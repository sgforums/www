              <p class="article-icon-links-container"><em>Well done: Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson applauds his side's win</em></p>
              <p class="article-icon-links-container"> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson described title rival Rafael Benitez as 'disturbed' and 'ridiculous' after seeing his </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> team close the gap at the top of the Barclays Premier League with a 3-0 dismantling of </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Goals from Nemanja Vidic, Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov gave United a deserved victory yesterday over a disjointed and dispirited Chelsea side.</p>
              <p>If United beat Wigan at home on Wednesday and then win at Bolton on Saturday, they will leapfrog Liverpool and go top of the table for the first time this season.</p>
              <p>Benitez's team play Merseyside rivals Everton a week tonight. Afterwards, Ferguson took the opportunity to respond to Friday's remarkable attack from Benitez, who had suggested that his rival considered himself above the law.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: 'I think you have to cut through the venom of what he said - and there was a lot of venom there - and hopefully he will reflect and understand that what he was saying was ridiculous.</p>
              <p>'There was an angry man there. He is disturbed for some reason or another.' Benitez suggested on Friday that he was presenting 'facts' against Ferguson when he suggested that the United manager was allowed to get away with repeated verbal attacks on referees.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson added: 'They are not facts. But I am not going into it. We should concentrate on chasing the leaders, who are Liverpool. We have games in hand and we must use them.'</p>
              <p>With United now within a point of Chelsea and five behind Liverpool - with two games in hand on both - Ferguson said: 'We have some tough games coming up as Wigan are in great form and Bolton is always a tough place to go but I said January was going to be an important month and it is looking that way now.</p>

              <p class="storycopy">Gill has been on the FA board since replacing David Dein 30 months ago and is highly regarded. Benitez, who will have a third operation to remove kidney stones on Wednesday, alleged that United had influenced how their fixture list was drawn up and that the FA were lenient in disciplining Ferguson.<br><br>Talking about Gill, who is also on the FA World Cup board bidding for the 2018 tournament, Benitez said: “It’s another fact. So maybe we will talk in another press conference about facts.<br><br>“One fact is that a person that has a lot of power and control and is on a lot of committees is in the FA. So, something is very strange.”<br><br>Benitez is ready to meet  Ferguson face to face following his fierce criticism of him and says he has got massive support from fellow managers.<br><br>Benitez is fed up of Ferguson’s attacks on Liverpool, and is not afraid of getting the infamous hair-dryer treatment.<br><br>He said: “Would I meet Mr Ferguson face to face? I don’t have any problem. “I have a lot of respect for him as a good manager. If he wants to talk about the weather we can talk about the weather.<br><br>“I don’t need to put pressure on Manchester United. They are under pressure, they know they are, because when you talk too much about another team that means you are under pressure. I need to change my mobile phone because it is blocked with messages.</p>

              <p>mind games only works when your players are not going to get affected by it, in ManU with SAF who no one dare to question, they'll be fine even if Rafa start all sort of mind games on them, cos ManU's palyers wouldn't feel anything when SAF tell them not to..</p>
              <p>in Chelsea, Jose mind game is different, he might be able to wound others with his comments but the fact that he had to also resort to protecting his players in order for them not to be affected showed that Chelsea's players are not as well oiled as ManU's in term of their Manager playing the mind games.</p>
              <p>Rafa?? Liverpool might still be able to win the league but if the players can pull themselves together however, Rafa is sure being badly wound up by SAF, to see him resorting to even mentioned David Gill just showed how much he pay attention to comments made by SAF and how badly he is affected by it...</p>
              <p>god bless Liverpool</p>
