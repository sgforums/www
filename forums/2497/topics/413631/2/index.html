              <p><strong>Fernando Torres and Pepe Reina are ready to quit Liverpool in January thanks to secret escape clauses in their contracts.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spain internationals made the get-out agreements with their Anfield bosses in the summer when they were persuaded to stay despite the departure of Spanish boss Rafa Benitez.</p>
              <p>Now Torres and Reina, key to Roy Hodgson’s attempts to steer the club away from the relegation zone, want out after promises of major team investment went unfulfilled.</p>
              <p>Mirror Sport understands the pair will tell the club in December they wish to leave, with Manchester City keen on £50 million Torres and Manchester United and Arsenal pursuing £20m Reina.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>The double whammy will devastate Liverpool fans who hoped John W Henry’s purchase of the club would bring the glory days back to Anfield.</p>
              <p>Instead, the American has made it clear there will be no major spending in January, and with many players unhappy with the direction the club is taking under Hodgson, Torres and Reina are ready to make a move.</p>
              <p>Torres was talked into staying in the summer when a three man delegation flew to Madrid for secret talks with with the striker’s representatives on July 14 - three days after the World Cup Final.</p>
              <p>It is understood Torres lawyer Margarita Pilar Garay-Bret and Jose Antonio Martin were present at the meeting.</p>
              <p>One member of the delegation remained in Madrid to speak directly with Torres before returning to Liverpool confident the Spaniard would stay.</p>
              <p>Torres and Spanish teammate Reina - a powerful voice in the dressing room - were both poised to quit Liverpool at the time with Chelsea having tabled a £50 million bid for Torres while Arsenal had offered £20 million for Reina.</p>
              <p>Both were upset at the lack of investment, the club’s failure to secure Champions League status and the grim reality of their Premiership title hopes.</p>
              <p>Torres was eventually persuaded to remain at Liverpool after three days of talks - during which the delegation described in detail plans laid out specifically by Christian Purslow, the club’s chief executive who quit last week following the sale of the club.</p>
              <p>Torres was told the new owners - that were not identified to him - were in place and ‘days’ away from completing the Liverpool takeover.</p>
              <p>It is claimed he was told Roy Hodgson’s appointment was a temporary measure and a big name manager was already lined up - armed with a £100 million transfer kitty offered as a ‘quick fix’ to drag the club back on terms with Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City.</p>
              <p>It is understood Liverpool planned to spend £50 million in the summer with a further £50 million available in January for targets no longer chasing Champions League ambitions.</p>
              <p>Torres and Reina reluctantly agreed to stay at Anfield - but only on condition they each had an escape clause written into their contracts.</p>
              <p>Mirror Sport can reveal the pair are now furious at the subsequent takeover - not directly with new American owner John W Henry or New England Sports Venture - but with the management team they feel misled them over the club’s future.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has been told there will be no marquee signings in the January transfer window leaving Torres and Reina feeling they have wasted a season.</p>
              <p>Insiders at Anfield fear that without Champions League qualification the club will struggle to make a profit - but crucially then have nothing to offer potential big name signings.</p>
              <p>Mirror Sport revealed on Tuesday that Reina has been targeted by Sir Alex Ferguson for a sensational switch to Manchester United - and that now could happen in January.</p>
              <p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will resume his quest to sign the keeper and the immediate lure of Champions League football will prove a massive draw for the World Cup winner.</p>
              <p>Torres will have his pick of clubs - even though the ‘big’ clubs very rarely make marquee signings in January because most major players are cup tied - thanks to Liverpool’s failure to qualify for this season’s Champions League.</p>
              <p>Representatives of Torres and Reina did not respond to attempts to contact them yesterday.</p>

              <p>it is virtually impossible torres would stay on past Jan.</p>
              <p>the only way that could happen is if they signed alot of star players in that period, but now with the new management and new policy, that is out of question.</p>
              <p>unless NESV bends over to their demands they are on their way out.</p>

              <p>At this point in time, there is really no use in trying to keep players who want to leave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let them leave, and use the money to buy a few good mid tier players who will be willing to put their bodies on the line for the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This will at least ensure that the team is stabilised until such time where it can be rebuilt again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I reckon the best position liverpool can attain this season will be among the top 10.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> manager Roy Hodgson has warned Manchester United that Pepe Reina is not for sale.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fears are mounting over the futures of Reina and fellow Spaniard Fernando Torres. Reina is on United's radar as they line up a long-term successor for Edwin van der Sar, while Arsenal are also monitoring his situation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Speculation over the future of Reina - and other star players - has arisen because of the recent instability at Anfield and the poor start made by the club to the Barclays Premier League season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sportsmail understands that a bid of £20million would tempt </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> into selling, while £50m would open the door to Torres leaving.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There are also suggestions that the pair had get-out clauses inserted into their contracts in the summer, although </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> are yet to comment on this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But the 28-year-old only signed a six-year contract in April and Hodgson has no intention of letting one of his most prized assets leave.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Hodgson told the Liverpool Echo: 'It was just one of those stories that seems to occur - it's just disappointing and annoying.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'Pepe is fantastic here, he is a lifeblood of this team. Everything he does around the club is excellent - he is always lively in the dressing room, he is always first class in training and he always wants to do more to improve.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'He demands better from those around him, he is always pushing people on. He is a player who we hold in the highest esteem.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'We have heard nothing from Manchester United and, more to the point, we don't want to hear anything from Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'If (Sir Alex) </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> is looking around at the end of the season and he has got lots of money to replace (Edwin) van der Sar, he might very well want Pepe Reina because he is the best around.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'But we do not want to sell him. I would like to think that we are going to become a successful club once again and Pepe is crucial to that.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hodgson’s last week suggested United would bid Fernando Torres if Wayne Rooney left.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But he has now moved to ease fears that the striker is on his way out of Anfield.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He said: 'We want to promise the players we have got here that we are going to be up there fighting once again and we are absolutely not looking to sell any of our better players.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'But, equally, I would also be disappointed if teams like Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona and all the teams with money were not looking at our players.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'If I was Fernando Torres, I would expect every top club in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Europe</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to be chasing me. That’s good as it means he’s doing his job. But we don’t need the money and we don’t want to sell.'</span></p>

Opportunities and value will drive spending in January and in the future.<br><br>"Our clear focus from day one of our ownership has been - and will be - to improve the club and focus on what it will take to put Liverpool FC consistently in a position to challenge for trophies. We intend to build this club the right way.<br><br>"Stories about our top players leaving are destructive and unwarranted but we realise that this kind of speculation is also common.<br><br>"We intend to build on the strength of the current squad, not undermine it. And I can reassure our supporters that we have no intention of allowing the team to be weakened going forward."</span><br><br></span></p>

              <p>funny how a gk is their star man.</p>
              <p>all pool need are 4 decent defenders and more importantly, 2 strong defensive midfielders.</p>
              <p>as long as they keep a decent defensive record that is half the battle won.</p>
