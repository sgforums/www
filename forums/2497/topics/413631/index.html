              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROY HODGSON toasted his best moment with Liverpool and said: I'm no quitter.</h2>
              <p>Widespread rumours claimed the under-fire Kop boss was ready to leave after last night's clash in Naples. But he said: "I've heard the ridiculous rumours and can tell you there is not one iota of truth in them. "If you want the simple answer, it's I've never considered resigning and I never will."</p>
              <p>Hodgson's outburst came minutes after seeing his second-string side grind out a vital point at one of the most hostile venues in Europe. And he had every reason to be bullish, after a line-up missing SEVEN regulars fully merited their point.</p>
              <p>Hodgson paid tribute to a side missing the likes of Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard when he added: "We've shown we're far from dead as a club.</p>
              <p>"Many people maybe didn't think we were capable of getting a result with the team I selected. "But they proved everyone wrong, which is commendable. We shouldn't be anything other than delighted with that, or the fact we top the group.</p>
              <p>"We needed to make certain we used the players in our squad, because if it's any good they will be able to step up and deal with it - and that was the case tonight.</p>
              <p>"I believe the new owners have already done a lot in giving the club a lift. "Even before Everton on Sunday, there was a certain feelgood feeling that we could get things right and on a good footing again.</p>
              <p>"Sunday against Blackburn gives us the ideal chance to do so. "The good thing is I know all the players will be champing at the bit to get out there."</p>
              <p>Hodgson also revealed his concern for the travelling fans who had to run a gauntlet of hate in the face of knife-wielding Napoli thugs.</p>
              <p>Six were taken to hospital the night before the game. He added: "These supporters know they're coming to a potentially dangerous situation and many were the ones who also supported us in Trabzon.</p>
              <p>"I can only say thanks for their support and how sad we are several got attacked."</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson insists he is at Anfield "for the long haul" after coming under pressure following a poor start to his time at the club. </strong> </p>
              <p>The former Fulham boss took over at Anfield in the summer but has overseen a poor start to the domestic campaign, with the Reds taking just six points from their opening eight games to sit second from bottom of the table. </p>
              <p>There was speculation before Thursday night's goalless Europa League draw in Napoli that he was preparing to stand down but Hodgson insisted nothing could be further from his mind. </p>
              <p>Instead, the 63-year-old insists he is a fighter and he will battle to turn around the fortunes of the club on the pitch. </p>
              <p>Hodgson told <em>Sky Sports News</em>: "You read these ridiculous websites that we have and resignation has never once entered my thought and, what's more, never will. </p>
              <p>"I pride myself on being a bit of a fighter, I pride myself on being able to stand the bad times. </p>
              <p>"I've had a lot of good times recently - Barclays Manager of the Year last year, great accolades here and there and everywhere - I realise in football you don't get the accolades all the time, sometimes you have to bite the bullet and fine. </p>
              <p>"It disappointments me that there are so many ridiculous websites, every day someone tells me that there is a new rumour about something that's supposed to happen and I think it's rather unfair that serious people use those rumours and then ask me questions because I shouldn't even be answering that question as it's literally never entered my mind and, what's more, won't enter my mind. </p>
              <p>"I'm here for the long haul, I'm here to do a good job, I came believing I can help Liverpool rebuild and get going again, the players are very much behind everything we're doing." </p>
              <p>He added: "So as far as I'm concerned it's work in progress, it's problematic at the moment because it's work in progress at the wrong end of the table, it's problematic because we're losing and not winning but there's only one thing to do with that - get out and play each week, play better, get the wins, get up the table and then you'll see my smiling face more often than my scowling one." </p>
              <p>Frank Rijkaard has been backed as a possible replacement for Hodgson but the Liverpool boss said such speculation could not concern him. </p>
              <p>"It doesn't bother me one little bit," he said.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Should West Ham claim at least a point against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/newcastle-united.html"><span style="color: windowtext;">Newcastle</span></a> today, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> will be rock bottom of the Barclays Premier League before <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/blackburn-rovers.html"><span style="color: windowtext;">Blackburn</span></a>'s crucial visit to Anfield tomorrow. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is understood that several </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> stars - including striker Fernando Torres and goalkeeper Pepe Reina - are questioning whether Hodgson has what it takes to lead the Anfield club away from the relegation zone. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, Sportsmail has been told that captain Gerrard and central defender Carragher believe the former Fulham manager should be given time to turn things around. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Gerrard and Carragher are the two most influential players at Anfield and are understandably concerned about a season that has plunged into disarray. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is understood that they have personally told some of their teammates that they should keep faith with Hodgson's training methods and tactics, at least until Christmas. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hodgson felt confident enough yesterday to laugh off claims he has fallen out with </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">'s £21million record signing Torres. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'It's sad really that we should have to put up with things like this,' he said. 'People write the most ridiculous things on these websites, like I'm having fights with Fernando Torres. Just ridiculous. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'I would agree that I am the right man to put it right.

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'It wouldn't stop websites putting out ridiculous stories, but I will have to learn to live with that.

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hodgson has also had to contend with reports that his job is about to be offered to Frank Rijkaard, but Sportsmail understands the former Barcelona coach is in no hurry to return to management after leaving Galatasaray on Wednesday. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Family matters are taking precedence at his home in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Amsterdam</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, after a week that has included the death of his father and birth of his first child with his current partner, and he is unlikely to consider  another managerial post until the new year. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Blackburn</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> counterpart Sam Allardyce tried to ease the pressure on Hodgson by telling his old foe Rafa Benitez to accept his share of the blame for </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">'s decline. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Allardyce, who often clashed with the Spaniard, said: 'As a manager, we live in the world of perception rather than reality. I feel for Roy and he's taking the brunt of the criticism, but given time he will get it right.' </span></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> stars including Pepe Reina, Fernando Torres and Glen Johnson want to quit the club in January as morale hits an all-time low.</strong></p>
              <p>Manager Roy Hodgson's job is on the line as Liverpool meet Blackburn at Anfield today looking to escape the Premier League's bottom three.</p>
              <p>The malaise is so great behind the scenes that even victory is unlikely to persuade the big names to stay under the current regime and new owner John W Henry, who cannot be present due to illness, will watch the game at home.</p>
              <p>Players are aghast that Hodgson has put a 68-yearold, Mike Kelly, in charge of first-team coaching. Kelly, a former keeper with Wimbledon, Birmingham and QPR from 1958 and 1976, even takes Reina through his routines, to the Spaniard's disquiet.</p>
              <p>Johnson, who could miss the game against Blackburn with a hamstring injury, has performed poorly under Hodgson and is aware Bayern Munich and Juventus are interested.</p>
              <p>Most worryingly for Liverpool fans, they were stunned to hear Hodgson link Torres with a move to Manchester United before Wayne Rooney signed his new contract. Torres has failed to score in the last six games - equalling his worst run for the club - and has an awkward relationship with the manager.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/23/article-1323260-0BB5EBCC000005DC-556_306x423.jpg" alt="Panic: Liverpool have made their worse ever Premier League start under Roy Hodgson" width="306" height="423">

              </div>
              <p><strong>There is a feeling the Spaniard is not trying hard enough. Torres decided to stay in the summer after having discussions with Hodgson but he is understood to regret the decision.</strong></p>
              <p>Even Steven Gerrard has not been won over yet by Hodgson. The captain has mainly been deployed in a deep role but is likely to get his chance behind Torres today. Liverpool have failed to win any of their last seven games and Hodgson admits that after resting players in the 0-0 draw against Napoli in midweek, there can be no excuses against Blackburn.</p>
              <p>Torres, Gerrard, Raul Meireles and Lucas did not travel to Italy while Jamie Carragher and Paul Konchesky were taken off early. Joe Cole, who has struggled to live up to his billing after signing from Chelsea, has admitted morale is so low at the club that any kind of victory would be welcome.</p>
              <p>Henry planned to give Hodgson a trial until Christmas before making a decision on his future.</p>
              <p>But things are unravelling so fast that defeat today could see them take immediate action.</p>

              <p><br>What! Johnson?</p>
              <p>My goodness, I would rather stick to O'Shea or Brown in that position any day. Or even play Evans in that position before even considering Glen "The Can't Defend Defender" Johnson in the United right-back position... He is like a joke who maybe spent more time on his hair than on defending...</p>
              <p>You gave me a fright man with that name... lol.</p>
              <p>The only thing he is good at is helping to make the required quota of 8 in each club... Pool paid big money for the wrong Johnson... Adam Johnson would have been much more worth that sum...</p>
