              <p><strong>Although a fee has yet to be agreed for the 32-year-old, he appears to be closing in on a move to the Eastlands club. </strong></p>
              <p>Toon boss Joe Kinnear revealed earlier this week that the
              Magpies were disappointed with City's offer of £5million for the
              player.</p>
              <p>Kinnear said: "We have had approaches for Shay - serious approaches from Man City.</p>
              <p>"Irrespective of all the stories, they've offered £5million and
              not a penny more. We think it's an insult to offer that for the best
              keeper in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"It's a derisory offer. But Shay has made it clear he wants to leave.</p>
              <p>"I wasn't involved too much with the meeting between the owner
              (Mike Ashley), Shay and his agent when they tried to thrash it out.</p>
              <p>"But as far as I know, the owner and the managing director (Derek Llambias) were unhappy they've only been offered £5million.</p>
              <p>"That's where we stand. I don't want to lose him - I'm fighting a relegation battle."</p>
              <p>Given did not figure in Wednesday's 2-1 defeat to Manchester
              City, with Kinnear citing injury for the reason the player was not in
              his squad.</p>

              <h2 id="stand-first" class="stand-first-alone">• 32-year-old moves to Eastlands after 11 years at Newcastle<br>• City boss Mark Hughes makes his fourth signing</h2>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club%20Home/2009/1/30/1233328614314/Shay-Given-001.jpg" alt="Shay Given" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The prospect of "going places" with </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong> lured Shay Given away from St James' Park, the goalkeeper said following his move to Eastlands tonight. The 32-year-old has joined City on a 4½-year deal worth £7m, possibly rising to £8m. He travelled to the North-west this morning for a medical examination and the clubs confirmed that the transfer had been completed late this evening.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It's exciting times at Manchester City with the new owners and this manager," Given said. "There are big plans for the club. I am very excited to be joining and delighted that Manchester City wanted my services. I'm happy that the two clubs could come to an agreement."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given's move to Eastlands was widely anticipated after he became publicly disillusioned with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/newcastleunited"><span style="color: #005689;">Newcastle United</span></a>'s lack of progress over the past few seasons. The Republic of Ireland keeper had been at the club for more than 11 years since arriving from Blackburn Rovers. "I have two young kids, I had just moved house in Newcastle and there were a few things that could have made me stay there," Given said. "I have a lot of friends there and the supporters are fantastic. They have been great to me for so many years and I thank them for that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But I just felt that this was an opportunity for me to come to a club that, in my opinion, is really going to be going places. I am even really excited to be going to training on Monday, it's a new chapter in my life and one I am looking forward to. The profile of the club has changed dramatically and there are already some fantastic players here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It looks like some good players will come here in the future as well and I am sure the fans must be on the edge of their seats to see who comes here. There is already the nucleus of a very good team and I hope I can add to that. I am just delighted that they have chosen me to strengthen their goalkeeping department as well."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Newcastle manager, Joe Kinnear, said on Friday that the Tyneside club had given City permission to speak to Given.
              </p><p> </p>
              Given is the fourth City signing of the January <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/transfer-window"><span style="color: #005689;">transfer window</span></a>, joining fellow recruits Wayne Bridge, Craig Bellamy and Nigel de Jong in a move to the club. The manager, Mark Hughes, explained: "I have said for a long time that we need the experience of a keeper like Shay. I am delighted that we have been able to acquire such an accomplished keeper and one so highly regarded by everyone in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a>.<p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We are getting a very good keeper and the experience he has will help the two outstanding young keepers that we have here in Joe [Hart] and Kasper [Schmeichel]. I am looking for them all to grow as a group and it's important that we have that influence of a senior keeper."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kinnear said: "I'm really sorry to see Shay go. He's been a fantastic professional and a great lad to work with. We bent over backwards to try and keep him at Newcastle United and offered him a longer contract to stay at the club. He's been with Newcastle United for a long time and has been a great servant but he felt the time was right to move on and, so realistically, we had no choice but to reluctantly agree to allow him to make this move. I wish him and his family all the very best for the future."</p>
