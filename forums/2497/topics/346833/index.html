              <p>Â </p>
              <p>LOS ANGELES, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Los Angeles Galaxy head
              coach Bruce Arena says David Beckham's request for a permanent
              move to Italy would be handled in the best interests of the
              club to avoid any possible distraction ahead of next season.</p>
              <p>Beckham, who joined the Major League Soccer club in June
              2007, is on loan with AC Milan and has expressed his desire to
              stay in Serie A to help him in his bid to play one more World
              Cup with England in South Africa next year.</p>
              <p>"We'll do whatever is in the best interest of the team and
              the organisation," Arena told reporters after a Galaxy training
              session at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California on
              Thursday. "I won't let it be a distraction. It won't be.</p>
              <p>"This is a business and we'll attend to this matter like we
              attend to every matter related to the Galaxy. Whatever happens,
              happens, and whatever concludes will be in the best interests
              of the Galaxy.</p>
              <p>"Most of the things I enjoy when I do read them," added
              Arena, who last week pledged that the Galaxy would honour
              Beckham's loan agreement with Milan.</p>
              <p>"Not only those about David but everything. It's kind of
              humorous when you understand what's going on behind the
              scenes."</p>
              <p>Midfielder Beckham, 33, said for the first time in Glasgow
              on Wednesday that he would like to quit the Galaxy, where he
              appeared to have put himself out to grass in U.S. soccer in
              2007 after agreeing to a lucrative five-year contract.</p>
              <p>"I have expressed my desire now to stay in Milan and
              hopefully the clubs can come to some agreement," the former
              England captain said after a friendly between Rangers and Milan
              at Ibrox.</p>
              <p>"I expected to enjoy it (in Milan), but I didn't expect to
              enjoy it this much and play in every game like I have.</p>
              <p>"I have said that my intentions are to stay here. Now it is
              out of my hands so I have to wait and see," added Beckham, who
              has played at the 1998, 2002 and 2006 World Cups.</p>
              <p>MAIN OBJECTIVE</p>
              <p>"My main objective is to stay at this club and I enjoy
              playing here and at the highest level and it would give me more
              of a chance (of playing in the 2010 World Cup)."</p>
              <p>The Italian giants have said Beckham's lawyers were
              discussing with the Galaxy the possibility of extending the
              player's loan spell, due to end on March 9.</p>
              <p>The midfielder moved to Italy during the U.S. close season
              for a two-month stint to try to stay in contention for a place
              in the England side he captained at the last two World Cups.</p>
              <p>Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani has said he wants
              Beckham to stay. For technical reasons, Beckham's loan is
              actually until June but there is an agreement that he goes back
              to the United States in March.</p>
              <p>Milan have not yet made an offer for the former Manchester
              United and Real Madrid player, Galliani said.</p>
              <p>"To enter a negotiation and eventually close a deal we have
              time until March 8," he said.</p>
              <p>Calls for Beckham to stay at Milan have grown since he
              surpassed expectations with his performances. He has scored two
              goals in his first five starts for the Serie A side.
