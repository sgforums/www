              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Torres</span><span style="color: #000000;">, who completed his British record transfer from Liverpool to Stamford Bridge in January, goes into Sunday's Premier League clash with Manchester City having failed to score in any of his six appearances so far for Carlo Ancelotti’s team. </span></strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The struggles endured by the Spanish forward have prompted comparisons with Ukrainian striker Shevchenko, who score just 22 goals in 77 appearances for <strong>Chelsea</strong></span> following a £30m transfer from AC Milan in 2006.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>At Chelsea, Shevchenko was unable to reproduce the form which had earned him a reputation as Europe’s most-feared striker during his seven-year spell with Milan.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>But the 34-year-old is confident that Torres will ultimately justify his expensive price tag by rediscovering his goal touch.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>“Torres must keep believing in himself and stay calm because the goals will come.” Shevchenko said.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>“He always works hard on the pitch and maybe he shouldn't think so much about scoring and try too hard to score. If he relaxes, they will come naturally.</p>
              <p>“He just needs to relax. He has proved he is a top player who can perform and score at the highest levels in the game, so I'm sure the goals will come again.”</p>
              <p>Shevchenko, who helped Dynamo Kiev overcome Manchester City to reach the Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday, admits that Torres must learn how to cope with the pressure of being English football’s most expensive player.</p>
              <p>“I know what that is like.” Shevchenko said. “In England, everyone puts a lot of pressure on you when you have cost a lot of money.</p>
              <p>“Everyone expects a lot of Torres because the price tag was a very high, but Chelsea play football in a different way to Liverpool and he needs time.</p>
              <p>“He must not let the pressure get to him. He needs time to adapt to his new team-mates and the movement of the midfield and the players around him.</p>
              <p>“People have said maybe he will be better next season and it is true that he certainly needs time to settle.</p>
              <p>“But I hope he can score against City on Sunday and, maybe if he does, the goals will start to flow this season.</p>
              <p>“The most important thing is to feel good. If he feels good and comfortable in the team he will score a lot of goals for Chelsea.”</p>
              <p>Shevchenko added: “I had a hard time at Chelsea mainly because I was injured much of the time.</p>
              <p>“Every time I recovered from one injury, I seemed to get a new one and it set me back again. I didn't leave Chelsea with bad memories though.”</p>
