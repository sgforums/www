              currently the only man in the running for the Real Madrid presidency
              after rival Eduardo Garcia confirmed he was pulling out of the election
              race. </strong></p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><img src="http://images.thethaovanhoa.vn/Images/Uploaded/Share/2009/02/20090213060927244/apuesta_florentino_perez.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>The 62-year-old has, therefore, moved a step closer
              to returning to the Bernabeu as the other two hopefuls, Juan Onieva and
              Eugenio Martinez Bravo, had already withdrawn.</strong></p>
              <p><span class="main-content">As it stands, Perez - whose €57.4million
              (£50m) bank guarantee has met neccesary stipulations - is on course to
              be confirmed as Real president on Monday unless another candidate
              presents a bid before a deadline of 31st May.</span></p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>Perez was previously at Real between 2000
              and 2006 when he marked his tenure with a number of dazzling signings,
              dubbed the 'galacticos'.</p>
              <p>And he is promising a return to the
              style of the beginning of the Millennium, saying: "We will build a
              spectacular team with top-notch players.</p>
              <p>"We have set up a strong
              and stable sporting project which will be able to call upon footballers
              who will turn each Real Madrid match into a fascinating rendezvous."</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Perez confident of Kaka and Ronaldo deals</h1>
              <p><strong>Perez is currently the only candidate for the post and, if no one
              else enters the running before the May 31 deadline, he will resume the
              role he held from 2000 to 2006. </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/spain/Real-Madrid/perez_speech-wave.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>And, after saying he feels ‘ashamed’ of what happened to the club’s
              reputation under Ramon Calderon – who stepped down after allegations of
              vote-rigging in relation to the financial budget – Perez has vowed to
              restore Madrid’s standing as a great side built on good values. </strong></p>
              <p>He told Marca: “I am ashamed that this institution, for which
              principles are absolutely vital, has for several years become
              associated with things that should not be associated with any
              institution – not least an institution like Madrid, which exists on the
              basis on fair values.”</p>
              <p>On his previous spell at the club, he added: “It was a time when
              football became spectacular, when we thrilled the world as we took our
              values around the world.</p>
              <p>“The quality of our players paid our debts and for new facilities.</p>
              <p>“We went from losing €60 million to earning €60 million and now we must go further down this road.</p>
              <p>“If we do not have great players, we will not have substantial
              income. We will have great players, which will increase revenue in the
              shortest time possible.”</p>
              <p>Milan star Kaka is thought to be the first player Perez aims to
              sign, and he has hinted that a deal is a distinct possibility due to
              his relationship with the Italian side’s vice-president, Adriano
              Galliani.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“We are not going to speak to any clubs until the elections are
              over, but I’ve always had a great relationship with Galliani and maybe
              that will make it easier to bring Kaka to Madrid,” he said. </strong></span></p>
              <p>There has also been fresh speculation that Manchester United
              winger Ronaldo could be a target again this summer, and Perez has done
              little to play down the reports.</p>
              <p>"He's also a player that would be very good if he came to Real Madrid,” he said.</p>
              <p>“What I know is what I've read – that there is an agreement that would allow him to come for £80m.</p>
              <p>"Next week we will look at the numbers and nobody should doubt that
              we are going to design a spectacular project with our sporting
              advisors."</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He added: "When I enter Madrid, I will look at Ronaldo's supposed
              release-clause. It's very good but all release clauses are negotiable. </span></strong></p>
              <p>"I like him because he is one of the best in the world.”</p>

              <h1>Perez: €73m To Bring Zidane To Real Madrid Was Cheap</h1>
              <blockquote>
              <h2>The construction supremo has cheekily showed off his economic prowess as he prepares to regain control of Los Blancos.</h2>
              <p>“[Zinedine] Zidane cost €73 million and he was the cheapest player,”
              he added, referring to the fact that the Frenchman was worth every
              euro, as he had stated numerous times before.</p>
              <p>Perez then assured that he will do his best to bring only the top superstars to the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>“Madrid must have the best players in the world, the best Spanish players and the best youngsters,” he boasted.</p>
              <p>“We will make an economic effort because the fans of Madrid need a small revolution. If we sign six or seven players, then ten will have to leave.”</p>
