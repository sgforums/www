              <h1>David Beckham effect is felt across America</h1>
              <h2 id="diggBodyText">Just over a year ago, David Beckham made his debut for Los Angeles Galaxy. His impact on his new club and Major League Soccer has been phenomenal.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/becks.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Beckham has improved the profile of the club.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>For every excited American awaiting his arrival in California, there was a critic ready to denounce the move. Yet the Beckham effect has not only improved the profile of the club, but also put the midfielder back in the England fold, a member of the 'Century Club’ now that he has passed 100 caps.</strong></p>
              <p>On the field, Beckham has become a one-man show, responsible for the Galaxy averaging a league-best 25,513 at home and a league-high 27,094 on the road this year. The Galaxy website could not be accused of understating Beckham, describing him as “one of the world’s most recognisable people”.</p>
              <p>New York Red Bulls had a crowd of 46,754 for the visit of the Galaxy on Saturday. Usually around 10,000 watch their home games. The 66,237 – an MLS record – who went to Giants Stadium last August to see Beckham and the Galaxy was more than for their five previous home MLS games put together.</p>
              <p>Indeed, every away match the Galaxy have played this season has seen the home team’s best attendance. Tim Leiweke, chief executive of Anschutz Entertainment Group who own the Galaxy, asked: “How can you not pay attention to the impact this guy is creating?”</p>
              <p>Off the field, Beckham is smiling, autograph-friendly and happy to speak to the media whenever he is asked, while he and his wife, Victoria, fit comfortably into the LA image and lifestyle. Ivan Gazidis, the deputy commissioner of MLS, said: “I don’t think any player could have had the impact with the general public that David Beckham has had.”</p>
              <p>Beckham’s five goals and seven assists have helped Galaxy to second place in the Western Division, one point behind Real Salt Lake.</p>
              <p>Beckham remains modest, satisfied with the manner in which he has settled. “I think we’ve moved the needle slightly,” he said. “I said when I first moved here that it’s not going to take a year or two. It will take five or maybe 10 years to make this league grow to a much higher level.</p>
              <p>“You see many families turn up with their young kids and watch the Galaxy playing. In 10 years those kids are going to be 15 and 16 years old, turning around and saying 'I remember when we saw the Galaxy play’.</p>
              <p>“It might take that long, but hopefully we’ve made the footprint that obviously takes it further on.”</p>
