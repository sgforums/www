              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Anton Ferdinand is hoping his move to Sunderland will allow him to emulate the achievements of his brother. </strong></p>
              <p>The centre-half joined the Black Cats for Â£8million
              from West Ham last week, following a similar route to Rio who left the
              Hammers for Leeds at roughly the same age.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand is now 23 and hopes a switch to the North East will see him fulfil his undoubted potential.</p>
              <h4>Progress</h4>
              <p>"I spoke to Rio a lot before the move," Ferdinand told the <em>Sunderland Echo</em>.</p>
              <p>"He made a similar move at a similar stage of his career, and he told me it was the making of him.</p>
              <p>"He's
              worked with the gaffer (Roy Keane) before and knows how much he could
              help me progress. I spoke to him about this at length, and he said
              straight away, 'That's a move that could take your football to a
              totally different level'.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to settle for being second best - I want to be the best I can possibly be."</p>
              <h5>Challenge</h5>
              <p>The
              former England Under 21 international is tipped to make the step-up to
              the senior fold in the near future, something Ferdinand is keen to
              achieve during his time at Sunderland.</p>
              <p>"The next couple of years are going to be massive for me," he added.</p>
              <p>"They
              will determine whether I get to the very top of the game or not. I'm
              looking forward to this new challenge a lot, and it's something I
              needed to do.</p>
              <p>"I was at West Ham a long time, and sometimes you
              need to take on a new challenge to enable your career to move to the
              next level. Hopefully, this move will help me do that."</p>
              <h5>Competition</h5>
              <p>Ferdinand will be hoping to snatch a centre-half berth off Danny Collins or Nyron Nosworthy once he regains full match fitness.</p>
              <p>However, Collins insists he will not be giving up his place without a fight.</p>
              <p>"I relish the competition - it spurs me on," said Collins</p>
              <p>"You
              have to fight for your place. If you just throw the towel in when new
              players arrive then there is no point in you being here.</p>
              <p>"All I can do is do my best every day in training and out on the pitch and the rest is up to the manager.</p>
              <p>"There
              are six defenders competing for four shirts, so there is a lot of
              competition and that's something you need in the squad if you are to do
              well in the Premier League."</p>
