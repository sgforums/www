Thayanathan added: 'Alam Shah is well-known in Malaysia. He is one player I would love to have in my side.<br><br>'I can't wait to see him in action for PDRM.'<br><br>Alam Shah, who could not be reached for comment, was also courted by Indonesian first division club Pelita Jaya, coached by former Singapore captain Fandi Ahmad.<br><br>Gifari declined to reveal how much the marksman is being paid.<br><br>Alam Shah will not be the only Singaporean in the Selangor-based team.<br><br>He will be re-united with former national team colleague Ahmad Latiff, who had been released by Woodlands Wellington at the end of the season.<br><br>Latiff has already made a good start to his career across the Causeway, netting against Penang and Sarawak.<br><br>'The club is very happy with Latiff's performances,' Gifari noted.<br><br>'He came and fitted into the team immediately and has made an impact.'<br><br>Nicknamed 'The Cops', PDRM are based in the MPS Stadium in Selangor.<br><br>They won promotion to the Super League after marching to the second-tier Malaysian Premier League title last season.<br><br>PDRM have a mixed start to their Super League campaign, lying sixth with six points in the 13-team table after winning two and losing two of their opening games.<br><br>Leaders Selangor are on 10 points.<br><br>PDRM's other foreign players are from Kenya - midfielder Hilary Echesa and striker John Mawalma Barasa.<br><br>A classic centre-forward known for his aerial power and never-say-die attitude, Alam Shah was named Most Valuable Player when the Lions won this year's Asean Football Championship.<br><br>He also top-scored in the tournament with 10 goals, including a national record seven-goal haul in the 11-0 thrashing of Laos.<br><br>He was also the S-League's Player of the Year in 2005.<br><br>But the 27-year-old also has a chequered disciplinary record, having been sent off nine times in 10 S-League seasons.<br><br>In 2001, he was also red-carded for his part in a mass brawl in a World Cup qualifier against Bahrain, when the Lions lost 1-2.<br><br>He, Dalis Supait and Bahraini Abdulla Barzooki were each banned six matches and fined $4,800.<br><br>The last Lion to feature in the Malaysian Premier League was former national skipper Aide Iskandar, who spent a season with Johor FA in 2005.<br><br>meng@sph.com.sg<br><br>Copyright, 2007, Singapore Press Holdings Limited</div>

Faced with the difficult problem of having to do without the services of arguably its best striker in the more advanced stages of the World Cup, the FAS has finessed its way out by a 'solution' that brings into question its commitment to curbing violence on the field.<br><br>The FAS will allow Alam Shah to play in the World Cup provided three conditions are met. The first two are wayang conditions, and the third is particularly disturbing. The two players and the national coach are to sit down and Alam Shah will be reinstated if all three are okay with it.<br><br>Now, let's remind ourselves of what happened. Alam Shah inflicted vicious blows on Bennett, an incident so serious the victim was dazed and the examining medical officer said it could have resulted in death or severe permanent injury.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Now in the twisted logic of the FAS, Bennett is set up as the fall guy. If he is not 'okay' (and why should he be as the victim of a vicious attack?), the FAS could say to the fans (of whom I am one, incidentally), well, we wanted to play him but the three could not agree. In the public's mind, the accusing finger would automatically be pointed at Bennett. So the victim of a vicious attack is now set up as a victim yet again. This is the behaviour of the Pontius Pilates of this world and it is disgraceful.</span></strong><br><br>Here is a situation where the FAS could have sent a strong message to players in the S-League on violence on the field but it ducked the issue because it deemed forsaking the glory of the World Cup too high a price to pay.<br><br>Yet, the problem is not difficult. It is difficult only for men with a muddled morality. In retrospect, it could be seen that allowing Alam Shah to play abroad while remaining suspended in Singapore is a cynical way to let the player continue honing his skills so they will be available in the World Cup while giving the impression that a penalty has been dished out.<br><br>We often read about players bringing the game into disrepute. Yet the FAS has done precisely that. Years from now, when violence on the field has escalated, we will look back at the lack of moral backbone of the FAS in this decision as a major contributing factor.<br><br>Eugene Tan Ying San</div>
