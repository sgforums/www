              <h3><em>Richard Bailey</em> takes a look at some of the best football
              myths and discovers football lovers have never been shy of letting the
              facts get in the way of an interesting tale.</h3>
              <h5><strong>Carlo Ancelotti can't speak English</strong></h5>
              <p>Sceptics
              had already doomed the tenure of Ancelotti at Chelsea before he had
              even stepped off the plane for the simple reason that he couldn't speak
              English. Many feared that the Italian's methods would get lost in
              translation when it came to addressing the players but they needn't
              have worried. Shortly after arriving in London the former AC Milan boss
              gave an interview to <em>Chelsea TV</em> in near-perfect English leaving the doom-mongers with egg on their faces.</p>
              <h5><strong>Ryan Giggs could have played for England</strong></h5>
              <p>The
              Manchester United record breaker captained England schoolboys in his
              youth, causing many people to believe he was eligible to represent the
              Three Lions at senior level. Therefore, there was mass confusion and
              bewilderment when Giggs apparently chose Wales over England. But, in
              truth, there was never a decision for the winger to make. Born and
              raised in Cardiff, Giggs moved to Manchester at the age of five where
              he attended English schools - explaining his inclusion in the England
              youth sides.</p>
              <h5><strong>Denis Law's back-heel relegated United</strong></h5>
              <p>The
              'King of Old Trafford' was assigned to the scrapheap by new Manchester
              United boss Tommy Docherty when he was handed a free transfer in the
              summer of 1973. Law subsequently signed for rivals Manchester City and
              faced his former club at Old Trafford on the final day of the season
              knowing that a win would consign United to relegation to Division Two.
              Law ultimately scored the winner with a divine back-heel but failed to
              celebrate thinking he had sent his former club down. The truth is that
              United would have been relegated regardless after results on the day
              went against them.</p>
              <h5><strong>Serie A is a boring league </strong></h5>
              <p>The
              Italians have long been admired for their defensive capabilities but
              over the years that same method - dubbed 'Catanccio' and made famous by
              the Inter Milan side of the 1960s - has now helped label Serie A as a
              negative, boring league. Back in the late 80s and early 90s Italy
              boasted some of the best attacking talent in the world with Diego
              Maradona, George Weah and Roberto Baggio just some of the stars who
              plied their trade in the Italian top flight. Nowadays the cream of crop
              flock to the Premier League or La Liga but is Serie A really that much
              more boring? According to the facts no. Over the past three seasons
              Serie A has outscored the Premier League twice, including this term
              when the English top flight recorded a total of 860 goals compared to
              Italy's impressive 988 strikes.</p>
              <h5><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't perform in the big games</strong></h5>
              <p>The
              current Fifa World Player of the Year's talent has never been in doubt
              but his critics state that he cannot belong to the game's elite until
              he influences games on the biggest stage. Over the past two seasons the
              Portuguese star has blown that theory out of the water. Ronaldo helped
              United to UEFA Champions League glory last season when he headed them
              into the lead against Chelsea, while he also scored twice in this
              season's Champions League semi-final second-leg against Arsenal to
              guide United to another final appearance. The 24-year-old has scored
              against all of the so-called 'big four' in the past two seasons, while
              last term he finished as the top scorer in the Champions League with
              eight goals.</p>
              <h5><strong>Holland's 1974 World Cup final 'sex scandal'</strong></h5>
              <p>The
              Dutch were hot favourites to lift the World Cup in West Germany having
              knocked out Brazil with their brand of total football. All that was
              left to do was defeat the hosts in the final. A German newspaper then
              decided to spice up the build-up when they paid female escorts to go to
              the hotel where the Dutch stars were staying. Their photographer was
              duly on hand to snap the action and report the breaking news, albeit
              without Holland's involvement. The truth later came out that the
              startled Dutch players had actually fled the pool area, where the girls
              found them, as soon as the women arrived, but they couldn't extract
              revenge on the German public as they lost the final 2-1.</p>
              <h5><strong>Wembley is an energy-sapping pitch</strong></h5>
              <p>So
              many times on FA Cup final day we see players going down with cramp
              with the sheer size of the pitch churned out as an excuse. Granted
              Wembley has always looked huge on our television screens but in reality
              the opposite is correct. The new Wembley measures in at 105 metres long
              and 68 metres wide and is smaller than 15 of the 20 Premier League
              pitches, but do you ever see players going down with cramp every
              weekend? We thought not.</p>
              <h5><strong>British players can't play abroad</strong></h5>
              <p>Despite
              the Premier League being one of the strongest leagues in the world, not
              too many Brits seem to succeed abroad. Jimmy Greaves and Denis Law were
              two players to first experience football on foreign soil with AC Milan
              and Torino respectively, but both were back home within a couple of
              months. Ian Rush was another to fall short in Italy in the 1980s, later
              describing his switch to Juventus as 'like moving to a different
              country'. Michael Owen and Jonathan Woodgate have continued the failed
              trend over recent years but the success of players such as John Charles
              at Juventus, David Beckham at Real Madrid and AC Milan, Paul Lambert at
              Borussia Dortmund and Matt Derbyshire at Olympiakos this season has
              surely proved that British players can hold their own overseas.</p>
              <h5><strong>Fixture congestion affects the top teams</strong></h5>
              <p>Nowadays,
              Premier League managers can't go two weeks without complaining about
              the number of games their teams have to play or that a Christmas break
              should be introduced into the English game. For years experts have been
              saying that our players at the top level are playing too many games,
              minimising their team's chances of success. But is it true? Of the top
              four teams Manchester United played the most games, 66, and also won
              the most games following a midweek fixture with 15 wins from 19 games.
              Chelsea claimed 14 wins from 19, Liverpool 12 from 19 and Arsenal had
              the worst return with 11 wins from 21. Hardly poor records. United won
              the Premier League, League Cup and reached the final of Champions
              League, Chelsea won the FA Cup, Liverpool pushed United all the way in
              the league and Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the Champions League
              and the FA Cup. Poor seasons indeed.</p>
              <h5><strong>Premier League players aren't loyal</strong></h5>
              <p>There
              is a myth among football fans, especially those at the top level, that
              if a player decides to leave a club he is not loyal. Granted, there are
              players out there who would leave a club at the drop of a hat or those
              that are simply motivated by money, but surely all footballers can't be
              tarnished with the same brush? Gareth Barry is the latest player to
              have his loyalty questioned after his switch to Manchester City.
              However the midfielder has given Villa more than 10 years of service.
              Surely that is loyal. Frank Lampard is vilified by West Ham fans for
              leaving the club but he still gave them five years of football. Shay
              Given was criticised for leaving Newcastle to join City in January but
              he had suffered in a poor team for more than 12 years. Perhaps we need
              to redefine the term 'loyal' when used in football circles.</p>
