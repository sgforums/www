So just give it up already. I see he's already taken the next step to not even bother to reply or start something even if he's 19, some elderly pensioner or some blue troll with a green mohawk wearing leather armor, wielding two daggers tipped with poison.</p>

              <p>yes without a shadow of doubt. That lamer has done it again, you would have thought he would have changed for the better after his hypocritical posting of 9 years nonsense at his forum lol. I was not stalked for a few weeks and I thought, man he changed, alas the nonsense has come back again, following me whereever I went lol.</p>
              <p>If you want to cross sword with me, I wont hold back either. a dog will not change its habit of eating shit. mark my words. the guy not particularly a bright fellow. will my inbox be flooded with expletives from him ?

              <p>after reading the thread on some forum, over 9 years, initially I read it with a pinch of salt. but now that thread filled with me with digust and contempt, that revolted me so much I want to vomit, especially changed for the better <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"> A dog will never change its habit of eating shit, especially when the person has not even served NS.</p>
