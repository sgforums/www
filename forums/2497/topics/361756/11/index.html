              <p>After not posting or coming here for quite a while, I'm rather surprised to see this topic hasn't expired yet or whatever. Had previously wanted to comment but let's just say we all have our own priorities in life. Besides, sgforums isn't the best place for football discussion online. It is fun once in a while to come here and see all the snippets of football news and tabloids gathered by different people.</p>
              <p>I'm not very botherd about the Chris vs Marc that's ongoing because in terms of within this topic, I don't see either being any better than the other. I am going to comment about what the topic starter has said at the beginning of this topic.</p>
              <p>As much as I don't agree with the manner of some of Marco Simone's postings, the things he says at the start of this topic do carry some weight. About playing the victim card and all.</p>
              <p>This started even with one of the previous mod of the Liverpool subforums, 798, who always liked to potray himself as a victim of some sorts. He once even called himself the Zhang Wu Ji of sgforums, which is a total insult to the character that is Zhang Wu Ji. It's also ironic especially since he has been the one who threatened people about being banned and has had the admin move and delete topics on his behalf.</p>
              <p>While I'm at it, yes, the admin's response on the first page says a lot really. I'll let some of you draw your own conclusions about that without going into detail.</p>
              <p>I have previously thought Poolman was an ok person, and even though I do not outrightly think he is as bad as some others here, there are two things that made me doubt him.</p>
              <p>One is how he considers 798 his 'good friend'. Quite obviously I do not have a good opinion of this person so I would be doubtful and sceptical about anyone who considers him a 'good friend'.</p>
              <p>Afterall, 798 only took up being mod of Liverpool forums probably just to be anti Man U. That was always his agenda and there are too many examples to show how his anti Man U agenda takes precedence over other football interests. Last time when innosaint, gansterkiller or whatever other nick was always talking smack about other clubs beside Man U like Liverpool or even his beloved Arsenal, he never said anything. Yet happily supported when the attention was on Man U. Says a lot really about where the priorities lie at least within sgforums.</p>
              <p>The other thing that has made me doubt Poolman is his open endorsement of Chris the Liverpool cum WWE fan. First off let me say I do not think Chris is very much worse than a lot of you, and he did change in his manner of posting after being appointed mod. But I really don't know if this was what anyone had in mind when he was appointed mod. As a mod I don't think that badly of him, but as a poster he is certainly not one of the more well-liked and anyone would be as sceptical before he became mod.</p>
              <p>Having said that, Chris has obviously been provoked no end by some people and he has reacted. I'm not saying either is right but that is what has happened. At the same time, he could be being made use of as being a lightning rod of some sort to draw fire or whatever. Honestly I don't know if that's the case but if it is I wouldn't be surprised either. He kind of wasn't the first to be used this way either.</p>
              <p>To some degree I think all are guilty of self-righteousness to some extent. Maybe even me unknowingly, a lot of humans are like that afterall. But I fully agree that some Liverpool fans tend to play the victim card very often and maybe because they think it works or that there is some reason behind that they believe or know that it works. And this behaviour was probably made precedent by individual(s) who were not even Liverpool fans to begin with.</p>
              <p>Coming back to 'the others', I find it is only in sgforums that the response towards you is so heavily based on the club people think you support. I've been treated so adversely by different people just because they think I support certain football clubs while they were posting to me.</p>
              <p>I've had one guy being so hostile towards me because he thought I was a Chelsea fan and he eased off not because anybody was getting an edge in the arguement but purely because I indicated I wasn't a Chelsea fan.</p>
              <p>I think all of you thoroughly deserve each other and I hope you continue to 'entertain' each other to no end. End of the day, I believe offline all of us still have great times watching football with our real friends no matter what football club it is they support or whether they even have a favourite club at all.</p>
              <p>You see a table of friends sharing a jug of beer with one wearing A Manchester jersey, another wearing Arsenal, another wearing Liverpool, another wearing Chelsea and maybe even one wearing Newcastle. Very often you rib each other about the other person's favourite club or favourite players, and even though the words are the same as those of you throwing insults at one another here, it all has very different meaning and intention.</p>
              <p>Cheers to all real football buddies.</p>

              <p>Honestly to me, I see him getting provoked more than any other individual. Not like I read every topic or post related to him but that's genuinely how I feel. It's a different thing about being provoked on basis of being a fan of a certain club.</p>
              <p>I'm not very bothered about it if they do carry a grudge. Since I sometimes don't post or even don't read in sgforums for months at a time even. If they were of better character than most, then they wouldn't carry a grudge either.</p>
              <p>End of the day, most of us will just enjoy football for what it is, for favourite teams or whatever, rather than be transfixed on hating one more club than supposedly supporting your own club.</p>
              <p>Just off hand, I sincerely dislike the ABU vs NBU section in The New Paper, but it works because it draws the attention and the readership. Personally I just have fun laughing at what Iain Macintosh writes, because very often what he writes is somewhat true yet absurbly funny.</p>

              <p>This is sincerely what I feel, that Chris has previously tried to break away. But his own personality and the continued provoking (even those in retaliation) doesn't help. I'm not here to offer or suggest reconciliation between you lot I'm just saying to me, that is what I see happening.</p>
              <p>About Poolman it is not an agenda or what, and I have nothing further to add regarding what I feel about him. Afterall, I am but just one guy. Rest of you in sgforums have your own opinion about him be it good or bad.</p>
              <p>p.s; I am aware Chris is to some extent getting such treatment because of his own doing, if that wasn't clear enough in previous posts then let me clarify now.</p>
