              <p><strong>LONDON - Brief reports of FA Cup
              fourth-round matches involving Premier League teams played over
              the weekend:</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong> Played on Sunday:</strong></p>
              <p><strong> CARDIFF CITY 0 ARSENAL 0</strong></p>
              <p>Last season's runners-up Cardiff battled all the way to hold
              the 10-times champions, with goalkeeper Peter Enckelman keeping
              out the best of the Premier League side's efforts.</p>
              <p>Cardiff also had chances and hit the bar late on through
              Ross McCormack in what could be the last Cup game staged at
              Ninian Park, the ground Cardiff are leaving after 99 years at
              the end of the season.</p>
              <p><strong>LIVERPOOL 1 EVERTON 1</strong></p>
              <p>The Mersey rivals drew 1-1 for the second time in a week and
              again Steven Gerrard was on target.</p>
              <p>After putting the hosts ahead in Monday's Premier League
              game, the captain earned a Cup replay with a low shot early in
              the second half on Sunday after Joleon Lescott scored with just
              about Everton's only chance of the match.</p>
              <p><strong>Played on Saturday:</strong></p>
              <p><strong> CHELSEA 3 IPSWICH TOWN 1</strong></p>
              <p>Michael Ballack scored twice and Frank Lampard hit the other
              as the Premier League side reached the fifth round for the 11th
              successive season.</p>
              <p>Ballack side-footed home after 16 minutes but Ipswich struck
              back through Alex Bruce.</p>
              <p>Ballack put Chelsea back in front after 59 minutes with a
              well-taken freekick before Lampard made it 3-1 with a superb
              long-range free kick.</p>
              <p><strong>DONCASTER ROVERS 0 ASTON VILLA 0</strong></p>
              <p>Championship strugglers Doncaster Rovers played above
              themselves and hit the bar twice although Villa went close with
              efforts from Gabriel Agbonlahor and Curtis Davies, while
              Agbonlahor also hit the bar late on.</p>
              <p><strong>HARTLEPOOL UNITED 0 WEST HAM UNITED 2</strong></p>
              <p>West Ham wrapped up a straight-forward victory with two
              goals at the end of the first half.</p>
              <p>Swiss international Valon Behrami opened the scoring before
              Mark Noble doubled the score in first-half stoppage time from a
              penalty after Hartlepool defender Michael Nelson was harshly
              punished for a handball as he was outside the area.</p>
              <p><strong>HULL CITY 2 MILLWALL 0</strong></p>
              <p>Hull made it through to the fifth round for the first time
              in 20 years as goals from Michael Turner and Ian Ashbee earned a
              2-0 win over the League One (third division) side.</p>
              <p>Turner headed in Andy Dawson's free kick before Ashbee
              scored from 20 metres.</p>
              <p><strong>KETTERING TOWN 2 FULHAM 4</strong></p>
              <p>Fulham needed two late goals from Andrew Johnson and Bobby
              Zamora to see off minor league side Kettering who twice
              equalised through Craig Westcarr.</p>
              <p>Simon Davies scored for Fulham after 12 minutes before
              Westcarr equalised. Danny Murphy put Fulham ahead 13 minutes
              from time, Westcarr made it 2-2 with a penalty before Fulham
              regained control.</p>
              <p><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED 2 TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 1</strong></p>
              <p>United came from behind after Roman Pavlyuchenko had headed
              the visitors into the lead after five minutes.</p>
              <p>United, who also beat Spurs at the same stage in last
              season's competition, came back with two goals in three minutes
              with Paul Scholes scoring from a deflected shot in the 35th
              minute and Dimitar Berbatov making it 2-1 with a superb shot
              past goalkeeper Ben Alnwick soon after.</p>
              <p><strong>PORTSMOUTH 0 SWANSEA CITY 2</strong></p>
              <p>Swansea knocked out the holders with Nathan Dyer, on loan
              from Pompey's arch-rivals Southampton, opening the scoring after
              26 minutes. The second came just before the interval when Nadir
              Belhadj fouled Jordi Gomez and Jason Scotland scored from the
              penalty spot.</p>
              <p><strong>SUNDERLAND 0 BLACKBURN ROVERS 0</strong></p>
              <p>A 65th-minute effort from Sunderland's David Healy ruled out
              for offside was the nearest either side got to a goal in a poor
              game.</p>
              <p><strong>WEST BROMWICH ALBION 2 BURNLEY 2</strong></p>
              <p>Burnley, dramatically beaten by Tottenham Hotspur in the
              semi-finals of the League Cup on Tuesday, took the lead after 25
              minutes with a Graham Alexander penalty but Albion turned it
              round with goals by Robert Koren and Kim Do-heon.</p>
              <p>Martin Paterson scored Burnley's late equaliser.</p>
              <p><strong>WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS 1 MIDDLESBROUGH 2</strong></p>
              <p>Middlesbrough took the lead against Championship leaders
              Wolves when Brazilian striker Afonso Alves lofted the ball over
              goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.</p>
              <p>The home side equalised after 63 minutes when Sam Vokes
              took advantage of a mix-up in the Boro defence to score before
              Marvin Emnes scored seven minutes from time to give Boro
              victory.</p>
