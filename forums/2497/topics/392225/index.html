              <p><strong>You can always tell when a sportsman’s arrogance has reached unbearable, 
              boiling-point proportions because they start talking about themselves in the 
              third person. </strong></p>
              <p>Thus it was with John Terry, who gave an extraordinary interview in which he 
              said: ‘I’m on a mission and nothing is going to distract me. I want to win the 
              Champions League and Premier League for Chelsea and World Cup for England. I’m 
              not ashamed to admit it. I wouldn’t be John Terry if I felt any 
              differently.’</p>
              <p>I actually laughed out loud when I read that. The only mission Terry’s been 
              on recently — that he ought to be ashamed of — is, of course, the mission to 
              seduce his England teammate and best friend Wayne Bridge’s girlfriend.</p>
              <p>A mission that has caused terrible damage to the significantly more important 
              mission of improving England’s chances this summer.</p>
              <p>Bridge has now pulled out of the squad, unable to deal with the appalling 
              treachery and telling friends that the worst thing about it was Terry hasn’t 
              even said sorry.</p>
              <p>Imagine that for a moment. You bed your best friend and former team-mate’s 
              girl, the woman he loves and has a baby with. Yet you don’t even apologise to 
              him when you’re caught.</p>
              <p>Instead, you calmly jet off to your gullible wife, who forgives your 
              umpteenth infidelity yet again because she prefers being ‘JT’s wife’ with all 
              the lucrative perks it brings, to not being ‘JT’s wife’. And you tell the world: 
              ‘I’m responding the way I’ve always done — by looking straight ahead. Nobody’s 
              going to knock me off my stride.’</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>Not a thought for Bridge, not a glimmer of contrition for the hurt and damage 
              he has caused. That takes a special kind of ego, a special kind of selfishness. 
              And he wouldn’t be John Terry if he felt any differently because ‘JT’ always 
              does whatever ‘JT’ wants and sod the consequences for anyone else.</p>
              <p>His career record shows us he’s a man who sleeps with who he likes, drinks 
              what he likes, hits who he likes, sells out to who he likes and gambles what he 
              likes.</p>
              <p>And the worse he has behaved, the more protective his club have been and the 
              louder Chelsea fans have roared his name.</p>
              <p>A few people have tried to persuade me what a decent, misunderstood guy Terry 
              is. One newspaper friend of mine almost welled up at a drinks party last week as 
              he told how kind Terry had been to his young daughter. But the Krays were nice 
              to kids, too.</p>
              <p>The truth about ‘JT’ is that he is a pretty unpleasant piece of work, 
              surrounded by even more unsavoury types, who thinks he can get away with 
              anything because everyone of any authority in his life lets him.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Roman Abramovich doesn’t care what Terry does. But why should we expect him 
              to? By Russian oligarch standards, the Chelsea skipper is a veritable 
              choirboy.</strong></p>
              <p>But Fabio Capello could yet be the man who finally gives Terry the lesson he 
              deserves — by dropping him from the England squad altogether and inviting Bridge 
              to rejoin it. That would surely be the right way to resolve this, wouldn’t it? 
              Punishing the villain, not the victim?</p>
              <p>‘There’s a shirt on my wall at home, the one I wore when I missed that 
              penalty,’ said Terry. ‘It’s there as a daily reminder of what I’m striving 
              for.’</p>
              <p>Capello should send him Bridge’s World Cup shirt from England’s training camp 
              in South Africa to stick on the wall as a daily reminder of what he’s missing.</p>
              <p>I wouldn’t feel sorry for him. He doesn’t feel sorry for anyone else.</p>

              <p><strong>Shamed star John Terry has lost all respect from his </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><strong>Chelsea</strong></a><strong> team-mates according to former Stamford Bridge icon 
              Marcel Desailly.</strong></p>
              <p>The World Cup winner and former defensive comrade to Terry believes the 
              England international is seriously showing the strain from the fall-out over his 
              affair with Wayne Bridge's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel and faces a difficult 
              end to the season.</p>
              <p>The retired French legend, now a TV pundit, believes Terry's position as 
              captain is in great doubt, claiming the likes of Frank Lampard and Joe Cole are 
              no longer with him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/01/article-1254543-08803EC6000005DC-269_468x361.jpg" alt="WAYNE BRIDGE JOHN TERRY " width="468" height="361">

              Sun</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>'Knowing John Terry well, I know why he is not playing the way he normally 
              does. He was catastrophic against Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>'You have to understand that John is a born leader and captain of this 
              Chelsea side since 2004. Now he has no credibility whatsoever within the club 
              and this is being felt.</p>

              <p>Desailly spent six years at Chelsea before handing over the captaincy to 
              Terry in 2004. But with the ex-England skipper struggling to cope under intense 
              scrutiny, it could only be a matter of time before he is axed by Blues boss 
              Carlo Ancelotti, on current form.</p>
