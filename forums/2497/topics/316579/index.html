              <h1>Gascoigne taken to hospital after suicide attempt in London hotel</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Paul Gascoigne is in hospital today following an alleged suicide attempt at a luxury London hotel. Police were called to the four-star Millennium hotel in Knightsbridge, west London, at around 3.15pm yesterday.</p>
              <p>According to newspaper, Gascoigne had his hair dyed red in a salon in Kensington on Saturday, before later cutting off all his hair. He allegedly left the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington on Saturday after setting off fire alarms by smoking in his room.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yesterday he arrived at the Millennium Hotel in Sloane Street around 1pm, wearing a leopard-print leather jacket and carrying half a bottle of gin. Staff claimed he ordered a steak from room service, before cancelling the steak and asking staff just to bring him the steak knife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When police were called by worried staff, Gascoigne allegedly tried to drown himself in the bath, and police had to drag the former England player out of the water. At first police told Gascoigne he was being sectioned under the Mental Health Act, but later agreed he could go to a local hospital without handcuffs.</p>

              <p><em>Gazza is helped across the road to his hotel by a hair salon employee</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is believed he was taken to London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where he was kept overnight for tests.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The former England legend has struggled for some time with alcoholism and depression, and was detained under the Mental Health Act in February after police were called to a Newcastle hotel following reports he was acting erratically.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Gascoigne, 40, was released after two weeks of treatment. A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard confirmed officers were called to a hotel in the SW1 area of London yesterday afternoon, and a man had gone to hospital voluntarily. No crime was alleged, she added, so the matter was no longer one for the police.</p>
