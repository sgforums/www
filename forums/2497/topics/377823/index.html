              <p>I was reading the papers and there was this small report on people preferring John Dykes to Joe Morrison</p>
              <p>Personally, i have nothing against the 2 presenters.  One is appears more "professional" whereas the other is like a football kaki that you can talk c*ck with.</p>
              <p>my main gripe is actually the panel.</p>
              <p>i have been quite happy with FC because of the people they get in to give their insights into the game.  quite a breath of fresh air compared to the generic rubbish spewed out by people like shebby singh or paul masefield.</p>
              <p>first things first, the panel on FC are ex-professionals who have been in the game recently.  i found it interesting that sometimes they give info of what happens over there and the banter is what i like between the host and panel.</p>

              <p>Well, personally I am fine with either one too but I do kind of agree with the TS on FC's guest pundits... Most are recent or retired ex-EPL footballers and give a different view than the regular ones from Espn...</p>
              <p>When John was doing the football shows and Joe came along, many wasn't pleased with it but now that Joe has been around for 2 yrs plus and seems to be doing a decent job, I guess some will miss him when he is replace by John again...</p>
              <p>I guess its kind of human nature... We always miss the ones or the things that was taken away from us without our consent... But I guess eventually we will get use to John again... lol</p>

              <p>John Dykes is awesome; strong natural screen presence. The authority he projects is such that he can make a discussion of Birmingham vs Burnley as important-sounding and as relevant to mankind as Iranian uranium enrichment. But his regular panel leaves much to be desired.</p>
              <p>Steve McMahon? He's not bad, but I'm a little biased as a Liverpool fan so I cannot say much. Provides the best insights into what footballers really have to do and what goes on in the field, seeing how he was a notable former footballer himself.</p>
              <p>Jamie Reeves? He taught Econs at Raffles JC at one point. Very solid and is the most likely to get his predictions correct. Has the most common sense.</p>
              <p>Shebby Singh? Played for Malaysia a few times but talks as if he has managed Brazil. Insane and stupid ideas, contradictory and downright ridiculous. "Steven Gerrard should play at right-back for Liverpool". Bloody hell.</p>
              <p>Paul Masefield? BLOODY HELL. Who the hell is this fat piece of lard? As far as I know he never even broken into Birmingham's first team successfully and then played in Hong Kong. The thing that irritates me most about him in his beard, which mysteriously appeared roughly around the same time Roy Keane sported a beard while managing Sunderland. Someone please tell him: Roy Keane + scraggly, unshaven = Manly; a picture of menacing machismo. Paul Masefield + scraggly, unshaven = Hairy, porky clueless pundit.</p>
              <p>I've never taken to Joe Morrison. He acts and looks like my psychology lecturer who is not really funny, not really charismatic, but tries very hard to be so and relate to his audience. His panel can have some have good guest speakers i.e. Scott Minto is not bad.. Les Ferdinand etc..</p>
              <p>But Carlton Palmer. Arrogant as hell. Less said about him the better - though I do remember reading that he was placed in a Worst Premiership XI list somewhere. John Burridge? Entertaining but seriously needs a mental check - one time he turned up wearing a red coat, red pants and red shoes. Is he a football pundit or a pimp?</p>

              <p>Wonder if there any restraint of trade clauses in their contracts to make these hosts and panelists from switching over to another channel. Maybe time for Singtel's/Starhub's lawyers to look into the issue? Football clubs in Europe fight over footballers... Singapore pay-tv broadcasters fight over John Dykes.. :lol:</p>
