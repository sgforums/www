            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The purported transfer of Carlos Tevez to Manchester United has taken a fresh twist, with the news that an arrest order has been issued for businessman Kia Joorabchian, the representative responsible for the player's affairs.</strong><br><br>A federal judge in Brazil has charged Joorabchian, amongst others, with money-laundering and being part of a criminal gang, for the role he played in the relationship between Media Sports Investment (MSI), the company he fronts, and Corinthians, the Brazilian club he first took Tevez to, before bringing him to England.<br><br>London-based MSI has been under investigation ever since it took over Corinthians back in 2004, with Brazilian intelligence known to have run thorough checks on the company.<br><br>"The (MSI) transactions are carried out with the use of numerous offshore accounts which have the single and well-known intention of distancing the investor and the illicit origin of the resources from their final destination, in this case the purchase and sale of (football) players," the federal attorneys Silvio Luis Martins de Oliveira and Rodrigo de Grandis are quoted as saying on Brazilian legal website consultor Juridico.<br><br>The detention of Corinthians president Alberto Dualib has also been ordered, along with that of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, whose money is thought to have bankrolled MSI. Both face similar charges.<br><br>News of Joorabchian's impending arrest has overshadowed the news, revealed exclusively to Sky Sports News on Thursday, that Tevez would wrap up his move to Manchester United in the next few days.<br><br>Suspicions of corruption were raised by the failure of money involved in the purchasing of players to be passed through the country, in a chain of events which has manifest accusations of money laundering. Both MSI and Corinthians have reportedly been unable to clarify the origins of the money, which proceeded to lead to the investigation, that has ultimately led to Joorabchian's impending arrest and cast further doubts over Tevez's move to United.<br><br>Joorabchian has been at the centre of the furore caused by Tevez's switch to West Ham, which concluded at the campaign's end with the Premier League club being fined Â£5.5million, having been found guilty of third-party ownership.<br><br>Sheffield United, who feel they should be reinstated to the top flight, at West Ham's expense, have taken the matter to the High Court, but it would appear Joorabchian now has more pressing affairs of his own.</div>
