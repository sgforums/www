              <h1>Chelsea poised for £50m swoop for Torres, one of sacked boss Grant's prime targets<br></h1>
              <p><a class="addStoriesLink" rel="1021851_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1021851/Chelsea-poised-50m-swoop-Torres-sacked-Grants-prime-targets.html"></a></p>
              <p>Chelsea will offer up to £50million in an audacious bid to sign Liverpool striker Fernando Torres. Stamford Bridge owner Roman Abramovich is ready to smash the world transfer record to land the 24-year-old Spaniard.</p>
              <p>Abramovich was prepared to pay that much for Thierry Henry when he first took over at Chelsea and he has given chief executive Peter Kenyon permission to offer the same amount for a brilliant marksman who scored 33 goals in his debut season at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Avram Grant was sacked as Chelsea's manager on Saturday and the search now begins for his successor, with Guus Hiddink and Frank Rijkaard among the favourites to take over. But it is understood the club will continue to pursue those players Grant identified prior to his dismissal - and Torres was top of his wish list, with the Barclays Premier League and Champions League runners-up happy to take advantage of the chaos at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Chelsea believe they have a chance of pulling off one of the most extraordinary transfer coups in football history which could beat the world record fee of £46m Real Madrid paid Juventus for France midfielder Zinedine Zidane in 2001.</p>
              <p>"There is a desire among certain people at Liverpool to sell at the right price," said an insider last night. "It's just a case of whether they have the nerve to incur the wrath of the Liverpool fans."</p>
              <p>Disruption reigns at Anfield, with the ownership of the club as well as the future of manager Rafa Benitez and chief executive Rick Parry uncertain.</p>
              <p>Tom Hicks says he is desperate to raise funds to take sole control and the sale of Torres only a year after he arrived from Atletico Madrid for £23m could be good business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05/25/article-0-01013D3700000578-157_468x422.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="422"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Benitez: will raise strong objections if owner Tom Hicks decides to cash in on Torres</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Benitez will not think so and agreeing to sell could add more tension. The Liverpool manager claims a lack of resources means his side will again be fighting against the tide for the title next term.</strong></p>
              <p>He said: "It's more difficult because after two years of Chelsea winning the league and spending big money, United needed to do the same. They started spending big money, and Arsenal were also spending big money on young players.</p>
              <p>"We're trying to do the same but it's more difficult to catch up. We'll do our best. The key is to not talk about the title."</p>
              <p>But his objections regarding the sale of Torres may not hold sway and it would represent good business for Chelsea as well as Hicks because striker Didier Drogba is up for sale.</p>
              <p>As well as Jose Bosingwa - who has agreed to join Chelsea for £16m - Grant identified AC Milan's Kaka and Real Madrid's Robinho. Like Torres, Kaka is an ambitious target and someone Milan have said they are not prepared to sell. But Chelsea will attempt to lure the World Player of the Year by offering Drogba, Ricardo Carvalho and possibly even money in return.</p>
              <p>Chelsea do not envisage the next manager objecting but they want to make an appointment quickly. Rijkaard has long been considered the favourite and the football he produced at Barcelona to win the Champions League in 2006 impressed Abramovich. But there are concerns about the strength of his leadership and Chelsea could turn to someone like the experienced Hiddink.</p>
              <p>The return of Jose Mourinho has been dismissed but among other possible targets are Luiz Felipe Scolari, Marcello Lippi, Mark Hughes and Sven Goran Eriksson.</p>

              <p>Liverpool won't sell cause if they do they would have also run a risk that Stevie do a walkout on them.. but if they eventually did then it must have been the making of the Americans and would spell the end of Liverpool's chances of a silverware for the next couple of years at least..</p>
              <p>however, if this rummors is true then i bet ManU would also wants to give it a try, having Torres as the target man and Ronney pulling the string they can seriously considering letting Ronaldo go to bankroll this transfer and still have 10m for another right winger.. one can only dream!!!!  </p>

              If Torres wanted to go Chelsea, he already would have gone there in the first place and not Chelsea. Still, I can understand why Chelsea would try. Proven quality in the Premiership and with Drogba possibly leaving Chelsea, it's important for a club of Chelsea's stature to get a good striker.
              
              I would feel Chelsea have a better chance of getting Berbatov though. And for Berbatov he'd be getting the Champions League football he deserves.
