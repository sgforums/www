              <p>Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson could be lining up Sol
              Campbell to help solve his defensive injury crisis, according to
              reports in the British press on Wednesday morning.</p>
              <p>With a host of defenders, including <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7825">Rio Ferdinand</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7624">John O'Shea</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=83176&amp;cc=4716">Jonny Evans</a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8866">Wes Brown</a>,
              all sidelined, it is reported that the Red Devils are interested in
              bringing in the former England defender on a short-term contract.</p>
              <p>Although
              the former Tottenham and Arsenal centre-back has already reached an
              agreement to leave Notts County, he would not be able to sign for
              another club before the transfer window opens on January 1 as he was
              contracted to the Magpies when the last window closed.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mirror </em>reports
              that Campbell has been invited to train with the United team to assess
              his fitness ahead of the new year, and Ferguson could then offer him a
              six-month contract until the end of the season. Campbell, who left the
              League Two club in September just one game into a five-year deal, has
              also been linked with a move to join former Spurs colleague Chris
              Hughton at Newcastle.</p>
              <p>A
              host of Premier League clubs are likely to be chasing his signature
              once he is eligible to sign for a new club, though it is certain he
              will need time to get back to full match fitness for the 35-year-old.</p>

              <p>A good deal I feel... Afterall, it only for 6 months and he is free...</p>
              <p>And considering the problem at United now... 5 to 6 senior defenders all out and about 3 need another 1 month plus to recover... Not a bad deal lah, cos in 2 to 3 weeks time some will come back in so he can be sub lor. There is also no telling if they will not get injured again mah... Where are you going to find a defender who is just as experienced not just in the Premiership but also in a title battle run in?</p>
              <p>Remember Laurent Blanc came at the same age also somemore he stayed for 2 years...</p>

              <p class="article">Campbell can prove, as Swedish star Larsson did, that he still has the quality to play at the very highest level and I'm not surprised at the reports tipping him for a Premier League return.</p>
              <p class="article">Not too many people took to the idea of striker Larsson doing a more than decent job for Alex Ferguson back in January 2007 when he was plucked from Swedish part-timers Helsingborgs.</p>
              <p class="article">Sir Alex needed a temporary fix for his squad when he was struggling with injuries to strikers Alan Smith and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. It worked out brilliantly as Larsson scored on his debut against Aston Villa in the FA Cup and then against Watford in the league during his three-month stay.</p>
              <p class="article">United went on to win the Premier League title that season, two months after Larsson, now 37, went home to Sweden with Sir Alex full of praise for the way he handled himself.</p>
              <p class="article">As a measure of Larsson's contribution, even though he did not play the 10 games needed to gain a champion's medal, United asked for and were granted an extra gong to pass on to him.</p>
              <p class="article">With United now having problems with the fitness of key defenders like Jonny Evans, Rio Ferdinand and John O'Shea, it has a familiar ring about the Larsson situation to it. Sol can still do a job for anyone and probably the biggest mistake he has made in recent years was moving to Notts County.</p>
              <p class="article">Not for one minute do I wish to disrespect anyone at Meadow Lane, I know they are honest pros who will do their best for the club. But one of the hardest things in football - and there are many - is trying to play alongside players who are not on the same level. That is the situation Campbell found himself in and while I don't know if he will go to Old Trafford, or if Sir Alex is interested, it would make sense.</p>
              <p class="article">Larsson was successfully persuaded to come out of retirement and Sol - at 35 a couple of years younger - would also be one of those 'golden oldies'. In fact, Sir Alex has already turned to one golden oldie and is getting the rewards for backing his judgment in signing Michael Owen when few would touch him.</p>
              <p class="article">I reckon Liverpool must be looking at Owen now and wondering why they didn't try to get him back at Anfield - when Fernando Torres is injured who do they have?</p>
              <p class="article">If the truth be known, Owen would probably have loved to have gone back to Anfield for a second spell and I can just imagine him running on to passes slid through defences by Stevie Gerrard. For me, it was a no-brainer when Owen became available and his hat-trick for United in Germany against Wolfsburg was a masterclass in finishing and demonstrates that class is permanent, form is temporary.</p>
              <p class="article">Owen took a little time to find his feet at Old Trafford and knows he is not going to play a part in every game - this is where his temperament kicks in. He is mentally tough enough to accept the situation if he is on the bench and accept the challenge on the pitch.</p>
              <p class="article">Michael has already played in enough games to get a title medal should United manage to overhaul Chelsea at the top. You never know, Sol could be getting another title medal of his long career when they are handed out in May.</p>
