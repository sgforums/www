              <h2>Lukas Podolski has admitted to being increasingly concerned that signing for Bayern Munich was a bad career move.</h2>
              <p>Still widely perceived as Germany's golden boy, the young forward had
              hoped that this season would be different from last, when he had to
              settle for a near permanent place on the Bayern bench. So far that has
              not been the case, however.<br><br>In a recent interview with the
              'Bild', the 23-year-old vented his frustration in a manner which makes
              it hard to argue that his relationship with the club's brass has
              reached a new low.<br><br>"I wouldn't have had I known that things were
              going to turn out like this," was Podolski's frank response when asked
              whether he still would have signed for Bayern had he been able to
              foresee what was in store for him in Munich.<br><br>"I'm not complaining though. I'm just not happy with the situation," he insisted.<br><br>Bayern
              director Uli Hoeness recently suggested that the ex 1.FC Koeln star
              needs a good kick in the butt, to which 'Prince Poldi' responded: "Why
              would he need to kick my behind? I've barely played at all this season,
              so it's not like I've been under-performing."<br><br>When pressed on whether he would consider a move abroad, Podolski replied: "Everything is possible."<br><br>He added: "I would be a bad footballer if I contented myself by sitting on the bench.<br><br>"I
              could tolerate it if it was a case of two or three weeks, but there
              comes a point when one has to draw the line and say: 'This is too much!
              I'm not making any progress here.' That's just human nature."</p>
