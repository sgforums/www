              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor has expressed his hurt after being targeted by
              sections of the Arsenal crowd this season and has claimed that he was
              an unwitting participant in the summer speculation that so angered some
              supporters.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/arsenal/adebayor-annoyed.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Adebayor was booed at the start of the season after being the
              subject of interest from Milan and Barcelona and having failed to
              replicate his 30-goal haul from last year, frustration has been evident
              amongst the home support.</strong></p>
              <p>The Togo striker, despite professing otherwise, did little to help
              his cause when threatening to leave the club before the start of the
              campaign in an interview with a tabloid newspaper and was recently
              quoted again as claiming that he has been in contact with Milan
              vice-president Adriano Galliani.</p>
              <p>But Adebayor claims he is blameless in the saga and has questioned
              why he has been singled out for criticism by some disgruntled
              supporters.</p>
              <p>“It was not nice playing at home getting booed by my own fans,” said Adebayor in The Sun. “I didn’t know what to do any more.</p>
              <p>“If Porto, for example, wants Adebayor, it is not Adebayor’s fault. Why boo me?”</p>
              <p>Adebayor has once again been linked with a move to Milan while Inter
              and Chelsea are also believed to be interested in the Togo
              international whose future remains the subject of some doubt.</p>

              <p><strong>Milan president Silvio Berlusconi has claimed there is a "good chance" his club will sign Arsenal forward Emmanuel Adebayor this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>And the Italian prime minister suggested Dutch legend Marco Van Basten will replace Chelsea-bound Carlo Ancelotti as coach next season.</p>
              <p>Adebayor nearly moved to Italy last summer before agreeing a new contract at the Emirates. But his performances this season suggest he should have gone - and now the Serie A giants are willing to give the Togo striker a second chance.</p>
              <p>"There is a good chance that we can get Adebayor," Berlusconi claimed.</p>
              <p>Van Basten played for Milan between 1987-93 and the 44-year-old former Holland boss is now out of work after resigning as Ajax coach earlier this month after failing to qualify for the Champions League.</p>
              <p>With Ancelotti expected to confirm his appointment at Stamford Bridge imminently, Berlusconi added: "Ancelotti is one of the family, but if he doesn't stay, we'll hire a young and emerging trainer. For me, Marco is like a son. He is a piece of Milan's history."</p>

              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has delivered
              his most unequivocal statement to date regarding the future of Emmanuel
              Adebayor with his revelation that he is out to persuade the Togo
              striker to remain at Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/arsenal/wenger_adebayor_chinwag480.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Noises coming out of the club, the player and his representatives in
              recent weeks have seemed to suggest that Adebayor's long-time
              flirtation with a move elsewhere could come to fruition this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Milan president Silvio Berlusconi claimed that there was a ‘good
              chance’ the club would sign Adebayor and Wenger has previously hinted
              that he would be willing to sell.</p>
              <p>However, the Frenchman, who has been forced to clear up his own future this week, now seems to have changed tact somewhat.</p>
              <p>"At the moment his future is at the club,” said Wenger at his
              pre-match press conference. “He has a long contract and we want to keep
              him at the club. I am hopeful I will be able to keep him.</p>
              <p>“My gut feeling is he will be here [next season]. But I believe
              that, considering transfers and the money available, the less you talk
              the better it is.</p>
              <p>“Let other people talk and do what you want. I believe the more
              everybody shuts up inside the club and doesn’t talk about anything and
              works hard is the best.”</p>
