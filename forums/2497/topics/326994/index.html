              <h3>REAL MADRID are ready to hit Cristiano Ronaldo with a £17million compensation claim for refusing to join them.</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Spanish club are claiming that Ronaldo’s agent Jorge Mendes struck the astonishing deal with them at the start of the summer transfer saga. Real are adamant they agreed personal terms with the Manchester United star and insisted on the compensation clause if the transfer was not completed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Spanish media sources, who have become Madrid’s unofficial mouthpiece during the Ronaldo negotiations, are reporting that Real president Ramon Calderon is determined to press ahead with the claim.</p>
              <p>Calderon might be prepared to waive compensation if he gets a guaranteed assurance from Ronaldo that he will join them next summer. But, amazingly, he has left the door open for the Portuguese winger to complete another U-turn before the August transfer window closes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A Real insider said: “The doors are not closed to things undergoing a U-turn. Until the transfer window closes everything remains in the air.” That will further enrage United boss Sir Alex Ferguson who has vowed to have no more dealings with the Spaniards.</p>

              <p><strong>Real Madrid are reportedly set to demand £17m in compensation from Cristiano Ronaldo after the Portuguese forward refused to demand a transfer from Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ronaldo's announcement last week that he would be remaining at Old Trafford heaped embarrassment on the Spanish giants and their president Ramon Calderon following their summer-long pursuit of the forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to the News of the World, Madrid are adamant that 'they agreed personal terms with the Manchester United star at the start of the summer and insisted on the compensation clause if the transfer was not completed.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>However, that claim is contradicted by the Sunday Express which says that, such is Madrid's anger at being rebuffed, Ronaldo may never be allowed to fulfil his boyhood dream of moving to the Bernabeu.</p>

              <h1>Figo’s Barça-Madrid Secret Revealed</h1>
              <h2>José Veiga, the former agent of Luis Figo, has exposed a startling fact behind the player’s hugely controversial move from Barcelona to arch nemesis, Real Madrid in 2000.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/14964_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="250"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Veiga, who is currently the chairman of English League One side, Swindon Town has revealed how former Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez managed to pull off one of the biggest shocks in transfer history by snapping up Luis Figo from Barcelona for €65 million.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Accoring to <em>Sport,</em> Veiga disclosed that he had signed a pre-agreement with Pérez, who was running against Lorenzo Sanz for the club’s presidency then, to bring Figo to the Bernabéu.</span></p>
              <p><span>He then claimed that the main reason he signed the document was to pressure</span> <span>Barcelona</span> <span>into accepting a contract improvement for the player, in addition to pocketing a handsome €3 million in commission.</span></p>
              <p><span>What Veiga didn’t know at the time – other than the fact that Lorenzo Sanz would lose the elections and hand the reigns over to Pérez – was that as per the signed agreement, there was a €30 million exit fee attached should Veiga or Figo himself break the contract to join Los Blancos.</span></p>
              <p><span>With Veiga trapped between a rock and a hard place, Figo then asked the agent: “What do we do now?” to which Veiga replied, “There are three options. One, you remain at Barça and pay the €30 million which you do not have, two, you don’t pay them and I go to jail, or three, you go to Real Madrid.”</span></p>
              <p><span>Veiga believes that it is a similar tactic that current president Ramón Calderón is using to snatch Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United; making the player sign a deal with Los Merengues that includes a penalty clause that could cost the Portuguese millions should he break his end of the deal.</span></p>

              <p>would be really really fun to see Ronaldo reacting to this latest claim from Real..</p>
              <p>anyway, IMHO it'll be better off for ManU to allow him to left while pocketing at least 60m pound, things are getting outta hand and would cause alot of distress to ManU's squad if this sh!t drags on.. even thou ManU would be better off with a player of Ronaldo's class but with 60m they'll be able to further strengthen themselves, getting themselves a proven striker, a out and out striker would be more important then getting them suc.k into this saga..</p>
              <p>Ronney might have been played outta position last season but in him i do see him more of a supporting striker then a out &amp; out striker, just like Teves.</p>
              <p>just like last night, the way they played is very very exicting, with players rotating around as the targetman hence giving lots of headache to their rival, if not for David James and the hard tackling of the entire Portsmouth team and ManU's lack of sharpness infront of goal, i'm sure the match would have settled way before the spot kick..    </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Ronaldo is still very young... So even if they can keep him for another year or two, his value won't drop... Look at Kaka, 2 yrs older than Ronaldo... Still can command such prices... So the smart thing is to keep him for another yr or two or maybe even 3 than cash in... And unlike Robinho, he has not even asked to leave something that the Real president wanted him to do... only saying it would be a boyhood dream to play for Real... At 26, his value may even be higher should the transfer market for players keep going up...</p></div>

              <p>Well, Man Utd winning the double is already a foregone conclusion, its over therefore, there is nothing much to talk about anymore... It is close season currently and transfer news are the biggest thing for the Press... Be it Ronaldo, Adebayor or Barry... They will still be keenly followed...</p>
              <p>I personally don't think there will be any ill effect to United, if anything  it may actually give the squad a boost in confidence that they didn't lose him... On the other hand, I think it may have a more negative effect on Real for the way they went about to get him... We can already see Robinho and Sneijder are not happy to be made makeweights in the deal... Van Nistelrooy commenting on Real should spend more time talking about their own players rather than on someone that is not at their club... Cannavaro saying Ron should honour his contract kind of stuff... This type of things can effect relationship between players like we can now see Robinho's unhappiness...</p>
              <p>And lastly, it can't be a good feeling for Van der Vaart knowing he was 2nd choice and Real only came in for him after they lost out on Ronaldo... Overall, if they are to sell him, do it in 2 to 3 yrs time would be better...</p>
