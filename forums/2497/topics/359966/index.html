              <p><strong>Xabi Alonso has dismissed the constant speculation regarding his
              future by stating he is eagerly anticipating the start of next season
              with Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/liverpool/alonso-gerrard.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>The Spain international’s position at Anfield has been a matter of
              sustained debate for 12 months after Benitez attempted to sell his
              compatriot to Juventus in order to fund a move for Gareth Barry last
              summer.</strong></p>
              <p>But Alonso has proved his manager wrong with a hugely-influential
              season in the red of Liverpool, leading to suggestions that Real Madrid
              and Arsenal, amongst others, could bid for the 27-year-old at the end
              of the season.</p>
              <p>Alonso admits to be enjoying his football on Merseyside though and
              is already focused on taking his supreme form into next season.</p>
              <p>“Time flies. I’ve already been here for five years – it’s gone so fast,” said Alonso in the Daily Express.<br> <br>“There
              have been ups and downs but I have tried to enjoy and learn from every
              situation. I’ve developed into a much better player and person.</p>
              <p>“A lot of things have changed for me during my time here, and now I’m looking forward to my sixth season as a Liverpool player.</p>
              <p>“It has been a complete season for me. I’ve felt good and feel I
              have been playing well, too. I have been very happy and want to carry
              that through our final few games of the campaign.</p>
              <p>“I finished last season well and was able to continue that with
              Spain at Euro 2008. That continued into this season and I feel I’ve
              been at a very good level for about 12 or 13 months.</p>
              <p>“Now I have to try to carry that on into next season. It’s not about what you have done, but what you have to do.”</p>
