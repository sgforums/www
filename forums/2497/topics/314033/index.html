              <p><strong>Chelsea defender Ashley Cole finally looks to have had the last laugh on Arsenal and his critics. Since the England left-back joined Chelsea in a deal which saw William Gallas and £5million going the other way in August 2006, Arsenal supporters have claimed their club got the better of the deal. Yet while the Gunners brace themselves for another trophy-less season, Cole has a great chance of winning the Premier and Champions League this term.</strong></p>
              <p>The 27-year-old, who progressed through Arsenal's junior ranks, has already received one honour this term after Roberto Carlos asked for his shirt following the win over Fenerbahce on Tuesday which put the Blues in the semi-finals. It is a sign the World Cup winner still regards Cole as one of the best left-backs in the game and his form in the last few weeks has begun to justify that tag.</p>
              <p>His performances have been all the more impressive because he has beaten off the challenge of Wayne Bridge, while having to cope with problems in his personal life and the criticism he received for his behaviour towards referee Mike Riley during the Tottenham match last month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cole, who has struggled with an ankle injury for the majority of his time at Stamford Bridge, feels the key in his renaissance is a return to the kind of fitness levels he enjoyed when at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Cole is relishing the chance to get Chelsea to the Champions League final in Moscow even though Arsenal's defeat to Liverpool means he has been robbed of the chance to truly haunt his former club by knocking them out of Europe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cole said: "I had no preference between playing Arsenal or Liverpool, we knew it would be tough whoever won that tie. We will go to Liverpool in the first leg with a lot of confidence.</p>
              <p>"It is vital we get a goal away from home and hopefully keep a clean sheet at Stamford Bridge."</p>

              <p>good....maybe can finally stop arsenal fans from saying that players that left arsenal are not as successful as they were when they were at arsenal.......</p>
              <p>even though van bronckhorst has provided a very good example of being more successful after leaving arsenal</p>
