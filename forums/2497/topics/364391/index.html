              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Steven Gerrard has admitted that he could retire at the end of his current contract, which runs until 2013. </strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool skipper will be 33-years-old by then and accepts that he may decide to hang up his boots.</p>
              <p>The
                  England international claims he will take great pride from the fact
                  that, should he call time on his illustrious career at that juncture,
                  he will have spent his entire career at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Gerrard was a boyhood Liverpool fan and has become the heartbeat of the Merseyside outfit over the years.</p>
              <p>He
                  has revealed that he came close to leaving the club when Chelsea came
                  calling in 2005, but is delighted to have remained loyal to his roots.</p>
              <p>"I will be 33 at the end of my contract in 2013 and I don't know if I will go any further," Gerrard told <em>France Football</em>.</p>
              <p>"If
                  I do retire, then I will know that from the start to the end of my
                  career I only had one club. And I don't want to think about wearing any
                  other shirt in the future.</p>
              <p>"I was close to leaving in the past,
                  maybe twice, most notably in 2005. That year we (Liverpool) were a long
                  way off the Premier League title and Chelsea's interest turned my head.</p>
              <p>"It
                  was a difficult moment for me. However, now when I look back I am very
                  happy that I chose to stay here. It has given me real pride."</p>

              <p>Zidane is an inspirational figure to Gerrard, who is delighted to
              have been hailed as one of the best players in the world by his idol.</p>
              <p>“Zidane is special to me,” Gerrard told France-Football.</p>

              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard believes Liverpool have to buy wisely this summer if they are to challenge Manchester United next season. </strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool skipper admits The Reds are two or three players short
              of rivals United, who have more depth and quality in their squad.</p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez has reportedly agreed a deal to take full back Glen
              Johnson to Anfield for £18 million, while The Reds have also been
              linked with big-money moves for Valencia’s David Silva and Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p>Benitez’s side finished second in the table last time around despite amassing their record Premier League points tally.</p>
              <p>And Gerrard believes the Spaniard will need get it right in the
              close season in order to turn The Reds from challengers to champions.</p>
              <p>“Today we are a lot closer to the title than in the past but the close season signings will be vital,” he told France Football.</p>
              <p>“Manchester United have more depth in their squad than us, you have
              to admit it. But if we add the right two or three quality players to
              those we already have we will be at their level.”</p>
              <p>“I am not proud of having won nothing this season. But I think the
              experience of the failure will help us next season. The team has made
              enormous progress. Now we have to step up again and the summer will be
              vital for that.”</p>
