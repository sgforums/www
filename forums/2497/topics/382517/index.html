              <div>ROY KEANE is making the same mistakes at Ipswich as he did at Sunderland - as 
              his managerial career teeters towards the brink.</div>
              </div>
              <p class="byline"> </p>
              <div>
              <p>Two separate dressing-room sources have revealed how Keane has alienated a 
              section of the Ipswich squad with his odd behaviour and appalling 
              communication skills.</p>
              <p>And with Town stuck in the relegation zone - just one point off the bottom of 
              the Championship - the fiery Cork-man is in danger of exiting Portman Road 
              before Christmas.</p>
              <p>The sources insisted Keane:</p>
              <p>* Fails to properly communicate with his players</p>
              <p>* Needs to radically change his coaching set-up</p>
              <p>* Ruins players' confidence with hairdryer outbursts</p>
              <p>Our dressing-room snitches also admitted Keane's selection policy has left 
              players baffled and frustrated.</p>
              <p>So far this season, Ipswich have won just one of their 16 league games, with 
              Keane chopping and changing his side week after week, selecting just one 
              player, Jonathon Walters, each time.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester United skipper has also changed his captain twice - 
              handing Walters the armband, after starting the season with Gareth McAuley 
              before he was stripped of the job in favour of Alex Bruce.</p>
              <p>Source No1 said: "Keane can be a bit of an oddball. When a player is dropped, 
              no proper explanation is given.</p>
              <p>"You are just out of the side without knowing what you have to do to get back 
              into it.</p>
              <p>"It'd be a lie to say morale is really bad at the club because even though the 
              team are struggling for points, there is still a lot of spirit there.</p>
              <p>"The bottom line is that even though players really respect Keane for what he 
              achieved as a player - which gives him a definite edge when it comes to 
              signing men - as a manager, he rules by fear.</p>
              <p>"He regularly has a go at players, which isn't that unusual in football 
              because every manager does it. Keane just seems to do it more than most and 
              that affects confidence.</p>
              <p>"The other part of the problem is that Roy does not have a top-class coaching 
              team working underneath him. The kindest thing I can say about his 
              assistant, Tony Loughlan, is that he is not highly-rated."</p>
              <p>In fact Loughlan, the Irishman's trusted Lieutenant, is regarded as a puppet 
              to the Portman Road master, which is at the centre of Keane's troubles.</p>
              <p>Rather than rely on an old mate, what Keane really needs is the 
              self-confidence to employ a man with the experience and expertise to 
              constantly challenge him.</p>
              <h4><strong>Cock-up</strong></h4>
              <p>Loughlan, rightly or wrongly, is perceived as a lapdog, which discredits both 
              him and Keane - and is a chief reason why the Irishman, who, by his own 
              admission, made dozens of mistakes during his spell at Sunderland, is really 
              cocking up this time.</p>
              <p>And be in no doubt this is a cock-up. Ipswich, after all, were one of the 
              Championship's leading spenders in the summer, forking out a fortune on new 
              players and handed Keane a generous budget to appease the league's eighth 
              largest support.</p>
              <p>Yet those supporters have been left scratching their heads in wonder at what 
              has gone wrong as Blackpool, a club whose annual budget is half Ipswich's - 
              enter the play-offs, the place Keane insisted he would be.</p>
              <p>That statement seems bizarre now as do some other aspects of Keane's 
              behaviour, such as his insistence on deploying match-day stewards to keep 
              out the public from a closed-door friendly with West Ham at Portman Road.</p>
              <p>When fans tried to watch through a window in the club shop, the manager 
              ordered the curtains to be closed, leading one former Ipswich director to 
              question whether Keane thinks he is bigger than the club.</p>
              <p>Whatever his thoughts on that are, Keane most certainly must be revising his 
              earlier declaration that "any half-decent manager can lead a side to 
              half-way in the Championship".</p>
              <p>So far, Keane has guided Ipswich to the bottom and kept them there, failing to 
              trust any of the club's four top scorers from last season, sending Kevin 
              Lisbie out on loan where he has been prolific, pretty much telling Irishman 
              Owen Garvan to find a new club and undermining Jonathan Stead and Paulo 
              Counago's confidence by starting each striker in just six league games.</p>
              <p>Worse yet, the man he signed to score goals, Tamas Priskin, has found the net 
              just once and floated in and out of the side as the lack of consistency in 
              team selection has inevitably resulted in inconsistent performances.</p>
              <p>Source No2 said: "At Sunderland, it fell apart for Keane when he signed new 
              players and then, within weeks, decided he didn't rate some of them.</p>
              <p>"To me, he is making the same mistakes all over again. It's one thing not to 
              fancy a player - some manager's prefer athletes to ball-players, which seems 
              to be Owen Garvan's problem.</p>
              <p>"But he just seems too impetuous. He's making rash call after rash call, 
              signing Damien Delaney for £800,000 to be his left-back and then going after 
              another player, Lee Wallace, to play in the same position.</p>
              <p>"On the plus side, he's definitely calmer here than he was at Sunderland and 
              he is here all the time, whereas at Sunderland he stayed away from the 
              training ground for most of the week.</p>
              <p>"So in some ways, he has learned from the past but in many other areas, it is 
              the same old issues that are costing him."</p>
              <p>Those issues need urgent attention, otherwise a once-great player's reputation 
              will be dented.</p>
              <p>"History shows I'm not great at dealing with setbacks," Keane said during his 
              spell at the Stadium of Light.</p>
              <p>It's up to the Cork-man to rewrite his own legacy.</p>
