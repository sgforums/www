              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Giovani dos Santos is already making an impact at Tottenham as Juande Ramos' side collected their first silverware of the season. The creative forward, signed from Barcelona for an initial fee of £4.7million, was the star of the show as Spurs won Feyenoord's Jubilee Tournament.</strong></p>
              <p>All the talk around White Hart Lane is of £24m Russian forward Andrei Arshavin, although the Spurs claim they have ended their interest in the Zenit St Petersburg star. There are also concerns that Dimitar Berbatov will still leave to join Manchester United, but the 500 Tottenham supporters in Rotterdam will have had their nerves eased.</p>
              <p>Darren Bent is looking sharper than ever and grabbed the opener against the Bundesliga side. Giovani then scored after half-time before Jamie O'Hara added a third late on to see off the Germans. 'The players have worked hard and it is good to have won these two matches,' said Ramos, who saw his side beat Celtic on Friday. 'But they are friendlies and the team will continue to prepare for the new season.</p>
              <p>'Giovani has settled well, I know him from my time in Spain. All of my players work for the team, and he will give a lot to us.'  David Bentley is settling in well to his new surroundings following his recent move from Blackburn and made his full debut in the De Kuip Stadium.</p>
              <p>It was Bent who shone early on though, as he cleverly drilled home from the edge of the area after 10 minutes. Berbatov replaced Bent at half-time, but it was Dos Santos who continued to impress. He almost scored just after the break and made his breakthrough on 55 minutes, latching on to a pass by Jermaine Jenas and applying a cool finish into the corner of the net.</p>
              <p>Jamie O'Hara scored the third late on from an Adam Smith cross. Tottenham are now back in England to prepare for a game with Roma on Sunday.</p>

              <h2>JENAS: SPURS ARE GENUINE CONTENDERS</h2>
              <div><span><img src="http://images.football365.com/08/02/240/Jermaine_Jenas_blubs_like_a_bubba_668792.jpg" alt="Jenas - thinks Spurs can have a good season."></span></div>
              <div><span><strong>Midfielder Jermaine Jenas insists the quality in the Tottenham squad will help them come close to breaking into the top four of the Premier League this season.</strong></span></div>
              <div>
              <p>Although the club have lost striker Robbie Keane to Liverpool, while Dimitar Berbatov is being linked with a move away from White Hart Lane, boss Juande Ramos has attracted David Bentley, Giovani dos Santos, Luca Modric and Heurelho Gomes to the club.</p>
              <p>And Jenas, capped 18 times by England, believes the "abundance of quality" in the squad gives the north London club a fighting chance of challenging Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool at the top of the table.</p>
              <p>The midfielder explained: "Getting into the Champions League is not going to be easy. "To break into that quartet is tough - but a number of quality players have come in and we'll be doing our best to get amongst it."</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old is impressed with manager Juande Ramos, adding on Sky Sports News: "As soon as he came you could see why he was so successful at other clubs.</p>
              <p>"It's been a pleasure to work with him."</p>
