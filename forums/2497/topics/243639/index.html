            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/104705.jpg"><br><br><strong>Charlton's China star Zheng Zhi has put his spitting image behind him and wants to stay on beyond his loan deal with the relegation-threatened club. Handed a six-month ban two years ago for spitting in the direction of a referee and insulting him, the 26-year-old made headlines for the right reasons with a goal in Sunday's 2-0 Barclays Premiership home win over Newcastle.</strong><br><br>Less than 24 hours later, Zheng jetted back to his homeland to captain his his country in two international matches next week. He will return in time for another crucial Premiership survival game against Wigan at the end of the month, determined to force Charlton to make his move permanent next season.<br><br>He said: "I want to stay longer than this season because I like this club very much. I may be the best player in China but not here. "I have my family with me here in London now and I have felt very comfortable recently. The club has been very helpful and, although the biggest problem was finding a house, that has been done now and everything is okay."<br><br>The third Chinese player to turn out in the Premiership after Manchester City's Sun Jihai and Sheffield United's former Everton star Li Tie, Zheng revealed he is still struggling with his English lessons - and that the pace of the game in this country is still something he has to conquer.<br><br>For now, Zheng relies on an interpreter for interviews and communication with his team-mates and manager Alan Pardew but his knowledge of the Premiership is beyond dispute. "I contacted Li Tie and Sun Jihai before I came over and I've watched many Premiership games on television in China," he said.<br><br>Zheng is used to fame. If he dares to walk down the street in China, people surround him. And most of China's 1.3 billion population are banking on him leading the national team to glory at the Beijing Olympic Games in 18 months' time. Zheng does not know what it will cost Charlton to buy him from Shandong Luneng, the reigning Chinese champions for whom he scored 21 goals last season, but he said: "I hope it can be arranged. I'm ready to give my all to help the team fight against relegation and then see what more can be achieved.<br><br>"We have some great players like Darren Bent and Luke Young and, although I'm not in their league yet, I think I have done well. I can play in a number of positions but feel I'm best in a five-man midfield, pushing forward. "I was delighted to get my first goal and I've given it to my mother Qu Li as a present because I understand it was Mother's Day when I scored but I should have added another one in the game with my left foot - and I regret missing that."<br><br>Zheng arrived at the Valley in late December after impressing in a trial in front of former Addicks manager Les Reed. But new boss Pardew has already become a big fan and said: "For obvious reasons, it took time to integrate him but he has fitted in now and can play anywhere. He has very good technical ability and he certainly has a tackle in him all right.<br></div>
