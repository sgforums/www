              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED ace Cristiano Ronaldo insists he deserves to be crowned the world's best player.</h2>
              <p class="article">The winger was unstoppable last season as his 42 goals helped his side to an unforgettable Double.</p>
              <p class="article">And Ronaldo, 23, believes he should win both the World Player of the Year and European Player of the Year awards later this year.</p>
              <p class="article">But when asked who he thinks should win the awards, Ronaldo said: 'Sincerely, "Yes, I'm confident.</p>
              <p class="article">"If you assess what I did over the course of the season, I think I did more than everyone.</p>
              <p class="article">"What else should I have done to win the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA award?"</p>
              <p>Ronaldo also described his 'torture' at having to play through the pain barrier before undergoing surgery on his ankle after Euro 2008 but insists he had no regrets.<br><br>'At times it was like having a knife in my ankle,' said the holder of Europe's Golden Boot award. 'I gritted my teeth. I don't regret it. It was worth it. It was torture, also psychologically.'<br><br>Ronaldo is on a 30-man shortlist for the 2008 Ballon d'Or, formerly known as the European Footballer of the Year award, and faces competition from the likes of Liverpool striker Fernando Torres and United team-mate Wayne Rooney.<br><br>The prize will be awarded on December 2 by 96 journalists from all over the world following a poll organised by French magazine France Football.</p>

              <p>What is there to laugh? If he don't win then it means they didn't pick the right man thats all mah... Honestly, base on last season's form... He is in a one horse race... But there is no denying that there will always be some people who won't like him and would ignore his skill and talent out of some reason...</p>

              <p><br>No disrespect to Torres, he did a good job in the final for Spain too but I think it was Villa's overall contribution that won Spain the Euro... Anyway, if Torres a striker scored so many goals, Ronaldo a midfielder scored even more... and probably the most in Europe last season...</p>

              <p><br>Yeah, definitely not just about goals lah... If it was then no need to vote already as he was top scorer in EPL and CL... Last season, he inspires confidence more than any other United player did to the team throughout the whole season, and thats what got them the EPL and CL titles.</p>
              <p>Iker, I would say would not even be in the top 3 position... Messi and maybe Villa or Torres should be in there... Even Iker's own coach, Schuster belief Ronaldo deserve it more than his own player... </p>
              <p>All I can say is, if he don't win it which is very possible, its because of a personally thing rather than a professional one. Cos even Messi didn't had a great season last year...</p>

              <h1><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.cristianoronaldofan.net/bernd-schuster-backs-cristiano-ronaldo-for-the-ballon-d%e2%80%99or-award"><span style="color: #0b3c89;">Bernd Schuster backs Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d’Or Award</span></a></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster says Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo deserves the Ballon d'Or ahead of his goalkeeper Iker Casillas.</p>
              <p>"I think that this year Cristiano Ronaldo deserves it. He was the leading scorer in Europe with 42 goals, has won the league and Champions League...that should be sufficient," Schuster said in <em>Marca</em>.</p>
              <p>"He didn't do so well with the national team (at Euro 2008), but this was due to Spain and Germany.</p>
              <p>"It's easy to say that Spaniards Iker and Xavi (should win it), but if you take into account the overall season you see that Cristiano is the one."</p>
              <p>Schuster underlined the fact that the Ballon d’Or Award was not based on the Euros only, but on the overall season.</p>
              <p>He then singled out the Portuguese Superstar’s achievement. Bernd Schuster recalled Ronaldo’s ability to help Manchester United win the double as a team player. He also talked about the Star winger’s individual achievements:</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was Europe’s top scorer in both the EPL and the Champions League with 42 goals in all, and his outstanding performance earned him the UEFA Club Player of the Year award and the PFA Award amongst other several awards.</p>
              <p>“That should be enough,” declared Bernd Schuster to conclude his argument that the 2007/08 season was fairly Ronaldo’s year.</p>
              <p>The Ballon d’Or will be handed out later this year in December and justice and honesty should help Cristiano Ronaldo possess what he deserves more than any other player on earth does.</p>
