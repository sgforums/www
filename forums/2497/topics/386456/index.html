              <p>Gary Megson has been sacked as manager of Bolton Wanderers with first team coach Steve Wigley and assistant manager Chris Evans taking over first-team duties with immediate effect.</p>
              <p>Megson saw his side throw away a two-goal lead against Hull on Tuesday and he was rounded-on by fans, who booed his decision to take off top-scorer Ivan Klasnic.</p>
              <p>A statement on the club's official website said: "Gary Megson has been relieved of his duties as First Team Manager of Bolton Wanderers Football Club with immediate effect.</p>
              <p>"The decision has been taken in the light of the position the club finds itself in the Barclays Premier League at the halfway point of the season.</p>
              <p>"Assistant Manager Chris Evans and First Team Coach Steve Wigley will take charge of first team matters for the interim period.</p>
              <p>"The Club wishes to place on record its thanks to Gary Megson for his hard work and commitment to Bolton Wanderers during his tenure as Manager.</p>
              <p>Megson had endured a strained relationship with the Bolton fans ever since he arrived at the Reebok in October 2007 to replace Sammy Lee.</p>
              <p>He steered the club away from relegation after an abysmal start to the campaign by Lee and achieved a mid-table finish last season. But with only eight victories under his belt in the past 12 months, fans had become increasingly frustrated, frequently venting their anger by booing Megson.</p>
              <p>Chairman Phil Gartside said in early December that points targets had been set for the festive schedule, and though the game against Wigan Athletic was postponed, it is believed that Wanderers failed to reach the mark.</p>
              <p>The Trotters currently lie 18th in the Premier League table, behind West Ham on goal difference, but they have two games in hand on the Hammers and have not lost in five games.</p>
              <p>Bolton have an FA Cup clash with Lincoln this weekend before away league clashes at Arsenal and Sunderland, a return home match against the Gunners, a visit of Burnley and a trip to Anfield to face Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Former Manchester City boss Mark Hughes and ex-Peterborough manager Darren Ferguson have emerged as the early favourites to take-up the vacancy.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">GARY MEGSON insists he leaves Bolton with his head held high and the club in good shape - despite their perilous position in the Premier League relegation zone.</h2>
              <p class="article">He knew it would be difficult right from the start.</p>
              <p class="article">A poll in the local paper showed just 1.7 per cent of Wanderers fans were in favour of his appointment back in October 2007.</p>
              <p class="article">They made their feelings known on the eve of his unveiling at a UEFA Cup tie against Braga and never really stopped venting their fury over the next 26 months.</p>
              <p class="article">The hate mob finally got their wish, Megson's departure, in the wake of Tuesday night's miserable 2-2 draw against relegation rivals Hull.</p>
              <p class="article">Anyone unfortunate enough to have witnessed the vicious abuse levelled at Megson during his Reebok tenure knew the situation could not be allowed to rumble on much longer.</p>
              <p class="article">The unrest had started to take its toll on the players and a run of just eight league victories in a calendar year makes it difficult for Megson to argue with the final verdict.</p>
              <p class="article">The team he leaves behind now faces a relegation scrap every bit as tough as the one the former West Brom chief guided them through two years ago.</p>
              <p class="article">Megson's assistant Chris Evans and coach Steve Wigley will take charge for the FA Cup tie against Lincoln on Saturday and probably next Wednesday's trip to Arsenal.</p>
