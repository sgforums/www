              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> <strong>10) What If Tim Howard Hadn’t Fumbled Against Porto In 2004?</strong><br><br>Manchester United
              were cruising into the quarter finals of the 2003/04 Champions League
              as they led Jose Mourinho’s Porto 1-0 in their second round second leg
              clash at Old Trafford.
              Then, in the last minute, goalkeeper Howard fumbled a harmless free
              kick and Costinha dispatched the rebound to send Porto through and
              Mourinho charging down the touchline. Porto would go on to win the
              Champions League.<br><br>Had Howard not erred, would Mourinho have been
              offered the Chelsea job at the end of that season? Would he be such a
              respected coach without a Champions League winners medal? Would
              Mourinho be able to argue against those who say he has only succeeded
              in his managerial career because he has been at rich clubs? Would
              Mourinho be the 'Special One'?<br><br><strong>9) What If England Had Appointed Felipe Scolari In 2006?</strong><br><br>Scolari
              had been England’s first choice to succeed Sven Goran Eriksson after
              the 2006 World Cup, but eventually rejected the FA who reluctantly
              appointed Steve McClaren. The former Manchester United assistant would have a disastrous 18-month spell that culminated in failure to qualify for Euro 2008?<br><br>
              </span></p><div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/24614_hp.jpg" alt=""><br></div>
              <br>Had Scolari accepted the job, would England have qualified for Austria and Switzerland? Would David Beckham
              have been ditched before being re-hitched? Would Scolari have tried the
              3-5-2 formation? Would he have erected that silly umbrella? Would Fabio Capello
              now be at the helm? Would there now be so many Italian coaches in the
              UK? Who would have replaced Avram Grant as Chelsea boss? Would Brian
              Barwick and the rest of the English FA be considered as anything other
              than incompetent? <br><br><strong>8) What If Argentina Had A Good Manager?</strong><br><br>In
              the 2002 World Cup, Argentina were loaded with top class players but
              were eliminated from the group stages due to the incompetence of their
              coach Marcelo Bielsa who, aside from blundering tactically, left out of
              the likes of Juan Roman Riquelme and Javier Saviola from his squad,
              preferring instead a 35-year-old Claudio Caniggia, 32-year-old Diego
              Simeone who hadn't played all season and Napoli nobody Claudio Husain.
              Not to mention the fact he started a 33-year-old past-it Gabriel
              Batistuta in every game.<br><br>Fast forward four years and Jose Pekerman left best right back in the world Javier Zanetti
              at home, as well as Walter Samuel. Despite this, Argentina blitzed
              their way through to the quarter finals and looked like the best team
              in the tournament. In the last eight they comfortably led Germany 1-0,
              until Pekerman thought it would be a good idea to substitute star man
              Riquelme with 18 minutes to go for target man Julio Cruz. Germany
              equalised to force extra time, Pekerman had used all his three subs
              (and left Lionel Messi on the bench), and the hosts would win on penalties.<br><br>What if Argentina had had a good manager in 2002 and 2006?<br><br><strong>7) What If Pavel Nedved Had Been Eligible In 2003 &amp; Fit In 2004?</strong><br><br>The Patrick Swayze lookalike was the world’s best player in 2003 and had dragged Juventus
              to the final of the Champions League almost single-handedly, but he
              cruelly missed the Manchester showpiece through suspension. Had he
              played, would Juve have beaten Milan?<br><br>A year later, Nedved had
              been the best player at Euro 2004, and the Czech Republic the best
              team. But in the semi final against Greece he limped off injured after
              40 minutes and the shock eventual winners would emerge victorious with
              a Golden Goal in extra time. Would the Czechs have gone on to win Euro
              2004 had Nedved stayed fit?<br><br><strong>6) What If Sir Alex Ferguson Had Retired In 2002?</strong><br><br>The
              legendary Scotsman had announced his decision to retire from management
              at the end of the 2001/02 season, but changed his mind before the
              campaign ended. More than seven years later and Fergie is still leading
              Manchester United to success.<br><br>
              <div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/48918_hp.jpg" alt=""><br></div>
              <br>If Ferguson had quit, would United still be the dominant force in English football? Would they have gone on to win four more Premier League
              titles and another Champions League? Who would now be manager of The
              Red Devils? Martin O’Neill? Would Ferguson’s successor have been
              capable to wrestle the power back from Chelsea in 2007? Would David Beckham still be playing at Old Trafford?<br><br><strong>5) What If Edgar Davids Hadn’t Joined Barcelona In 2004?</strong><br><br>In
              2003/04 Barcelona had a new president in Joan Laporta, a new coach in
              Frank Rijkaard, and a new star player in Ronaldinho. But the first half
              to the season was a complete disaster as the Blaugrana languished in
              12th place, way off the pace and with seemingly no chance of even
              getting into the Champions League places. Many directors and fans
              wanted Laporta out, while Rijkaard was on the brink of the sack. <br><br>Then, in January 2004, Edgar Davids arrived on loan from Juventus.
              The Dutchman was simply magnificent and the driving force behind a
              brilliant Barcelona recovery that saw them roar up the standings to
              finish the season in second place. Although Davids would not make his
              move permanent, he had saved his former Ajax colleague his job.
              Rijkaard and Barca would not look back as they would win consecutive La Liga
              crowns and the 2006 Champions League. Would Barca be the unstoppable
              team they are now had it not been for Davids? Would Rijkaard have been
              sacked? Would Laporta have been ousted? Would Ronaldinho have found his
              feet?<br><br><strong>4) What If The ‘Hand Of Henry’ Had Been Spotted?</strong><br><br>It
              was seen by virtually every person in the world, but what would have
              happened had referee Martin Hansson spotted Thierry Henry’s blatant
              handball prior to William Gallas’ decisive extra time goal that saw
              France oust Ireland in the 2010 World Cup playoffs?<br><br>
              <div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/61307_hp.jpg" alt=""><br></div>
              <br>Would
              the Irish now be booking their plane tickets to South Africa? Would
              Giovanni Trapattoni have been hailed as a hero in Ireland? Would we be
              talking about the greatest moment in Irish football history? Would Raymond Domenech
              still be in charge of France? Would Laurent Blanc now be in his place?
              Would Thierry Henry have retired from international football?!<br><br><strong>3) What If Zinedine Zidane’s Headbutt On Marco Materazzi Had Gone Unpunished?</strong><br><br>In
              the twentieth minute of extra time during the 2006 World Cup final
              between Italy and France, Zinedine Zidane performed his infamous
              headbutt on Azzurri defender Marco Materazzi. The referee Horacio
              Elizondo and his linesmen, despite halting play, appeared to miss the
              incident but Zidane was eventually red carded. It is rumoured to this
              day that Elizondo only sent Zidane off after the fourth official had
              watched a replay on the pitch-side television. But what would have
              happened had Zidane stayed on the field? <br><br>
              <div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/12630_hp.jpg" alt=""><br></div>
              <br>Would Italy have won
              the World Cup on penalties? Zidane would have been one of France’s
              penalty takers. Would Italy have declared war for the second World Cup
              running had they lost in such circumstances? Would Materazzi have been
              on the receiving end of such a worldwide hate campaign? Would the
              British tabloids have printed those defamatory remarks before being
              sued? Would Raymond Domenech have snubbed Serie A’s French stars at
              Euro 2008?<br><br><strong>2) What If Roman Abramovich Hadn’t Bought Chelsea?</strong><br><br>Chelsea
              were completely transformed in the summer of 2003 when Russian
              billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates and poured
              his fortune into the club. Had the 43-year-old not taken over, where
              would Chelsea be now?<br> <br> Would they still be waiting to win their first championship since 1955?
              Would the club have gone into administration due to the fact they were
              crippled by debt when Abramovich rescued them? Would Chelsea now be in
              the same situation as Leeds United? What if Abramovich had bought
              Tottenham Hotspur instead of Chelsea, as was first planned? Would Spurs
              now be a European supergiant? Had Abramovich not entered English
              football, would there be so many foreign owners in the Premier League?
              Would English teams have performed as well in the Champions League in
              recent years?<br><br><strong>1) What If There Had Been No Calciopoli Scandal?</strong><br><br>The
              implications of this are never-ending. Would Inter just be about to
              enter their twenty-first year since last winning the Scudetto? Would Juventus still be dominating Serie A with the third star on their shirts? Would Luciano Moggi still be the transfer guru of Calcio?<br><br>
              <div><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/51262_hp.jpg" alt=""><br></div>
              <br>Would
              the Italian league have performed much better in Europe these past few
              seasons? Would it be so crippled financially? Would it have such a bad
              image internationally? Would Kaka and Zlatan Ibrahimovic have left
              Italy, and would more big name stars such as Fernando Torres and Cristiano Ronaldo now be plying their trade in the Campionato? Would Marcello Lippi ever have left after Germany? Would Fabrizio Miccoli have been frozen out of the Azzurri set-up? Would Italy have won the 2006 World Cup?<p></p>

              <p>There are so many what ifs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What if maradona's hand goal was ruled for handball, would argentina still go on and won the world cup in 86?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what if fergie was sacked in 1990 if he did not win the fa cup that year? would united still go on and be successful as today?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what if kenny daglish continued and did not resigned in 1991, would he be as successful as he was in the late 80s?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if schmeical did not save that penalty from berkamp in the semi finals of the fa cup in 1999, would united still go on and won the treble?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what if united bought ronaldino in 2003 and did not buy ronaldo instead? will ronaldo be the player he is now if he didnt joined united?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if united signed shearer in 1996, would united still have won the treble in 99 if shearer was its striker then?</p>
