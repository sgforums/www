              <p><strong>Andrei Arshavin has given short shrift to reports that he could be
              seeking a shock return to Zenit St Petersburg just four short months
              since his highly-productive move to Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/arsenal/arshavin_clap.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Arshavin joined The Gunners from Zenit on February 2 in a club
              record £15 million move and immediately made a significant impact in
              North London, scoring six times in 12 league games and contributing
              seven assists.</strong></p>
              <p>The Russian international has quickly become a firm fans’ favourite
              at Emirates Stadium thanks to his beguiling style of play and
              expectation is high ahead of next season when the club will seek to end
              their four-year wait for a trophy.</p>
              <p>But Arshavin’s public reservations about the 50p tax rate in England
              had led to suggestions that the forward could seek refuge with his
              former club where he could earn considerably more than he does so at
              present.</p>
              <p>Arshavin has been training with Zenit in recent days but is adamant
              he is not even considering leaving Arsenal, telling Sport Express: “I
              do not consider it necessary to comment on [the rumours].</p>
              <p>“It is just not a topic for conversation.”</p>
              <p>"I spent a week in St. Petersburg training with my former club –
              Zenit," Arshavin explained. "Everybody was quite kind to me. I cannot
              say that I communicated a lot with anyone just a bit with everybody.</p>
              <p>"I hope that these trainings in my former club would be useful. In any case they were better than a week of doing nothing.</p>
              <p>"I don’t think that the attitude of people in St. Petersburg has
              changed when I left. As far as I can see they like me equally even
              though I am playing in a different team now.”</p>
              <p>Arshavin was also asked by Russian journalists which of his
              international colleagues he would recommend to Arsenal’s Premier League
              rivals, and touted goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev and Alexander Anyukov as
              potential Premier League stars.</p>
              <p>“Given that Van der Sar will not be around forever, Ferguson is most
              in need of a goalkeeper,” Arshavin added. “I therefore advise him to
              sign Akinfeev.</p>
              <p>“And Liverpool? Perhaps Anyukov.”</p>
