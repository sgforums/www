              <h1>Sir Alex Ferguson Is More Afraid Of Manchester City Than He Admits – Carlos Tevez</h1>
              <h2>'Carlitos' believes his city neighbours are well aware of the threat posed by the blue half of Manchester.</h2>
              <p>Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez
              has had another dig at his former employers by insisting that manager
              Sir Alex Ferguson will not admit how much he fears the Citizens.<br><br>The
              Sky Blues’ summer spending has created a formidable squad at Eastlands,
              a squad which the Argentine believes is spreading fear throughout the
              Premier League.<br><br>Speaking to the <em>Sunday People</em>, Tevez
              insisted that Ferguson calling City a “small time club” was dangerous
              and that the club would prove why on the pitch in the Manchester derby.<br><br>“That Ferguson criticises City is dangerous for him and his objectives this year,” explained the striker.<br><br>“Perhaps
              he is more afraid of us than he lets on and he is trying to break our
              concentration. The answer will come on the pitch in the first derby
              game in September.”<br><br>Tevez also insisted that he preferred Mark Hughes’ management style to Ferguson’s and that he was excited about the new season.<br><br>“Ferguson
              is history in my career. Mark Hughes just concentrates on working and
              training, not getting involved in the business of other club,” said the
              Argentine.<br><br>"Hughes is closer to the players than Ferguson and he talks some Spanish, which is good for me.<br><br>"He
              has been a player and you notice that in how he treats the players. My
              evaluation of him is positive and I'm excited about the season ahead."<br><br>The
              25-year-old also admitted he did not fear competition for places at
              City and said that he was convinced his new club could challenge for
              the title.<br><br>“We have a lot of strikers at City but that happens at Manchester United as well and at other clubs,” he added.<br><br>“It is a long season in England and there has to be room for everyone.<br><br>"We have started the season well but know that what counts is how the season ends - that is how we will be judged.<br><br>“There will be a lot of candidates for the title - and City are among them.”</p>
