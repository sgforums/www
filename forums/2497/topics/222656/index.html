            <div class='col-md body'>Real Madrid sports director Predrag Mijatovic is confident that the club's serious challenge for honours this season will convince David Beckham to stay on in Spain.<br><br>The former England captain has not won a major trophy with Real since moving from Manchester United in 2003, as the club suffered a downturn in fortunes.<br><br>"He hasn't had much luck in the last three years because when he arrived at Real he thought he was going to win many trophies," Mijatovic said in an interview with Serbian radio station B-92 and the BBC.<br><br>"Now the situation is different and I think he is conscious of this."<br>With a new team of president Ramon Calderon and coach Fabio Capello installed, Real are looking a much stronger proposition this season.<br><br>They are third in the Primera Liga, three points behind leaders Barcelona, and still in the Champions League and the King's Cup.<br><br>The main stumbling block to Beckham signing a contract extension is the fact that the 31-year-old has dropped out of favour with Capello. He has started only three out of 12 league games this season.<br><br>"As far as I am aware, Beckham is happy here in Madrid. At the moment he isn't in the starting line-up but that's not to say that the situation won't have changed in a couple of weeks' time," Mijatovic said.<br><br>The former Yugoslavia striker believed a decision on Beckham's future would be reached in another month and a half.<br><br>Beckham is out of contention at present with an inflamed cartilage in his left knee.<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/sp2_01.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its not that Beckham not wanting to leave, its just that he has no where else to go.<br><br>it hurts his ego to move to a smaller club that where he's been.  Actually there is not much other clubs comparable to RM and Man U in stature and reputation, except maybe, only Barca and Chelsea.<br><br>But both clubs won't want him....so with his ego hurt, he still have to hanker down at RM and sulk....<br><br>its sad to see one of the best deadball specialist in the trade to be languishing like this.  Maybe if he had learned from Giggs / Scholes, he's probably now still ruling the right midfield of Man U.</div>
