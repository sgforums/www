            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>THE wait until the January sales is almost over. </strong></span><br><br>Once the hectic Christmas schedule is completed, clubs can whip open their cheque books for new signings. Every side Â— whether challenging for the title or fighting relegation Â— will be considering buying players once the transfer window opens for business on January 1.<br><br>Teams will have a month to bring in what they believe is their missing link to success. Here we profile the six biggest stars expected to move on during January Â— and reveal where they may end up.<br><br><strong>Owen Hargreaves<br>Interested: Manchester United</strong><br><br>The England star is desperate to move from Bayern Munich to Manchester United. The Canadian-born midfielder wants to join the Premiership giants after almost a decade with the German outfit. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson bid for Hargreaves, 25, last summer but will have to pay upwards of Â£12million to prise him away. Sir Alex is hoping the midfielder Â— along with the loan signing of Swedish hitman Henrik Larsson Â— can fire his side's title hopes. But unlike Larsson, Hargreaves would be ineligible for the Champions League after playing against Spartak Moscow before breaking his leg. He is now on the verge of making his comeback from injury and Fergie is set to send scouts to watch him in Bundesliga action soon.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Nigel Reo-Coker<br>Interested: Manchester United, Arsenal, Everton</strong><br><br>West Ham's skipper is hoping Arsenal and Manchester United revive the interest they showed in him during the summer. The England Under-21 star wants out of Upton Park to join one of the Premiership's elite clubs. Reo-Coker has fallen out with Hammers fans this season after a series of under-par performances. The midfielder was booed up until his second-half winner against Manchester United earlier this month. But new boss Alan Curbishley is desperate to keep hold of his captain and will attempt to resist any Â£8million-plus bids.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Shaun Wright-Phillips<br>Interested: West Ham, Newcastle, Manchester City, Portsmouth</strong><br><br>The England winger badly needs a move away from Chelsea to revive his flagging career. Wright-Phillips hit the big time with his Â£21million transfer to Stamford Bridge from Manchester City in the summer of 2005. But the move has backfired as the 25-year-old has failed to nail down a place in Jose Mourinho's side. The lack of first-team action has also seriously dented his chances of becoming David Beckham's long-term successor on England's right flank. A loan move would suit Wright-Phillips initially but his future almost certainly lies away from the Premiership champions.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Ashley Young<br>Interested: Arsenal, Tottenham</strong><br><br>The Watford ace has been one of the shining lights in an otherwise difficult season for the Premiership strugglers. Young, 21, was the driving force behind the Hornets' successful promotion campaign last season and has carried that form into the top-flight. Starting the season in midfield, Young pulled the strings as Watford put the wind up big teams. And he has continued to impress after being pushed up front to replace long-term injury victim Marlon King. Arsene boss Arsene Wenger has expressed an interest in signing Young but Watford know he is crucial to their hopes of avoiding relegation.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Darren Bent<br>Interested: Tottenham, Liverpool</strong><br><br>Charlton's forlorn striker has a few things on his mind right now. Stuck in the relegation fight, beaten in the Carling Cup by Wycombe and struggling for a place in the England squad, Bent is understandably contemplating his future. He has scored 25 Premiership goals since joining from Ipswich 18 months ago for Â£2.5million. Yet he has looked far from happy recently and his form has suffered after being paired up front with moody Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Charlton fans accept Bent's future lies away from The Valley but hope he will see out their survival campaign.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Lucas Neill<br>Interested: Liverpool, Newcastle, Aston Villa</strong><br><br>The Blackburn defender could be the bargain of the January sales. Neill, 28, is out of contract next summer and wants to join a leading Premiership club. And he could cost as little as Â£500,000 as Rovers attempt to recoup a fee for the want-away Australian. Neill was the subject of a Â£2million bid from Liverpool last summer and Reds boss Rafa Benitez is ready to launch another bid. The Blackburn star would jump at the chance of signing for the 2005 Champions League winners.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bargains in the Championship</strong><br><br><strong>Matthew Upson</strong><br>The England defender is urging Birmingham to sell him in January. With his contract up in 18 months, Premiership clubs are ready to make Â£5million bids to land injury-plagued Upson. Liverpool, Aston Villa, Newcastle and West Ham are among the sides considering signing the ex-Arsenal man.<br><br><strong>Giles Barnes</strong><br>The teenager has taken the Championship by storm during Derby's battle for promotion. Barnes Â— rated at Â£3million Â— has excelled in the centre of the Rams' midfield as they push for a return to the Premiership. His form has alerted Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle to prepare bids in the New Year.<br><br><strong>Curtis Davies</strong><br>Despite pledging his future to West Brom, the giant central defender is set for a big-money move back to the Premiership. Already the club's skipper at 21, Davies has demonstrated remarkable maturity in his short career. This has not gone unnoticed at Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool over the past year Â— but he could cost up to Â£9million.<br><br><strong>Gareth Bale</strong><br>Southampton are still hurting from the sale of Theo Walcott 12 months ago. Left-back Bale is the latest player to roll off the club's academy conveyor belt Â— and has raised eyebrows with a series of brilliant free-kicks. But Saints fans fear Manchester United or Arsenal may make a golden offer to tempt the 17-year-old away.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>IAN WALKER has been allowed to leave Bolton on loan.</strong><br><br>The former England keeper can join a Championship club with Coventry and Crystal Palace leading the chase. Ex-Tottenham man Walker, 35, has made only two appearances this term after being unable to force his way past No 1 Jussi Jaaskelainen.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>PORTSMOUTH will launch a Â£6million move for Glen Johnson.</strong><br><br>The Chelsea right-back, 22, is on loan at Fratton Park Â— and Pompey boss Harry Redknapp wants to make the deal permanent. Chief executive Peter Storrie said: Â“We would love to keep Glen. We are certainly interested in signing him.Â”<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>MATTHEW UPSON has pleaded with the Birmingham board to flog him in January. </strong><br><br>The Blues defender recently returned from eight months out with an Achilles injury. But Upson, who has 18 months left on his current deal, rejected a new contract offer as he is desperate for a move back into the Premiership. The ex-Arsenal ace, 27, reckons his time is up after four years at Birmingham Â— even though the club are eight points clear at the top of the Championship. Upson, who has been linked with Newcastle, said: Â“Who knows if I will be in the Premiership before next season?<br><br>Â“Whatever bid comes in, it is up to the Birmingham board whether they take it. They are in control and I am contracted to them. Â“I havenÂ’t signed a new deal at the club and if they receive an offer in January, itÂ’s up to them. Â“I am sure everyone has their price. I shall be keeping my phone on.Â”<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>WIGAN have swooped to sign Swedish defender Andreas Granqvist.</strong><br><br>The Helsingborg centre-back, 21, will join the Latics on a six-month loan on Monday. Granqvist said: Â“ItÂ’s a dream for a Swedish player to be a part of the Premier League.Â”  Wigan skipper Arjan de Zeeuw is expected to return to the side to face Watford on Saturday. De Zeeuw was rested for the 3-1 defeat at Manchester United on Tuesday.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>DENNIS WISE is preparing a January clear-out after being told he must raise his own transfer funds at Leeds.</strong><br><br>Chairman Ken Bates has admitted there is no cash to spend in the transfer window so Elland Road boss Wise will have to flog up to four of his leading stars if he wants to bring in new blood. That means Leeds Â— who are second from bottom in the Championship Â— could be forced to cash in on defender Matthew Kilgallon and strikers Robbie Blake and David Healy.<br><br>Leeds rejected Sheffield UnitedÂ’s Â£3million summer bid for England Under-21 star Kilgallon, 22, but the Blades are still keen.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>WEST BROM have stepped up their interest in Rotherham striker Will Hoskins.</strong><br><br>Boss Tony Mowbray sent scouts to watch the Â£600,000-rated star during the MillersÂ’ 3-2 defeat against Oldham on Boxing Day. Hoskins, 20, is also being tracked by Celtic, Watford, Everton, Reading, Wolves, Ipswich and Nottingham Forest.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>NORWICH will demand Â£5million for 16-goal Robert Earnshaw in the transfer window. </strong><br><br>Portsmouth are set to offer Â£4m for the ChampionshipÂ’s top striker and struggling Canaries, although hoping to keep their biggest asset, will sell for the right price. Norwich paid West Brom an initial Â£2.7m for Earnie in January 2006 with the deal worth Â£3.5m depending on appearances.<br><br>And the Welshman, 25, despite playing in an average side, has hit 24 in 39 games Â— with his goals this term keeping Norwich away from the bottom of the table. Earnie said: Â“If clubs come in for me that shows IÂ’m doing well. But IÂ’m happy here, I want to go on to the end of the season.Â” New boss Peter Grant has one win in the last eight and could use Earnie revenue for rebuilding.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SAM ALLARDYCE has warned Chelsea to forget about nicking Tal Ben Haim on the cheap. </strong><br><br>The Israeli defender has been a target for Jose Mourinho before and he could renew his interest with John Terry out. Big Sam has admitted Ben Haim, 24, is unlikely to sign an extension to his contract, which expires in the summer, and will allow him to leave for Â£3million. Allardyce said: "He may spark a frenzied bidding war because he is a top talent.<br><br>"Although everybody thinks they can play games with us, they canÂ’t play games with me. "Unless we get what we believe he is worth, we may ultimately lose out. "You have to consider what we could lose through qualification for Europe by letting him go."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>MARTIN OÂ’NEILL is praying that he can hang on to loan keeper Gabor Kiraly. </strong><br><br>Crystal Palace decide today whether to recall the Hungarian because of their own injury crisis. And that would leave Aston Villa with no recognised senior stopper at Charlton tomorrow or for the visit of champions Chelsea next Tuesday. Manager OÂ’Neill has Thomas Sorensen and Stuart Taylor crocked, leaving him with only untried Austrian Robert Olejnik. Kiraly, who wants to quit Selhurst Park, has played three games for Villa, conceding six goals. He was given special dispensation to join Villa on a temporary basis. But PalaceÂ’s Julian Speroni has hurt a wrist and the Championship club have the right of immediate recall. That would leave Olejnik, 20, facing a baptism of fire over the next few days.<br><br>Meanwhile, defender Mark Delaney, 30, has suffered a new knee injury that could end his career. The Welsh international said: "IÂ’m coming to the end of my Villa contract so the timing could not have been worse."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>STEVE BRUCE has four million reasons to be cheerful as Birmingham see out 2006 tonight.</strong><br><br>The Championship table-toppers are eight points clear and can widen the gap with victory over Luton. Key to this success is the 13 goals scored by Â£4m ex-Coventry winger Gary McSheffrey, who Bruce refused to give up on signing in the summer. Boss Bruce insisted: "Gary was my No 1 target. HeÂ’s full of determination and heÂ’s a very good finisher."<br><br>Meanwhile, Bruce is ready to cut his losses on Â£5.5m midfielder David Dunn, 27, who could return to Blackburn for around Â£2m. He said: "We canÂ’t get the boy fit."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>GARETH SOUTHGATE has told Fabio Rochemback to forget a return to Portugal.</strong><br><br>MiddlesbroughÂ’s Brazilian midfielder, 25, has been linked with a move back to Sporting Lisbon. His representatives claim he wants to leave but Boro boss Southgate expects him to play a part at Blackburn tomorrow. He said: "There have been inquiries but nothing concrete. We are not looking to move Fabio on. "HeÂ’s been out of the side recently but has the talent to get back in."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>ANDERSON DE SILVA could be dumped by Everton Â— without playing a Premiership game.</strong><br><br>The Brazilian midfielder, 24, agreed a move 16 months ago but went on loan to Malaga as he did not have an EU passport. Toffees boss David Moyes said: "As a team we have moved on."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>TOTTENHAM and Newcastle are leading the race for DerbyÂ’s Â£3million-rated whizkid Giles Barnes, writes DAVE KIDD. </strong><br><br>Toon boss Glenn Roeder has been an admirer ever since the midfielder, 18, tore apart his academy side two years ago. Spurs chief Martin Jol is also keen on the talented youngster, who can also play on either wing. And the Dutchman may be willing to loan Barnes back to the promotion-chasing Rams for the rest of the season Â— in a deal similar to the one which took Tom Huddlestone from Pride Park to White Hart Lane two years ago.<br><br>Barnes is being regularly watched by top-flight scouts, including Chelsea. And Derby boss Billy Davies admits he will not stand in the playerÂ’s way if the price is right.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Barton may exploit exit clause</strong><br><br><img src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2006/12/29/JoeyBarton2.jpg"><br><br>Joey Barton's Manchester City future is in doubt and there are suggestions that a number of Premiership clubs are considering exploiting a get-out clause in the midfielder's contract which would allow him to leave for Â£5.5m.<br><br>The 24-year-old, who begins a three-match suspension this afternoon following his sending off for serious foul play against Bolton Wanderers last week, submitted a transfer request last January as he sought a move to a club playing in the Champions League only to remain at City and sign a new contract at the beginning of this season which virtually doubled his salary to Â£25,000-a-week. However, that deal included a get-out clause negotiated by his agent Willie McKay.<br><br>There were strong suggestions yesterday that Newcastle are most keen to sign Barton with the Turkish international Emre expected to leave Tyneside but while Glenn Roeder is a known admirer of the midfielder, it would be a surprise if he moved to St James' Park. Middlesbrough attempted to sign the player almost a year ago while Everton - the club Barton supported as a boy - have made it clear they are in the market to secure a midfielder. However, they are understood to be wary of the salary Barton would demand to move to Goodison Park.<br><br>Aston's Villa striker Chris Sutton will be out of action until mid-February because of blurred vision and concussion. Sutton suffered the setback during the early stages of last week's game with Manchester United and was substituted during the second half. The 33-year-old then missed the defeat at Spurs and has been advised by a neurosurgeon to rest for six weeks.<br><br></div>

The 27-year-old, who is out of contract in 18 months, has already been linked to Chelsea, Liverpool and Newcastle.<br><br>Upson's agent Barry Neville said: "Matt has made it quite clear that he sees his future elsewhere." Blues boss Steve Bruce is reluctant to release Upson and said it would take "one hell of an offer" to let him go.<br><br>Birmingham are six points clear at the top of the Championship and Bruce sees Upson as integral to their push for promotion back to the Premiership. "I have said to Matt if we are promoted, that we would want to build our team around him," said Bruce. "Hopefully by the summer we can be in the Premier League and can make Matt an offer he can't refuse.<br><br>"We've got to be strong enough when the transfer window opens. "Where can I go and get a left-sided England centre-back who is 27 of his quality? I don't think I can."<br><br>Upson has refused to sign a new five-year deal at Birmingham and has already stated it would be in the club's best interests if they maximised his transfer fee by selling him, "the sooner, the better".<br><br>The England international is rated at Â£7m and was linked with a move to Liverpool before he ruptured an Achilles tendon in April. He has now returned to fitness after a lengthy lay-off with pelvic and Achilles problems.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Chelsea eye defenders as transfer window swings open</strong></span><br><br>Premier League chairmen can expect an early morning phone call on Monday from managers reeling off their list of transfer window targets. Sunday's newspapers were full of rumour and speculation and as a frenetic holiday period concludes with a fourth match in 10 days, many squads are creaking under the strain.<br><br>Chelsea are expected to lead the spending to plug a leaky defence that is in danger of scuppering their bid for a hat-trick of titles. Defenders are the obvious priority for Jose Mourinho and among the players linked with a move to Stamford Bridge are Portsmouth's Sol Campbell, Birmingham's Matthew Upson and Manchester City teenager Micah Richards.<br><br>United boss Alex Ferguson knows his side's lead could evaporate with key injuries and could bolster his squad by bringing in Bayern Munich's Owen Hargreaves.<br><br>Liverpool are said to be close to signing Blackburn Rovers defender Lucas Neill with striker Peter Crouch, frustrated by his limited opportunities at Anfield, possibly heading to injury-hit Newcastle United.<br><br>Although the window swings open on Monday, past seasons suggest that managers will not rush in.<br><br><strong>COMPLICATED CHAINS</strong><br><br>Like in the English housing market, deals can involve complicated chains with one club only willing to sell if the player they have targeted becomes available. Seemingly 'done deals' often fall through at the last moment. Often the busiest managers are those involved in the battle for survival. Last year, Portsmouth's Harry Redknapp virtually rebuilt his side in January and the gamble paid off as Pompey dragged themselves out of the mire to stay up.<br><br>West Ham United's new owner Eggert Magnusson says funds are available and manager Alan Curbishley could be a busy man in the next few weeks as he tries to haul the Hammers away from the relegation zone.<br><br>Chelsea misfit Shaun Wright Phillips is a top priority for Curbishley, although his former club Manchester City are also keen to take him back. Curbishley could also go for Charlton Athletic striker Darren Bent but Alan Pardew would fight any such move, having just taken over at the relegation battlers after being fired by Magnusson at West Ham.<br><br>Middlesbrough, just outside the bottom three, have problems at both ends and Manchester City's defender Sylvain Distin is a reported target for manager Gareth Southgate. The cream of young English talent from the lower leagues also comes under scrutiny at this time of year with managers in the second division probably reluctant to answer the phone.<br><br>Southampton boss George Burley can expect several offers for 17-year-old defender Gareth Bale, while Derby County's midfielder Giles Barnes and Southend United striker Freddy Eastwood will both be in demand.<br><br>Preston North End's David Nugent may also get the chance to demonstrate his goalscoring talents at the top level, with Portsmouth and Sheffield United reported to be in the queue for his signature.<br><br>Â© Reuters 2007.<br></div>
