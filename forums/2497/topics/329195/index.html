              <p class="ss-text-bold">Manchester City have lodged bids for Valencia's David Villa and Stuttgart's Mario Gomez.</p>
              <p>The Blues have already seen an offer of over
              £30million accepted for Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov, but have
              made approaches for a further two attacking talents.</p>
              <p>With
              Berbatov also believed to be in discussions with Manchester United, and
              Real Madrid thought to have entered the race for the Bulgarian, City
              are keen to keep their options open.</p>
              <p>Los Che star Villa, who won
              the Golden Boot at Euro 2008 this summer, has been the centre of
              transfer speculation all summer, but had appeared to have accepted that
              his future lay in Spain.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Gomez shot to prominence
              after scoring 28 goals for Stuttgart last season, immediately
              signalling him out as one of Europe's hottest properties.</p>
              <h4>Serious</h4>
              <p>Money would not appear to be a problem for City following Abu Dhabi United Group's takeover of the club on Monday.</p>
              <p>Head
              of that consortium, Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, confirmed that the ambitious
              Premier League outfit continue to chase a number of potential targets
              prior to the closure of the transfer window at midnight on Monday.</p>
              <p>"I am hopeful about Berbatov, but I need to speak to our colleagues in England to see what the latest is," he said.</p>
              <p>"We
              have bids in for three players. There is Berbatov, but there is also
              David Villa and Mario Gomez. We have bids in for Villa and Gomez and I
              am waiting to hear whether we have been successful with those.</p>
              <p>"Funds are available, and transfers such as these show we are serious."</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester City may have pulled off the coups to end all coups by
              bringing Robinho to the North West on deadline day, but it seems that
              the newfound moneybags missed out on Feyenoord’s Jonathan de Guzman. </strong></p>
              <p>City appeared to have bids on the table for most of Europe following
              the shock news of their takeover on Monday, with the likes of David
              Villa and Mario Gomez amongst those on their ambitious hitlist.</p>
              <p>However, it has been reported in the Dutch press that attempts to sign Holland international de Guzman fell on deaf ears.</p>
              <p>Reports in Holland suggest that Mark Hughes pinpointed the
              20-year-old as a target before Abu Dhabi United Group rode into
              Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Feyenoord are thought to have dismissed the offer in the belief that
              a higher bid would arrive before the closure of the transfer window.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">REAL MADRID have blasted Robinho over his shock move to Manchester City.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Brazilian ace sensationally joined Mark Hughes’ revolution last night in a blockbuster £33million deal.</p>
              <p class="article">Robinho was linked with a move away from Real all summer and was on the brink of joining Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">But City’s deadline day offer saw them gazump the Londoners and sign one of football’s hottest properties.</p>
              <p class="article">Last weekend, Real president Ramon Calderon claimed the forward would be staying in Spain but yesterday’s shock developments have left them fuming.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Robinho had a problem with his frame of mind that was more important than we thought it was.</p>
              <p class="article">"I spoke with him several times. When he talked about his situation he cried and asked to leave Spain.</p>
              <p class="article">"His departure from Madrid is not only for sporting reasons, there's something more which I can't understand.</p>
              <p class="article">"It is not the objective of Madrid to sell players. We have to defend the interests of the club.</p>
              <p class="article">"The reasons in this case were human kindness and sporting. The lad was feeling very bad."</p>
              <p class="article">Real boss Bernd Schuster was desperate for Robinho to stay but Calderon says the German will cope with his exit.</p>
              <p class="article">Calderon added: “ "I spoke with Schuster and he has a very positive attitude. He took the sale of Robinho well.</p>

              <p><strong>Abramovich's executives may talk of balancing the books, but the owner does not behave as if that is a remote concern. He bought Andriy Shevchenko from AC Milan for £30million and when that did not work out, loaned him back to the same club and would appear to be ready to write off the transaction as an expensive mistake. The only reason Chelsea's bidding for Robinho stopped at less than Manchester City's is because Abramovich no doubt realised he was going against a tycoon who had even more millions to burn than him and respectfully withdrew. Whatever he offered, City were always going to top it.</strong></p>
              <p>Like Abramovich, Sheikh Mansour is not in it for profit. He loves sport, yes, but perhaps also sees City as the way to promote the emirate of Abu Dhabi, with Premier League ownership as a prestigious accessory, the way that the Godolphin stable owned by Sheikh Mohammed introduced the entrepreneurial strengths of Dubai to the world. At a time of political uncertainty, maybe this is also seen as an opportunity to present the Arab nations in a positive light around the world.</p>
              <p>At Chelsea, the dynamic is different. The more that is understood of Vladimir Putin's Russia, the more the political energy behind Russian investment in sport can be recognised, too. These owners and their clubs are no longer operating within the same boundaries as Premier League rivals who value a conservative balance sheet. It is different for Wigan Athletic or Bolton Wanderers. No one expected them to get through the door to this ludicrously fancy establishment anyway; it is an achievement just to be a member.</p>
              <p>What has been changed by the Manchester City takeover is that the most thankless job in football now is to be in charge of a club who believe that they should be big. Newcastle, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa; where do these clubs go if joining the elite requires a key to the exclusive platinum room at the billionaires' spa, the one that their gold membership card does not quite cover?</p>
