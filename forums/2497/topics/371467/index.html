              <p>Liverpool were unable to round off their pre-season campaign with a win as Atletico Madrid secured a 2-1 victory at Anfield.
              </p>
              <p class="med"> First half strikes from Kun Aguero and Diego Forlan fired the Spaniards into a two goal lead before the break. 
              <br> 
              <br>Lucas Leiva pulled a late goal back for the Reds but it wasn't to be with Rafa Benitez's side unable to find a leveller. 
              <br> 
              <br>Liverpool displayed a positive intent in the opening exchanges and
              Atletico goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo was forced to claw a dangerous Dirk
              Kuyt to safety, with Fernando Torres lurking. <br> 
              <br>At the other end, Kun Aguero's turn and shot was tipped over the
              bar by Pepe Reina, but the Argentinean front man's effort would not
              have counted anyway as he was flagged for offside. <br> 
              <br>He did find the net seconds later as he ghosted into the six yard
              box to head Antonio Lopez's cross into the Kop end net from close-range
              on 15 minutes. <br> 
              <br>The Reds were down to ten men at this point as Jamie Carragher
              underwent treatment on a knock at the side of the pitch. The
              centre-back was deemed unable to return to the action and was replaced
              by Mikel San Jose. <br> 
              <br>The home side were unfortunate not to draw level on 21 minutes when
              Javier Mascherano's pass forward was deflected into the path of Torres.
              The No.9 bore down on goal, but Asenjo smothered his attempt at close
              quarters. <br> 
              <br>With the ball only half cleared, the home team worked it back into
              the area and Torres had a strong penalty appeal waved away by referee
              Phil Dowd after he appeared to be hauled down inside the box by Paulo
              Assuncao. <br> 
              <br>Then, Steven Gerrard clipped a first-time strike into the side netting after good work by Glen Johnson. 
              <br> 
              <br>But, as Atletico broke from a Liverpool corner, Aguero came close
              to doubling the visitors' advantage just shy of the half hour mark when
              he skipped beyond San Jose and burst into the area, only to be thwarted
              by Reina. <br> 
              <br>The action quickly swung to the other end and Lopez diverted
              Emiliano Insua's dangerous centre behind for a corner with Gerrard
              ready to pull the trigger. <br> 
              <br>It proved a key intervention for the La Liga outfit as Atletico doubled their lead with a fine goal on 33 minutes.  
              <br> 
              <br>A break forward saw Simao back heel the ball into the path of Diego
              Forlan on the edge of the box and the Uruguayan forward beat Reina with
              a sumptuous first time curling shot into the top corner. <br> 
              <br>He may have played for Manchester United in his past, but the
              Anfield faithful were quick to recognise the quality of the strike as
              they burst into applause. <br> 
              <br>Liverpool's response was almost instant and Gerrard sent Torres
              through on goal. El Nino's shot beat Asenjo, but not the post as the
              ball cannoned back off the woodwork and to safety for his former club. <br> 
              <br>Kuyt flashed a header over on the stroke of half-time as Atletico went into the break holding the lead. 
              <br> 
              <br>Moments after the restart, Lucas nodded across the face of goal
              from Benayoun's corner before Torres' aerial effort was plucked out of
              the air by Asenjo. <br> 
              <br>Liverpool went closer still on 54 minutes when Gerrard turned Torres' cross inches the wrong side of the post on the stretch. 
              <br> 
              <br>Simao dragged wide after Forlan attempted to return the favour for
              his goal with a back heel of his own as Atletico threatened for the
              first time after the break on the hour, moments prior to Reina
              producing a routine stop from Aguero. <br> 
              <br>Torres was denied a wonder goal on 67 minutes when the 25-year-old
              weaved his way past three defenders but was unable to drag the ball
              past Asenjo to cap a magical run. <br> 
              <br>The striker was dangerous throughout and a downward header from
              Emiliano Insua's cross produced another stop from the Atleti custodian.
              <br> 
              <br>Reina then blocked Forlan's angled drive, with the visitors
              introducing Anfield old boy Florent Sinama-Pongolle into the action
              with 15 minutes left on the clock to a warm reception from the Kop. <br> 
              <br>With time ebbing away, only some spectacular last ditch defending
              from Juanito prevented Benayoun from getting a clear strike on goal at
              point-blank range. <br> 
              <br>Liverpool did pull a goal back with eight minutes remaining when
              Gerrard's precise through ball picked out Lucas in the area and the
              Brazilian retained his composure to dispatch a low effort into the
              bottom corner. <br> 
              <br>Spurred on by the fans, the home team poured forward in search of
              an equaliser and substitute David Ngog was unable to get a clear shot
              away in the midst of another penalty area scramble. <br> 
              <br>Ayala headed wide from a corner in stoppage-time and Liverpool will
              hope for better fortune when the new Barclays Premier League campaign
              gets underway at Tottenham Hotspur next week.

              <h2>BENITEZ REVEALS TURNER INTEREST</h2>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez has held talks with Hull boss Phil Brown over the possible transfer of defender Michael Turner to Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>The Anfield chief has a number of injury worries in defence, which were compounded on Saturday when Jamie Carragher limped off early in the first half of the friendly with Atletico Madrid nursing an ankle problem.</p>
              <p>Benitez is increasingly short of defenders, having seen Sami Hyypia and Alvaro Arbeloa leave the club this summer.</p>
              <p>The problem has been made even more pressing with both Daniel Agger (back) and Martin Skrtel (hamstring) doubtful for the season's opening league game at Spurs next weekend.</p>
              <p>Benitez has been linked with a bid for Turner, as well as Portsmouth's Sylvain Distin.</p>
              <p>And the Spaniard said after the 2-1 defeat by Atletico Madrid at Anfield: "I was talking with (Hull manager) Phil Brown, but I will not talk about figures. But maybe I was just talking to Phil about the weather."</p>
              <p>Benitez is believed to have offered £6million for Turner, with Hull demanding closer to £12million.</p>
              <p>On Liverpool's injury problems, which also saw Fernando Torres limp off at the end with an ankle injury, Benitez said: "Carragher twisted his ankle, and because we have problems with injuries to our centre-backs, we decided to take him off as a precaution.</p>
              <p>"We will have to wait to see how the injured players improve, but I feel they will be ready for our next game.</p>
              <p>"We have two options. One is to bring in someone at the back and the other option is to keep working with the young players we have.</p>
              <p>"We have three centre-backs to get fit and will need one more as a fourth. We have to decide what to do, but the one solution we can achieve is to work with the youngsters.</p>
              <p>"Some youngsters need the opportunity to impress, we will see how they go.</p>
              <p>"Jamie will come in tomorrow for treatment at Melwood, and we will assess the situation then. "For a twisted ankle you need two or three days to see how the injury settles down. I do not believe he will need a scan.</p>
              <p>"Fernando Torres also came off with an slight injury on his ankle, but he also came off as a precaution because this was only a friendly."</p>

              <td class="med" colspan="2" width="487" valign="top">
              <p> The Reds midfielder capped another fine display with a late strike in
              front of the Kop and, although it wasn't enough to earn a share of the
              spoils, the boss was keen to praise the 22-year-old. <br> 
              <br>"I said in my pre-match notes that Lucas has been best player in
              pre-season," he said. "He showed why again today. He is really focused,
              working hard and is showing quality. <br> 
              <br>"He knows Aquilani will need time. When we decided to bring in
              Aquilani we knew he would be out for one month or so, so we analysed
              the squad and we think that with Mascherano, Lucas, Gerrard and Plessis
              we have enough." <br> 
              <br>First-half goals from Kun Aguero and Diego Forlan saw the Reds end
              pre-season with a home defeat and Benitez admitted it was a tough 90
              minutes for his men. <br> 
              <br>"It was a difficult game," he said. "We conceded one when we were
              playing with 10 players and Mascherano was at centre back. It was
              really disappointing and after this we were a little bit nervous. We
              were playing against a good team and we had our chances but couldn't
              take them. <br> 
              <br>"They had spells when they were in control because they have
              players with quality who can keep the ball and pass it well. It wasn't
              easy for the young players to play against four offensive players with
              such quality. <br> 
              <br>"But we showed a good reaction in the second half and we were pushing - there were positives and negatives. 
              <br> 
              <br>"The game was important. We wanted to impress our fans but credit
              to Atletico, they are a good team. We haven't seen all the things we
              wanted but at least we can analyse the team and start working on things
              if we need to change something."</p>
