But I cannot do anything about it."<br><br>Third-choice Hilario, who came on for Cech after an hour against Blackburn following a collision with Roque Santa Cruz in the 48th minute, is currently Chelsea's only fully-fit keeper.<br><br>"I wanted to take him (Cech) off, but he told me he wanted five minutes more to see if the injury would improve," Grant explained.<br><br>Portuguese keeper Hilario came on for his first appearance since 13 January and kept a clean sheet as Chelsea won 1-0 through Joe Cole's first-half goal.<br><br>The result means Chelsea remain third at Christmas, six points behind leaders Arsenal and five behind second-placed Manchester United.<br><br>"It was difficult for Hilario to come into a game like this, but he did very well, and in the end he made a very good save," Grant added.<br><br></div>
