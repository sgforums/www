Ferguson saw evidence of that after watching Larsson come on and dramatically change the course of last seasonÂ’s Champions League final for Barcelona against Arsenal.<br><br>Now he has told the former Celtic hero, 35, he wants him to do the same for United at home and in Europe. Ferguson said: Â“This is a terrific boost for us. He has a great pedigree and great character.<br><br>Â“He is someone who can change games for us. You saw how he did it in for Barcelona against Arsenal Â— and I think he can do the same for us.Â”<br><br>Fergie talked to Larsson this week about that European glory night in Paris when he came on and put Barca on the front foot as they came from behind to win 2-1.<br><br>Larsson added: Â“I am not going there just to be sitting on the bench. I want to play.Â” He spent the last two seasons with Barcelona before apparently going into semi-retirement. Then came the Ferguson call from totally out of the blue. Larsson said: Â“He called me up on Thursday and he said welcome to Man United.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m just pleased IÂ’m going to get a chance to play for such a great club now. IÂ’m thrilled.<br></div>

"I feel quite humbled that such a huge club and great manager are interested in what I can do.<br><br>Fergie (left) revealed his delight at signing Larsson, whose Â£20,000-a-week wages at Helsingborg will be trebled at United.<br><br>"Getting Henrik is fantastic because he's a proven goalscorer and he's got great experience," said Fergie. "He's 35, but look at what Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer are doing at the moment.<br><br>"In last season's European Cup Final Henrik changed the game for Barcelona and won it for them, as Ole did for us when we won it in 1999."<br><br>STRIKER Giuseppe Rossi will return to United in the New Year following his loan at Newcastle.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sir Alex Ferguson has defended his decision to sign 35-year-old Henrik Larsson on loan and says Manchester United plan more transfer activity in January.<br>Ferguson, who also revealed he will be recalling 19-year-old Giuseppe Rossi from his loan spell at Newcastle at the beginning of next month, says Larsson could have the same impact at Old Trafford as Teddy Sheringham.<br><br>'Some players look after themselves very well, so their age confuses you in terms of what you see on the football field,' said Ferguson. 'I let Teddy go five years ago when he got an offer from Tottenham which I told him he'd be stupid to turn down. He has played for two other clubs since then, which is amazing.'<br><br>Having decided against pursuing more striking options following his deal for Larsson, Ferguson confirmed he is now looking to strengthen his midfield, with another bid for injured Bayern Munich star Owen Hargreaves still possible.<br>'We're not sitting on our backsides,' Ferguson said of United's general transfer situation. 'There could be another development yet. But I don't want to comment on the Hargreaves situation. I don't want to upset those poor Germans. They're very fragile.'<br><br></div>
