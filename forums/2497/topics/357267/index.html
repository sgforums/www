              <h1>MLS rake in Beckham loan-deal fee</h1>
              <p class="first"><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45695000/jpg/_45695972_beckham.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="170"></p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Major League Soccer (MLS) will receive Â£6.8m as
                  part of the agreement to extend David Beckham's loan to AC Milan until
                  the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>Beckham is with Milan on a timeshare deal, but will rejoin the Los Angeles Galaxy on 1 July until Christmas.</p>
              <p>"We asked for $10 million, we got our $10 million," said MLS
                  commissioner Don Garber. "We don't know where it (the money) is coming
                  from.</p>
              <p>"He can't get paid from Milan. Milan could pay us. He could pay them."</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>In the US players are contracted with the league rather than individual teams.</p>
              <p>Milan want the 33-year-old Beckham, who has the right to terminate
                  his Galaxy contract after the 2009 season, back at the Serie A club in
                  January 2010.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if he's going to leave after this season whether we would want him back," added Garber.</p>
              <p>The former Manchester United and Real Madrid player is believed to have part-funded his move to Milan himself.</p>
              <p>Since returning to Europe, Beckham has moved back into contention as
                  a major player for England, who are coached by former Milan coach Fabio
                  Capello.</p>

              <h1>Redknapp interested in Becks deal</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp
              would be interested in signing David Beckham if the midfielder became
              available ahead of next year's World Cup.</span></strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/03/330/David-Beckham-edited3_1938878.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Beckham will play with AC
              Milan up to the end of the Serie A season before returning to Los
              Angeles Galaxy until the MLS campaign is over - but the 33-year-old may
              then need another loan spell to keep match-fit in preparation for South
              Africa in just over a year.</p>
              <p>Milan are keen to take him back and Spurs, despite Redknapp
              insisting Beckham is not in his immediate thoughts, could also be an
              option.</p>
              <p>"I have not thought about David Beckham, but it would be
              disrespectful of me to say I would not be interested in him, were he to
              become available," Redknapp said in the Evening Standard.</p>
              <p>"David Beckham is a fantastic player, but he is also a terrific
              role model and a terrific professional. If the opportunity was there to
              sign him, any club would have to think about it.</p>
              <p>"He would still be a terrific player. His delivery of the ball
              remains exceptional, he is a great trainer and he is a local boy from
              up the road."</p>
              <p>Beckham will want regular football next season right up to the
              World Cup now he has won his England place back and is firmly in Fabio
              Capello's plans.</p>
              <p>The Spurs boss added: "I think he will be part of the squad,
              for sure." Redknapp feels Beckham would also help raise standards of
              any club he goes to.</p>
              <p>"Imagine what the young players at the club could get from someone like that," Redknapp added.</p>
              <p>"When I signed Teddy Sheringham for Portsmouth in 2003, he was worth his weight in gold.</p>
              <p>"He was such a great professional that the other players all
              looked up to him in training. He did everything right, he was superb
              around the place, and that is what it is about.</p>
              <p>"I have met him only once or twice, but he seems a great lad.
              To have someone like Beckham at your club...if the opportunity came and
              someone said he was available, any club would have to think about it."</p>
