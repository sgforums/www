              <p><strong>According to <em><span style="color: #333332;">The Daily Mail</span></em>, Roberto Mancini has opened the door on the possibility of succeeding the under-fire </strong><a href="http://goal.com/en-gb/people/spain/9478/rafael-ben%C3%ADtez"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Rafael Benitez</strong></span></a><strong> as </strong><a href="http://goal.com/en-gb/teams/england/98/liverpool"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> manager.</strong><br><br>The in-demand Italian recently settled his £5.5 million-per-year contract with Serie A giants Inter Milan, having parted ways with the San Siro club in May 2008.<br><br>Thus, with the Nerazzurri no longer obliged to feed his bank account, it is believed that Mancini is finally ready to re-enter the world of football management.<br><br>The former Bologna, Sampdoria, Lazio and Leicester City forward has been sought out by clubs from all over Europe in the past 18 months, the most noteworthy being Real Madrid.<br><br>But now it appears there could be interest from Merseyside as well, with the Reds struggling to find any sort of consistency in a season that has seen them lose five of their 11 Premier League game so far.<br><br>Benitez, meanwhile, has also been touted for the post at the Santiago Bernabeu, although Galacticos president Florentino Perez recently came out in support of Manuel Pellegrini</p>

              <p><br>if u counted the serie A title he won when juventus was found cheating and eventually handed over the title to inter who was runner up.</p>
              <p>Mourinho is going to win the title this year again. He won on his first season with inter. He practically changed the squad of inter cos inter cant win anything more than serie A with mancini's players. mourinho can breeze thru serie A without any difficulty. But in EPL, he faced stiff challenge from man utd and liverpool (he never won against rb liverpool except once if i remember). EPL is a tougher league to be honest.</p>
              <p>at least rb won champions league and reached the finals of champions league. He attained 87 points with liverpool last season. I dun think mancini, who cant even reach the semi-finals of champs league with his inter win the title in epl. RB is better than him obviously.<br>I didnt say -  "Guus Hiddink's Chelsea and Fergie's United lost to Barce too, but it doesn't mean they are lousier managers compare to Guardiola."</p>
              <p>Then you guys mean "I believed he won 3 league titles and the equivalent of 2 FA cups (Coppa Italia) and 2 Carling cups (Supercoppa Italiana) all in the short space of 4 years..." he is a better manager?</p>
              <p>i believed if he were to encounter trapattoni's juventus years ago, mancini's inter would pee in their pants.</p>
              <p>i hope that he would not be another scolari, who have won world cup! lol</p>

              <p><br>if u counted the serie A title he won when juventus was found cheating and eventually handed over the title to inter who was runner up.</p>
              <p>Mourinho is going to win the title this year again. He won on his first season with inter. He practically changed the squad of inter cos inter cant win anything more than serie A with mancini's players. mourinho can breeze thru serie A without any difficulty. But in EPL, he faced stiff challenge from man utd. EPL is a tougher league to be honest.</p>
              <p>at least rb won champions league and reached the finals of champions league. He attained 87 points with liverpool last season. I dun think mancini, who cant even reach the semi-finals of champs league with his inter win the title in epl. RB is better than him obviously.<br>I didnt say -  "Guus Hiddink's Chelsea and Fergie's United lost to Barce too, but it doesn't mean they are lousier managers compare to Guardiola."</p>
              <p>Then you guys mean "I believed he won 3 league titles and the equivalent of 2 FA cups (Coppa Italia) and 2 Carling cups (Supercoppa Italiana) all in the short space of 4 years..." he is a better manager?</p>
              <p>i believed if he were to encounter trapattoni's juventus years ago, mancini's inter would pee in their pants.</p>
              <p>i hope that he would not be another scolari, who have won world cup! lol</p>

              <p>Obviously if someone was found cheating, then the next highest club who played fair and top the table without cheating, deserved the honours without a doubt right... Cos if that team didn't cheat in the first place, then they wouldn't be top would they?</p>
              <p>Whether Jose manage to win the league this year is another thing... But Inter didn't even stand a chance of winning the league title over the last 15 yrs until Mancini took over... And that is something quite impressive... He kind of brought Inter back among the top side in Italy...</p>
              <p>And you are correct that Jose changed a number of inter players with the owner spending like never before hoping to win the CL but unfortunately, most of his big money signings turn out to be big flops as well like... Brazilian player Mancini, <span class="fn"><span style="color: #000000;">Ricardo Quaresma and </span></span><span class="fn">Sulley Muntari... And Jose's Inter didn't fare any better either in the CL going out at the same stage the Q-finals.</span></p>
              <p><span class="fn">Instead he relied on Roberto Mancini's players like... </span><span class="fn">Maicon, Julio Cesar, Cambiasso, Javier Zanetti, Materazzi, Cristian Chivu, Mario Balotelli and Zlatan Ibrahimovic to do the job for him... So are you still sure he practically changed the inter squad? </span></p>
              <p><span class="fn">So I<span class="fn">nter cant win anything more than the serie A with mancini's players?  Well, that practically what Jose won last season only... </span></span><span class="fn">At least Mancini also won the Cup and Shield during the same season...</span></p>
              <p><span class="fn">And on management areas, i don't think it really matters where you come from or the league you play in... If you are good enough, you can make it anywhere... You see who is currently leading the EPL? Its a manager from the Italian league and he just came over less than 6 months only... And the current Chelsea team is playing totally different to their old self... Now they are more interesting to watch and no more the boring boring team they were once called... But Pool are and will still be stuck with that tag under Rafa...</span></p>
              <p>Yes you didn't say the Guus Hiddink and Fergie stuff, but didn't you said "mancini led inter and lost to RB's liverpool over two legs last season in cmps league. How can this guy be better?"  So they are the same isn't it? Just because Rafa's team got lucky and won Mancini's then he is inferior to Rafa? I don't think we should look at it this way...</p>
              <p>On your second last statement... I really don't know what to say to it...lol... I guess its just an opinion and an assumption at best.</p>
