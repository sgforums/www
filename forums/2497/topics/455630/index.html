              <p><span>Arsenal are holding out for at least £20m for Van Persie, whose contract expires next summer.</span></p>
              <p><span>Van Persie trained with his Arsenal team-mates on Friday morning and looked relaxed.</span></p>
              <p><span>Manager Arsene Wenger wants a quick resolution to the Van Persie saga so he can either prepare for the new season with the Dutchman in his plans or have enough time to find a replacement.</span></p>
              <p><span>Arsenal had been adamant their captain will make the trip to Malaysia on Saturday, but he will now remain behind, which surely signals the beginning of the end of his Gunners career.</span></p>

              <p>Arsenal boss Wenger is determined to hold out for at least £20m for the Dutch striker and Manchester United, Manchester City and Juventus have not increased their offers despite having opening bids turned down.</p>
              <p>It leaves Wenger believing that the club's spending spree - which will top £40m when Santi Cazorla is confirmed alongside Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud - may yet see van Persie stay.</p>
              <p>Arsenal will not sell van Persie for less than £20m and then if he stays beyond August 31 they will then try to persuade him to sign a new deal.</p>
              <p>Van Persie, who turns 29 today (August 6), will fly out to Germany for the club's pre-season training camp ahead of the friendly with Cologne next Sunday, as revealed in Mirror Sport last Friday.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal will sell if the right offer comes in because they cannot risk him leaving for free next summer but the chances of the Dutch striker at least starting the campaign at the Emirates are increasing.</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United are now favourites and are expected to come back but Arsenal still have doubts as to whether they will match their price because Sir Alex Ferguson may have concerns over van Persie's age, injury record and that he will have no resale value.</p>
              <p>Juventus have had a bid turned down, the Italians have made a further enquiry but their coach Antonio Conte being fined and suspended have damaged their hopes while City fear they will miss out on van Persie.</p>
              <p>Arsenal expect to complete a deal for Cazorla this week but the £20m deal - a £16m basic fee with add-ons - is being held up by Malaga's financial problems. They are also still in for Real Madrid's Turkish midfielder Nuri Sahin.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Roberto Mancini has admitted defeat in his pursuit of Arsenal's Robin van Persie. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Italian has been desperate to bring the striker to the Etihad but have faced stiff competition from Manchester United and Serie A giants Juventus. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>And after it emerged that Sir Alex Ferguson had stayed in Britain while his team were in Norway in a bid to force through a £20million deal for the Dutchman, Mancini has revealed his club are no longer in the race. </span> </p>
              <p><span>When asked about the Gunners star, the City boss said: 'Van Persie? No, I don't think he will come here.' <br></span></p>
              <p><span>United now expect to get the coveted signature of last season's Premier League top goalscorer by the time the new campaign kicks off on August 19.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The club also expect to add young Brazilian Lucas Moura to their ranks in the coming days.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, after the failed attempt to lure Van Persie to the Premier League champions, Mancini expects Edin Dzeko to remain. </span></p>
              <p><span>The Bosnian has failed to live up to the £27million City paid Woflsburg for him 18 months ago, and is wanted by several top clubs around Europe. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>However, responding to speculation about Juve and AC Milan's interest in the forward, Mancini added on Italian television: 'I'm pleased, as this means we have good players, but it’s pretty unlikely he will leave.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Speaking to German media this week, Dzeko hit out at his lack of playing time - he started just 16 league games last season - and suggested he would be ready to leave for the right club.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has been warned it will take an “unbelievable” offer to persuade Arsenal to sell Robin van Persie to him.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Gunners manager Arsene Wenger will not sell for less than £20m - and will demand a premium fee of more than £25m </span><span style="color: #000000;">from Fergie and Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;"> because Arsenal do not want to do business with a direct Premier League rival.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, Juventus, who have also been chasing the Dutch striker, have claimed van Persie has told them he will not move to Italy, but <em>was</em> signing for another club.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wenger still believes he can persuade van Persie to stay, even though United are expected to make an improved offer for him before the end of the week.</span> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Van Persie trained with his team-mates at Arsenal’s pre-season camp in Germany on Wednesday night, ahead of their away friendly against Cologne on Sunday, and the club insist nothing has been agreed with United.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"We have made a bid</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and they've been trying to negotiate with other clubs," said Ferguson after United's friendly against Barcelona on Wednesday night.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"I don't have a gut feeling on it at the moment, I must admit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"We're not getting any breakthrough with Arsenal. It's difficult to say why they're operating this way.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"I don't know what their thoughts are, because they're not giving anything away."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Even though van Persie has been training hard and is understood to be impressed with Arsenal's summer spending spree, his statement that he will not sign a new contract to replace the one that expires at the end of the coming season still leaves them with a major dilemma.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal do not want to risk losing van Persie on a free transfer next summer, which may tempt them to sell even if the signs are encouraging that the striker is having a change of heart.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Mirror understands that van Persie has told Manchester City that he does not want to join them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Now Juventus are out of the running, United are likely to test Arsenal's, and van Persie’s, resolve with another bid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But Wenger and the club’s hierarchy are determined to hold out for a much bigger price if they end up selling to a rival.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal are not convinced United will meet their asking price because of van Persie’s age - he turned 29 at the start of this week - and the fact he is only one year away from leaving the Emirates on a Bosman.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Elsewhere, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Wenger may consider a big offer from Barcelona for Alex Song</span><span style="color: #000000;">, but is under no pressure to sell as the midfielder's contract does not expire until 2015.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal would also want a ready-made replacement to be lined up before doing business with Barca.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">They </span><span style="color: #000000;">have been tracking Real Madrid’s Turkish midfielder Nuri Sahi, who's also been linked with Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">, for a one-year loan deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Rennes and France midfielder Yann M’Vila has also been a long-term target.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Remind yourself of </span><span style="color: #000000;">all the twists and turns in the van Persie saga</span><span style="color: #000000;"> with our transfer timeline,</span></p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Robin van Persie is closing in on a sensational £20million-plus move after Arsenal officially began negotiations with Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">The Mirror can reveal the two clubs spent Tuesday night talking about a deal which could now be pushed through before the Premier League kick-off this weekend.</p>
              <p class="body ">Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is likely to settle on a fee of just above £20m as United prepare to increase their offer for the Dutch forward, who is currently on international duty but won't be in the starting line-up when Holland play Belgium on Wednesday night.</p>
              <p class="body ">It is understood the clubs are very close to agreement on a fee.</p>

              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><strong>Arsenal would rather sell now than lose van Persie, who has already said publicly he will not extend a contract that is into its final year, on a free transfer next summer.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">United boss Sir Alex Ferguson has already had a £15m bid turned down, and has reservations about paying a bigger fee for a 29-year-old who has one year left on his contract and a chequered injury record.</p>
              <p class="body ">But United are now prepared to go higher to get their man as they set about taking the Premier League title back from neighbours Manchester City.</p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">Fergie made direct contact with Wenger earlier in the week</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to try to push the deal through after weeks of posturing.</span></p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">The clubs are likely to find a middle ground which means it is highly possible van Persie will be on the move and will therefore not be involved in Arsenal’s opening game against Sunderland.</span></p>
              <p class="body "> </p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">Van Persie has made it clear that United is his preferred destination, ahead of Manchester City and Juventus</span><span style="color: #000000;">, and that has prompted Arsenal to sell now.</span></p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">Wenger is also understood to be </span><span style="color: #000000;">ready to cash in on Alex Song, who is a target for Barcelona</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p class="body ">Arsenal will then look to bring in Real Madrid’s Turkish midfielder Nuri Sahin on a one-year loan.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has finally got his man, with Robin van Persie poised to join Manchester United in a £24million deal.</strong></p>
              <p>Van Persie will sign a four-year contract with United on £200,000-a-week in a package worth almost £40m to the Holland international.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>United will pay £15m cash up front with the fee rising to a guaranteed £22m. But, depending on other add-ons, Arsenal could still land £24m.</p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">As revealed by the Mirror on Tuesday</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Arsenal agreed to sell their captain and star striker once their asking price was met.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">He will travel to Manchester on Thursday, where he will undergo a medical at the city's Bridgewater Hospital before the deal is completed.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">After weeks of wrangling, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Ferguson had made a personal plea to old foe Arsene Wenger to agree to allow van Persie to join United</span><span style="color: #000000;">. Wenger was reluctant to let his prized asset join United, but was forced to cave in once the offer reached £24m.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Dutchman had just one year left on his contract, and Arsenal faced the prospect of losing him for nothing next year unless they sold.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The capture is a formidable statement of intent from United on the eve of the new Premier League season, as they aim to reclaim the title from local rivals Manchester City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">United's attack now boasts the Premier League's two leading strikers from last season in van Persie and Wayne Rooney</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> who scored 71 goals between them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><img class="captify" title="Be afraid... Rooney and van Persie are set to team up for Manchester United" src="http://i2.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1242232.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Wayne+Rooney+and+Robin+Van+Persie" alt="Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie" width="615" height="410"></p>
              <p>Be afraid... Rooney and van Persie are set to team up for Manchester United  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ferguson feared he had lost out on van Persie a few weeks ago, with the United boss privately claiming Wenger wanted £30m for the forward.</strong></p>
              <p>And <span style="color: #000000;">only last week Ferguson went public with that dismay</span>, accusing Wenger of trying to sell van Persie to any club other than United.</p>
              <p>Yet despite interest from Manchester City and Juventus, United was always Van Persie's first-choice, with Arsenal's asking price the only stumbling block to the move.</p>
              <p>Arsenal confirmed the deal on their website and United released their own statement moments later which said: "Manchester United is pleased to announce it has reached agreement with Arsenal for the transfer of Robin van Persie.</p>
              <p>"The deal is subject to a medical and the agreement of personal terms."</p>
              <p>The news was greeted with fury by celebrity Arsenal fan and TV presenter <span style="color: #000000;">Piers Morgan, who laid into the Dutchman on Twitter</span>, labelling him "mercenary, heartless and selfish."</p>

              <p class="body ">Wenger was reluctant to let his prized asset join the Red Devils, but was forced to cave in once the offer reached £24m.</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>The Dutchman had just one year left on his contract, and Arsenal faced the prospect of losing him for nothing next year unless they sold.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">The capture is a formidable statement of intent from United on the eve of the new Premier League season, as they aim to reclaim the title from local rivals Manchester City.</p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">United's attack now boasts the Premier League's two leading strikers from last season in van Persie and Wayne Rooney</span><span style="color: #000000;"> , who scored 71 goals between them. </span></p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">The news was greeted with fury by celebrity Arsenal fan and TV presenter </span><span style="color: #000000;">Piers Morgan, who laid into the Dutchman on Twitter</span><span style="color: #000000;"> , labelling him "mercenary, heartless and selfish." </span></p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile one Manchester United striker could be going the other way and joining Arsenal. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Click here to find out which one.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="body "><span style="color: #000000;">Plus our Arsenal expert John Cross says that although van Persie's move will be seen as a betrayal by fans, </span><span style="color: #000000;">at £24m the deal represents good business for the Gunners.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
