            <div class='col-md body'><strong>New Wigan boss Steve Bruce believes the pressures of management are harming England's chances of producing a home-grown national coach.</strong><br><br>The search is on to replace Steve McClaren with a number of foreign options believed to be at the forefront of the Football Association's thinking.<br><br>And Bruce, who recently left Birmingham to join the Latics, believes the culture of demanding instant results is hurting the English game.<br><br>He said: "The pressure and intensity is immense. I believe we have the best league in the world but the disadvantage is it creates so much pressure, not only in the Premier League, but in the Championship because everyone wants that pot of gold that comes with being in this division.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unbelievable</span></strong><br><br>"The average survival rate of a manager in the Championship last season was one year and one month. That is unbelievable.<br><br>"And then we wonder why we can't produce a young English boss with the credentials to become a national team manager.<br><br>"I'll give you Paul Simpson as an example. He did wonders at Carlisle for two or three years, got them promoted, gets a job at Preston, does terrifically well, has a bad start to the season and... whoosh... he's gone.<br><br>"He was the next bright young manager. The frustrating thing is if you are not given time to turn around a club, how are we going to produce a top manager?"<br><br>Another example Bruce cites as to the current difficulties facing managers is Sam Allardyce at Newcastle.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ridiculous</span></strong><br><br>"Look at Sam Allardyce's situation at Newcastle," he said. "If he is under pressure, it is ridiculous. He's been there four months. What on earth is all that about?<br><br>"The reason Sam got a top job like Newcastle was for what he did at Bolton. Who could have done a better job than the one he did?<br><br>"He has proved beyond doubt he is a good manager and he will turn Newcastle around.<br><br>"For goodness sake, give the geezer a chance. This is the crazy side of the game."<br><br>As regards the vacant England coach role, Bruce can only see one candidate for the job.<br><br>He added: "I actually don't think we need a coach as such. Do you need to be a genius to coach people like Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney?<br><br>"What you need is nous, a man who can organise a team, make the right changes when required and who has the experience of winning games.<br><br>"And the man who has done that consistently over the years is Harry Redknapp."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is buying some grace for himself?  ie paving the road that in case Wigan gets relegated, its not his fault?<br><br>I agree partially with him.  As in all businesses, soccer clubs are run like a company.  You buy a club and you expect returns in the form of TV royalties,gates receipt and prize money as well as merchandise sales.  All these are inevitably affected by league &amp; competition performance.  Hence, if I invest in a club - there are certain ROR that I am looking at and I set KPIs for the manager - unless I am being kind &amp; generous and say, ok, I want to grow a club &amp; I give the manager 3 years to do so...and we track his performance.<br><br>If we look at the managers that have gone - eg: Jol at Tottenham, he has been there for so long, and the owners probably feel he has not been developing / growing the club - hence he got to leave.  Ditto for Mourniho - whose job is even more difficult because his KPI is even more stringent.  This is the same for the corporate world out there - fail in your job &amp; you walk.<br><br>Times are different, gone are the days where the club is patient and believes in time to build the squad.  Nowadays where TV revenues &amp; transfer fees are huge, you need to balance things out by recouping your fees.  True, some transfers are against your wishes -eg; Shevenchenko - but as a manager, you must prove your mettle by managing your resources at hand.<br><br>Similarily for the managers, if you are uncomfortable with achieving your targets don't take the bloody job.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think more bad examples of manager getting sacked too early includes:<br><br>chris hutchings sacked after expected loss to chelsea<br><br>iain dowie at charlton, his successor did even worse....<br><br>bobby robson sacked for dropping shearer and he's probably the best newcastle manager in recent years<br><br>martin jol brought spurs to uefa cup qualification for the first time in a long while and he gets sacked after a bad start.....</div>
