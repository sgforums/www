              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>MIKE ASHLEY has tried to flog Newcastle to the company who want to buy Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Toon owner Ashley’s people have approached a third-party financing firm called PCP in a bid to get Dubai Investment Capital to switch targets from Anfield to St James’ Park.</p>

              <p class="article">The multi-millionaire sportswear mogul bought the club last summer for £130m and took on debts of around £100m.</p>

              <p><em>Keegan.. nightmare</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>IS it just me or has the second coming of Kevin Keegan at Newcastle got the look of disaster about it?</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Special K, King Kev or whatever else you want to call Mighty Mouse, turned 57 this week.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But it was hardly a birthday to celebrate as Newcastle start to sink into the mire. His record since returning to St James’ Park reads: Won 0, Drawn 2, Lost 3, Goals for 2, Goals against 11.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Granted two of these games were against Arsenal. Yet it was more the second-half capitulation against Aston Villa last week that should have set alarm bells ringing in Geordieland.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Keegan went whiter as the game went on and was unable to do anything about it.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Some are already wondering whether Mike Ashley was hasty in sacking Sam Allardyce. I am convinced of it.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">While Allardyce is a manager for the time Keegan is a manager behind the times — from a distant, if exciting, past.</p>
              <p class="article">People only had to witness the way Keegan’s Manchester City team played in his final season to realise the magic had gone.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">In the three years since he quietly departed Eastlands he claimed he had not watched a match. Hardly preparation for one of the high-pressured jobs in football.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Mere knowledge of what this special club and area was all about was enough, he claimed. So why did he allow the appointment of Dennis Wise?</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Allardyce proved at Bolton he was at the cutting edge of what was new in football. He used the latest technology and methods to get the best from his players.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He was trying to do the same and needed time for the team to adjust. But it wasn’t the football of Keegan’s era we were told so it wasn’t good enough.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But this nonsense about preferring to lose 4-3 rather than win 1-0 is just that. I’ve not met a Newcastle fan who came away from Anfield happy at having lost 4-3 in 1996.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article">I have met plenty of fans happy at having won a game 1-0.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">When Keegan was appointed people who were still mastering Subbuteo the last time he was at St James’ told us it was the best thing for the club.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Why, how, what!</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">If he was that good England would have won Euro 2000 and Manchester City would have challenged for the Premiership on the back of his £50million spending spree.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The point is he was the right man for a certain time at St James’ but that time has gone. Dreams are just that. This one is turning into a nightmare. Next game up is Manchester United at home. Good luck!</p>
