              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City's </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Carlos Tevez</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> has attacked the greed of overpaid young players in the </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Premier League</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">, claiming they are more interested in lining their pockets than winning trophies.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The Argentinian is so disenchanted with the state of the game he has vowed to quit within "three or four years" and said he would rather punch some of his colleagues than listen to their advice.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to play any more. I'm tired of football but also tired of people who work in football," said Tevez. "I'm talking seriously. Football is only about money and I don't like it.</p>
              <p>"There are so many agents with really young footballers, it's awful as these young players are not interested in winning titles. They only want money."</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old, who has three and a half years left on his £145,000-a-week contract, said football was full of uneducated "bad people".</p>
              <p>"The young players think that they have won something in football because they have two cell phones and a house. Today there are many bad people in the football business and you have to fight with them all the time. I'm tired of that, too. I'm going to play football for three or four years in Europe, then I will quit.</p>
              <p>"Today the young players have no education at all and I don't want to listen to them," Tevez told Argentinian television station TyC Sports. "When I played in Boca [Juniors], when [Martín] Palermo or [Juan Román] Riquelme talked, I listened to them.</p>
              <p>"So I don't want a young player to tell me, 'Why did you do that?' in the dressing room. I would punch [them], as I have won 13 titles in my career."</p>

              <p>I think he is responsible for his own downfall. He has no respect for anyone and I've lost count of how many times he was involve in a row with Mancini. Maybe Fergie sensed a troublemaker and sent him packing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
