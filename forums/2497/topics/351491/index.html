              <p><strong>The </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/everton"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Everton</strong></span></a><strong> forward Victor Anichebe is awaiting an apology following a police swoop as he was looking in a jeweller's window in Knutsford, Cheshire. Officers, directed by CCTV operators, rushed to the scene and began a "heated dialogue" with Anichebe and his friend.</strong></p>
              <p>The 20-year-old striker's friend was put in handcuffs after police believed the duo were possibly part of a gang of raiders responsible for robberies on the exclusive King Street. The Nigerian-born Anichebe was wearing a leg cast following surgery when police detained them both. An Everton spokesman, Ian Ross, said: "Victor was deeply upset and very distressed by the incident. I believe he is still waiting for a full and unreserved apology from the police involved. Once he has received that both the club and the player will consider the matter closed."</p>
              <p>Cheshire Police would not answer alleged comments from the pair that white men would not have received the same treatment and a police source said no complaints had been received. "For some time Cheshire Constabulary have been responding to a series of violent robberies targeting jewellers in Knutsford and in the wider Cheshire area," a police spokesman said. "We have robust plans in place to respond swiftly to any report of any suspicious activity at or in the vicinity of jewellers' premises.</p>
              <p>"As part of that plan, local CCTV operators actively and routinely monitor shopping areas and jewellers' premises and on this occasion identified what appeared to be two men acting suspiciously outside a jeweller's store on King Street, Knutsford. Police attended the location within minutes and upon speaking with the two men, a heated dialogue developed in an attempt to ascertain exactly what the two persons were doing outside the jeweller's premises.</p>
              <p>"During the course of this exchange, an officer took the decision to restrain one of the two men concerned by applying handcuffs. It was subsequently ascertained that there was no criminal conduct whatsoever on behalf of the two men concerned and they were in no way involved in any criminal activity."</p>
