              <h2>One of Arsenal's penalty converters explains that he learned how to take penalties from an ex-England international.</h2>
              <p>Two legs and extra-time was not enough to separate the fifth-placed
              Premier League side from the sixth-placed Serie A team, but Arsenal
              eventually edged Roma after eight rounds of penalties.<br><br>One of
              Arsenal's converters, Theo Walcott, has today revealed that he took
              inspiration from a former team-mate at Southampton, as mind-games can
              play a key part in the outcome of a spot-kick, so Walcott refused to
              eye-ball opposition glovesman, Doni.<br><br>"I had a dry throat going
              towards the goal but I didn't look at the goalkeeper once," Walcott is
              quoted by the club's official website as saying. "I learned that from
              James Beattie. <br><br>"He's probably one of the best penalty takers I
              have seen. I have watched him over the years and mine wasn't as good a
              penalty as his but they all count. <br><br>"I didn't want the
              goalkeeper to make eye contact with me because sometimes they might put
              you off a little bit. Plus he was a big lad. It's all about positive
              thinking and it counted in the end.<br><br>"To be fair, it was a really good experience for me. It was the first penalty shoot-out I have ever done."<br><br>The
              England international - who scored a famous hat-trick against Croatia
              towards the end of last year - also added that the Arsenal camp had not
              been practicing penalties prior to the knock-out clash.<br><br>"To do
              it on penalties for such a young team who haven't experienced that, it
              just shows the character we have got in the whole side.<br><br>"I
              didn't expect to take the third penalty but the boss has faith in all
              of us. That definitely showed in the penalty takers tonight. He told me
              I was third and I am not going to say no. I just wanted to get up there
              and see what would happen.<br><br>"We didn't practice them at all - we
              thought we could get the result. But it doesn't matter how they go in
              and it was like we had just won the World Cup Final in the dressing
              room after the game.<br><br>"The atmosphere was brilliant," he added.
              "Even though there are all sorts of nationalities in there, we all get
              along and we are like a family in there. <br><br>"It's just a brilliant bunch of lads to play with," he concluded.</p>
