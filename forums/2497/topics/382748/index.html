              <h3>THE wind picks up, stopping people in their tracks whenever the ice-cool, 
              mountain air tumbles down the valley.</h3>
              <p>This is familiar territory for England manager Fabio Capello, instantly 
              recognisable after bringing Roma here in 2000 and Real Madrid in 2006.</p>
              <p>Both teams went on to win the league title, breathing in the air at altitude, 
              then blowing teams away when it counted.</p>
              <p>England's players will make the same trip, getting giddy when the team coach 
              takes on the endless switchbacks as they climb through the clouds.</p>
              <p>Then they hope to take the nation to dizzying heights, reaping the benefits of 
              a week-long stay at their pre-World Cup retreat.</p>
              <p>The players cannot fail to be impressed, from the snow-capped peaks 
              surrounding the hotel to the goat-herders taking on the even steeper climbs 
              towards the top.</p>
              <p>It is a world away from Wembley - a stunning setting for a team preparing to 
              play tournament football at the very highest level.</p>
              <p>They intend to play a game out here, a practice match before they return to 
              their sold-out national stadium for a World Cup farewell match.Capello has 
              yet to decide on the standard of opposition in Austria, but the local 
              part-timers have been primed for action. Real Madrid beat them 10-2 in July 
              2006, in front of more than 2,000 starry-eyed locals.</p>
              <p>Then it will be on to the real action, with England's players travelling to 
              South Africa six days before their first game.</p>
              <p>Their Austrian stay will help the players adjust to the altitude in South 
              Africa, with some stadiums as high as 5,749ft.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-280"><img title="GYM: Where the players will work out" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00066/base2_280x420_66813a.jpg" alt="GYM: Where the players will work out">

              </div>
              <p>Capello's squad will stay at the magnificent Hotel Schloss Pichlarn, sucking 
              in mountain air from their spot more than 2,300ft above sea level. What a 
              choice. No flag-wavers, no fans and not a WAG in sight.</p>
              <p>The only supporters will be the townsfolk of this sparsely populated Austrian 
              village, a hidden gem tucked in between the foreboding sight of the Alps.</p>
              <p>England are taking up two floors of this grand, five-star hotel, following in 
              the famous footsteps of Francesco Totti and Zinedine Zidane.</p>
              <p>The hard work will be done in the foothills, down in the village where the 
              England team will train twice a day at the local stadium.</p>
              <p>After meeting for breakfast in the Spiegelsaal ('the room full of mirrors'), 
              the 23-man squad will board the bus for the five-minute drive to the 
              stadium.</p>
              <p>It is here that 500 supporters watch the local team Irdning, an amateur side 
              playing in Austria's fourth division.</p>
              <p>More than twice that number will turn up to watch England's double-sessions, 
              downing tools for the day to watch them train.</p>
              <p>The president of Irdning is already preparing for England's stay, proudly 
              showing off an enormous Three Lions badge in a reception area that will 
              welcome the team each day.</p>
              <p>Josef Manschefszki breaks off from polishing the recent arrival, admitting the 
              prospect of England's players pitching up in Irdning is special.</p>
              <p>He said: "The whole town is very proud to be associated with the English 
              national team.</p>
              <p>"They will be made to feel very special and very welcome here. It is a quiet 
              village, very peaceful and very tranquil. These are idyllic surroundings."</p>
              <p>Everybody in the town is looking forward to England's stay, although the 
              locals will maintain a respectful distance.</p>
              <p>Next May will be work-time for England's squad, training hard as they prepare 
              for a potential four-week stay in South Africa. Some 40 staff will be on 
              hand to assist them during their stay in Irdning.</p>

              </div>
              <p>They will eat three meals a day, with chef Roger Narbett staying at the hotel 
              to prepare platefuls of pasta. In the corridors, "Snack Stations" will be 
              set up, with a steady supply of nuts and fresh fruit on hand.</p>
              <p>The Grimming Room, named after one of the nearby mountains, will be divided 
              into three areas, with designated zones providing internet, table tennis and 
              pool.</p>
              <p>There is also a separate meeting room for Capello to run through videos of 
              past matches and potential opponents. Whenever Capello loses his rag - which 
              we hope will not be often - he can head for the basement and the House of 
              Harmony.</p>
              <p>There, he can enrol in a pampering programme, spiritual exercises in holistic 
              surroundings.</p>
              <p>It's a chill-out zone for England's manager, the perfect place for him to 
              gather his thoughts ahead of the group phase.</p>
              <p>Breathe in, breathe out... then blow those negative thoughts away.</p>
