              <p class="introcopy"><strong>ARSENE WENGER has risked infuriating Arsenal’s frustrated supporters by claiming he would accept second place for the next 20 years.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p class="storycopy">The Gunners’ boss has come under fire after his team lost the Carling Cup final, were knocked out of the Champions League and FA Cup and fell seven points behind Premier League leaders Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But ahead of Arsenal’s match at Blackpool tomorrow, Wenger hit back by saying: “I am only very proud of what this team have done.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“As long as you are second in the league, I am ready to sign for the next 20 years and stand up for that.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But despite insisting that his team can still win the Premier League, Wenger’s rant resembled a familiar list of excuses for yet another trophyless season. He is right to point out his and Arsenal’s achievements. Only Manchester United have matched their record of qualifying for the Champions League, and fighting for the title with eight games to go is hardly a crisis.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">It is understandable Wenger feels unfairly targeted, given Spurs boss Harry Redknapp is being touted as the next England manager for his achievements and that Manchester City’s ambitions do not extend beyond a top-four finish.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But it is Wenger who built a winning mentality at Arsenal that he and his players are now being judged by.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“Some of the clubs behind us have done nothing for 20 years, yet suddenly they get a lot of praise,” said Wenger. “I don’t understand. I managed 1,500 games and I have to listen to many opinions of people who have done a bit less. We have eight games to go and are in a position to fight for the championship, so let’s give the maximum.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“If we’re disappointed at the end, then OK. Why do you say that it is a disaster when we’re second in the league? Do the 18 clubs behind us have a fantastic disaster?</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“To be consistent at the top level is the most difficult and important thing in our job. We’ve been in the Champions League for 15 years and there’s only two clubs who have done that in this country: us and Manchester United.</p>
              <div class="padding7north">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">“Trophies are one way to judge a club. They’re not overrated as it allows you to say you’ve won a trophy, but would you swap winning the FA Cup for playing in the Champions League? Is it a trophy or not to be in the Champions League? We do as well as we can and if it’s not good enough, it’s not good enough.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“But what I deny is that everything is suddenly negative. We’ve built this club.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I don’t know where Arsenal would be without me – maybe better, maybe worse. I hope one day maybe better.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I defend what we do here and the way we do it. That’s all. I don’t see why we should be negative.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“If I cannot defend the fact we’re second in the league and fighting for the championship then I should stay at home, but I’m in a fighting job.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">He remains convinced that history will prove him right to put so much faith in this set of players. Although, ominously, he suggested that it will not necessarily be Arsenal who benefit. “The average age of this team is 23,” said Wenger. “We’ve done well for our age.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“Is that a disaster? There are teams who invest 10 times more than us, one player cost more than our whole team and they’re behind us.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“We have many big players in this team and the future will tell you that. Whether they play here or somewhere else, you’ll realise they’re big players.”</p>

              <p>i dun think arsenal can keep on making profits every year, the reasons are simple enough, they don't sell the likes of adebayor, toure, henry every year, there's no guarantees of champs league every year or progress into the later stages where the big money comes in</p>
              <p>although their model is better than most of the big clubs but it's still not the best, you have to look at german clubs to see the best models, almost every club in the bundesliga is bringing youngsters through, they're all financially well run and there's only one sugar daddy club in hoffenheim. Arsenal's model means they still pay for their youngsters, they're cheap but ethically makes you cheap as well....</p>

              <p>I beg to differ on what Wenger is on to... Arsenal isn't the most profitable club during this past 6 yrs despite spending lesser than the others...</p>
              <p>I belief the main reason Arsenal is even profitable is they have a bigger stadium than Spurs and Chelsea in London. And also the land and housing sale of their former ground helps pop up their past few season's revenue. Land in London is costly but this is a short term means as they will run out from this source very soon...</p>
              <p>I strongly belief that Wenger, after having won in his earlier years, now wants to achieve winning with a young squad. And contrary to belief, Arsenal does spend a lot of money on players too only on young players. Paying over the odds for very young players and some of them or perhaps lots of them may not even make it to the first team or reserved before they are released. Sidwell, Bentley are just a few who have became successful elsewhere... Their youth programme takes up a lot of their expenses, they do it aroundthe world, they have even conducted course for youth in Singapore just imagine...</p>
              <p>Although their highest paid player is only on $110k and there is only one such earner (Fabregas), their wage bill is still not too far behind from United's... So we have to wonder where have the rest gone too?</p>
              <p>As to Wenger getting a chance to do his experiment, it's probably got to do with the Arsenal club board being weak with too many shareholders... There is no focus from anyone... Like Chelsea have Roman and United have Fergie... The Arsenal chairman is only interested on the annual profits to show to the directors so is willing to sacrifice winning than really going for the title... While Wenger isn't put under any pressure to win so he continues with his experiments... As Mourinho said, Wenger has an easy job as he is not expected to deliver year in, year out... and he doesn't face the sack.</p>
              <p>But I think things may be about to change for Arsenal... With the emergence of City, Spurs and perhaps Liverpool... Their chances of getting a CL place becomes harder as well if they continue with Wenger's experiments... And we know the CL is a cash cow that Arsenal can't afford to miss out if they want to continue to be profitable and a big club...</p>
              <p>But who knows, a new owner taking over may change all this.</p>
