              Given hopes any new owner for Newcastle United will have the spending
              power to lift the club into the top echelons of European football.</p>
              <p>He said: "I have been there a long time now and I would class
              it as my home. I have been there 11 and a half years or something, so
              it's a big part of my life.</p>
              <p>"At times like this, it's difficult. Because I've been there so
              long, I feel a little bit how the fans feel. It's been so frustrating.</p>
              <p>"I've been through rough times at Newcastle, but this time with
              the club up for sale and the management up in the air, it just seems
              like the ultimate turmoil.</p>
              <p>"As a player, it is easy to turn around and say, 'I want to leave, I want to do this or that'.</p>
              <p>"But I would love to see Newcastle really turn the corner.
              Hopefully, this is as low as it's going to get and we will turn the
              corner and things will pick up, the club will get sold and the right
              people will come in to invest in the team.</p>
              <p>"I think someone was quoted as saying things can turn bad quickly, but they can turn really good quickly as well at Newcastle.</p>
              <p>"It can go on a bit of a rollercoaster and hopefully that will be the case, and I would like to be part of that.</p>
              <p>"I would like to win some things at Newcastle. I know at the
              minute we are miles off that, but you look at the investors at
              Manchester City and you know the money they are talking about there.</p>
              <p>"If we had someone similar, someone who is going to put money into the team, then things can change in the blink of an eye."</p>

              <p>it seems every club is praying to hit the "jackpot" in that a rich Arab will descend into their club and wipe off all the debts, and give the manager, a blank cheque..</p>
              <p>Newcastle is a grossly over-hype club with nothing to show over the years. Despite having the best goal-scorer of all times, Shearer, they have belly-up so many times. And to be fair to the owners, it is not that they are offered no money but just that it was not wisely spent..</p>
              <p>Do you guys feel that the only way for EPL club to challenge the big clubs is an "arab-injection"?</p>
