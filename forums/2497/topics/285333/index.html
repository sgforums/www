Cesc, 20, quit Barca as a kid to join Arsenal and Barca have regretted losing him since. His agent Joseba Diaz, who has in the past also held talks with Real Madrid, claimed this morning that Cesc would consider a move back to the Camp Nou. </strong><br><br>Diaz said: Â“IÂ’ve talked to Cesc and we are not aware of the interest of Barcelona. Â“And if theyÂ’re interested, great, because itÂ’s one of the big clubs, itÂ’s the team that plays the best football and Cesc was very happy there. Â“If an offer from Barca came itÂ’s clear we would listen to it itÂ’s the club that taught Cesc everything when he was a little boy and it would be very flattering.<br><br>Â“Neither the player nor me have thought about the story and really the only thing that is in our minds right now is Spain's game against Denmark. What is going to happen can happen.Â” Cesc has a contract with the Gunners until 2014 after signing an eight-year deal last year.<br></div>

Time will tell. But i think Barce rather than Real is where he wants to play his football in future...  Fabregas has always said great things about Barce but not Real... At the end, he is still a Barce boy... but he probably won't go over within this 2 yrs yet cos like i said... when he has finally made it in the Epl... Otherwise he would just end up on the bench if he goes over now... and i am guessing that he will play for Barce before he reaches 25.<br><br>On a side note... how come you type ronaldo like someone we see around here so frequently...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

But i think Barce rather than Real is where he wants to play his football in future...  Fabregas has always said great things about Barce but not Real... At the end, he is still a Barce boy... but he probably won't go over within this 2 yrs yet cos like i said... when he has finally made it in the Epl... Otherwise he would just end up on the bench if he goes over now... and i am guessing that he will play for Barce before he reaches 25.<br><br>On a side note... how come you type ronaldo like someone we see around here so frequently...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div></blockquote>it is the media who always trying to tell fake new dat fabregas is interested in his former club.<br><br>but i doubt fabregas will ever return to barca since barca nvr appreciate him in the 1st place. why would he leave arsenal n BPL to play for a club which might land him on the bench?<br><br>regarding ur second paragraph, i dun get wat u r saying? r u trying to create something out of nothing?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>8 yrs or 10 yrs doesnt matter..those who play FM will noe that the clubs have to renew their contracts after 3 yrs..<br>Fab comes from barca originally...so why not? who doesnt wan to go home? Despite that i think he will stay at arsenal at least for the next 5 yrs...</div>
