Barca is where he came from after all. I think the only time Fabregas will leave is when AW leaves. It goes the same to C Ronaldo, he will leave when Fergie leaves.</div>

There is nothing wrong with wanting to return to the club you started with... Many players would like to return to the club they started their career with one day so i don't see why Fabregas wouldn't especially when its Barcelona...<br><br>Ronaldo and Fabregas are in a way similar yet very different... Ronaldo is playing for man U, whereas Fabregas is playing for Arsenal. No disrespect to the gunners but i think almost everyone who follow football for the past 10 yrs or longer would know that there is 2 big club from Spain... Real Madrid and Barcelona. And there is also 2 big clubs from England and Arsenal isn't one of them...<br><br>There is no guarantee that Ronaldo wouldn't leave united one day but at least it would be more difficult than in Fabregas's case cos Fabregas isn't earning much presently at Arsenal... And it is quite difficult to see Arsenal matching an offer from Spain as they hardly pay their players top $. Henry was their highest earner at $100k per week before he left and at present, i don't think there is a player that makes that amount. And even if they can match the offer, i am afraid they still lack the prestige that Barce or Real brings.<br><br>Man united and Pool have hardly lost the players they want to keep to Spanish clubs cos they can match the prestige or even better it and money is also not a problem with them... On Arsenal's case... i think its not as good... cos over the last 10 yrs alone, They seem to have lose many of their best players to Barcelona or other Spanish clubs... Players at the top of their game that they wanted to keep but couldn't starting were Nicolas Anelka in 1999. Then Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit in 2000, Edu in 2005, PirÃ¨s in 2006, Henry and JosÃ© Antonio Reyes in 2007... It seems like every few years Arsenal loses their best players to Barce or Real...<br><br>So I won't be surprise if Robin van Persie or Cesc FÃ bregas leave them too But i think Cesc the more likely one cos Spain is still his home land. And Cesc being only 19 or 20 now, may want to go back and play infront of his own country fans in 4 to 5 yrs time when he has made it in the Epl and is sure that he won't be bought to be place on the bench.</div>
