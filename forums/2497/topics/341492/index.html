              <p><em>You're off: Howard Webb sends Adebayor off after a foul on Liverpool's Arbeloa</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1100503" rel="1100503_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1100503/Referee-Howard-Webb-let-Liverpool-kick-storms-Arsenals-Adebayor.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor has accused referee Howard Webb of failing to protect </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong>’s attacking players during Sunday’s 1-1 draw with </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>. The Arsenal striker was sent off after 62 minutes at the Emirates, but said he should not have been the one heading to the dressing room early.</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger called Webb’s decision to dismiss Adebayor for a second bookable offence a ‘joke’ and his striker urged the referee to review his decision.</p>
              <p>Adebayor said: ‘If you try to protect strikers I would not have had a red card. I don’t think I deserved a red card, but at least one of the Liverpool players did. ‘Carragher was always fouling, so was Lucas in the middle. I made two fouls and got two yellow cards, which is not fair.</p>
              <p>‘The referee has to watch it on TV. If he thinks it’s a red card then fine, but if he thinks he has made a mistake he needs to comment on it as quickly as possible.’</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s Jamie Carragher and Leiva Lucas were among the six who received yellow cards from Webb as the Barclays Premier League leaders were held by Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Gunners’ scorer Robin van Persie and Bacary Sagna were also cautioned along with Robbie Keane, who smashed in the Liverpool equaliser. But Adebayor criticised the referee for allowing attacking players to be kicked, including his Arsenal teammate Cesc Fabregas, Fabregas limped off after a coming<br>together with Xabi Alonso and Arsenal fear his ligament damage could keep him out for longer than expected.</p>

              <p>Togo striker Adebayor, 24, said: ‘You can see the tackle on Cesc Fabregas before he went off was a little bit dangerous, but there was no card, not even a foul. ‘I can show you the marks on legs. I was kicked a lot but I tried to stay on my feet.’<br><br>There is, however, no possibility of Arsenal’s top-scorer avoiding the one-match ban that means he will miss the Boxing Day clash at Aston Villa. He had been booked for a high challenge on Emiliano Insua in the first half and received a second yellow card for tackle on Alvaro Arbeloa. Under FIFA guidelines, clubs cannot appeal against yellow cards unless there is a case for mistaken identity. <br><br>Adebayor said 10-man Arsenal should see the draw against Liverpool as a point gained, but insisted Webb’s decision robbed the Gunners of two more precious points.</p>

              <p><em></em> </p>
              <p>Despite lying fifth in the Premier League, Adebayor insisted Arsenal still have a chance of winning the title. He said: ‘With 10 men we managed to get a point against Liverpool and they were at the top of the table, with great players and playing great football at the moment. I think we still have the chance to do something. <br><br>‘We still have to go there, they have to play Manchester United and Chelsea. It means the title is still open for everyone to win. At the moment</p>
