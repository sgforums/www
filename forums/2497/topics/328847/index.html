              <p><em>Don't put your shirt on him yet: Real striker Robinho's move to Chelsea is in doubt.<br></em></p>
              <p><a class="addStoriesLink" rel="1050498_3" href="/sport/football/article-1050498/Madrid-Real-shirty-stun-Chelsea-U-turn-Robinhos-29m-move.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid have done a dramatic U-turn over the proposed ?29m sale of Robinho to Chelsea and insist the Brazilian will stay at the Bernabeu in a major embarrassment to the Blues after they advertised shirts for sale with his name on last night.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spanish giants are understood to have provisionally agreed the fee with Chelsea for Robinho but their failure to capture Valencia's David Villa and Villarreal's Santi Cazorla has put the move in serious doubt.</p>
              <p>Real had previously stated they would not stop the player moving to Stamford Bridge but last night dramatically changed their stance, reports The Daily Telegraph.</p>
              <p>'The coach and the sports director want the player to stay and I am sure he will,' said president Ramon Calderon. 'Our squad is complete and it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have.'</p>
              <p>Sporting director Predrag Mijatovic says Robinho will complete the terms of his contract despite the player's wish to switch clubs. He added: 'Robinho still has two years left on his contract. Therefore he is our player for the next two seasons, so you can draw your own conclusions from that.'</p>
              <p>'In a healthy environment such as the one we have at the club, there is no problem that cannot be sorted.' Chelsea, rather embarrassingly, had to withdraw advertisements selling Robinho shirts on their website yesterday. His number had been stated as 'to be confirmed'.</p>
              <p>'Our online partner, Kitbag, always prepares in advance of any potential signings, and unfortunately it accidentally made its way onto the site but has now been removed,' a club spokesman told The Daily Telegraph. 'The club has always made it clear he [Robinho] is a major target and we hope to compete a deal soon.'</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea: Robinho will wear Shevchenko's No.7 shirt</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The <em>Daily Mirror</em> reports that Robinho will be handed Andriy Shevchenko's old No.7 shirt when his £28million move to Chelsea is completed on Friday. The Real Madrid winger is expected to be unveiled by the weekend with the Blues even hopeful he will be registered in time to play against Spurs on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon reckons Robinho, 24, can emulate the success of Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo. He said: "I think he comes with real desire and wants to be recognised as one of the best players in the world.</p>
              <p>"I know everyone does, but Robinho is different to what we have had. He's young, he's 24, so he's the right age, and he's come from Madrid so he understands what big club football is all about."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Chelsea have risked angering Real Madrid by advertising replica Robinho shirts for sale before the transfer for the Brazil forward has been completed.</p>

              <p><strong>Robinho's anticipated £29.5million move to </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong> has hit a major snag after Real Madrid manager Bernd Schuster told club president Ramon Calderon that he could not sanction the deal.</strong></p>
              <p>The German, who guided Real to the Spanish title last season, was said to be furious at the potential sale. He refused to talk to reporters after Wednesday's 5-3 friendly win over Sporting Lisbon at the Bernabeu and is believed to have even threatened to quit should the striker be sold.</p>
              <p>Chelsea, who maintained today that transfer talks were ongoing, had hoped to parade the Brazilian in front of the Stamford Bridge crowd before Sunday's game against Tottenham. But Robinho turned up for training with Real this morning and Calderon appeared to offer the player an olive branch in an interview with Madrid-based paper Marca.</p>
              <p>The president pointed the finger at Robinho's agent Wagner Ribeiro and claimed that the striker had been badly advised before he said he wanted to join Chelsea last Friday.</p>
              <p>Calderon said: 'I think it's normal that a player says that he wants to leave and in the case of Robinho I accept that as being totally normal. 'It seems to me that it's a mistake, but it's his problem. I think that his representatives are advising him very badly and I have a lot of faith in the player. I believe he has a lot of quality and could be successful here.</p>
              <p>'But I say it again that I have to defend the interests of this club in the best way possible.' With just four days remaining until the end of the transfer window, Chelsea will now be concerned.</p>
              <p>Chief executive Peter Kenyon had confidently claimed Robinho would be their player before the weekend but it now appears talks will do down to the wire.</p>
              <p>Blues owner Roman Abramovich is adamant that he will not pay any more than £29.5 for the Brazilian, even though he was on a list of two players that Phil Scolari wanted to sign this summer - the other being Deco.</p>
              <p>Real have been trying to find a replacement for Robinho (above) and have been closely linked with Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka, another Chelsea target. The pursuit of Manchester United's Ronaldo ended when the winger finally committed to staying at Old Trafford for at least another season and Kaka wants to stay in Milan.</p>

              <p>They were about to sell him... Some of their directors were ready to accept what was initially a $19m offer snowball into $29m... In footballing terms, this was a good deal of business.</p>
              <p>I belief the deal was about to go through that made Kenyon to be so confident to claim Robinho had signed and Chelsea started selling his shirt... But by doing so, i think it may have made some Madrid directors angry not to mention Calderon. It was probably taken as a sign of disrespect to them.</p>
              <p>Whatever the outcome of this deal, its still in the balance... only until tue 7am will we know the result. Roman may have to come up with more cash to soften Real's stand or Real may just be making something out of nothing taking this opportunity presented to them to get more out of this deal... Afterall, how often do you get to sell your substitute player for $30m?</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>The game of brinkmanship has intensified over the past 48 hours, with Real dramatically changing their stance following clear indications earlier in the week that they had accepted the 24-year-old's departure as inevitable.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Negotiations with Real Madrid over the Brazil international striker’s transfer were deadlocked last night after two days of wrangling. </p>
              <p class="article">Real were furious when they learned Chelsea had started selling Robinho shirts and heard the public comments from chief executive Peter Kenyon which suggested the player had signed. </p>
              <p class="article">Madrid president Ramon Calderon was stunned by Kenyon’s ‘arrogance’ when he was pictured in the Spanish Press yesterday leaving a restaurant with Robinho’s agent. </p>
              <p class="article">Calderon then responded by saying the £28.4million move for the star was off. He said: “Robinho stays in Madrid — there is no going back. “It’s normal a player says he wants to leave and in the case of Robinho, I accept that. “But it seems to me it’s a mistake, but it’s his problem. </p>
              <p class="article">“I think his representatives are advising him very badly and I have a lot of faith in the lad. “But I have to defend the interests of this club in the best manner possible.” </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea remain hopeful an improved offer of around £31m may be enough to prise the 24 year old away before the transfer deadline at midnight on Monday.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon is staying in Madrid, until the transfer deadline on Monday if necessary, to try to push through the signing of Brazil international Robinho from Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>Kenyon faces a tough task, with Madrid's resolve to keep their player hardening after Chelsea fell short of their valuation and they also angered the Spanish champions by offering shirts bearing Robinho's name via their website before completing his capture.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have yet to improve their most recent £25.8million offer for Robinho, who trained yesterday ahead of the La Liga opener at Deportivo La Coruna tomorrow.</p>
              <p>And it seems Kenyon will have to come up with a further £6.4m if he is to bring Real back to the negotiating table.</p>
