              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paul Gascoigne has
                  revealed he was offered a helping hand from Argentina national team
                  coach Diego Maradona.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The controversial Argentine has battled back from a catalogue of health
                  problems and near death to become the host of his own entertainment
                  show and, now, take charge of his country's 2010 World Cup qualifying
                  campaign.</p>
              <p>And Gazza, who himself has suffered with mental illness and
                  alcoholism since his playing career ended, admitted he received an
                  offer from 'El Diez' to visit him.</p>
              <p>“I got a call and they just said Maradona has invited us to stay
                  with him," he told Sky News. "This was a couple of months ago but I
                  left it. I said I’d just leave it because he was taking the job of
                  Argentina and he would be busy anyway. But it’s still on offer.”</p>
              <p>And the ex-England international, who made 57 appearances for his
                  country and scored 10 times, revealed one of his biggest regrets was
                  not joining Manchester United when he had the chance, believing that -
                  under Sir Alex Ferguson's guidance - his life may have taken a
                  drastically different path.</p>
              <p>“Maybe if I had stayed at Man U I might have still been there," he said.</p>
              <p>"I don't know, you just look at these players and the squad of young
                  kids that play, young Rooney that's there, the Neville brothers and
                  Becks, the way he [Ferguson] just brought them on and there are so many.<br> <br> "I got invited to the academy and it is a magnificent place and you can
                  see the way he treats his players, he treats them with respect but he
                  also makes men out of boys.</p>
              <p>"It took me six years to get back talking to Sir Alex, I called him from Lazio and asked him would he re-sign us.<br> <br> "He was with Eric Cantona and he said he would see what Cantona was
                  going to do but I think everyone knows if you do something to Sir Alex
                  Ferguson the way I did you don't get a second chance."</p>
