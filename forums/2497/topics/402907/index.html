              <h1>WORLD CUP 2010: Manager Fabio Capello expects the sack if England 
              flop in South Africa</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Fabio Capello expects to be sacked by England if his under-pressure 
              team fail to win their make-or-break World Cup match against Slovenia in
               Port Elizabeth on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>According to a source close to the 
              manager, Capello is said to be 'under no illusions' as to his fate 
              should England produce their worst performance at a World Cup finals 
              since 1958 by being eliminated at the group stage.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Anger management: The England substitutes catch 
              the full force of Fabio Capello</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>After the dismal 0-0 
              draw with Algeria on Friday, Capello refused to be drawn on whether he 
              would offer to resign if his team fail again. 'It's too early to speak 
              about that,' said Capello.</p>
              <p>'We have to wait. We have time to answer that question. OK?'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Asked if England's poor performances were down to his 
              management or the team, Capello said: 'For a long time we were really 
              good and I'm training with the same systems that I have trained with for
               a long time.'</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, Capello agreed with the 
              chairman of the new Club England committee, Sir Dave Richards, to remove
               an escape clause from his £6million-a-year contract, meaning neither 
              the FA nor the manager have the option of terminating the deal without 
              paying compensation.</p>
              <p>But the Capello 
              source said: 'This is 
              football and we are 
              under no illusions. The new deal was set up as a show of faith on both 
              sides but if England don't go beyond the group stage, we expect the FA 
              to fire Fabio.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/19/article-1287994-0A1A4EF3000005DC-14_468x371.jpg" alt="Man management: Fabio Capello has a word with Steven Gerrard" width="468" height="371">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Man management: Fabio Capello has a word with 
              Steven Gerrard</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'Before the World Cup, Sir Dave assured Fabio he's still wanted. As 
              things stand, nothing has changed in essence from the agreement Fabio 
              struck. We went into the World Cup with a spirit of unity, we put that 
              in writing, and that is how we intend to continue. We must think 
              positively.'</p>
              <p>When the FA secured Capello's commitment to a new 
              contract to at least 2012, there was widespread acclaim, given his 
              success in qualification.</p>
              <p>Yet no one envisaged the team failing 
              to make the last 16 and Capello will be under huge pressure if the team 
              fail to qualify.</p>
              <p>If the FA did sack Capello, they would be liable
               for compensation up to the value of two years of his contract. But 
              compensation is only payable if Capello is out of work - and the Italian
               is unlikely to stay unemployed for long.</p>

              <p>England has beet really bad so far... The Gerrard and Lampard, can they play together or they can't player together has come back to haunt the team all over again... How many years already has this been going on... I just feel these 2 can't play in the same team at a tournament... Cos they just want to out do each other, outshine one another, it's just terrible... They are taking pot shots as and when they get the opportunities and forget to create for the strikers and the team...</p>
              <p>Another problem I find rather weird is how come Joe Cole isn't playing at all? Has he done something to upset Capello? And how is SWP even there in the first place let alone playing like a regular in the first team...</p>
              <p>I feel Capello should go after the WC... And Roy should not take the Pool job just yet, cos the England job could be up for grabs very soon... He could be one of the strong candidate for it.</p>

              <p>The Gerrard and Lampard stuff is still crazy...Since the days of Sven and McClown, they still haven't figure out how to deal with it... They both are good players on their own but they just don't work well with each other. So either you drop one or you will end up with an unbalanced team... Cos now in order to fit them all in, Gerrard is moved to the left, Lampard played well for Chelsea as the attacking midfielder but here he is move further back... But they both still wish to be the attacking midfielder so we get 2 of them trying to do the same job and outshine each other but in the end, get confused and no proper build-up play... To make it more worse, Capello made Lampard vice-captain... So now these 2 got something else to prove as to who is the more important player to the team...</p>
              <p>And yeah, What with Heskey doing there as well... He can't even get into the Aston Villa team and he is a regular for Capello... I remember Capello said he only use players that are playing regularly?</p>

              <p>It is players who should take the blame, not Capello. They should reflect on what they had done during friendlies and group stage matches. He has tried the best to save England after McLaren era.</p>
