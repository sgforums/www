              <p>Capello is much better than mclaren, but he is as stale as sven goran eriksson when it comes to selecting players and tactics, very stale.</p>

              <p>SWP i don't know what Capello sees in him that we don't. Even Adam Johnson who is taking his right winger spot for club was not brought, and that is one player in the entire English team that can actually dribble and send in a good cross and is a natural left footer as well.</p>
              <p>If he likes this kinda all pace and no brain player, why leave out walcott, might as well start SWP,Lennon and Walcott together as the front 3.</p>
              <p>Bring Joe Cole in but not even using him, continued to use Heskey when he's obviously there as a foil for Rooney, might as well use Crouch who can also win headers in the air.</p>
              <p>And the solution to Gerrard and Lampard is to unleash them both, stop being so defensive minded and play only 1 attacking midfielder, meaning the other has to drop back. One Gareth Barry is enough for that purpose against lesser teams.</p>
              <p>But anyway Terry and Carragher partnership is way too slow to cope against fast and pacy strikers. And also send Ashley Cole up more often like what he does for Chelsea when the team is lacking of a left sided width. This conversativsm style of play is obviously a Capello's formula, but it needs to go.</p>

              <p>hmm..as for the gerrard-lampard issue..y not force one of them to play defecely and another in atttacking midfield...or switch reponsibility periodically...or drop one of them for 1 match...<br>e.g<br>gerrard - DM lampard AM<br>lampard DM - gerrad AM<br>barry DM - gerrad AM<br>barry DM - lampard AM<br> Or Have gerrard play behind the rooney as a forward? :P</p>
              <p>i guess the above is not feasible or the coach doesnt dare to do such a thing..<br>since it is pretty evident. they cant play together...<br><br>cheers</p>

              <p>Capello is method is just like the old steven eriksson. bringing in those lao jiang to the squad will help them win the world cup meh?? But i believe during the time of steven mangement, the team is much stronger than now.</p>
              <p>as a coach, shouldnt him add in some young potential england player in the squad?? i am really curious of why heskey is inside.</p>
              <p>he said he would bring in only fit player to the team, why is there so many unfit player in the squad??</p>
              <p>jole cole is creative in creating chances, why isnt him used??</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>No rift: John Terry insists the England team is fully behind Fabio Capello</em></p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1288083" rel="1288083|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2010/article-1288083/Were-boss-John-Terry-denies-claims-rift-players-England-boss-Fabio-Capello.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>John Terry has said the England squad is 'fully behind' manager Fabio Capello. </strong><strong>The Italian tactician has come under fire after England's disappointing start to their World Cup campaign, which has seen them manage draws against the United States and Algeria.</strong></p>
              <p>In the wake of Friday night's goalless draw with Algeria there had been speculation of a rift between the players and manager, but Terry flatly refuted those claims. </p>
              <p>'We shouldn't be looking at excuses or criticising the manager,' he said.</p>
              <p>'We're here, we're supporting and we are fully behind him. We know we've got his support as well and that's the main thing.</p>
              <p>'I've seen a few reports myself this morning. Coming here on behalf of the players there's no unrest in the camp at all.</p>
              <p>'We're obviously still disappointed from the game the other night, but we have to pick ourselves up. We have to win the game on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>There have been numerous calls for the inclusion of Joe Cole and Terry backs his former Chelsea team-mate to deliver, should he be introduced to the action having been an unused substitute in the opening two matches.</p>
              <p>'I think so, we've seen with Chelsea,' added Terry. 'I personally think he and Wayne are the only two in the side who can really open up things and are key to breaking down defences. If he's called on Joe will do a great job.'</p>
              <p>Terry revealed there would be a clear-the-air meeting between the players and the coaching staff.</p>
              <p>'We've got a meeting tonight to see where we went wrong,' he said.</p>
              <p>'That's probably the whole 93 minutes. Everyone needs to get off their chest exactly how they're feeling.'</p>
              <p>He added: 'If it upsets him (Capello) or it upsets any player then so be it.'</p>
              <p>Terry dismissed Capello's suggestion that World Cup pressure was getting to the players, adding: 'I think, naturally, at any level there is always a bit of nerves but once you step over the white line, that's not an issue.'</p>
              <p>The Chelsea player, stripped of the England captaincy by Capello, admitted the players have been bored at their Rustenburg base where they have been separated from their partners and banned from playing video games.</p>
              <p>'There is a little but of boredom kicking in,' said Terry.</p>
              <p>'That's where as group of players we need to stick together.'</p>
              <p>Terry added: 'I don't want to go home on Wednesday, I'm here to win it.'</p>

              <p>England isn't doing all that bad liao...  Holland was quite lucky in both their matches...  Against Denmark they got an own goal to settle them and even against Japan, they again got lucky with the goalkeeper's mistake to win that match 1-0...</p>
