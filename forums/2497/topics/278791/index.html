"Since day one, I've been trying to make our team play attacking, aggressive football and so far, I think, we have done that. That's our style now.<br><br>"Of course, it's a totally different proposition, playing England at Wembley," the Dutchman said. "But we're not going there just to defend. If we sit back for 90 minutes, sooner or later they'll punish us," he added. "We'll have to attack but we will have to defend as well. I see it as a high tempo game with both sides looking to score."<br><br></div>

They top the group with 20 points, ahead of Russia (18 ) and England (17) -- who meet each other at Wembley on Wednesday.<br><br>"We are hoping for Russia and England to draw," Bilic was quoted as saying by spornet.hr, a Croatian sports Web site. "But really, we only need to look at our own games. We are 90 percent secure. If we beat Andorra and Israel, I think we are definitely in. "Likewise, one blunder and we can drop the ball completely."<br><br>Bilic said he was very pleased with his team's commitment, and added it had to be sustained to the end of the campaign. "Playing Andorra at home is a game one must win... But playing Andorra away, on their pitch, that's something else.<br><br>"We will not be relaxed, we shall treat this game like any other," he said.<br>"We are now in a position where we wanted to be and we deserved it. But this position forces you to treat any further games with utmost seriousness. And that's what this team has."<br></div>

Midfielders Owen Hargreaves and Frank Lampard have already been ruled out of the crucial tie because of injury. But the remaining 25 members of the squad took part in training at London Colney on Tuesday. </strong><br><br>Steven Gerrard has been passed fit after making it through Saturday's win over Israel, despite his broken toe. Midfielder Gerrard played without having a painkilling injection but suffered from cramp and was substituted after 71 minutes. However, the Liverpool star told BBC Sport: "I'm fit for selection on Wednesday and the toe is feeling good."<br><br>But Manchester United midfielder Hargreaves has returned to Old Trafford and Lampard has gone back to Chelsea to receive treatment on their thigh injuries. The absence of Hargreaves and Lampard is likely to mean Gareth Barry keeps his place in the England side after an impressive display against Israel.<br><br>Gerrard was delighted with the way his new midfield partnership with Aston Villa's Barry worked at Wembley. He said: "Myself and Gareth were happy with how it went. I think the secret was that we know each other from a long time back, from Euro 2000, and we are good friends off the pitch. "The communication was there from the off on Saturday and the balance was right. It just seemed to work. "We only worked on it a couple of days before the game and we seemed to hit it off straight away. Gareth deserves credit for the way he played."<br><br>Peter Crouch is available again after his ban and competes with Emile Heskey to partner Michael Owen up front. In the absence of the injured David Beckham, Shaun Wright-Phillips is likely to continue on the right flank at Wembley after his man-of-the-match display there on Saturday. The Chelsea winger says club team-mate Joe Cole has played a part in his recent resurgent form after a difficult first season at Stamford Bridge. He said: "Joe Cole is an idol for everybody and I am a believer that you can learn from every player you work with. "To have someone who has been through it is a plus. Me and Coley are really good friends and chat about all sorts of things. "The most important thing is that we enjoy each other's company and there is a tight bond there."<br></div>

If McClaren let these past 2 games get into his head and think that they are out of the woods... I would be very worry for the England team.<br><br>Winning Israel &amp; Russia at home isn't something i would consider a great achievement... If anything, i would have said, it should have been expected. But then again, with the state of the England team since McClaren took over, winning these 2 home matches is already seen as a big deal...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But they seem to have forgotten that they just lost to Germany at home not too long ago only...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
