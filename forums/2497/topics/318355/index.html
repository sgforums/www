              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Australia goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer has announced he has agreed to move to Fulham from Premier League rivals Middlesbrough.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The deal comes after drawn-out negotiations with Boro broke down.</p>
              <p>Schwarzer will move to Craven Cottage on a two-year deal, double the length offered by the club he served for 11 years.</p>
              <p>The 35-year-old touched down in Sydney on Thursday ahead of the
              Socceroos' four World Cup qualifiers next month and explained his
              decision to the media.</p>
              <p>"I thought it was important to sort it out sooner rather than
              later so it didn't affect preparations for the qualifiers," Schwarzer
              said.</p>
              <p>"I was very confident something would be sorted out.</p>
              <p>"I had a few other options but felt this was the best one for me.</p>
              <p>"I don't think anyone can say anything negative about my stay at Middlesbrough, I fulfilled every contract I had with them."</p>
              <p>Schwarzer had been linked with Bayern Munich in Germany as well as a possible move to Italy.</p>
              <p>Schwarzer's fitness is under a cloud heading into Australia's
              friendly with Ghana on Friday night but he is expected to play in the
              upcoming qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup.</p>

              <h1>Schwarzer: Buffon Made Me Reject Juve</h1>
              <h2>Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer has revealed that he
              rejected moves to both Juventus and Bayern Munich in order to sign for
              Fulham.</h2>
              <p>Schwarzer completed his free transfer move to the Cottagers after rejecting
              an extension to his current deal at Boro that runs out next month.</p>
              <p>A host of top clubs were interested in signing the 35-year-old, who has
              confirmed that two of these were Juventus and Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>"There were offers on the table but the only thing that mattered to me
              was regular first-team football," he said on <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"And obviously someone like Juventus you don't have to be Einstein to
              work out that you have Buffon there and it is very unlikely you are going to
              play too many games under Buffon as he is such a world class keeper.</p>
              <p>"And with Bayern Munich it was a similar situation with their
              goalkeeping situation.</p>
              <p>"I want to qualify for the next World Cup and hopefully be part of that
              so I had to go somewhere I would be considered No.1."</p>
              <p>Schwarzer has been at Middlesbrough for 11 years, having signed for them in
              1997 from Bradford
               City. Previous to this he
              enjoyed a spell in Germany
              with Kaiserslautern
              and Dynamo Dresden.</p>
