              <p><strong>Twenty-one months after Manchester City began their torturous pursuit of Roque Santa Cruz, the club’s supporters may finally get their first glimpse of the Paraguay striker as he prepares to make a long overdue debut at home to West Ham United in the Barclays Premier League this evening.</strong></p>
              <p>City’s interest in Santa Cruz pre-dates Mark Hughes’s arrival as manager at the club in the summer of last year, but despite finally getting their man after what amounted to a seventh bid was accepted by Blackburn Rovers in June, the agonising wait to blood him continued as he was sidelined by a troubling knee injury.</p>
              <p>Having spent the past three months recuperating, however, Santa Cruz is expected to be given a chance against West Ham to show why City persevered for so long trying to sign him.</p>
              <p>“We could have brought him back sooner but given the fact that we had good options up front, we had no need to rush him back,” Hughes said. “We had a game behind closed doors against Wrexham last week and he looked in good fettle. It is good to see him on the training ground, playing in games and looking in good nick.”</p>
              <p>With Carlos Tévez and Craig Bellamy expected to lead City’s attack once again, Santa Cruz may have to settle for a place on the substitutes’ bench, but he will be involved at some point.</p>
              <p>Quite where Santa Cruz will figure in City’s plans once Robinho, the Brazil forward who is injured, and Emmanuel Adebayor, the Togo striker who completes his three-match ban for violent conduct, return remains to be seen.</p>
              <p>With Bellamy impossible to drop at the moment and Tévez the fans’ favourite, it would appear to be a straight choice for Hughes between his two big men up front — Adebayor and Santa Cruz — but while the African’s form so far has made him indispensable when available, Hughes is a big admirer of the Paraguayan. So what does £18 million buy you?</p>
              <p>“He is a big guy, his physical presence is important for us and he is quick, strong, brave and good in the air,” Hughes said. “Technically, he is good enough and he is a great character and that is part and parcel of what I am looking to bring to the club.”</p>
              <p>Unfazed by Santa Cruz’s history of injury problems, Hughes paid Bayern Munich £3.3 million to bring the striker to Blackburn in July 2007, a decision that paid handsome dividends as the player plundered 23 goals in his first season with the club.</p>
              <p>“I will always remember the first training session he had at Blackburn and the reaction the other players showed when they saw what he had produced,” Hughes said. “He has the ability to make people sit up and take notice.</p>
              <p>“He has been at the biggest club in Germany so he is used to performing under pressure and at a club with a big profile. He has the mentality I need. I blew all of my budget on him when I was at Blackburn so that shows you what I thought of him. If he can replicate even half of what he did there, then he will be good value.”</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester City (probable; 4-2-3-1):</strong> S Given — P Zabaleta, K Touré, J Lescott, W Bridge — N De Jong, G Barry — S Wright-Phillips, S Ireland, C Bellamy — C Tévez.</p>

              <p><strong>Sick Stephen Ireland forced out of Manchester City's meeting with West Ham<br></strong></p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/09/28/article-0-06831919000005DC-790_468x307.jpg" alt="stephen ireland" width="468" height="307"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Struggling: Ireland (right) is unlikely to line up against the Hammers</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Stephen Ireland looks set to miss </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City's</strong></span><strong> Barclays Premier League clash with </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>West Ham</strong></span><strong> tonight after contracting a sickness bug.</strong>  </p>
              <p>Ireland's presence had initially been in doubt when he was taken to hospital on Wednesday night after complaining of dizziness during the Carling Cup win over <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/fulham.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Fulham</span></a>.  </p>
              <p>The midfielder was subsequently released, with his symptoms diagnosed as nothing more serious than extreme tiredness. </p>
              <p>However, his hopes of facing Gianfranco Zola's men seem to have collapsed amid reports Ireland contracted a virus late last week which saw him ordered home from the City training ground.</p>
              <p>Gareth Barry had suffered from the same problem, but his recovery has apparently been quicker and he should face the Hammers as City look to move back into the top four. </p>
              <p>If, as expected, Ireland does miss out, manager Mark Hughes will face a selection dilemma as he does not have an obvious like-for-like replacement.  </p>
              <p>Should Micah Richards recover from a shoulder problem, Pablo Zabaleta could move into midfield alongside Barry and Nigel de Jong.  </p>
              <p>Martin Petrov is another alternative in a more orthodox 4-4-2 formation, while there is also a chance £17million forward Roque Santa Cruz could be handed a starting berth for his debut after being sidelined since his summer move from Blackburn due to a knee operation.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLOS TEVEZ was already a hero to the City faithful - just for turning his nose up at Alex Ferguson. And now he is scoring goals as well. </h2>
              <p class="article">Tevez's two strikes last night were his first in the Premier League following his defection from the red side to the blue side of Manchester. And the force is now most definitely with City as they bounced back from their derby defeat to manager Ferguson's Manchester United. </p>
              <p class="article">They are up to fifth in the league, just three points off leaders United with a game in hand. These really are heady times at Eastlands. A host of former bosses were there last night but Tony Book, Peter Reid, Brian Horton, Joe Royle and the most recent departure Sven Goran Eriksson are now witnessing a City team like none they can remember. </p>
              <p class="article">They are now watching one with a real chance of glory under new boss Mark Hughes. Is it time to suggest they are contenders for the title? City have five wins from their first six league games and a squad overflowing with talent. </p>
              <p class="article">Striker Roque Santa Cruz - a £17million summer buy - came on for his debut last night and midfielder Michael Johnson, 21, also returned as a substitute. </p>
              <p class="article">There is also the promise of more additions in the New Year. One thing City do not have is the distraction of Europe - and that can only help in the league. </p>
              <p class="article">So why not the title? West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola thinks it is possible. He said: "Some of their play was absolutely outstanding and if they keep up this standard, they will definitely be up there."</p>
              <p class="article">Last night the team fashioned by a £250million spending spree were in sparkling form, with Tevez the star performer. Zola said: "I am angry with myself and the team. I don't think anyone including myself is giving or doing what they are capable of." </p>
              <p class="article">When his side drew level in the 24th minute, it was against the run of play. A foul by Luis Jimenez on Nigel De Jong gave City a free-kick five yards outside the area. Petrov took charge and curled the ball past the wall and the dive of Rob Green. </p>
              <p class="article">Not surprisingly, Craig Bellamy did not get the same reception as Tevez from the fans he left behind when he joined City last January. It does not bother the Welshman, you sense he thrives on his anti-hero status. But the City fans love him and last night he was as fast and furious as ever. It was from his floated free-kick that City extended their lead. </p>
              <p class="article">A poor challenge by Julien Faubert earned City the kick and Bellamy put the ball in for Tevez to direct his header across Green and in. Bellamy turned to manager Hughes pumping his fists with joy, the game was won.</p>
