              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard spent the night in police cells after he was arrested early today in connection with a brawl at a restaurant. The </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>star was among six men arrested when officers were called to the Lounge Inn in Southport, Merseyside.</strong></p>
              <p>A 34-year-old local man was taken to hospital with facial injuries, which are not thought to be serious. Merseyside Police said the 28-year-old footballer and five other men were arrested on suspicion of assault.</p>
              <p>Gerrard was arrested after a disturbance at the Lounge Inn, a modern restaurant close to the junction of Bold Street and Stanley Street.</p>
              <p>The venue converts to a late-night club venue with live music and DJs. No one was available to comment today. The bar was closed this lunchtime but evidence that a fight had taken place inside could be seen through the windows. Spots of blood were clearly visible on the floor together with shards of broken glass.</p>
              <p>A Bentley car, which is believed to have been parked overnight, remained outside the club with a parking ticket attached.</p>

              <h1>Gerrard remains in police custody</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard remained in custody on Monday night after he was arrested over a nightclub brawl.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The England international was one of six men held after a fight outside a late-night bar in Southport, Merseyside.</p>
              <p>The venue's DJ, a 34-year-old local man, required hospital treatment after suffering facial injuries.</p>
              <p>Gerrard, 28, was at the restaurant and bar - which turns into a
              nightclub - with friends to celebrate Liverpool's 5-1 victory at
              Newcastle earlier on Sunday.</p>
              <p>After the game on Tyneside, Gerrard, who scored twice, hailed his table-topping side as the best he has played in.</p>
              <p>But several hours later, he was apparently caught up in an altercation outside the Lounge Inn in Bold Street.</p>
              <p>Police were called and arrested six men on suspicion of assault in nearby Lord Street.</p>
              <p>The town centre business remained shut on Monday but evidence of a fight inside could be seen through the windows.</p>
              <p>Spots of blood were clearly visible on the floor, along with shards of broken glass.</p>
              <p>Gerrard's wife Alex Curran, 26, left a coffee shop close to the
              police station in Southport where the father of her two children was
              being questioned.</p>
              <p>She refused to answer reporters' questions as she walked to her Bentley car and drove off towards Liverpool.</p>
              <p>The sister of the Lounge Inn co-owner, Dario Curcillo, said the
              footballer was in the club to celebrate his team's win over Newcastle.</p>
              <p>She said: "As far as I know, he comes here regularly and it was
              just a normal night at the bar. I don't know anything about what
              happened last night."</p>
              <p>Gerrard has been capped by England 70 times and has captained his country on four occasions.</p>
              <p>He was made an MBE last year and received an honorary fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's next match is against Preston in the FA Cup on Saturday.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman said: "Merseyside Police are investigating an
              assault that took place in the early hours of Monday December 29 on
              Bold Street in Southport.</p>
              <p>"At around 2.30am this morning, officers attended a disturbance at a licensed premises on Bold Street.</p>

              <p>"A 34-year-old man from Southport was taken to hospital with facial injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening."</p>
              <p>A Liverpool spokesman said the club would not be commenting on their captain's arrest.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">SOCCER star Steven Gerrard was charged with assault and affray last night over a bloody punch-up in which a DJ was badly beaten.</h2>
              <p class="article">Liverpool and England midfielder Gerrard, 28, was nicked with five pals after fighting broke out early yesterday. DJ Marcus McGee, 34, needed four stitches to head wounds.</p>
              <p class="article">Blood and shards of broken glass could still be seen on the floor of a pub yesterday after a punch-up which left England soccer hero Gerrard in police custody. A shocked witness said: “Someone made a comment and it all went off.”</p>
              <p class="article">Part-time DJ Marcus McGee was rushed to hospital after fighting broke out in the Lounge Inn bar-restaurant at around 2.30am yesterday. Detectives were speaking to witnesses and scouring CCTV from the bar and surrounding streets. It is understood there was a row involving the player and Marcus, who had taken over the decks while the bar’s regular DJ took a break.</p>
              <h4>Elbow</h4>
              <p class="article">Marcus was left in charge of a card which allowed the music to be changed — and Gerrard is said to have asked for a different tune. But he refused to hand over the card, saying he could not alter the music policy.</p>
              <p class="article"><em>A  reveller said: “Marcus pushed Gerrard in the chest and, almost instinctively, Gerrard hit back with his elbow in Marcus’s mouth.</em></p>
              <p class="article">“Gerrard stepped back and walked away but his mates piled on top of Marcus and one of them smashed a beer bottle over his head. The whole thing lasted less than ten seconds.</p>
              <p class="article">“Gerrard was pulled out of the scrapping and it turned into a free-for-all. The doormen all ran in and the club seemed to empty in seconds. We didn’t see who went where.</p>
              <p class="article">“People were rushing to Marcus’s side. He had a light-coloured shirt on and it was stained with blood.”</p>
              <p class="article">The DJ, a father of two young girls, needed four stitches to a head wound, had a tooth knocked out and suffered a suspected broken nose. The witness said there had been bad feeling in the bar earlier. He went on: “Marcus came into the club with two pals and some time later Gerrard walked in.</p>
              <p class="article">“One of Gerrard’s mates had a dispute with one of Marcus’s pals and they eyeballed each other. “Marcus stepped in as peacemaker and it calmed down for a while. “Everyone was drinking and having a good time. But when Marcus’s mates left, he was on his own and it was then that him and Gerrard started rowing by the dance floor.”</p>
              <p class="article">There was no sign of it kicking off. Then it went crazy.” Marcus stayed silent at his home in Southport last night. His mum Patricia, 61, said: “He had only gone for a quiet night out with his partner.</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“He has ended up losing a tooth and the whole family is shaken up. I’m looking after his two little girls. We can’t believe that this happened. Fighting like this is just pathetic.”</p>
              <p class="article">Police had raced to the bar after the bust-up and arrested Gerrard and five pals. A nearby newsagent said: “My milkman told me that there were police officers and forensics outside the club at about 5.30am after a fight had taken place.”</p>
              <p class="article">Gerrard was held overnight and it is understood police started questioning him and his mates yesterday lunchtime. Nine hours later he was still being quizzed.</p>
              <p class="article">He was released after almost 21 hours at 11.25pm.</p>
