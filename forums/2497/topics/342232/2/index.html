              <p><strong>Reds pledge support for skipper</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/liverpool/gerrard_training_480.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool have thrown their full support behind club captain Steven
              Gerrard after the England international was charged with assault and
              affray in the early hours of Tuesday morning.</strong></p>
              <p>The charge relates to an incident that occurred outside a Southport
              nightclub and left a 34-year-old man requiring hospital treatment for
              facial injuries.</p>
              <p>Gerrard was arrested along with five other men in the early hours of
              Monday morning and, on Tuesday, was charged and bailed along with John
              Doran, 29, and Ian Smith, 19.</p>
              <p>The three men will now appear at North Sefton Magistrates’ Court on
              January 23 having been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily
              harm and affray.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, currently three points clear at the top of The Premier
              League and hunting their first title since 1990, have now pledged their
              total support for the skipper as he deals with the fallout from the
              alleged incident.</p>
              <p>A statement on the club’s official website read: "Steven has been an
              outstanding servant to Liverpool for the last ten years and the club
              will give him all the support he needs at this time."</p>

              <h1>Steven Gerrard charged with assault and affray after alleged brawl</h1>
              <h2>Steven Gerrard, the Liverpool and England footballer, has been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, police have said, after an argument over music being played in a restaurant allegedly escalated into a violent brawl.</h2>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span class="caption"><em>Liverpool FC captain Steven Gerrard (right) pictured with a Liverpool fan earlier on in the evening at the Lounge Bar in Southport before Gerrard was arrested.</em> </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Gerrard, 28, was charged early on Tuesday morning over the alleged fracas in which Marcus McGee, a company director, lost a tooth and needed four stitches to a head wound.</strong></p>
              <p>He was released from custody at Southport police station almost two hours earlier after police interviewed him and the other five men, aged between 18 and 33 - none of whom are team-mates of Gerrard - for most of the day.</p>
              <p>Meryside police said Gerrard and two other men were charged with ABH and affray. The other three have been bailed pending further inquiries. Inspector Swan, spokesman for Merseyside Police, said in a statement: "Merseyside Police have charged Steven Gerrard, 28, of Formby, John Doran, 29, Ian Smith , 19, both of Huyton with Assault causing Actual Bodily Harm and affray following an incident in Bold Street, Southport.</p>
              <p>"All three men will appear at North Sefton magistrates on Jan 23rd. "Three other men who were interviewed over the same incident have been bailed. "They were released earlier tonight."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01213/gerrard-460_1213395d.jpg"><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01213/gerrard-460_1213395d.jpg" alt="Steven Gerrard released from custody after questioning over alleged brawl " width="288" height="179"></a></p>
              <p><em>Gerrard and two other men were charged</em> <em>under section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act, carry up to five years in jail.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The charges, under section 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act, carry up to five years in jail. Wearing a white t-shirt and smart black trousers, Gerrard attempted to cover his face with his hands before being driven away in a black Citroen Xsara people carrier, believed to be driven by his father.</strong></p>
              <p>The Liverpool captain had been celebrating Sunday's 5-1 win over Newcastle United, in which he scored twice, when a row is said to have broken out involving Mr McGee about the music being played at The Lounge Inn in Southport, Merseyside.</p>
              <p>Gerrard is understood to have asked Mr McGee, a friend of the restaurant's owner, if he could borrow a swipe card which staff must use to operate the music system behind the bar.</p>
              <p>Mr McGee is said to have refused to provide his card. Mr McGee, 34, a father of two, also suffered cuts to his face and a swollen eye. He declined to talk about the incident as he recovered at his home in Southport, but his mother Patricia said: "He was just out for a drink with his partner and I have no idea how he became involved in this.</p>
              <p>"He lost a tooth and the whole family is really shaken up. I'm looking after his two little girls at the moment and we just can't believe this has happened."</p>
              <p>Gerrard, who lives in Formby, Merseyside, is a regular customer at the Lounge Inn, where spots of blood and shards of broken glass could still be seen on the floor on Monday.</p>
              <p>John Watts, whose daughter Eve had been celebrating her 35th birthday at The Lounge Inn, said Gerrard appeared to be sober and in good spirits shortly before the alleged attack.</p>
              <p>He said: "When Steven Gerrard found out it was my daughter's birthday he bought her a bottle of champagne. He seemed in very good spirits. He wasn't drunk at all. He and his party were in a separate room and I believe some of the people who were with him were footballers, though I couldn't name them."</p>
              <p>Mr Watts, who left the venue 15 minutes before the alleged fight, added: "It was a really civilised occasion in a middle-class bar."</p>

              <p><br>It doesn't really matter whats the verdict cos Gerrard was indeed there at the scene, part of the group of 3 that hurt the guy... and is now charged. When you think of it, its actually a very serious offence... Not just some punch up in a bar with another guy... A person actually lost a tooth and needed four stitches to a head wound when a bottle was smash onto the victims head.</p>
              <p>Even if Gerrard manage to pay the victim off to drop the charges or he being famous gets away from the law, the people will alway doubt him...</p>

              <p>Have anyone ever consider how serious is it to take a hard liquor bottle and smashing it on someone else head? It can actually kill the man...</p>
              <p>Thats how serious this offence is... Unlike Barton who fought with his hands only... There was actually a weapon used here that could result in someone's death...</p>
              <p>I feel that Gerrard deserve jail time for this crime cos its worse than what Barton did.</p>

              <p><br>I am not sure but I don't think he was the one to use the bottle... It was possibly his ka kia who whack the DJ with the bottle because he refused to play Gerrard's request... A fight broke out and the group pound on the lone DJ... Gerrard was the leader of the pack lah... Like a gangster boss...</p>
