              <p><strong>Lucas Leiva has hinted that he may have to leave Liverpool to revive his international career. </strong></p>
              <p>The former Brazil Under-20 captain played his part in
              Liverpool’s stunning 4-1 demolition of Manchester United on Saturday,
              yet he still remains a bit-part player for The Reds.</p>
              <p>Fighting with Xabi Alonso and Javier Mascherano for a midfield
              slot, Lucas has often suffered the chop as a result of some
              less-than-impressive displays.</p>
              <p>Despite costly contributions at Wigan and Everton in particular
              this season, the Brazilian still believes he deserves more starts for
              the Anfield club.</p>
              <p>Having won the bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics last summer
              Lucas was only called up twice by Brazil in 2008, and the former Inter
              target admits he might need to consider his international future.</p>
              <p>“I consider that I play a lot, but the internal competition is very high,” Lucas told Folha.</p>
              <p>“The situation doesn’t worry me right now because my objective
              has always been to be playing in order to be back with the national
              team.</p>
              <p>“Once the season is over I will see what the best option is for
              me. Everybody wants to be playing in the World Cup and I will push to
              have this chance.</p>
              <p>“You have to play all the time if you want to be called up.”</p>
              <p>Far from blaming Rafa Benitez for his current situation, Lucas
              appears to be mystified by coach Carlos Dunga’s decision not to call
              him up.</p>
              <p>“I can hardly explain what happened, but Dunga makes his own decisions.</p>
              <p>“I was in the squad in the last four World Cup qualifiers and played against Bolivia, during which the team didn’t play well.</p>
              <p>“I believe that I’m part of a list of 30 or 40 players, but I’m out of the 22-men squad.”</p>

              <p><strong>Lucas Leiva has admitted he has yet to win over the majority of Liverpool fans, but claims he is improving day by day. </strong></p>
              <p>The Brazilian has come in for fierce criticism from Reds fans who have been far from impressed with his efforts this season.</p>
              <p>Lucas spoke to the South American press at the weekend and
                  claimed me may be forced to move on if he fails to nail down a regular
                  start at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Despite this, the midfielder feels he has a long-term future at Anfield and is determined to win over the club’s fans.</p>
              <p>"I think I'm improving and I have more confidence every day,"
                  the 22-year-old told the club’s official website "The team is playing
                  well too, which also helps. Everyone is on fire - all these things help
                  me.</p>
              <p>"I don't think about what some of the people say. I have to concentrate on the team. Rafa always gives me a lot of confidence.</p>
              <p> "I know some people don't trust me yet but I will try to show them my quality, and I think I've now started doing that.</p>
              <p>"When you have games in a row you get more confidence. You get
                  some rhythm. It is more difficult when you play just one or two games a
                  month but I have to work hard, try to improve every day and try to get
                  to my best level."</p>
              <p>Lucas claims his fellow midfield cohorts Javier Mascherano and Xabi Alonso have helped him bed in on Merseyside.</p>
              <p>"They help me a lot. Javier is my room mate, so we are always talking," said Lucas.</p>
              <p>"He and Xabi Alonso have a lot of experience and they've won a
                  lot of titles already. I am trying to improve with them, and also with
                  Stevie - he helps me a lot.</p>
              <p>"They tell me to play with confidence and that I have quality."</p>
