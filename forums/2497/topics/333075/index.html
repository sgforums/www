              <p>Ronaldinho is predicting he will soon recapture his best form and admitted that he has been given a new lease of life following his move from Barcelona to AC Milan this summer.</p>

              <p>The Brazil international was named FIFA World Player of the Year in 2004 and 2005 but rarely played last season for Barca with injury woes and lack of form seeing him lose his starting spot with the Catalan giants.</p>
              <p>But the South American star is eager to again delight the world, telling <em>Gazzetta dello Sport</em>: ''I hope I can return to be number one in the world in little time. I am working intensely to achieve this.''</p>
              <p>"I'm at a stage of adapting to my new circumstances and my only concern right now is to regain my form and add consistency to my performances. This year I have played little and won nothing. But in 2009, if I am in good condition, I will be among the favourites for the Ballon d'Or.''</p>
              <p>Ronaldinho, who signed a three-year contract with the Milan outfit and was the Rossoneri's top summer signing at Euros21million, has no regrets over his decision to leave La Liga after five seasons with Barca.</p>
              <p>''It was simple,'' he said. ''A cycle had ended at Barcelona. We had won everything and what happened next was part of life.''</p>
              <p>However, the move to the San Siro has denied Ronaldinho the chance to play in the Champions League this season as Milan having failed to qualify for the tournament after a fifth-placed finish in Serie A last term.</p>
              <p>''I miss the Champions League because it is the most beautiful tournament,'' he said who won the competition in 2006 with Barca. ''But at Milan we want to win the UEFA Cup and the Scudetto.''</p>
              <p>Milan fans had to be patient to see Ronaldinho open his scoring account in the Italian top flight, but when it came it proved to be memorable as it came in the 1-0 win over city rivals Internazionale on September 28.</p>
              <p>''It was one of the most beautiful and important goals of my career,'' he admitted. ''I hope that it will be the first of many in the Rossoneri colours. It was beautiful to score the winner in an important game like the Milan derby, it was an intense feeling.</p>
              <p>"I want to thank the fans for the support they have shown me since the first day. I cannot make any promises to the fans, only tell them that I will give my best.''</p>
