The Frenchman took charge in the summer but has presided over a disappointed season so far, with Rangers 17 points behind leaders Celtic in the Bank of Scotland Premier League.<br><br>He stripped the popular Barry Ferguson of the captaincy on Monday, and dropped him from the squad for the next day's match at Motherwell in the Bank of Scotland Premier League. Le Guen claimed Ferguson had attempted to exert undue influence on the Rangers squad, and argued that the 28-year-old was undermining his authority.<br><br>It appeared that one of the two men would have to leave, Le Guen was hugely successful in French football with Lyon, helping them win three successive Ligue 1 titles. However he struggled to make the transition to the Scottish game.<br><br>Reserve-team coach Ian Durrant will take charge of training on Friday. Rangers play Dunfermline on Sunday in the Scottish Cup.<br><br><strong>PAUL LE GUEN FACTFILE</strong><br><br>2002: Joins French champions Lyon, taking over from Jacques Santini.<br><br>2003-2005: Leads Lyon to three successive Ligue 1 titles. The club also reach the Champions League quarter-finals in 2004 and 2005.<br><br>2005, May 9: Announces he will not renew his contract with Lyon which ends on June 30 and is linked with a move to join countryman Arsene Wenger at Arsenal.<br><br>2006: February - Le Guen confirms discussions with Rangers to replace Alex McLeish, who has announced he will step down in the summer.<br><br>March 11 - Agrees three-year deal to become new Rangers manager at the start of 2006-2007 season.<br><br>August 7 - Police confirm Le Guen was confronted and verbally abused by rival fans after watching Old Firm rivals Celtic's match at Hearts.<br><br>November 8 - After a poor start to the league season, Rangers hit rock bottom in terms of morale after a 2-0 defeat to Division One side St Johnstone in the CIS Insurance Cup. Le Guen said: "I have lost games before but this one was one of the worst."<br><br>December 27 - Rangers crash 2-1 to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the Bank of Scotland Premier League. Their second league defeat to Inverness in the season leaves Rangers third in the SPL, 17 points behind leaders Celtic and two points behind Aberdeen.<br><br>2007: January 1 - Drops Barry Ferguson from the squad for the match against Motherwell and strips the midfielder of the captaincy.<br><br>January 2 - Reveals he dropped Ferguson because he felt he was being undermined by the player. "He tries to have too much influence. Even if I don't agree with him on the role of the captain, and I don't think he is as important as he thinks," said Le Guen, who accepted the decision may cost him his job.<br><br>January 4 - Leaves Rangers by mutual consent<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This guy was asking for it... You sack the captain of the team and he happens to be the national team captain too... and also the most popular player in the country. Himself, his team is 17 points away from the leader on the table... What do you expect the club to do? Keep him when he has not bring them any success or keep their country's captain at the club whereby their fans will be happy and throw him away...?<br><br>Stupid move... I guess he never heard of something called Players power.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
