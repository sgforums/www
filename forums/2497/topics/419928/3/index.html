              <p>aiya...focus on the next game la. Spurs. All this will be forgotten come season end. Berba has never dived before, has he? I don't recall him being a cheater. If you think he has, then so be it la. Only he can tell the truth.</p>
              <p>This topic of diving reminds me of juergen klinnsman. He dived quite a lot in his heydays but hell, he was legendary too.</p>

              <p>Err... I think you are somehow a little lost here...</p>
              <p>First of all, You are the one making an accusation here and not me remember this... Since it's you who is making the accusing statement, then the ounce is on you to prove your point to us without any doubts... and definitely not me.</p>
              <p>The pictures I took from the video you so kindly provided, shows a clear offence that you so conveniently left out from yours... I am assuming you watched the whole clip prior to the offence right? Cos I am just wondering how did you miss out something so obvious? If I didn't post the others pics in my reply, then people may just take yours to be the case and not seen it from another angle... So am I wrong to say it was tailored to suit your argument? Cos clearly you left out more relevant moments of the clip intentionally or not you should know...</p>
              <p>Now to your 2nd and 3rd post... My point has never changed for even a second... Go read from the beginning again if you can understand my meaning...</p>
              <p>My exact words... "I thought the clip on his heel might not have enough to bring him down, it might have made him lose his balance but a combine clip at his heel and a push from the back... "</p>
              <p>My point was made in one single statement but when you deliberately separate them, you are trying to make it seem I was changing tracks when in fact I have not... Cheeky, but underhand...</p>
              <p>Now on to your 3rd post... You should seriously try to keep all in one post...</p>
              <p>I am always ready to answer any questions you may have, even silly ones... But first of all, I like to know how on earth did you came to the conclusion that "we both agreed there's no contact"... lol. Seriously, since when did I say THAT? Go back and read every word carefully then tell me at which point did I say that can? I also would like to know...</p>
              <p>But I think it could be you again who can't understand my simple sentence and misconstrued it to become something else... Is it from the 2nd page, number 6 post, last paragraph? I suggest you read all 9 words lah and not just 6 only then stop half-way... lol.</p>
              <p>Finally, seems like you have been push into a corner for an answer until you made a silly statement like in your 2nd of your 3 posts, last sentence... Though I asked 3 time but can't answer also no need to force yourself mah...</p>
              <p>Really meh? A player running from behind, Foot cutting into another's path and not getting the ball is neither a foul nor penalty" ? Ok lah, if it makes you happy... I am just happy I wasn't the one seen making that statement... I will just quote it just in case... lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, the way you post and misconstrue words remind me of someone... I wasn't sure earlier but after a few post, I am quite sure who it could be now... lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, nevermind... What's in a name right? It's the substance that matters... lol.</p>

              <p><br>Yeah what's wrong with that question? It's just a simple Yes or No for you I belief... There are even pictures and videos to assist if you need help... Does it in anyway indicate to you I agreed with you that there's no contact? Really ? How did you came to that conclusion... Again I suspect it's from the 2nd page, number 6 post, last paragraph, first 6 words instead of 9? lol...</p>
              <p>Now after a few post, you are seriously asking me my exact version? Please read properly can... I maintain the same reason all the way... You just have to read carefully and hopefully understand them better...</p>
              <p>And on to your questions... Err... If you must know why I didn't squeeze a reply to your 2 simple questions in my big wall of text... Do you think it has something to do with your mis-interpretation in the first place? Yeah, take that minute and think why... as you are reading now... Did it came to you yet?</p>
              <p>Well I hope it does...</p>
              <p>Could it be your 1st question is already incorrect so how to give an answer? There was never a <strong>"since we both agreed there's no contact"</strong> Do you understand what I am getting at? I sincerely hope you do for your own sake...  </p>
              <p>I have a few new ones though you conveniently seem to miss out...</p>
              <p>So after making a statement together with pictures, do you think the ounce is on you to back-up your accusation?</p>
