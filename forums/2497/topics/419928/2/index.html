              <p>Any players know that once they are in the penalty boxes, and any contact can be rewarded by a penalty or yellow depending on angle of contact and call by referee.</p>
              <p>this may be a "soft" touch, but given this is @ OT, I am sure the ref is "influenced" to give the penalty.</p>

              <p>after seeing that clip so many times which in fact doesn't show the part where berba fell, you are able to conclude it's not a penalty...amazing. It's a soft touch, even the commentator and soccernet reported so and berba made the most out of it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, do you play football? Sometimes these things are hard to tell. You are running so fast that sometimes just a soft touch can get you to ground.</p>

              <p>Actually the clip is very good... Just watch Agger's left foot... Daniel Agger did clip  Berbatov's right heel. It is soft but, no matter how soft it is, he shouldn't be doing that in the first place not when the ball is so far away... If anything, it's Agger's poor positioning that let Berba in and in trying to make up...  He kind of panic tackle...</p>
              <p>A clear view would be to look at the full body picture... Look carefully where was the ball and where was Agger's left foot attacking? </p>
              <p>And don't just look at the foot, look at his right arm as well... He shouldn't be pushing him from the back either...</p>
              <p>Looks more like he was going for the man rather than the ball...</p>
              <p>Howard Webb was brave and made the right decision cos most referees wouldn't dare to give the home side a penalty in the first minute even if it is one... That's why he is considered one of if not the best in the world currently... </p>
              <p>I felt the commentary seemed to favour Pool cos even Gerrard's outrageous two footed tackle on Carrick was deem ok at first and when Webb took out his red card,  they were like in disbelieve Gerrard can be sent off kind but once the replay was shown... They kind of accepted it and couldn't find other excuses to defend him...</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Howard Webb made 2 brave decisions and both were correct without a doubt...</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks for the clip...</p>

              <p>The red card was a correct decision...two foot tackle definitely off no matter how you defend it. but not the penalty IMO.</p>

              <p>maybe, this time, he went to the ground easier than usual, but in a sense, he took the best of an opportunity to profit his organisation in an impt fa cup tie. ( I don't condone diving/cheating also).</p>

              <p>this explanation can be used for 90% of dives lor</p>
              <p>dive just say dive la. he dived and got a penalty. ok, so what.
              liverpool (specifically gerrard) does that too. i saw maxi diving
              in the same match</p>

              <p>well... for me, technically, a dive is when no-one or nothing "touches" you, and U go over like a ton of brick.</p>
              <p>"Simulation" is the new word isn't it now??</p>
              <p>in this case, as I did not see it myself, I can't determine whether any "touches" him. If U watch the match, and over many angles, was he "touched"?</p>
              <p>now, maybe he did "go over" when he was not even "touched" and in this case, I would say that he 'dived'.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, Your picture had the wrong answer I am afraid... And who said I can't be bothered to see? I have seen it very carefully and even enlarge it for a better view and still came to the same conclusion... And that is, your picture only show the poor angle of the foul as I had mentioned earlier...</p>
              <p>Such pictures are usually tailored to suit ones argument like in this case yours... Cos it doesn't even show the defender's foot cutting infront of the attacker's causing obstruction to progress...</p>
              <p>The pictures I put up were taken from the video clip you so kindly provide to us... And it gave us a better and clearer view of the offence that took place...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I put it to you again and if you feel like entertaining us, kindly give us your answer to my earlier questions...</p>
              <p>Did Agger's foot cut into Berbatov's path while he was running? (Kindly refer to pictures and video)</p>
              <p>And last, did Agger get any touch of the ball during this whole process? (Kindly refer to the video)</p>
              <p>Feel free to give us your reply, I am sure other are keen to know too...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Finally, just out of curiosity... Since you mentioned it, I really like to hear about the 20 other 'obstruction to progress without touching' that didn't end up a foul...</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Just curious, don't mind me... lol...</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
