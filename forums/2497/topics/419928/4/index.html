              <p>1. cutting into his path implies running (how do you cut into one's path if he's standing still?) but anyway, have it your way : <span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;"><em>what's your exact version of the story now? agger clipped &amp; pushed? or he cut into berb's path <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">while he was running</span></strong>? or agger cut, clip, push </em></span><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">while he was running</span></strong></em></span><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;"><em>, then shoot him for 4 hit combo?</em></span></p>
              <p>2. my 2nd question have no relevance to the first question: if bebartov didn't fall, would he have gotten the penalty?</p>

              <p>If you want answers, kindly give a proper reply... Don't just conveniently hide away from these...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yeah what's wrong with that question? It's just a simple Yes or No for you I belief... There are even pictures and videos to assist if you need help... Does it in anyway indicate to you I agreed with you that there's no contact? Really ? How did you came to that conclusion... Again I suspect it's from the 2nd page, number 6 post, last paragraph, first 6 words instead of 9? lol...</p>
              <p>Now after a few post, you are seriously asking me my exact version? Please read properly can... I maintain the same reason all the way... You just have to read carefully and hopefully understand them better...</p>
              <p>And on to your questions... Err... If you must know why I didn't squeeze a reply to your 2 simple questions in my big wall of text... Do you think it has something to do with your mis-interpretation in the first place? Yeah, take that minute and think why... as you are reading now... Did it came to you yet?</p>
              <p>Well I hope it does...</p>
              <p>Could it be your 1st question is already incorrect so how to give an answer? There was never a <strong>"since we both agreed there's no contact"</strong> Do you understand what I am getting at? I sincerely hope you do for your own sake...  </p>
              <p>I have a few new ones though you conveniently seem to miss out...</p>
              <p>So after making a statement together with pictures, do you think the ounce is on you to back-up your accusation?</p>
              <p>Was I wrong to say you tailored your pictures to suit your argument? Leaving out relevant moments of the clip intentionally?</p>
              <p>And you asked me, "who's the one being 'pushed into a corner'?"</p>
              <p>Well, if you must know... It's You.</p>
              <p>Cos you are using misquotes, half-quotes for your material... And when they are pointed out here, it makes you look silly. Honestly, not joking here...</p>
              <p>You wouldn't catch me making such a bizarre statement like... "anyway, guess what? foot cutting into path and not touching ball is neither a foul nor penalty"</p>
              <p>Tell that to the others, I think the other right-minded ones here won't want to be caught making such a statement either...  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Give me your reply and you will get your answers very quick...</p>
