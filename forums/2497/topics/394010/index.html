              <p><strong>Colin Hendry faces financial ruin over massive internet gambling debts, it emerged on Thursday.</strong> <strong>The former international footballer and ex-Blackburn player is to suffer fresh anguish after the death of his wife from complications caused by botched plastic surgery.</strong></p>
              <p>Spreadex, an online sports betting firm, has filed a bankruptcy petition against the former Scotland World Cup captain at Blackpool County Court. He is understood to owe the company £35,000.</p>
              <p>Yesterday the extent of Hendry's financial freefall was revealed - as he was forced to accept an undisclosed bid for his £1.7million Georgian home on the seafront at Lytham St Annes, Lancashire.</p>
              <p>It is understood there is an outstanding re-mortgage debt of nearly £1million on the house, which he bought outright for £750,000 in 2001.</p>
              <p>Hendry's legal advisers hinted the taxman was 'circling' for an Inland Revenue bill which friends estimate may be as high as £800,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/18/article-0-08BE548D000005DC-445_468x286.jpg" alt="hendry 2" width="468" height="286">

              <p><strong>And Blackburn County Court has ordered him to pay more than £90,000 to his former friend and neighbour, businessman Hector McFarlane.</strong></p>
              <p>Hendry does not dispute that he owes Mr McFarlane, 61, the money and accepts the debt. But it was the legal dispute over the original loan of £85,000 that revealed Hendry's financial 'house of cards'.</p>
              <p>He has been sinking in a sea of debt since the tragic death last year of his wife Denise, 44. The mother of four had suffered serious ill health since 2002 after a botched 'tummy tuck' operation.</p>
              <p>She underwent a series of operations but died from a brain infection. <br>Until yesterday, Hendry's friends claimed he had been left penniless because his devotion to his wife had prevented him from working.  </p>
              <div class="relatedItemsTopBorder">They said they were surprised by the gambling revelation. One said: 'Obviously Colin has always loved football but we never realised how much money he was gambling on the sport.'</div>
              <p>'It is so easy running up a gambling account when you are big name or putting on bets via the internet.</p>
              <p>It is understood Spreadex launched the bankruptcy action, scheduled for April 6, after Mr Hendry defaulted on an arrangement to pay off his debt with them.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption" style="text-align: left;"><em></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Speaking from Thailand, where he is staying with wife Williamina, 59, Mr McFarlane said: 'My wife and I will probably get about 3 per cent  -  the average payout for creditors in bankruptcy - of money we had saved for our retirement.</strong></p>
              <p>'The big question is where did his money go? He earned all that money as a player and then got £300,000 in compensation for what happened to Denise.</p>
              <p>'Colin also took my money and I know that he borrowed from others.'</p>
              <p>Hendry declined to comment.</p>
