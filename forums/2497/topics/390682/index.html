              <p><strong>CHELSEA have said Ashley Cole will be out for three months - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least</span> that's what they are hoping.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea left-back Cole enters hospital today for an operation to repair the fracture. He will be out for at least three months, will miss all England's World Cup warm-up games and maybe the tournament itself. <br><br>The side kick off their group matches in South Africa this summer against the USA on June 12. <br><br>Cole, ironically hurt in a clash with Everton's American international forward Landon Donovan during Chelsea's 2-1 defeat at Goodison Park on Wednesday, will certainly struggle to be fully fit by then. <br><br>One of the player's close friends revealed last night: "Ashley is simply devastated. <br><br>"This was the last thing he wanted to hear and all he can do is cling to the hope he can still make the World Cup.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Feeling the pain: Chelsea will assess injured Ashley Cole after the left-back suffered a 'nasty ankle knock' during the defeat at Everton</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ashley Cole is facing World Cup heartbreak after being ruled out for the rest of the season. And his broken ankle seems set to force Fabio Capello to bring Wayne Bridge into England's defence alongside John Terry, the man who had an infamous affair with the Manchester City full back's former partner.</strong></p>
              <p>Cole limped out of Chelsea's 2-1 defeat at Everton on Wednesday night after being caught on his left ankle by on-loan USA star Landon Donovan. He now faces a race to be fit to face Donovan again in England's opening group game in South Africa against the United States on June 12.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">The pair have been at odds following Terry's alleged affair with Bridge's former partner Vanessa Perroncel, the mother of the former Chelsea full-back's son.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Aside from the potential loss of a player widely regarded as the best left back in the world, Capello must now decide if he can risk playing Bridge and Terry together, given the bad blood caused by the affair.</p>
              <p>The news is also a severe blow to Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, who will have to cope without one of his most consistent performers for the title run-in and the club's assault on the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Yuri Zhirkov is the obvious stand-in at Chelsea but Capello has a far tougher selection conundrum, given the furore caused by Terry's liaison with Vanessa Perroncel.</p>
              <p>Terry, who was stripped of the England captaincy by Capello because of the affair, has flown to Dubai to be with his wife Toni and will miss Chelsea's FA Cup fifth-round tie with Cardiff tomorrow after being given leave to try to patch up his marriage.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Moment of horror: Ashley Cole's World Cup hopes were ironically plunged into doubt by Landon Donovan - the man set to lead USA against England in June</em></p>

              <p><strong>Capello must decide whether to select Bridge, who has recently returned for Manchester City after a two month lay-off with a knee injury, for England's friendly against Egypt at Wembley on March 3. The alternative would be to pick Everton's Leighton Baines or Stephen Warnock of Aston Villa, who is currently sidelined with a shin injury.</strong></p>
              <p>Bridge has been told he could jeopardise his chances of playing in the World Cup if he ducks out of the Egypt game. After taking such a tough stance with Terry last week, Capello has demanded that his players show their professionalism by moving on from the controversy.</p>
              <p>Cole is expected to be in plaster for around a month and if he is unable to play for Chelsea before the end of the season, his World Cup hopes would seem to rest on his proving his fitness in England's pre-tournament friendlies, which are expected to be against Mexico at Wembley on May 24 followed by a game against Japan in Austria.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: 'He has a big problem, probably out for three months, but we hope for Fabio and for the England team that he is ready for the World Cup. I hope that he may yet be ready before the end of the season for us, too.'</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>what would bridge do if JT scored a goal or if england won the match? will the pair fake their feelings and went up to shake hands for the sake of camera and camaraderie. deep down bridge must be feeling nauseous and want to puke. as for terry, he must be feeling embarrassed and guilty. poor old JT and bridge.</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>John Terry and Wayne Bridge just cannot stop bumping into each other. Yesterday's FA Cup quarter-final draw pencilled them in for another possible collision on March 6.</strong></p>
              <p>The love rivals will go face-to-face for the first time since the Vanessa Perroncel scandal broke next Sunday when Bridge's Manchester City travel to Chelsea's Stamford Bridge in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>They will then meet at an England get-together the next day for the Egypt friendly. Then there is the possibility of a mouth-watering FA Cup clash in west London - if City can overcome Stoke in their fifth round replay next week.</p>
              <p>Bridge, the former Chelsea left-back, plans to snub Terry's handshake before any clash between the pair - sparking further problems for England manager Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p>On-loan Portsmouth midfielder Jamie O'Hara was delighted to avoid parent club Tottenham in the draw.</p>
              <p>Instead financially-stricken Pompey will welcome Birmingham to Fratton Park – if they are not wound up in the High Court just days earlier.</p>
              <p>After starring in Pompey's 4-1 derby win over bitter rivals Southampton, the 23-year-old was desperate to lead the south-coast side to Wembley - where he insists he has unfinished business.</p>
              <p>O'Hara has twice been to Wembley with Spurs, and has nothing but painful memories. He was left out of Harry Redknapp's Carling Cup winning side that beat Chelsea in 2008 before missing a penalty in the shootout defeat to Manchester United in the same final last year.</p>
              <p>He said: "The big clubs are out of it, why not, we might get to Wembley, the semi-finals are at Wembley and it could be fantastic for everybody involved with Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>"As long as we don't get Tottenham, I'm happy, because I won't be able to play.</p>
              <p>"Obviously going to Wembley would be brilliant. I've been there twice, missed a  penalty and didn't play, so it hasn't been too great for me.</p>
              <p>"But if we can get there with Portsmouth hopefully it's third time lucky for me and we can bring a trophy here."</p>
              <p>Crystal Palace could set up an all Championship tie against either Reading or West Brom if they can get the better of Aston Villa at the second time of asking after a thrilling 2-2 draw yesterday.</p>
              <p>Spurs can set up a London derby with Fulham at Craven Cottage if they can see-off Bolton in their replay.</p>
