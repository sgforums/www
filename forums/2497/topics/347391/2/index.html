              <p>Well, if they didn't sack him... Then Chelsea could even miss out on the CL and I don't just mean the knock-out stage which is coming up very soon but next season's as well...</p>
              <p>If we take a long hard look at Scolari's time in charge, we have to be practical... Lost to a small club in the Carling cup despite starting with most of his first team squad, lost all of his matches against the other big 3, only getting one draw... I think these are very serious mistakes he made... We are now only in earlier Feb and they are or could already be 10 points behind the leader... I don't think Chelsea has even experience this ever since Roman came...</p>
              <p>One thing Chelsea fans should be happy with it is, Roman seem to take a very personal interest this time... I honestly belief he is doing it for the good of the club... Chelsea if continue with Phil, could very well end up in free fall to 5th place cos Phil has lost the plot in my opinion... Now I belief they won't end the season outside the 4th spot... And come Jun to Aug... Chelsea will spend big again after getting a new managr in place.  </p>

              <p class="article">As SunSport revealed yesterday, AC Milan chief Ancelotti is Chelsea’s No 1 choice to replace the axed Phil Scolari.</p>
              <p class="article">Milan chiefs admit he will leave the club this summer and the Blues expect him to be installed by June. In the meantime, Hiddink is expected to be confirmed tomorrow as interim boss and he will be highly paid for his few weeks’ work.</p>
              <p class="article">The ex-Holland coach will get a £1.5million basic salary. Then on top of that he could get a £500,000 bonus for winning the Champions League and the same again depending on performances in the league and FA Cup.</p>
              <p class="article">Hiddink, 62, has made it clear he will NOT take the job full-time and is only helping out as a favour to Roman Abramovich. He will continue as Russia’s national boss while at Stamford Bridge and return to that job in the summer to let Ancelotti take charge.</p>
              <p class="article">AC Milan director Umberto Gandini hinted at where Ancelotti’s future lies yesterday. He said: “If the Chelsea position is open in July, I think he might consider it.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ancelotti has won two Champions League trophies as AC Milan coach. Scolari, in charge for seven months, left Chelsea with a £7.1m compensation package yesterday.</p>

              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti has told Chelsea he will not leave AC Milan to coach the Blues next season.</strong></p>
              <p> Guus Hiddink will manage the side until the end of the season, but Ancelotti is reportedly owner Roman Abramovich's main candidate to replace Luiz Felipe Scolari in the long term.<br><br>However, AC Milan coach Ancelotti, who is under contract until June 2010, told calciomercato: "The only club that has made a move to sign me has been Chelsea.<br><br><strong>"In the summer I met Abramovich but I didn't want to leave AC Milan. The same thing happens now, I am not thinking about leaving."</strong><br><br>Ancelotti, 49, is the longest serving manager in Italy's top flight after joining the Rossoneri in 2001. And it is not the first time he has been linked with a move away from the San Siro.<br><br>"Even seven years ago this happened," Ancelotti added. "At this point of the season the same story comes out but I am not worried."</p>

              <p>to be fair, Chelsea needs a revamp or a overhaul..</p>
              <p>they are too used to Mourniho's methods and anything else, is not good enough.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the best players are ageing and not ready replacements so they will need some cleaning up soon..</p>
              <p>why not do it with a new manager? one way, it is good to see what happens when the big boss ties up his wallet cause then, it will be down to the managers/players to show their stuffs and not expect a kaka or Robinho to walk in and save their hide..</p>
