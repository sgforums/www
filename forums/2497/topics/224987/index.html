"I suspect we'll get together over the next day or so when the dust settles. This chance would be a massive honour."<br><br>The 49-year-old says he is thrilled West Ham fans want him to take the job but says they should not take his appointment for granted.<br><br>"I'm flattered by the response from fans who believe I should be the next boss but two and two do not always make four," added Curbishley.<br><br>"West Ham are my club. I come from Canning Town, grew up as a trainee, became a first-team regular and sat at the feet of the incomparable Bobby Moore.<br><br>"The England captain would often give me a lift into training and I've never forgotten the lessons he taught me on and off the pitch, especially how to conduct myself in public.<br><br>"Once you are brought up in a background like West Ham, the affection you have for the club never goes away.<br><br>"I can easily tap into the fans' passion for the club, what they want and what they stand for."<br><br></div>

Charlton are considering a dramatic move for him as Les Reed has struggled to improve the Addicks' results.

He was last night in talks as the new owners moved fast to replace Alan Pardew, who was sacked on Monday.<br><br>Curbishley was offered the position in discussions that involved his adviser Phil Smith, the West Ham chairman, Eggert Magnusson, and the deputy chief executive, Scott Duxbury.<br><br>Although he has declared his interest in West Ham in what club sources described as "a very positive signal", Curbishley is a free agent and is still believed to consider that a more stable club might yet emerge as a potential employer.<br><br>The Icelanders are willing to submit to Curbishley's judgment in the transfer market and would abandon the pursuit of players identified by Pardew. One such is Chelsea's England winger Shaun Wright-Phillips.<br><br>Curbishley will also have to contend with the Argentinian players Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez, whom his predecessor found difficult to accommodate.<br><br>Though sources insist they are popular with their team-mates, Pardew found their lack of command of English a barrier in the dressing room. Curbishley may demand that they be shipped out of Upton Park next month. However, though Fifa rules would permit them to make a third transfer of the season, they would not be allowed to play for the destination club.<br><br></div>
