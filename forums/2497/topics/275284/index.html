"If you're playing in the Premier League, hopefully it should help your prospects of playing for Scotland.<br><br>"On the other hand, if I'm not playing first-team football, I know what the consequences of that are. It's certainly something I took into consideration but it was a move I couldn't turn down.<br><br>"You are always disappointed if you don't play but that's part of being a footballer in a squad of this size. The manager can only pick 11 players. There will be players left out but that's part of football.<br><br>"The important thing is a performance and a result. I don't really think it matters who plays, it's about continuing the good results and form of last season.<br><br>"Whoever is given the opportunity, it will be up to them to try to carry that on."<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Livid</span></strong><br><br>Anderson has played just 28 minutes of Premier League football since his switch to the Stadium of Light - and gave away a penalty which gave Wigan their third goal in Saturday's comprehensive 3-0 defeat at the JJB Stadium.<br><br>Black Cats boss Keane was livid with his side's display and no-one was spared in the dressing room afterwards.<br><br>Anderson admitted: "He is the manager. If you don't play well, you are going to have to face the music. There were a few home truths said in the dressing room on Saturday."<br><br>And the 28-year-old defender admits he is unsure over the reception he will receive on his return to the venue where he plied his trade for over a decade.<br><br>"I hope I get a good reception," Anderson admitted. "I haven't really thought about it until now but I hope so.<br><br>"It feels a bit strange to be back, to be honest. I wasn't expecting to be back so soon but it's good to be in familiar surroundings and I'm looking forward to it."</div>
