              <p><strong>Elland Road, England, 19 September, 2000</strong></p>
              <p>Leeds United stunned Milan in rain-lashed Yorkshire, and in so doing
              re-ignited their Champions League campaign. David O'Leary's spirited
              side had produced a cracking performance but looked like having to
              settle for a goalless draw and a point in this first group stage
              encounter - until a calamitous howler by Milan's Brazilian goalkeeper
              Dida two minutes from time handed them a vital victory on a sodden
              Elland Road pitch.</p>
              <p>Dida made a hash of Lee Bowyer's speculative 30-yard drive and
              suddenly Leeds had the victory they deserved. The win was all the more
              remarkable because Leeds had been thrashed 4-0 by Barcelona in their
              first Group H game, and went into this clash against the highly-fancied
              Rossoneri depleted by a lengthy injury list.</p>
              <p>But fears that the Whites might be given a footballing lesson proved
              unfounded: Oliver Bierhoff was shackled and only the electrifyingly
              fast Andriy Shevchenko
              offered much of a goal threat for Milan, while O'Leary's patched-up
              side played above themselves. The fact that on the same night Barcelona
              lost to Besiktas was a bonus, keeping alive Leeds' hopes of
              qualification to the second group stage.</p>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword">
              </span></p><p>Injuries had opened the way for Dominic
              Matteo to make his debut following a £4.25 million move from Liverpool,
              and he proved to be one of the best performers in a white shirt, ably
              supported by Olivier Dacourt and Bowyer in midfield.</p>
              <p>Leeds set the tempo and had a penalty appeal dismissed when Alan Smith went down under a challenge from Jose Antonio
              Chamot on 53 minutes. Paolo Maldini was booked for hauling Smith down,
              while at the other end Nigel Martyn produced excellent saves to thwart
              Shevchenko twice. But with time running out, Bowyer's speculative shot
              was spilled by Dida, and the ball rolled over the line into the net.</p>
              <p>By the time the return at San Siro
              came around, Leeds needed one more point to progress, and earned it
              with a 1-1 draw. They beat Lazio in the second group and went on to
              reach the semi-finals, eventually losing to Valencia. Now, as they
              struggle to secure a play-off place in England's third-tier, those
              Champions League exploits seem a long way away...</p>
              <p>Leeds: Martyn, Kelly, Harte, Duberry, Mills, Bowyer, Bakke, Dacourt, Matteo, Bridges, Smith.</p>
              <p>Subs: Robinson, Huckerby, Jones, Hay, Burns, Evans, Hackworth.</p>
              <p>AC Milan: Dida, Chamot, Costacurta, Maldini, Helveg, Albertini, Giunti, Coco, Guglielminpietro, Bierhoff, Shevchenko.</p>
              <p>Subs: Rossi, De Ascentis, Leonardo, Roque Junior, Sala, Serginho, Saudati.</p>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword">
              </span></p><p><strong>2. Lazio 0-4 Chelsea</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Stadio Olimpico, Rome, 4 November, 2003</strong></p>
              <p>Claudio Ranieri's Chelsea routed Lazio with a clinical display in
              Rome that saw them take control of Champions League Group G. The Blues
              included former Lazio stars Hernan Crespo
              and Juan Sebastian Veron in their line up, and it was Crespo who opened
              the scoring after 15 minutes. Keeper Matteo Sereni should have dealt
              better with Veron's cross but palmed it towards Crespo, who bundled it
              in from close-range.</p>
              <p>Then on 34 minutes, Lazio defender Sinisa Mihajlovic
              embellished an already tarnished reputation among English fans - he'd
              been banned by UEFA three years earlier for directing racist remarks at
              Arsenal's Patrick Vieira.- by kicking Adrian Mutu
              and spitting in his face. Shamefully, both incidents went unpunished by
              the Russian referee, so he was allowed to stay on the pitch - but only
              until the 52nd minute when he was sent off for a second yellow card
              offence, a hack at Duff. Mihajlovic refused to leave the touchline
              immediately and was eventually escorted down the tunnel by a UEFA
              official.</p>
              <p>By then Lazio had nearly equalised early in the second half when Carlo Cudicini saved first from Dejan Stankovic and then superbly from Bernardo Corradi. But with the Bancocelesti reduced to 10-man, Chelsea went for the jugular.</p>
              <p>Substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen slotted the ball home after Sereni could only parry a Frank Lampard
              drive, then Duff jinked his way through the Lazio defence before coolly
              converting for number three. And when Sereni parried another effort,
              there was Lampard on hand to capitalise and give the scoreline an
              emphatic look.</p>
              <p>The Blues were reduced to 10 men themselves when Glen Johnson
              collected a second yellow card in the final minute, but by then they
              were home and hosed, and well on their way on a journey that was to
              take them to their first Champions League semi-final. </p>
              <p>Lazio: Sereni, Zauri, Couto, Mihajlovic, Favalli, Stankovic, Liverani, Albertini (Muzzi 71), Fiore (Negro 58), Corradi, Inzaghi (Lopez 71).</p>
              <p>Subs not used: Casazza, Dabo, Giannichedda, Sergio Conceicao.</p>
              <p>Chelsea: Cudicini, Johnson, Gallas, Terry, Bridge, Veron (Cole 76),
              Makelele, Lampard, Duff, Crespo (Gudjohnsen 67), Mutu (Gronkjaer 57).</p>
              <p>Subs not used: Ambrosio, Huth, Geremi, Hasselbaink.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Manchester United 7-1 Roma (aggregate 8-3)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Old Trafford, Manchester, 10 April, 2007</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United
              needed to overturn a 2-1 deficit from the first leg of this
              quarter-final in Rome, a game marred by crowd disturbances and
              accusations of heavy-handed policing. There were further scuffles
              between rival fans outside Old Trafford
              before kick-off, but what was memorable was what unfolded on the pitch,
              United turning on a dazzling display that blew the Giallorossi out of
              the water.</p>
              <p>Francesco Totti
              went close for Roma with a powerful shot narrowly wide, but it was a
              false dawn for the visitors, who soon found themselves three goals down
              in the space of eight first-half minutes as United seized control of
              the tie.</p>
              <p>Michael Carrick
              opened the scoring after 11 minutes, taking a pass from Ronaldo and
              curling a shot past Doni. Within six minutes it was 2-0, Gabriel Heinze
              and Ryan Giggs
              combining before the Welsh winger picked out Alan Smith, who finished
              in style to record his first goal for United since November 2005. Then Wayne Rooney
              completed a superb move that opened up Roma's right flank, timing his
              run just right to meet a Giggs cross and slide the ball home.</p>
              <p>Philippe Mexes
              headed a David Pizarro free-kick wide as Roma tried to come to terms
              with United's ruthless verve, but they were leaving themselves exposed
              at the back and Cristiano Ronaldo
              was in the mood to exploit it. Ronaldo made it 4-0 before half-time
              with a low shot into the bottom corner as Roma backed off, effectively
              inviting him to have a go.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese star slid home a Giggs cross for number five, before
              Carrick let fly with a stunning shot to make it 6-0 on the hour, the
              Red Devils having shown no willingness to ease off the gas.</p>
              <p>Roma halted the flow temporarily when Daniele De Rossi
              turned and shot deftly to restore a touch of pride, but Patrice Evra
              responded with a shot that stayed low to beat Doni. It was a thrilling
              performance by United, on of their most compelling in Europe. It
              brought them a remarkable 8-3 aggregate victory - their biggest in
              Europe since they thrashed Irish side Waterford en route to winning the
              1968 European Cup - and a place in the semi-finals against Milan. That
              proved to be an altogether tougher Italian Job, which was scant
              consolation to humbled Roma.</p>
              <p>Man Utd: Van der Sar, Brown, Ferdinand, Heinze, O'Shea (Evra 52),
              Ronaldo, Fletcher, Carrick (Richardson 73), Giggs (Solskjaer 61),
              Rooney, Smith.</p>
              <p>Subs Not Used: Kuszczak, Dong, Cathcart, Eagles.</p>
              <p>Roma: Doni, Panucci, Mexes, Chivu, Cassetti, Wilhelmsson (Rosi 88),
              De Rossi (Faty 86), Vucinic, Pizarro, Mancini (Okaka Chuka 90), Totti.</p>
              <p>Subs Not Used: Curci, Defendi, Ferrari, Taddei.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Inter 1- 5 Arsenal</strong></p>
              <p><strong>San Siro, Milan, 25 November, 2003</strong></p>
              <p>Having beaten Arsenal 3-0 at Highbury in mid-September - when Julio
              Ricardo Cruz, Andy van der Meyde and Obafemi Martins all scored before
              the break and Thierry Henry had a penalty brilliantly saved by Francesco Toldo - nothing could have prepared Inter for the pace and panache with which the Gunners dismantled them in Milan two months later.</p>
              <p>Indeed, even Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger remarked after the Gunners' super show at the San Siro, "Not in my wildest dreams could we have predicted that sort of result." His side had at last reproduced their Premier League form on the European stage to avenge the earlier defeat at Highbury with interest.</p>
              <p>Henry was in inspired mood, and it was the Frenchman who swapped
              passes with Ashley Cole midway through the first half before picking
              his spot and side-footing the ball into the bottom corner. Yet the
              Nerazzurri levelled eight minutes later when Christian Vieri received a
              pass on the edge of the area and his first-time shot took a decisive
              deflection off Sol Campbell, looping over Jens Lehmann and in off the bar.</p>
              <p>Undaunted, Arsenal hit back four minutes into the second half
              through Freddie Ljungberg, whom Henry found unmarked in the area with a
              left-wing cross, the Swedish midfielder turning the ball into the net
              from close range. Henry would have increased the lead had he not tried
              to square the ball to a team-mate with only Toldo to beat. Jens Lehmann
              saved a Fabio Cannavaro
              header and Andy van der Meyde sent a free-kick narrowly over the bar,
              but Arsenal clinically exposed growing gaps in the Inter defence.</p>
              <p>Henry sprinted clear and beat Javier Zanetti before shooting beyond Toldo from a tight angle for the Gunners' third. Then Edu and Robert Pires
              added further goals as Inter committed men forward, to ensure an
              emphatic victory. Wenger's side moved above Inter in the group and were
              firmly on course for a place in the knockout phase. In fact they
              proceeded to the quarter-finals where they were beaten by
              fellow-Londoners Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Inter Milan: Toldo, Cordoba, Javier Zanetti,
              Cannavaro (Pasquale 59), Materazzi, Brechet, Cristiano Zanetti,
              Lamouchi (Almeyda 57), Van der Meyde (Cruz 69), Martins, Vieri.</p>
              <p>Subs not used: Fontana, Luciano, Adani, Gonzalez.</p>
              <p>Arsenal: Lehmann, Cole, Campbell, Toure, Cygan, Ljungberg, Parlour, Edu, Pires, Kanu (Gilberto Silva 73), Henry (Aliadiere 89).</p>
              <p>Subs not used: Stack, Keown, Clichy, Papadopulos, Hoyte (J).</p>
              <p><strong>5. AC Milan 3-3 Liverpool (aet) - Liverpool win 3-2 on penalties</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ataturk Stadium, Istanbul, Turkey, 25 May, 2005</strong></p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard-inspired Liverpool staged one of the most dramatic
              comebacks in European Cup history to claw back a three-goal deficit,
              win a penalty shoot-out and snatch the coveted trophy from Milan, who
              had appeared out of sight at half-time with a 3-0 lead and a
              comfortable gap in class.</p>
              <p>Milan captain Paolo Maldini had given the Rossoneri a first-minute
              lead when when Andrea Pirlo's free-kick found him unmarked, and he
              swept the ball high into the net past Jerzy Dudek. Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez
              had surprisingly left Dietmar Hamann and Igor Biscan on the bench and
              started with Harry Kewell. The selection back-fired disastrously:
              Kewell had to limp off injured on 23 minutes, replaced by Vladimir
              Smicer, and on 39 Hernan Crespo doubled Milan's lead when he turned in a cross from Andriy Shevchenko. 
              It got worse four minutes later when Milan added a third. The
              outstanding Kaka, played a brilliant pass that set Crespo free and the
              Argentine deftly chipped in over the onrushing Dudek.</p>
              <p>It looked all over at the break, Liverpool having been thoroughly
              outplayed. Surely Milan, famed for a strong defence, were in an
              impregnable position. Liverpool's midfield had been overrun in the
              first half, but Benitez made a change, sending on Hamman for Steve
              Finnan, who had sustained a thigh injury. Dudek dived well to keep out
              a Shevchenko free-kick that would have made it 4-0. And then the
              comeback began.</p>
              <p>Gerrard headed home John Arne Riise's cross after 53 minutes to give
              the Reds a lifeline. And incredibly, Dida fumbled Smicer's 25-yard
              effort into the net a minute later. The momentum was suddenly all with
              Liverpool, And their comeback was complete on the hour when Gennaro
              Gattuso brought down Gerrard in the box  as he was about to pull the
              trigger for the equaliser. Dida saved Xabi Alonso's spot-kick, but the
              Basque midfielder followed up to net the rebound as the Milan defenders
              looked on disbelievingly.</p>
              <p>Djimi Traore cleared off the line from Shevchenko after Dudek
              spilled a Crespo cross, and it went to extra-time. Milan dominated
              possession, but a sensational double save by Dudek from Shevchenko
              three minutes from the end ensured it would need a penalty shoot-out to
              find the winner.</p>
              <p>Serginho and Pirlo failed with Milan's first two penalties, while
              Hamann and fellow-substitute Djibril Cisse scored theirs for Liverpool.
              Substitute Jon Dahl Tomasson scored for Milan and Riise missed for
              Liverpool. Kaka and Smicer duly scored, but  Shevchenko's kick was
              saved by Dudek to clinch a stunning victory that had seemed impossible
              at half-time, but which had revealed great reserves of character and
              fighting spirit. Milan were broken; but Liverpool, lifting the Cup for
              the fifth time, had earned the right to keep the trophy at Anfield
              permanently.</p>
              <p>AC Milan: Dida, Cafu, Maldini, Stam, Nesta, Gattuso (Rui Costa 112),
              Seedorf (Serginho 86), Pirlo, Kaka, Shevchenko, Crespo (Tomasson 85).</p>
