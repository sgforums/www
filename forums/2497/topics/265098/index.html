The Atletico Madrid star, 23, is yet to hold talks with Kop boss Rafa Benitez as his advisors hold out for Â£100,000-a-week.</strong><br><br>The astonishing package for the striker will amount to Â£57.9m, including the Â£24m transfer fee. Atletico want Liverpool to pick up a Â£2.7m tab for a pay-off Torres is due under the terms of his contract.<br><br>The deal will stretch LiverpoolÂ’s purse strings to the limit and would put TorresÂ’ wage behind only skipper Steven GerrardÂ’s Â£120,000-a-week. But Benitez risks losing his No1 summer target to Inter Milan if his board baulk at the demands.<br><br>The Italian giants have had a Â£27m bid accepted for the Spain ace. And although Torres favours Liverpool, the Inter offer is being used as a bargaining tool by his agents Bahia International. A Bahia source said: Â“HeÂ’ll only leave Atletico if the club, and the offer, is absolutely right for him.Â”<br><br>The deal was given a boost at the weekend when midfielder Luis Garcia sealed a Â£3.36m move in the other direction. Officially the switch has nothing to do with TorresÂ’ deal but the fee has been taken off his price-tag.<br><br>Torres will keep Benitez waiting until he returns from holiday on July 7 before any deal is signed. Atletico chiefs are now desperate to finalise the move after signing Diego Forlan as a Â£14m replacement from Villarreal.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If this deal goes through, he will be guaranteed Â£100,000-a-week until he is 29 yrs old even if he plays like crap... Quite a big risk Pool is taking on him... Because if he dosen't perform he will still know that he is guaranteed the $100, 000 per week pay... And what will the other Pool players who has been there longer be thinking? Players like Carragher, Crouch, Kuyt will all not be happy like what we see happening at Chelsea now...<br><br>I feel sometimes paying a higher transfer fee is better than paying a higher salary cos paying a higher salary may create a unhappy feeling among the other players... especially when that player has not done anything for that club yet...</div>
