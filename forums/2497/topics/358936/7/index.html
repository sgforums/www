              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Uefa gags Ovrebo after horror show</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/champions_league/ovrebo-lampard.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Uefa has imposed a gagging order on Tom Henning Ovrebo after the
              Norwegian referee provoked a huge furore with a series of controversial
              decisions during Chelsea’s Champions League exit at the hands of
              Barcelona.</strong></p>
              <p>Ovrebo waved away a series of penalty appeals from the home side,
              most notably when Gerard Pique handballed in the second half, and the
              match official provoked considerable anger from Chelsea’s players.</p>
              <p>Michael Ballack appeared to place his hands on Ovrebo when Samuel
              Eto’o was not penalised for handball in the dying seconds, while Didier
              Drogba was also booked following the final whistle as he had to be
              pulled away from the referee by stewards and team-mates.</p>
              <p>Following such distasteful scenes, Uefa has instructed Ovrebo not to
              make any comment on the match or the behaviour of Chelsea’s players
              which is sure to come under the scrutiny of the governing body.</p>
              <p>“Because of the circumstances after the match, Uefa has asked us not to comment to the press,” Ovrebo told Aftenposten.</p>
              <p>Graham Poll has told Setanta<strong></strong> that Uefa had to
              change Ovrebo’s hotel arrangements as a result of press attention and
              the former Premier League referee has also <a href="http://www.setanta.com/uk/Articles/Football/2009/05/07/Champions-League-Uefa-gags-Ovrebo/gnid-51807/">strongly condemned the actions of the Chelsea players</a>.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Chelsea striker Didier Drogba was furious after the Champions League semi-final defeat on away goals against Barcelona and labelled referee Tom Henning Ovrebo a "disgrace".</strong></span></p>
              <p>An animated Drogba needed restraining by stewards and his manager Guus Hiddink at the end of the game.</p>
              <p>Drogba felt he should have had a penalty and his side also had two appeals turned down for handball, with the Spanish giants then grabbing a stoppage-time strike to go through on away goals.</p>
              <p>The Ivory Coast forward, who was unhappy after being subbed in 72nd minute, approached the referee after the game.</p>
              <p>He then turned to the television camera, shouting that the official was a "f***ing disgrace".</p>
              <p>Chelsea fans also threw flags at the officials and the Barcelona bench.</p>

              <p><strong>MADRID, May 7 (Reuters) - The ecstatic face of Barcelona's Andres Iniesta adorned the front pages of the Spanish newspapers on Thursday after his dramatic goal in added time sent Pep Guardiola's side through to the Champions League final.</strong></p>
              <p>Pictures showed the normally unassuming 24-year-old midfielder from the village of Fuentealbilla near Albacete roaring in triumph, yellow Barca shirt in hand, as he sprinted to the corner flag to celebrate his 93rd-minute strike.</p>
              <p>British newspapers sympathised with Chelsea's claims of a poor refereeing performance by Norwegian Tom Henning Ovrebo but were united in their condemnation of Didier Drogba and Michael Ballack's post-match protestations.</p>
              <p>"Iniesta, a heavenly goal," (El Pais), "Iniesta the quiet hero," (El Mundo), "Iniesta works the miracle," (As), were some of the headlines in Spain, many with a religious theme.</p>
              <p>"Now we know who the God of football is," As columnist Juan Cruz wrote. "His name is Andres, he is shy and he comes from Albacete. He's a good person and last night he made me cry."</p>
              <p>Many newspapers also ran pictures of the thousands of Barca fans who celebrated into the night at the Canaletes fountain on the Paseo de las Ramblas in the Catalan capital.</p>
              <p>They had barely had time to recover from the outpouring of joy prompted by Barca's record 6-2 win at Real Madrid on Saturday that all-but wrapped up the Spanish league title.</p>
              <p>Writing in daily El Pais, Luis Martin said Iniesta had become obsessed with improving his shooting in recent years and the work had borne fruit on Wednesday at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"Barca is in the final in Rome and Iniesta will rightly go down in the history of the club," he said.</p>
              <p>In El Mundo, Miguel Herguedas noted how Iniesta had arrived at Barca's famed youth academy aged just 12.</p>
              <p>"Those early days in Barcelona were hard for this diminutive and shy Manchegan, far from his family and with the soccer ball as his only reference point.</p>
              <p>"He never raised his voice, nor let himself be seduced by offers of millions, because he was faithful to the club that gave him the chance of his life."</p>
              <p>British writers also hailed Iniesta's pervasive contribution.</p>
              <p>"Exquisite Iniesta inflicts far worse suffering than UEFA will devise" read The Guardian headline ahead of almost certain punishment from European soccer's governing body for Chelsea and its players after they angrily surrounded the referee at the final whistle.</p>
              <p>"Cheated Out", "Blue Murder at the Bridge" roared headlines in the Daily Mail as the press shared Chelsea's astonishment that none of their penalty appeals, especially a clear handball by Gerard Pique, had found favour with the referee.</p>
              <p>The sympathy dried up, however, as Drogba remonstrated with Ovrebo as the distraught Chelsea players made their way off the pitch.</p>
              <p>"The rancour of Chelsea's response to defeat, orchestrated by the incorrigible Didier Drogba, deserves to earn them punishment from UEFA as well as the disdain of the rest of the continent," wrote the Guardian's Richard Williams.</p>

              <p>if the ref was on barca's side. he wouldn't have send abidal off</p>
              <p>i think its fair. pique's hand ball was indeed controversal. so was abidal's sent off.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">FIRED-UP Didier Drogba calmed down yesterday and apologised for his screaming rant at the end of the match. </h2>
              <p class="article">Drogba — seen by millions on TV yelling at ref Tom Henning Ovrebo and swearing into a camera — said sorry for his behaviour “in the heat of the moment”. And he emphasised he had “not set a good example” to children. </p>
              <p class="article">The Ivory Coast striker, who had been substituted during the match, got a yellow card from Ovrebo after running on to the pitch to abuse him. And he could now face more sanctions from UEFA. </p>
              <p class="article">In a statement Drogba, 31, said: “I regret that in the heat of the moment I let out my incredible frustration and disappointment in this way, and for that I apologise. “I also accept that the language I used did not set a good example for those watching at home, especially children.” </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea welcomed the £24million star’s apology, saying: “We are all aware of the responsibilities that lie with both the club and its players towards setting a good example as role models. </p>
              <p class="article">“While some of the events last night were regrettable, they occurred only because of the high emotions and frustrations which arose from the disappointment of a controversial defeat in such an important game.”</p>
