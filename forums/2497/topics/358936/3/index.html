              <p>Yeah, the refereeing was simply awful. What's wrong with refs these days? Red cards for innocuous challenges and failure to spot blatant penalties.</p>
              <p>For all the possession Barca had, I thought Chelsea deserved to go through. Barca's ball in the final third was abject and lacking of ideas. Chelsea's shackling of Messi was impressive I must say. Chelsea have only themselves to blame for not pressing on with the extra man advantage.</p>
              <p>From a neutral's perspective, the champions of England meeting the champions of Spain in Rome is an excellant advert for a classic European Cup final match.</p>

              <p>The match was not great but interesting though... I thought Chelsea were going to win it as Barcelona didn't impress me at all... Chelsea looked stronger, faster and honestly, better too... And when I saw the starting line-up, Not only were Barce without their 2 usual centre-backs, Henry was also missing (Well the Press certainly had their ways of finding out, they were spot on even though Barce tried to deny it before the game)... And his replacement Keita, was quite useless... Didn't even troubled Chelsea's defence.</p>
              <p>The way it ended, I can understand why Ballack and Drogba went berserk. Winning all the way until injury time... This is really a very bitter pill for not just the players but the fans too to take...</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Drogba was back to his theatrical best again but this time, the referee didn't buy it. Of all the penalties claim, I think only one could have been given. The one where the ball hit Pique on his hand... To me this had the highest chance but it was also a 50/50 as some referee could viewed this as "ball to hand" rather than "hand to ball"...</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, I think Chelsea only have themselves to blamed for playing negatively again... They knew it was a precarious situation to sit back with the away goal thing but yet they continue at it... They kept defending and never really commit men up to attack in numbers... Even when Barce went down to 10 men, they continued this way... I thought Guus shouldn't have taken out Drogba as he was the one that gave them lots of problems... Drogba wasn't hurt at all, he was only acting and delaying the match... He looked disgusted when he saw his number being shown... A real bad tactical mistake by Guus Hiddink I thought.</p>
              <p>On Messi, what can you say... He was just an ok player last night. Again he couldn't stamp his authority in this match, he was rather quiet just like in the first one too... Iniesta on the other hand, live on to his billing...</p>
              <p>The whole crazy thing was Cech didn't had a thing to do throughout the match... Only picking up the ball out of his net in injury time... Barcelona, 1 shot, 1 goal... weird.</p>
              <p>Perhaps on hindsight, we can only assume Uefa doesn't want an all English final or even an English champion again... But we can argue that the ref did sent off that Barce defender when I thought a yellow was more appropriate though...</p>

              <p>Drog attacks ref in tunnel</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">DIDIER DROGBA faces a huge UEFA ban after a vicious tunnel attack on Chelsea’s Euro ref last night. </h2>
              <p class="article">The crazed Blues striker hurled an F-word tirade at Tom Henning Ovrebo as Barcelona hit a 93rd-minute goal to reach the Champions League final. Millions of stunned TV viewers saw Drogba square up to the ref on the pitch after he had rejected FOUR penalty appeals. </p>
              <p class="article">Mad Drog screamed obscenities at the TV cameras, forcing Sky to issue a rushed apology. Then the Ivory Coast star stormed down the tunnel and hurled abuse at Ovrebo.</p>
              <p class="article">An eye witness said: “Drogba was coming down the tunnel with ref Ovrebo alongside him. He kept shouting at Henning and the referee stopped. </p>
              <p class="article">“Drogba turned towards the ref and put his face just three or four inches from the ref’s face and kept shouting. He told the ref ‘This is a f***ing disgrace, you don’t have respect, something like that can’t happen. You can’t do that’. </p>
              <p class="article">“All the time he used his hand to intimidate the ref further. “He kept slamming his hand to the wall just inches from the ref’s face. Ovrebo looked terrified — but never said anything.” </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1178190/Cheated-Foul-mouthed-Drogba-rages-ref-denies-furious-Chelsea-FOUR-penalties.html"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05_01/ChelseaBarca_482x449.jpg" alt="Chelsea Drogba Ballack" width="482" height="449"></a></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea star Michael Ballack then joined in until the terrified ref ran back on to the pitch to avoid more confrontation. </p>
              <p class="article">The eye witness added: “Drogba looked crazy. He had lost control. But he never laid a finger on the ref, even though his behaviour was anything but civil.” </p>
              <p class="article">Last night Ovrebo admitted to UEFA representatives at the match that he had made “significant mistakes” during the game. </p>
              <p class="article">But Drogba’s behaviour is certain to trigger a UEFA probe. Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink defended the disgraceful reaction of his players. He said: “I can fully understand the emotion of the game, the players’ disappointment. “It’s not just one decision made in doubt but several decisions.”</p>

              <h2>HIDDINK QUESTIONS KEY DECISIONS</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline">
              <div id="storyinfo"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/05/240/Allsport-Guus-Hiddink-Waves-Arms-Barca-Champs_2273485.jpg" border="0" alt="Hiddink - defended his players actions."></div>
              </div>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Guus Hiddink felt Chelsea were on the wrong end of an "injustice" against Barcelona. The Blues bowed out of the Champions League on Wednesday night after a dramatic 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.</strong> </p>
              <p>Michael Essien's opener appeared to have settled the contest as the game moved into injury time, but Andres Iniesta snatched a late leveller to book the Catalan giants a final date with Manchester United. </p>
              <p>The Chelsea players were outraged at the final whistle as they felt they were denied a number of blatant penalty decisions by referee Tom Henning Ovrebo. </p>
              <p>Their manager was equally as disappointed by the performance of the Norwegian officials and felt his side were harshly treated over the course of the 90 minutes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Anger management: the final straw for Chelsea came with seconds remaining. Michael Ballack's last-ditch shot struck the arm of Samuel Eto'o. No penalty</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"I'm very disappointed, it is not easy to analyse the game when adrenaline is still pumping," the Dutchman told <em>Sky Sports</em>.</strong> </p>
              <p>"We are so disappointed because we have a few issues. Firstly we could, and should, have scored in some open situations and then because we must talk about the not given penalties. </p>
              <p>"There were three of four situations that were so clear. I will not say what we really feel, but it is an injustice. </p>
              <p>"We should have scored, though, and had the game already done." </p>
              <p>Hiddink refused to concur with the accusations of some of his players that UEFA were determined to ensure there would not be an all-English final for a second consecutive season, but admitted that some decisions on the night had left him baffled. </p>
              <p>"You can never prove that, but it is sad," he added.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Heartbreak: as the whistle blew Chelsea were left to ponder a great defensive performance riven by bad refereeing decisions.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"It is out of emotion, but there were five or six situations. It is not just one doubtful one. Nevertheless we should have scored in other situations."</strong> </p>
              <p>The Chelsea coach also leapt to the defence of his fuming stars after their post-match reaction. </p>
              <p>"I can fully understand the emotion of the game, as long as they don't literally touch him (the referee)," he said after Didier Drogba, John Terry and Michael Ballack had all confronted the officials. </p>
              <p>"I can understand the disappointment. It is not just one decision made in doubt, it is several. I can fully understand and I protect my players and their emotion."</p>

              Anyone has the clip of Drogba's rant?

              <p>Essien, what can you say... He would have been the hero for Chelsea but instead now he is zero... His air kick gave Barce the chance to come back in... He could have simply pass it to the player in front of him...</p>
