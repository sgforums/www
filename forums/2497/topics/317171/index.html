              <h1>Grant ready to walk away: Chelsea's boss may jump ship even if his team do pull off historic double</h1>
              <p>Avram Grant, whose reign as Chelsea
              manager has been dogged by uncertainty
              over his long-term future, may leave on
              his own terms at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>As his team prepare for their two-game
              tilt at history, Grant refuses to discuss his
              plans in any detail beyond reiterating that
              he has a four-year contract and he is
              happy at the club.</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_02/80grantL0405_468x949.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="949"></p>
              <p>But Eyal Lachman, one of his closest
              friends, believes Grant may take control
              of his own destiny, regardless of whether
              he snatches the Premier League title from
              Manchester United today and defeats the
              same opponents in the Champions League
              final in Moscow in 10
              days' time.</p>
              <p>Lachman, head coach
              at Ghana's Hearts of
              Oak and linked to a role
              at Stamford Bridge
              under Grant, said: 'I
              won't be surprised at all
              if Avram leaves Chelsea
              at the end of the season.
              'We are good friends
              and when we speak it is
              about football. Avram is
              a man of decision, as we
              can learn from the past.'</p>
              <p>This is a clear reference
              to Grant's resignations
              from Hapoel
              Petach Tikva and Maccabi
              Haifa before the end of his contract,
              and Chelsea's late-season surge to the
              brink of the double has not only strengthened
              his position within the club but also
              boosted his credentials outside it.</p>
              <p>His pronouncements have grown more
              confident and playful and there is a sense
              that he feels he has done everything
              asked of him by taking Chelsea to their
              first Champions League final and developing
              a more entertaining playing style.</p>
              <p>Suggestions that Chelsea's squad of
              experienced internationals have done it
              all themselves, without much input from
              him, draw the observation that similar
              would have to be said of the club's success
              under Jose Mourinho, because the same
              players formed the core of his team.</p>
              <p>But when asked if he could state once
              and for all that he would still be in charge
              of the club's first team
              at the start of next season,
              Grant returns to
              serious mode.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I think any
              manager who said that
              would not be right.</p>
              <p>'Sometimes the club
              don't want you, sometimes
              the manager is
              not happy with the club.</p>
              <p>'I know what my situation
              is. I am doing all the
              preparation for next
              year. I can't answer
              your question because it
              doesn't depend on me.</p>
              <p>'You can judge my job
              on what I achieve. But I
              will not answer questions today about my
              personal future.'</p>
              <p>As with all major decisions at Chelsea, it
              will be down to owner Roman
              Abramovich.</p>
              <p>But Grant would, arguably,
              be entitled to be upset if moved upstairs
              or out of the club altogether whatever
              occurs today and on May 21, and, according
              to Lachman at least, might take matters into this own hands even if
              he won both trophies.</p>
              <p>Grant, who
              dismissed an Israeli journalist's
              request to respond to Lachman's
              comments, is happier to talk about
              his previous experience of a title
              race which went to the final day.</p>
              <p>'In 1995, we took the
              championship in the last game
              with Maccabi Tel Aviv,' he said. 'It
              was different because it depended
              on us. We needed to win, a draw
              was not enough, and we won.</p>
              <p>'It is the same in any country
              when you fight for first place. You
              do what you have to do and then
              look at others.'</p>
              <p>Victory over Bolton, of course,
              will not be enough if United
              triumph at Wigan, and Chelsea
              midfielder Claude Makelele
              admits United are favourites.</p>
              <p>But upsetting the odds would
              make a third Premier League title
              with Chelsea the sweetest of all for
              the veteran France midfielder.</p>
              <p>Makelele said: 'We rely on United
              stumbling at Wigan and that would
              perhaps be the best title I've won
              since coming to Chelsea. To lose
              the championship on goal
              difference would be painful.</p>
              <p>'After Mourinho's departure,
              people wrote off our season. But
              we have shown our courage.
              Chelsea are always in the fight.'</p>
