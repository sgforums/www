Ballack held talks with Chelsea's head coach in an attempt to clear the air after his treatment 11 days ago provoked a furious response. The midfielder's future at Stamford Bridge is in doubt as Mourinho is not thought to have sanctioned the micro-surgery directly, but Ballack is determined to stay and has blamed the club's medical department for the dispute.</strong><br><br>It is understood the Germany captain has claimed Chelsea's experts missed a problem of a small loose bone above his ankle after he damaged it at Newcastle last month. A statement issued on bahalf of the German Football Federation on Ballack's condition said "an immediate operation was necessary and indispensable. Ballack is also thought to have told boss Mourinho that continuing to train or play with the problem could have caused serious long-term damage.<br><br>Conflicting accounts of communications between Ballack, the medical department and the Portuguese after the player flew to Germany to get a second opinion have clouded the picture further as Chelsea's season of in-fighting re-ignited. Despite the seriousness of the allegations against Chelsea's medical department, which is led by doctor Bryan English, the midfielder was hoping the club would make a statement backing him.<br><br>That has not been forthcoming but one was issued by the German authorities on behalf of the national team doctor, Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt. It said: "An immediate operation was necessary and indispensable. Wohlfahrt detected lose splints in Ballack's left high ankle. Any further practice session or another game potentially could have endangered the player's health, even threatened Ballack's career.<br><br>After defending the 30-year-old all season Mourinho has made thinly-veiled attacks on him and Andriy Shevchenko, who was due to undergo season-ending surgery today on a troublesome groin after also falling out with the head coach. Ballack is expected to be fit for the FA Cup Final on 19 May against Manchester United.<br><br>Frank Lampard has also added to the suggestions that Chelsea have lacked unity in their squad, with Shevchenko and Ballack not integrating fully. He said: "There have been other problems at the club and they have to be addressed, simple as that. We cannot lose the spirit that has got us where we are, with certain people."<br></div>

Sheva was concerned by rumours he was not giving his all for the club. The news comes after the German football federation backed Michael BallackÂ’s decision to have an operation against manager Jose MourinhoÂ’s wishes.</strong><br><br>The German skipper claims ChelseaÂ’s medical staff failed to diagnose a loose bone in his ankle. Both players believe they are victims of a communication breakdown. Shevchenko, ChelseaÂ’s Â£31million summer signing, yesterday had a hernia operation that will keep him out of the FA Cup final against Manchester United.<br><br>He has been concerned by claims he pulled out of the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool because he was not picked to start the game. Shevchenko spoke to Terry at training to talk through the full extent of the injuries he has suffered this season.<br><br>Terry, also England skipper, is arguably the most influential club captain in the Premiership. He has an open hotline to Mourinho and they talk regularly about team affairs. A source close to Sheva told Sport: Â“Andriy is determined to be fighting fit for the start of next season. He has had a lot of injury problems. Â“He has explained all this to John Terry who was quite happy with what he had to say.Â”<br><br>Sheva travelled to Anfield to cheer on the Blues from the directorsÂ’ box where he was welcomed by club officials. And he was down by the touchline as Chelsea suffered their penalty shoot-out defeat. Neither Frank Lampard or Terry have agreed new contracts. It is believed the fact Shevchenko and Ballack are the top-paid stars has been one of the major stumbling blocks.<br><br></div>
