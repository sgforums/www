              <h1>Being a supporter should mean offering the team support, so why do so many Arsenal fans keep leaving early?</h1>
              <p id="stand-first" class="stand-first-alone"> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article219183.ece/ALTERNATES/gallery-large/JohnCross.jpg" alt="JohnCross.jpg"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal fans have become notorious for leaving the Emirates early, way before the final whistle blows. On Saturday, the ground was just over half full when Cesc Fabregas stepped up to score the second goal and clinch victory over Sunderland. The victory was not secure until Fabregas's injury time penalty.</strong></p>
              <p>Not that thousands of Arsenal fans cared. They were already on their way. There have been worse examples, most notably the Champions League semi final against Manchester United last season. That was truly embarrassing.</p>
              <p>But before I get bombarded with e-mails and foul mouthed hate mail, a lot of Arsenal fans agree with me. When I wrote a tweet (johncrossmirror if you want to sign up) on this at the weekend, 90 per cent came back and said they agree and that it's the "new breed" of supporter.</p>
              <p>There was one exception, though. This angry twitter-er told me he pays £1,000 for a season ticket therefore can do as he pleases and asked: what's wrong with leaving early to beat the rush?</p>
              <p>Here's a simple solution for that supporter: don't bother going at all. Yes, it's up to you to pay £1,000 and yet why work all week to buy the ticket and then leave early to save yourself half an hour?</p>
              <p>Yes, it is a nightmare getting away. The queues for the three nearby Tube stations are a nightmare, roads and parking is chaos and you've got a lot of people leaving in a short space of time.</p>
              <p>But the replies sent to me at the weekend all complained that it was the new fans and they were embarrassed about them all leaving early. Others said they'd love the ticket and if they didn't want to watch it, then they would take their place.</p>
              <p>A new stadium attracts new fans. Arsenal is a good day out: good football, great hospitality and generally a few goals, too.</p>
              <p>But football should also be about a good atmosphere, cheering the team until the end and if that means being a bit held up getting home then so be it. The latte sipping classes at Arsenal will have enough home comforts when they get there.</p>
              <p>However, your football club needs you. Does staying until the end make a difference? Yes, it certainly does. And being a supporter should mean just that - offering support.</p>
              <p>Thierry Henry once made this very point. Knowing that I was a regular reporter at Arsenal, Henry was fascinated to know why Arsenal fans left early. It annoyed him, upset him and he wished they stayed until the bitter end.</p>
              <p>After all, how often do those final minutes count?</p>
              <p>Henry was aware of Arsenal fans leaving early just as he was always aware of before every game at Anfield the Liverpool fans chanting: "You'll Never Walk Alone" at the players when they warmed up before games.</p>
              <p>Henry would stop his warm-up drills and stop, watch and listen to the Liverpool fans because he was utterly blown away by them. If there was one club in England apart from Arsenal he would play for in the future, I bet it would be Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Have you really been to the cinema recently and left with five minutes to go before the end? No, of course not. So why on earth is football any different?</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> A good point but honestly i did not observe Arsenal's supporter as much as i do observe United's. United's supporter tend to be the quiet type, only occasional cheering when the team in on the move.</p>
              <p>I also notice the same singhs sitting at the box seat in every home matches. (Anyone notice that as well?) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>not a fair comment..I think all fans will walk out if they feel that it is done deal, either lose or win. even in the days of Malaysia cup, friend and I will go early if the score is more or less determined, cause we don't want to squeeze when we take the mrt @ kallang.</p>
              <p>also,maybe it has to do with the traffic condition, but often I hear the announcers asking the away fans to wait for a while for the home crowds to dispere for fears of fans trouble.</p>
              <p>till date, the joker who was brushing his teeth during the chelsea game still fresh in my memory.</p>
