              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Blue day: Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez watches as his side slump to defeat at Chelsea</em></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">RAFA BENITEZ last night insisted defeat by Chelsea is not the end of Liverpool's title challenge.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Reds boss was clearly upset by the 2-0 loss at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p class="article">But Benitez went on the attack against those who feel the Premier League crown is already beyond his side.</p>
              <p class="article">Despite the fact Liverpool have now lost one game more than they did all of last season, upbeat Benitez is confident the campaign is still very much alive.</p>
              <p class="article">And, no, he wasn't kidding!</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool lost two games last term but have already suffered defeats by Tottenham, Aston Villa and now Chelsea this time out - leaving them six points behind the leaders from the Bridge.</p>
              <p class="article">But Benitez pointed to Manchester United's defeat at Burnley and their draw with Sunderland - as well as Chelsea's loss at Wigan - as reasons to remain cheerful.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "If the teams at the top lose points and you win, then you're in a better position.</p>
              <p class="article">"But it's a long race. Chelsea are very strong but we'll try to stay as close as possible and see what happens in April and May.</p>
              <p class="article">"You will see the top sides losing more points against any team. That's good for the Premier League but it means we have to keep going.</p>
              <p class="article">"We can't think about three defeats. It's one game at a time, try to win the next game and improve. That's it."</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool face Sunderland after the international break and Benitez pointed to the amount of games they drew last season as their undoing.</p>
              <p class="article">In a largely uncontroversial match against their bitter rivals, the only contentious moment came when Liverpool's Slovakian defender Martin Skrtel appeared to be bundled over in the box by Didier Drogba.</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez said: "It could have been a penalty, I haven't seen the replay.</p>
              <p class="article">"It looked a penalty from the bench but I cannot do anything about that now.</p>
              <p class="article">"Our target has to be the next game. It's important to keep calm, keep working, improving.</p>

              <p>Man Utd did badly against the top sides last season but still won the league.</p>

              <p>So liverpool still got hope if they keep winning the small sides, because end of the day its the total points that matter and not who you win or lose against.</p>

Lucas will nv be a star he just an average player. torres is good but u dun always expect to score every game. and aurelio is a much better player than insua. babel will nv be a star under rafa. And rafa dunno how to train players. their top players are already good before rafa got them like torres , carra, gerrad. seriously i dun tink any player is rafa train 1.<a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/player/0,19754,11669_232512,00.html"> </a></p></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Jamie Carragher has reacted to </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong>'s defeat to </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong> by conceding that his side are behind their Premier League title rivals and demanding both he and his team-mates improve quickly in order to close the gap.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds crashed to a 2-0 loss at Stamford Bridge - their third in the league already this season - thanks to goals from Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda and Carragher spelled out that any mistake can prove costly against the top sides.  </p>
              <p>'I thought we played quite well and done alright for most of the game yet we have still come away with a 2-0 defeat,' he said. 'It's the small details that are so important at this level and we know that there are certain areas we have got to improve. There's a gap at the top and we've got to close it.  </p>
              <p>'Games against Chelsea are notoriously tight and a bit of quality or a mistake is always going to be the thing that turns it one way or another. But we have lost the ball in midfield for their first and I felt myself that I should have done a bit better for their second one.'</p>
              <p>Chelsea's win leaves Liverpool six points behind the Blues at the top of the Premier league and Carragher admits that if Rafa Benitez's side still hold ambitions of winning the title they must get back on track after the international break with wins against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/sunderland.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Sunderland</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a>.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><strong>'It's never nice to lose before an international break, particularly a game as big as this, but we have got to put it behind us,' said Carragher.
