              <p>You know something must be wrong when the 1st choice Substitute
                  is Ramires. The commentator also said something that goes "Ramires
                  looks like a stick, how on earth is he a defensive midfielder?"
                  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, I think Arsenal got their lucky break when the last 2
                  goals Chelsea conceded was largely due to error. Essien's mistake
                  in tackling caused the 2nd goal while Malouda was caught in
                  possession in the 1st.</p>
              <p>I thought Ancelotti look damn lost at the touchline when Arsenal
                  hit them on the break. He doesn't seem to have a plan B. Oh yeah,
                  plan B is to introduce Ramires?! Kakuta is still so raw, he cant
                  seem to find a way past Arsenal's defence at all. Bosingwa is also
                  another strange substitution because it's obvious that Drogba is
                  stuggling to find supplies from midfield area. I thought a wiser
                  decision would be to have Daniel Sturridge on but he's not even on
                  the bench!</p>

              <p>When you are given a wooden spoon to dig a mountain and the wooden spoon is broken, I am sure you will look lost too..Lol .. Oh well, I guess I am exaggerating it haha..<br><br>But so far it seems like the young substitue players Sturridge or Kakuta are no way near ready to at least stand in temporarily for the first teamers like Drogba or Anelka. Fabio Borini, Josh MacEacharan, Jeffrey Bruma and Patrick van Aanholt are young players whom hardly have a sniff of even being subs. Where has players like Benayoun gone to I wonder.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, Man Utd, are able to call the likes of the young but effective Javier Hernandez as well as young but quite experience players like Darren Gibson or Fedrico Macheda and during a certain time Johnny Evans to stand in for Berbatov, Rooney, Ferdinand, Giggs et al.. Man Utd has a good mix of youth and experience.<br><br>At Chelsea, the problem of having a sugar daddy to pump in the cash to bring in quality players has now become apparent. Youth development is neglected because incrediluous amount of money can be used to bring in the quality. One day when the owner decides not to invest so much in the club, they will be unable to call upon their youth...nor be able to bring in/replenish quality re-enforcements. Chelsea are in this state now, make do with neither youth (admit it, Macheda, Hernandez, Gibson, Evans have far too much experience compared to Kakuta, Bruma, Van Aanholt or Borini) nor new faces (barred the ineffective Ramires).</p>

              <p>Van Aanholt has the most experiences of the Chelsea youth, he had a decent season with Newcastle last season.</p>
              <p>The supposing subsitiutes such as Zhirkov, Benayoun and Anelka are all INJURIED. Thats why you see youngsters sitting on the bench.</p>
