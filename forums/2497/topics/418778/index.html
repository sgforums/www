              <p><strong>Ashley Cole has warned Arsenal that Chelsea are ready to fire after finally getting all their big guns back ahead of Monday's night's derby clash.</strong></p>
              <p>The faltering Barclays Premier League champions will be at full strength for the first time in four months at the Emirates Stadium, where they romped to a 3-0 win last season.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are on their worst run in the league for more than a decade, having won just one of their last seven games and slumping from top to fourth spot.</p>
              <p>Injuries to the likes of John Terry, Frank Lampard and Michael Essien hit them hard but all three are back, with star midfielder Lampard set to start his first game since August.</p>
              <p>And England left-back Cole is confident the Blues can reignite their title defence with a victory over his former club.</p>
              <p>'We've been disappointing in our last six games and it's a big contrast to how we started the season, but we have a lot of big players back to fitness and it's going to give us a boost,' he said.</p>
              <p>'Any team who has their top players out is going to be affected.</p>
              <p>'The players who have come in have done a good job but you're always going to miss JT, Lamps and Essien. We seem to play better when they are all in the team; hopefully we can start to push on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>'They're major players for us and we have missed their personalities, desire, will to win and leadership.</strong></p>
              <p>'We have been unlucky in games, even though we haven't been playing well. We have still had a lot of shots and chances.</p>
              <p>'It has not gone our way but, now the big guys are back, hopefully we can turn our season around because it is getting to the important part.</p>
              <p>'We're fourth in the table; we have to get back on track and start winning again.'</p>
              <p>Manager Carlo Ancelotti yesterday claimed Arsenal were 'afraid' of Didier Drogba, who has scored 13 goals in 13 games against them.</p>
              <p>The Ivory Coast striker has not been in top form this season following a malaria scare and also had to cope with the pressure of the captaincy in Terry's absence.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Cole added on Chelsea TV: 'It was hard for Didier to get the guys' morale up and focused. 'But now everyone is back, everyone is going to come together again and push on.'</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal are a point better off than Chelsea in the table but this did not stop Manchester United winger Nani dismissing their title chances this week.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti disagrees with that assessment, saying: 'Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham have an opportunity and the skill to fight for the title until the end.</p>
              <p>'It will be a race with balance because a lot of teams have the ability to win, not just United.'</p>
              <p>And despite Chelsea boasting five wins in their last five meetings with the Gunners, Ancelotti will take nothing for granted on Monday.</p>
              <p>'Either team can win this game,' he said. 'It will be an exciting game in this period.</p>
              <p>'I'm happy to play this game because we've moved on from the bad moment and we're able to come back and fight for the title.'</p>
              <p>Ancelotti yesterday bemoaned a fixture schedule that sees his side play Bolton less than 48 hours after Monday night's match.</p>
              <p>He is understandably reluctant, therefore, to set a points target for the hectic festive period, saying: 'It's difficult to think about this.</p>
              <p>'It's easier to think that we have to do our best to win against Arsenal and then against Bolton.'</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsene Wenger</span> has billed Arsenal's game at home to Chelsea on Monday as 'must-win' but said he did not expect the visitors to show any weakness.</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal have consistently struggled to match the top teams and, while the table suggests they are serious contenders, results against title rivals often prove vital at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have already suffered defeats at Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford this season, but Wenger believes they proved a match for Chelsea and Manchester United and is confident of success at Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>"Of course this is a must-win game," he said. "We have mixed feelings because we came out of both games against Chelsea and Man United this season thinking we could have won and that there wasn't a difference between the teams.</p>
              <p>"We have a good opportunity to show that in the coming months and that our improvement is bigger than any other team because we are a very young side.</p>
              <p>"It's about how well we respond to what happened to us at Chelsea and Man United that will be the decider for our season. We have played Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool away, so our home form in these kind of games will be decisive.</p>
              <p>"We are confident over taking Chelsea on at home. We face a big challenge. What we want is to produce an intelligent game full of dynamism. That is the only way we can win these big games."</p>

              <h2>CHELSEA CLASH IS VITAL - WENGER&lt;!</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><img src="http://images.football365.com/10/10/240/Chelsea-v-Arsenal-Arsene-Wenger_2511089.jpg" alt="Wenger - says Arsenal must win."></h2>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger believes Monday night's Barclays Premier League clash with Chelsea will play a critical role in defining Arsenal's season. </strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners have already endured defeats at Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford this term and Wenger insists their response to those setbacks will be key to their title aspirations.</p>
              <p>They enter Monday's showdown at Emirates Stadium on the receiving end of five successive defeats in the fixture, leaking 13 goals in the process.</p>
              <p>Wenger knows a precious victory over a title rival would give Arsenal's Christmas schedule the best possible start.</p>
              <p>"Of course this is a must-win game," the Frenchman said. "We have mixed feelings because we came out of both games against Chelsea and Man United this season thinking we could have won and that there wasn't a difference between the teams.</p>
              <p>"We have a good opportunity to show that in the coming months and that our improvement is bigger than any other team because we are a very young side.</p>
              <p>"It's about how well we respond to what happened to us at Chelsea and Man United that will be the decider for our season.</p>
              <p>"We have played Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool away so our home form in these kind of games will be decisive.</p>
              <p>"We are confident over taking Chelsea on at home. We face a big challenge. What we want is to produce an intelligent game full of dynamism. That is the only way we can win these big games."</p>
              <p>Chelsea have dropped to fourth in the Premier League table following a run of five games without a win, offering Arsenal a glimmer of hope they can topple the champions.</p>
              <p>Wenger recognises that their self-belief has weakened but believes their revival could begin at any moment.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea have gone through a period where results are a bit less good but that can happen to anyone in this league," he said.</p>
              <p>"We have seen recently that any team, when you think they are on the brink of breaking through, can have a hiccup. Maybe it's just the quality of the league.</p>
              <p>"You never know whether it's the best time to play Chelsea. Every game is specific and a new start.</p>
              <p>"They have a little bit less confidence than they had in October but we know that winning will be down to our performance.</p>
              <p>"We know that on Monday we will play against a top team and we do not expect any weakness on their side.</p>
              <p>"We want to put a top-level performance in at the Emirates and show we are masters at home."</p>
              <p>Arsenal enter the Christmas period second in the table and even Wenger wonders at their ongoing challenge for the title.</p>
              <p>"I'm surprised that we lost five games - three of them at home against teams who are not normally fighting for the championship - but we're still near the top," he said.</p>
              <p>"The good news is that we are still in a good position and have not paid a high price for that.</p>
              <p>"Of course our home form in the second part of the season will be the decider."</p>
              <p>Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie are available to make their first start together since August, while goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski is also available.</p>
              <p>Arsenal travel to Wigan next Wednesday and visit Birmingham on New Year's Day before hosting Manchester City four days later.</p>

              <p><span>The Barclays Premier League champions crushed the Gunners 3-0 at the Emirates Stadium last season and 4-1 in the previous campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span>Last November's victory was widely described as 'men against boys' and although Chelsea go into Monday's game on their worst run of league form for a decade, captain Terry believes a repeat performance is on the cards.</span></p>

              <p><span>Chelsea have won only one of their last seven league games and have not tasted victory in any competition for more than a month.</span></p>
              <p><span>That was partly because of the postponement of last Sunday's home clash with Manchester United, who the Blues could find themselves six points behind when they take to the field on Monday.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Everyone is in the right frame of mind; it will be two weeks by the time the game comes around since we've played,' added Terry.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We're raring to go and want to get off to a flying start.'</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Chelsea's miserable run has seen them slip from top spot to fourth in the table, a point behind Monday's opponents.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>They have only found the net four times and kept just one clean sheet in that period, which coincided with injuries to key men Terry, Frank Lampard and Michael Essien.</span></p>
              <p><span>But all their star names are back for tomorrow's game against a side who have scored plenty of goals but have been unable to keep them out at the other end.</span></p>
              <p><span>Terry said: 'Defensively they've conceded goals, and with our strike force and the threat we pose opposition sides all the time, one goal and a bit of confidence and everything is looking bright for us again.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It just takes that one thing to set it off, and hopefully a goal away at Arsenal will do that, and we want to get back to keeping clean sheets.'</span></p>
              <p><span>However, manager Carlo Ancelotti does not believe Chelsea will find winning at the Emirates as easy as they did last term.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I think Arsenal changed a little bit compared to last season,' he said.</span><span> <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'They've improved their experience.</span><span> I think that it could be a different game compared to last season.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti became the first manager to win the double at Chelsea during his first season in charge as Arsenal's trophyless run stretched to five years.</span></p>
              <p><span>But the Blues boss believes tomorrow's opponents - who are strong favourites to land the Carling Cup - may be on the verge of ending that drought.</span></p>
              <p><span>'They were not able to win (trophies) in the last years because I think that to win you need to have experience in your squad,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'With young players, it's difficult to find this immediately.</span></p>
              <p><span>'You have to spend time to give to the young players the opportunity to improve their experience.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti is also confident his own side will not end the season empty-handed, revealing he had once again used the club's Christmas meal to spell out his ambitions to his players.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Last year, at the same time, we had a Christmas dinner and we spoke about how our dream was to win something and, at the end, we were able to win,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'This year is the same: our dream is to win something. I said to my players the same things.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We were not sure last year to win something. We did a fantastic job.</span><span> This year is the same.'</span></p>

              <p><strong>Captain </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8931/John-Terry"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><strong>John Terry</strong></span></a><strong> is hoping Chelsea can dish out another heavy defeat to Arsenal when they visit Emirates Stadium on Monday.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After winning 3-0 and 4-1 in consecutive seasons, the Blues appear to have the beating of the Gunners on their own turf. But <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=96"><span style="color: #225fb2;">Carlo Ancelotti</span></a>'s side make the trip across London in their worst run of form in a decade, which suggests another huge win is unlikely.</p>
              <p>"We think we can go there and do what we did last year,'' Terry told Chelsea's official website. "If we're not thinking that, we shouldn't be playing.</p>
              <p>"Everyone is in the right frame of mind; it will be two weeks by the time the game comes around since we've played. We're raring to go and want to get off to a flying start.''</p>
              <p>Chelsea, who should be back to full strength for the match, will hope to take advantage of an Arsenal defence, which has struggled to keep clean sheets for much of the campaign.</p>
              <p>Terry said: "Defensively they've conceded goals, and with our strikeforce and the threat we pose opposition sides all the time, one goal and a bit of confidence and everything is looking bright for us again.</p>
              <p>"It just takes that one thing to set it off, and hopefully a goal away at Arsenal will do that, and we want to get back to keeping clean sheets.''</p>
              <p>However, Chelsa coach Ancelotti didnot echo his captain's bullishness aout the Blues' chances of ripping Arsene Wenger's side apart.</p>
              <p>"I think Arsenal changed a little bit compared to last season,'' he said. "They've improved their experience. I think that it could be a different game compared to last season.</p>
              <p>"Last year, at the same time, we had a Christmas dinner and we spoke about how our dream was to win something and, at the end, we were able to win. This year is the same: our dream is to win something. I said to my players the same things.</p>

              <p>chelsea defence so shit. if arsenal go out all attack will be able to crack it.</p>
              <p>chelsea attack depends on drogba, anelka, malouda, lampard; their 3 strikers form recently has been apocalyptic.</p>
              <p>everybody remembers kalou saying chelsea can wrap up title by xmas lol. now they 4th place and their fixtures ahead not easy. plus the 5th and 6th placed teams are just right behind them.</p>
              <p>chelsea dont buck up may lose out on CL spot even. maybe lampard is one man show</p>

              <p>If d refs let up, Asrenal may lose. No teams can match Chelsea in a fair game even if they put their 2nd team out!!</p>
              <p>But Britain is still sore over losing wc2018 spot so e F.A will make sure both teams will not hit top spot anytime soon. Since both hv Russian connections.</p>

              <p>it is so ironical that people are barking that the refs are giving the title to certain teams when accordingly, they turn a blind eye when refs/FA gives them so much leverage..</p>

              <p>With a team full of 30+ first teamers and a bench deprived of young or able backups even Hiddink would be struggling. <br><br>Hiddink did well during his time at Chelsea? Well that time the team was still not as stale compared to now. Ancelotti did win the league and cup double least you not forget. <br><br>Chelsea need to add in a few new faces to their team, that is more likely to solve problems than bring in Hiddink and let him still work with the same old players</p>

              <p>You know something must be wrong when the 1st choice Substitute is Ramires. The commentator also said something that goes "Ramires looks like a stick, how on earth is he a defensive midfielder?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, I think Arsenal got their lucky break when the last 2 goals Chelsea conceded was largely due to error. Essien's mistake in tackling caused the 2nd goal while Malouda was caught in possession in the 1st.</p>
              <p>I thought Ancelotti look damn lost at the touchline when Arsenal hit them on the break. He doesn't seem to have a plan B. Oh yeah, plan B is to introduce Ramires?! Kakuta is still so raw, he cant seem to find a way past Arsenal's defence at all. Bosingwa is also another strange substitution because it's obvious that Drogba is stuggling to find supplies from midfield area. I thought a wiser decision would be to have Daniel Sturridge on but he's not even on the bench!</p>
