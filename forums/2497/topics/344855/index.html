              <p><strong>Serie A leaders Inter Milan suffered a stunning 3-1 defeat at Atalanta on Sunday before Juventus cut the gap at the top to three points with a 1-1 draw at Lazio.</strong></p>
              <p>The title race is very much on at the halfway stage of the season after champions Inter dropped points for the second weekend in a row following last Saturday's 1-1 home draw with Cagliari.</p>
              <p>Striker Sergio Floccari scored a superb opener for mid-table Atalanta on 18 minutes before playmaker Cristiano Doni extended their lead with a deflected free kick and a powerful header in the first half.</p>
              <p>Jose Mourinho used all his three substitutes by the start of the second period but his side barely mustered a shot on target before Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted a consolation in injury time.</p>
              <p>"I can't explain it," Mourinho told Sky television before he clashed with interviewers.</p>
              <p>"I should keep quiet and let the sports press use any adjective they want, which I must accept given my team played such an awful match."</p>
              <p>Before the Cagliari draw, Inter had won eight league matches in a row but have rarely hit top form all season.</p>
              <p>Bergamo-based Atalanta are always a threat at home and 22 out of their 27 points this term have come in their own stadium.</p>
              <p>In the late game in Rome, Cristian Ledesma put Lazio ahead midway through the first half when his free kick from near the touchline was misjudged by goalkeeper Alex Manninger and drifted into the top corner.</p>
              <p>Manninger, who has admirably filled in for the injured Gianluigi Buffon for the past three months, was only playing because the fit-again Italy keeper went down with a fever.</p>
              <p>Sweden defender Olof Mellberg headed in the equaliser on the half hour for second-placed Juve, who hit the post through Nicola Legrottaglie in the second half among other chances.</p>
              <p>Last season's runners-up AS Roma, who had a terrible start to the campaign, are now just five points off a Champions League place after a wonderful overhead kick from Julio Baptista in injury time sealed a 1-0 win at lowly Torino.</p>
              <p>AC Milan in third are six points behind Inter after a 1-0 win over Fiorentina on Saturday in what could be Kaka's last game for the club if Manchester City's huge bid is successful.</p>

              <p>Shock because they are not expected to lose to smaller clubs... Inter has won the last 3 Serie A easily. This year with Jose having spent a lot of the club's money, they are expected to win the title easier but so far, some of his new signing have been flops... Big money signings like Mancini and Quaresma are not doing well and he is depending on former coach players... Ibrahimovic, <span style="color: #000000;">Julio Cruz to provide the attacking options.</span> And he still has Adriano on his hands which he don't seem to know what to do with his behaviour...</p>
              <p>Juve despite having a number of injuries to their important players like Buffon (who was still out in their last match) and Del Piero are now 3 points behind Inter only... They had a very bad start to the season due to injuries to many of their first team players earlier in the season and Ranieri was even consider for the sack but it seems like they have recover and have climb to 2nd place and within 3 points of Inter... All this while Buffon was out for like 3 months or so already so it would be quite surprising and probably unexpected if Inter allows Juve to overtake them...</p>

              <h1>Mourinho And Branca Involved In Furious Inter Spat</h1>
              <h2>Mourinho and Branca have been involved in a bitter spat over the club's views on the market...</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/35097_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="221"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Inter</strong></span><strong> coach </strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Jose Mourinho</strong></span><strong> and sporting director Marco Branca are on the war path after a bitter dispute over the club's transfer policies.</strong></p>
              <p>The 'Special One' is uncomfortable with Inter's stance on the market. <em>Sportmediaset </em>claims Mourinho has been involved in a nasty spat with Branca where tempers flared over the plans to trim the size of the squad.</p>
              <p>Mourinho wants to get rid of players in an attempt to enjoy a more managable squad, but Inter are not keen on sending out players on loan: it's here where the two men collided.</p>
              <p>Reports suggest the coach demanded his club get rid of Hernan Crespo, Nicolas Burdisso, Marco Materazzi and Olivier Dacourt.</p>
              <p>However, Branca disagreed. Inter are not in the mood to pay players wages if they go out on loan,and  as well as this, the club will risk losing out when the players' contracts expire. In other words, he sells now, or does nothing.</p>
              <p>Inter president Massimo Moratti will now have to put his foot down and intervene. The chief is unlikely to be impressed, he is still annoyed with Sunday's defeat and already made that clear earlier this week.</p>
              <p>The instability behind the scenes are likely to affect the club on the pitch. Tensions around the Adriano saga have settled, but a new soap opera is about to begin.</p>
