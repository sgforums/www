               Green<br><a href="mailto:info@sleague.com">info@sleague.com</a><br><br>Tampines
               Rovers maintained their strong Great Eastern-YEO’S S.League title 
              challenge with a simple 2-0 win over Balestier Khalsa at Toa Payoh 
              Stadium on Saturday night.<br><br>But it came at something of a cost for
               Singapore international Qiu Li, who came off the bench to score both 
              goals, only to return to it four minutes from the end.<br><br>Balestier 
              hung on well after falling behind to Qiu’s first strike a minute or two 
              before the break, but their plucky resistance ended when they failed to 
              chase back quickly enough to defend a counterattack on 79 minutes and 
              paid the price after some unselfish work by Aleksandar Duric.<br><br>“We
               were caught off guard for their first goal,” said Tigers coach 
              Nasaruddin Jalil afterwards.<br><br>“We held them well for most of the 
              game, but when you look at it they have more foreigners than we do; we 
              only have four,” he quipped, referring to the fact that Duric and Qiu, 
              both members of the Singapore national team, were once considered as 
              ‘foreign talent’.<br><br>“We gave them a hard game and should not have 
              let them score a second goal the way they did, as we did not defend in 
              enough numbers after our own chance of scoring was lost.<br><br>“It’s 
              not an excuse, but the suspensions and injuries we had coming into the 
              game – Ishak Zainol in particular – and the sadness surrounding (winger 
              K.) Vikraman must have had some impact,” said Nasaruddin.<br><br>Of 
              Vikraman, who lost his wife in tragic circumstances only days earlier 
              and for whom a minute’s silence was observed before the match, the coach
               said it was up to the player himself to decide when he felt ready to 
              play again.<br><br>The 45-year-old added that the rest of the team will 
              support him irrespective of when he feels ready to rejoin the side.<br><br>Balestier
               created few scoring chances in the game, it has to be said, with 
              Tampines keeper Hassan Sunny given little to do for most of the match.<br><br>Tampines,
               on the other hand, were also unable to penetrate much as a resolute 
              Balestier held them at bay until ten minutes from the break, when 
              Vorawan Chitavanich invited the injury-prone Qiu to come on for former 
              Tigers defender Jufri Taha.<br><br>The strongly-built striker slipped 
              immediately into a deep-lying midfield slot, and Tampines began to look 
              like a team that would soon score after a lacklustre opening period.<br><br>When
               the goal came, characteristically it was an individual effort by Qiu 
              that his coach even admitted was lucky when interviewed after the match.<br><br>The
               former Home United star had received the ball 35 yards out on the 
              right, and no Balestier player tried to close him down, assuming, as 
              most would, that a shot from that range could only be a speculative one.<br><br>But
               Qiu has scored from similar situations before, and at least once this 
              season he had sent a first-time shot from distance into the roof of the 
              net.<br><br>His direct hit fooled Balestier keeper Ahmadulhaq Che Omar 
              completely as his defenders saw the ball sail over their heads before 
              landing in the centre of the net.<br><br>“I don’t think he could do that
               again,” said Nasaruddin, clearly unaware of Qiu’s prowess from 
              distance.<br><br>“It was a little lucky, but his second goal was very 
              good,” said Vorawan, more or less agreeing with his opposite number’s 
              assessment.<br><br>The second goal was good, not because of any 
              additional brilliance by Qiu, but because of the passing and unselfish 
              work of Duric in the lead-up which came after a straightforward 
              counterattack.<br><br>Balestier had looked likely to draw level on 78 
              minutes, when Rivaldo Costa intercepted a sloppy pass and got into the 
              six-yard box to fire a powerful shot that, for once, forced a save from 
              Hassan.<br><br>The goalkeeper could not hold the ball, however, and it 
              ran free to the left, where Vitor Borges was handily placed to make 
              something of the opportunity.<br><br>Borges, though, failed to reach the
               ball before a Tampines defender, and it was quickly sent upfield.<br><br>It
               reached Duric on the left, out wide, and the target-man soon took the 
              ball to the byline, despite being reasonably well-placed to try a shot 
              of his own from a tight angle.<br><br>An alternative route was sought as
               he laid the ball back to the edge of the penalty area, where Qiu had 
              arrived in support, and the resultant shot from the latter was sent low 
              and accurately into the centre of the net, with Ahmadulhaq powerless to 
              slow or even stop its progress.<br><br>Moments later Qiu, already 
              carrying an ankle injury, collapsed in the penalty area and had to be 
              stretchered off.<br><br>Vorawan, conscious that his title-hunting side 
              has another game against Albirex Niigata (Singapore) in four days’ time,
               was concerned about his prize striker, whose two goals took his tally 
              to 15 for the season, level with Frederic Mendy of first-placed club 
              Etoile FC.<br><br>Qiu may now be level with Mendy, but Tampines 
              themselves are still two points behind after both sides have played 22 
              matches thus far.<br><br>“We don’t know how bad Qiu Li’s injury is,” 
              said his coach.<br><br>“I don’t think it is too bad, but I don’t think 
              we’ll be risking starting him against Albirex.<br><br>“We brought 
              Khairul Amri on today off the bench as well and we’d like to start him 
              in the next game, but he is still complaining of some soreness and we 
              hope he can play on Wednesday.”<br><br>Tampines gave Balestier very 
              little chance of scoring throughout the game as the experienced Park Yo 
              Seb, Seiji Kaneko and Benoit Croissant were very solid.<br><br>A stray 
              pass was not enough to tilt the game away from Tampines late on either.<br><br>“After
               we scored,” said Vorawan, “we controlled the game.”<br><br>Twice in the
               game Tampines lost possession and might have been punished, and they 
              did allow Balestier a period midway through the second half when they 
              sat back and let the Tigers come at them.<br><br>A ball given away in 
              midfield by Akihiro Nakamura was a rare blemish by the Stags, and it 
              came on 47 minutes, but Andrew Tan, charging towards goal, was somewhat 
              hasty in his attempt at capitalising on the mistake and blasted his shot
               well over the bar once inside the six-yard box.<br><br>Hassan therefore
               only had one crucial save to make, from Costa as earlier mentioned, and
               his opposite number, while conceding twice, spared his teammates a 
              greater losing margin with one fine save from Aliff Shafaein on 51 
              minutes in a game where clear-cut chances were at a premium, even for 
              the winners.<br><br>Balestier have a longer rest after this than do 
              Tampines, with a match at Jalan Besar on Friday against Sengkang Punggol
               to look forward to.<br><br>Tampines may overtake Etoile on Wednesday if
               they can prevail against the White Swans, and could hold the lead 
              longer than merely overnight depending on the outcome of the French 
              team’s visit to Yishun Stadium to play Beijing Guoan the following 
              evening.<br><br>For Vorawan, though, the chief concern would be his 
              men’s health – particularly that of talismanic striker Qiu.</span></span></p>
