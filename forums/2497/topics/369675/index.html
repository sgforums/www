              <h2>IBRAHIMOVIC MEDICAL FINDS FRACTURE</h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic has completed his medical
              with Barcelona, the European champions have confirmed, but they have
              detected a fracture in his left hand.</p>
              <p>Ibrahimovic, having arrived in the city on Sunday evening,
              underwent various medical tests on Monday morning as he puts the
              finishing touches on his move from Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old was set to be confirmed as a Barcelona player
              at 6pm local time before being presented at the Nou Camp around half an
              hour later and the club have not revealed whether his injury will
              affect their plans.</p>
              <p>"We've extensively examined the injury to his left hand," club doctor Ricard Pruna told www.fcbarcelona.cat.</p>
              <p>"We've seen that he has a fracture at the base of the second metacarpal of his left hand.</p>
              <p>"It's a fracture that we have to study how to fix it so that he can play as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>"This afternoon we will meet up and decide what treatment we will do."</p>
              <p>Ibrahimovic hurt his hand playing for Inter in a pre-season friendly against Chelsea in Los Angeles last week.</p>

              <p>The Sweden striker has joined the European champions - with an astronomical buy-out clause of €250m in his contract - after he passed a medical in Spain, though scans did reveal a fracture in his left hand, and wasted no time in launching a parting shot towards his soon-to-be former club.</p>
              <p>"When did I start thinking about moving somewhere else? In December, before Christmas,'' he is reported as saying on <em>Tuttomercatoweb.it</em>. "The more I saw Barcelona play, the more I wanted to leave.</p>
              <p>"Moreover, I was fed up of Italy, of Milan, of your football: you play badly, there's too much stress. In short, I needed something else. Did Inter pay me more than any other footballer? No comment.''</p>
              <p>A statement on Barcelona's website revealed they had paid Inter Milan €46m euros for the Swedish striker, with Samuel Eto'o and Alexander Hleb also joining the Italian champions in the 'swap' deal.</p>
              <p>Barca confirmed that Eto'o is valued at €20m in the deal, while Inter will have the chance to buy Hleb for an initial €10m euros once his season-long loan spell is concluded.</p>

              <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic triggered a mass pitch invasion at the Nou Camp after completing his move to Barcelona. The Sweden star has signed a five-year deal despite the European champions discovering a fracture in his medical. And when Ibrahimovic was presented at the Spanish giants, supporters stormed the pitch in delight.</p>
              <p>The enigmatic forward arrives after Inter Milan accepted an offer of around £40million  with Samuel Eto'o and Alexander Hleb also joining the Italian champions in the 'swap' deal.</p>
              <p>But the club revealed they had detected a fracture in the striker's left hand, which he sustained during Inter's pre-season defeat to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> last week, before confirming the switch on Monday afternoon.</p>
              <p>'We've extensively examined the injury to his left hand,' club doctor Ricard<br>Pruna told the club's official website. 'We've seen that he has a fracture at the base of the second metacarpal of his left hand.</p>
              <p>'It's a fracture that we have to study how to fix it so that he can play as soon as possible. This afternoon we will meet up and decide what treatment we will do.'</p>
              <p>Now Barcelona have wrapped up the Ibrahimovic deal, they will turn their attention to making one last attempt to lure <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool's</span></a> Javier Mascherano.</p>
              <p>The Argentina midfielder is desperate to join the European champions but the Reds are refusing to sell, particularly as Xabi Alonso looks set to leave for Real Madrid.</p>

              <p>'Every player wants to come to Barca, but not everybody can. When I saw Barca were interested in me I told my manager to sort it out and he’s done a great job.</p>
