              <p>Emanuel Eboue will put weeks of torment behind him and re-sign with Arsenal.</p>
              <p>The Ivorian was booed and jeered by fans at various stages earlier
              this year but has hit back hard in recent weeks highlighted by a double
              after coming off the bench against Blackburn on the weekend.</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said he was delighted Eboue would remain at Emirates Stadium and happy his form had turned around.</p>
              <p>"I am pleased that Eboue starts to score because it looked to us that he could never score goals,” he told the club’s <em>official website</em>.</p>
              <p>"It shows as well the importance of a psychological factor
              because he scored last week, again this week and could have scored
              another one. Before that he never looked like scoring so it's more in
              their heads sometimes.</p>
              <p>"If he had not scored his goal, and not scored last week, he
              would not have taken the penalty today and that tells you the
              importance of confidence.</p>
              <p>"We have already tied up Eboue's contract - that has been done for a long time."</p>

              <p>If eboue can keep up with his recent performances why not let him stay. It seems like recently every arsenal players have moved up a notch in their game. Even the normal rubbish eboue seems to have more positive attitude and to score 3 goals in a week for him was great for his confidence.</p>
              <p>Knowing that the injured players are coming back coupled with the arrival of masterclass arshavin, players know that competition for the places are getting more competitive. They have no choice but to perform better than what they used to be.</p>
              <p>Eboue's staying on would most likely result in him playing on the right flank, sharing the workload with walcott. Rosicky would be sharing the workload with Nasri. Denilson, Diaby, Song would be fighting for a place to partner fabregas. Or rather they can play in fabregas's role if wenger would want to rest fabregas.</p>
              <p>Therefore, this would allow wenger to rotate one or 2 players in the cup games, or during a stretch of games over just a few days.</p>
              <p>I reckon that if wenger persists in playing 4-5-1 (which was what he played during these past weeks, we would end up with a 5 men midfield which would most probably be as such:</p>
              <p>Nasri (left), Arshavin (centre) Walcott (right) Denilson (DM) Fabregas (both DM and centre).</p>
              <p>With this formation, arsenal can be very good. RvP can play as the main striker. Eduardo to deputise him if need be. Bendtner would have a very good chance to be arsenal's main striker if he improves on his shooting. Adebayor (haiz... i dont wanna mention him... just sucks). Vela can obviously just play as striker on on the left. Simpsons would probably join the first team next season, I would not expect him to have an impact. I think he would be more like aliadiere... stay awhile and sold!!</p>
              <p>Arsenal all the way, we might not be liverpool or man utd, but we are unique in our own ways. We would be a force next season, trust me.</p>
