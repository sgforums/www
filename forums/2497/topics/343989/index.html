              <h1>Rafa Benitez's dossier on Alex Ferguson could double as his suicide note.</h1>
              <h2>Rafa Benitez reveals exactly how Liverpool are going to throw away the title in today's Daily Bung...</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01236/rafa-benitez_1236967c.jpg" alt="Rafa Benitez's dossier on Alex Ferguson could double as his suicide note" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <p><em>Rafa's dossier on Sir could double as his suicide note</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, <strong>Rafa</strong>, let's review the last few days shall we? Dealing, as you prefer to do, in facts (<em>Bung unfolds A4 sheet of paper and clears throat....)</em></p>
              <p><strong>Rafa: </strong>United put pressure on referees at Old Trafford and all the decisions go their way.</p>
              <p><strong>Fact:</strong> United have perfectly good goal disallowed when assistant referee chooses to make up rule about need to inform him about corner kick plans. (Supplementary question to that linesman - what the hell do you think Rooney would be doing over there if he WASN'T taking the corner? Blowing his nose on the flag?)</p>
              <p><strong>Rafa: </strong>United are nervous.</p>
              <p><strong>Fact:</strong> United produce most emphatic display of the season in their biggest game of the season. United are now 8/11 to win the title, the shortest they have been all season.</p>
              <p><strong>Rafa: </strong>Attacking Mr Ferguson will not affect my team or put more pressure on my players.</p>
              <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Liverpool fail to beat Stoke, the first time they have not won away against so-called inferior (non Big Four) opposition since November 1.</p>
              <p><strong>Rafa: </strong>"We know what kind of player Robbie Keane is. He needs people around him to pass the ball well. I believe he will be OK"</p>
              <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Keane, who at £20.3 million cost more than Stoke's entire first team, was left on the bench despite the 0-0 scoreline as Benitez chose to make only two substitutions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>=========================================================</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>THE HEADLINES THIS HOUR</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Kevin Davies</strong> has accused Arsenal's players of screaming every time they are tackled. "It's embarrassing. A few easy free-kicks were given because they let out a big scream" growled Kev, while picking bits of Gael Clichy's shin bone out of his studs.</p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Harry Redknapp </strong>has been honoured by the Football Writers' Association after taking two points from his last five games at Tottenham. 'Arry now has a worse record than Juande Ramos after his first 20 games in charge. He has blamed Spurs' problems on the previous regime signing too many small players. Redknapp's first signing: Jermain Defoe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Has <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong> lost interest in Chelsea? Well, I guess it's all relative. Even if Rom got his mate to text him the score yesterday, that'd still count as showing more interest than Chelsea's players did...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And <strong>Fulham </strong>are planning to improve their facilities after the postponement of their game against Blackburn cost them £100,000. Good to see that it's lost revenue, and not the scandalous treatment of Blackburn fans, or the humiliating fact that neighbouring QPR were still able to stage a match on Saturday, which caused Fulham to act.</p>
