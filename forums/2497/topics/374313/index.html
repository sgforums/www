              <h2>CHELSEA SUSPECT CONSPIRACY - REPORTS</h2>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><span><strong>Chelsea were given no warning of their
                                      extraordinary two-window transfer ban and believe they are the
                                      victims of an anti-English conspiracy, according to
                                      reports.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reeling from the ramifications of a ban that will prevent them
                                      signing any new players until January 2011, Chelsea have pledged to
                                      'mount the strongest appeal' against FIFA's ruling. 'Chelsea will
                                      argue that the punishment is disproportionate to the relatively
                                      modest fine imposed and the nature of the offence, while senior
                                      figures at the club - who have maintained their innocence - believe
                                      that they are victims of an anti-English conspiracy at the heart of
                                      Fifa and Uefa,' claims The Times.</p>
              <p> The bombshell ruling from FIFA against that the current leaders
                                      of the Premier League was delivered just two days after the closure
                                      of the latest transfer window in which, the signing of Yury Zhirkov
                                      apart, the Stamford Bridge club were mere observers. It seems as if
                                      the club were caught completely by surprise when a fax was
                                      delivered to their offices on Thursday afternoon informing them of
                                      their punishment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Chelsea were stunned as they had not been expecting a verdict
                                      for another three months,' reports The Times, while a concurring
                                      Daily Mail adds that, 'The announcement took Chelsea by surprise,
                                      given it usually takes FIFA's dispute resolution chamber two or
                                      three months to reach a decision.</p>
              <p>'The hearing for this case only took place last week. According
                                      to one source, it is partly because the world governing body has
                                      lost patience with Chelsea for what is seen as arrogance over the
                                      way they sometimes conduct transfers. So much so that Sportsmail
                                      understands former employees have been approached in recent months
                                      to assist with their investigation.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having announced their intention to appeal, Chelsea will be
                                      hopeful that, following the outcome of a similar case involving
                                      Roma in 2005, their two-window punishment will be halved by the
                                      Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, says The Times, 'Any attempts by Chelsea to delay the
                                      hearing in the hope of having the transfer ban frozen by the CAS,
                                      thereby enabling them to buy players in January, are likely to fail
                                      as Fifa seems certain to fast-track the appeal.'</p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>UEFA president Michel Platini has backed FIFA over their reaction to the Gael Kakuta affair.</strong> </p>
              <p>FIFA have banned Chelsea from signing any players in the next two transfer windows after finding them guilty of poaching the former Lens player in 2007. </p>
              <p>The Stamford Bridge outfit and Kakuta were both handed fines, and the player was also banned from playing for four months. </p>
              <p>Platini has thrown his weight behind the ban, insisting that action has to be taken to stop clubs poaching young talent. </p>
              <p>"It's a FIFA decision but we're interested in what happens," the Frenchman told <em>the Sun</em>. </p>
              <p>"It is necessary to make rules in the transfer market of young players. I say this not because Chelsea or another team is involved, but the illegal traffic of young players has to be stopped." </p>
              <p>The Blues face a second legal threat over allegations they tapped up an 11-year-old from French amateur side ASPTT Marseille in October 2008. </p>
              <p>Youngster Jeremy Boga switched to West London after five years with the French side, and fresh allegations have emerged that Chelsea pushed through the transfer by arranging accommodation and a car for the player's parents. </p>
              <p>ASPTT will ask lawyers whether the circumstances of the move broke the rules set out in FIFA's Article 19 which governs international transfers involving youngsters.</p>
