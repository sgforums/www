              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2009/1021/pepereinawoe20091020_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Pepe Reina " width="470" height="264"></p>
              <p>Liverpool goalkeeper <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=12910">Pepe Reina</a> has revealed he is ready to sign an extended contract at Anfield - and
              also insisted the club are very much still in the title race.</p>
              <p>Reina has been one of the Reds' most consistent performers since
              moving to the Premier League from Villarreal four years ago and is
              considered to be one of the very best goalkeepers in England's top
              flight.</p>
              <p>But despite a horrific run of form which has seen
              Liverpool lose six of their last seven games in all competitions, and
              slump to a fifth Premier League defeat of the season at Fulham on
              Saturday, Reina believes hopes of winning the Premier League title for
              the first time since 1990 should not be ruled out.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, who trail leaders Chelsea by nine points, also face a crucial Champions League tie away to Lyon this week.</p>
              <p>Reaina
              said: "The title race is not even close to being over. We have to go
              game by game. Now we must focus on Lyon, which is massive, and after
              that Birmingham is a must-win game next Monday in the league.''</p>
              <p>Talks
              on a new deal are expected to open soon and Reina added: "My aim is to
              get a new contract in the future and I want to be here for many years.
              Apparently the club wants the same. It's already my fifth season here
              and that says it all, really. One of my daughters is a Scouser.</p>
              <p>"I have some friends here and my wife and kids are happy. I have every reason to stay longer and of course I will.''</p>
              <p>Reina also backed beleaguered boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=28">Rafael Benitez</a> to turn things around: "Titles are what we are all here for. As a
              Liverpool player you have to have these ambitions. Trophies are the
              most important thing and the most important one is probably the Premier
              League.</p>
              <p>"Rafa is building something special here. He proved that
              when he came here; the club was one thing and now it's something
              totally different. We have grown up and we can still grow up a little
              bit more.''</p>
