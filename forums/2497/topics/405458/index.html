              <h2>SHEARER IN FRAME FOR ENGLAND?</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Alan Shearer has emerged as a candidate for the England coaching
                   staff after Fabio Capello reportedly agreed to add another Englishman.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Capello already has Stuart Pearce and Ray Clemence on his 
                  otherwise-Italian staff, but it has been reported that he has agreed to 
                  add another - with Shearer's name already mentioned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Capello agreed to work with Sir Trevor Brooking in a bid to 
                  develop the skills of English coaches following a meeting of the 
                  Football Association Board at Wembley on Friday afternoon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The FA also confirmed its intention to recruit an independent 
                  chairman who they hope to have installed early in the new year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Brooking, along with FA General Secretary Alex Horne, will also 
                  work on providing a raft of recommendations in relation to international
                   and youth player development and the coaching education set-up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The FA board plan to consider these recommendations by December.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is understood there was a "lengthy" discussion about England's
                   performance at the tournament in South Africa and how to find a way 
                  forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Capello's squad won just one game out of four and crashed out 4-1
                   to Germany in the last 16 stage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The defeat was the heaviest in World Cup history for England but 
                  despite speculation over his future after the tournament, the FA 
                  announced that Capello was to remain as coach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But he will now be supported by Brooking, the FA's Director of 
                  Football Development, as the FA Board look for ways of improving the 
                  skills and development of English coaches.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The move will also provide the Italian boss with more English 
                  support, particularly when assistant Stuart Pearce is working with the 
                  under-21 international squad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Capello will also work closely with the Board of Club England as 
                  they look to qualify for the European Championships in two years' time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Brooking's increasingly pivotal role in the game will also see 
                  him work closely with Horne when it comes to advocating ways to improve 
                  the development of England's international players.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The pair will produce a set of recommendations in relation to 
                  international player development that will also consider all aspects of 
                  the FA's current youth development and coach education set-up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The FA are determined to learn from successful countries, in 
                  football as well as other sports, in order to enhance their own 
                  development plan for England's top players.</p>
