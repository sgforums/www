              <p>Nicklas Bendtner became an instant <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> hero with a stunning hat-trick in tonight's victory over Porto.</p>
              <p>Bendtner's hat-trick helped <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> make history on Tuesday night, his goals seeing the Gunners to a 5-0
              win over Porto on the night - 6-2 on aggregate - and into the last
              eight of the Champions League.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr>'s
              men, without the influence of injured pair Cesc Fabregas and William
              Gallas, came back from an opening-leg deficit in a European tie for the
              first time since 1978.</p>
              <p>Bendtner made up for his wastefulness at the weekend by scoring
              twice in the first half - both after good work from Andrey Arshavin.</p>
              <p>Samir Nasri scored a fine indivudual goal to make it 3-0 after
              Porto had threatened to fight back in the early stages of the second
              half.</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Eboue grabbed the hosts' fourth before Bendtner completed his treble at the death from the penalty spot.</p>

              <h1>Arsenal 5 Porto 0 (agg 6-2): Nicklas Bendtner leads massacre as it's a high five for top Gunners</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those who nicknamed him ‘Barndoor Bendtner’ after his efforts
              against Burnley might still take some convincing when the opportunities
              Arsenal’s Danish striker enjoyed did not exactly test his finishing
              ability.</p>
              <p>They might still say he could not score the kind of goal
              that Samir Nasri produced to make sure of Arsenal’s passage to the
              Champions League quarter-finals, beating three Porto players before
              driving a shot in off Helton’s right-hand post.</p>
              <p>Or indeed the
              goal that then followed from Emmanuel Eboue, who had the composure not
              only to time his run to perfection in meeting a wonderful ball from
              Andrey Arshavin but then rounded Porto’s goalkeeper to score Arsenal’s
              fourth goal of an extraordinary night.</p>
              <p>But convert those chances
              Nicklas Bendtner did — as well as an injury-time penalty for his
              hat-trick after the hopeless Fucile had brought down Eboue — and it
              still amounted to a fine response to the criticism he received after
              last weekend and daring to suggest earlier this season that he would
              finish the season as top scorer in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/09/article-1256702-08A69001000005DC-465_468x336.jpg" alt="Nicklas Bendtner" width="468" height="336">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Great Dane: Nicklas Bendtner fired a hat-trick to seal Arsenal's progression </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>He still has some way to go, and not just because the two he scored
              at the Emirates last night took his tally for the season to a modest
              eight.</p>
              <p>But Arsene Wenger needed someone who could rescue his side from what
              looked like a pretty precarious situation after the first leg of this
              Champions League tie and Bendtner delivered.</p>
              <p>Wenger must have been feeling pretty pleased with himself. Perhaps
              not as much as Bendtner, judging by the 22-year-old’s apparent capacity
              for self-adulation.</p>
              <p>But Wenger did not just predict that Bendtner would ‘score his next
              one’, he also confidently declared that his side would create a small
              piece of Arsenal ‘history’.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/09/article-1256702-08A6C891000005DC-787_468x312.jpg" alt="Emmanuel Eboue (second right) rounds FC Porto goalkeeper Da Silva Helton" width="468" height="312">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Completing the rout: Emmanuel Eboue rounds Porto keeper Helton </em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is more than 30 years since Arsenal last overturned a first-leg
              deficit in Europe and Wenger will take great joy from this when his
              young side ended that particular run in the absence of the injured Cesc
              Fabregas and William Gallas.</p>
              <p>Confidence will certainly be high at Arsenal after this. After the
              manner in which Arshavin destroyed Porto down their left side and the
              manner in which Thomas Vermaelen and Sol Campbell marshalled the
              defence.</p>
              <p>That said, the presence of Manuel Almunia in place of the error-prone Lukasz Fabianski also made a significant difference.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/09/article-1256702-08A6C549000005DC-121_468x313.jpg" alt="Solo stunner: Nasri fires home after mazy run to make it three for Arsenal" width="468" height="313">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Solo stunner: Nasri fires home after mazy run to make it three for Arsenal</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keen to regain control of this tie as soon as they could, Arsenal
              started with real purpose. Their football was fast, fluent and executed
              with real ferocity and Porto could do little to contain them.</p>
              <p>Bendtner went close to scoring when Gael Clichy sent in a teasing
              cross from the left — the Frenchman’s ball just eluded the towering
              Dane — and Arshavin forced a fine save from Helton when he met a fine
              delivery from Bacary Sagna with a close-range header.</p>
              <p>But Helton could do nothing to deny Bendtner in the 10th minute
              after right back Fucile diverted the ball past him in an effort to beat
              the advancing Arshavin to a super pass forward from Nasri.</p>
              <p>The ball spun into the path of Bendtner and the young Arsenal
              striker shrugged off the challenge of two Porto defenders to score with
              ease.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/09/article-1256702-08A69787000005DC-592_468x352.jpg" alt="Nicklas Bendtner" width="468" height="352">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Make mine a double: Nicklas Bendtner wheels away after firing his second of the evening</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>If Wenger was delighted to see his prediction come true, he would
              have been less impressed with his side’s failure to quickly add a
              second.</p>
              <p>They had their opportunities, not least in the form of an effort
              from Abou Diaby and a cross from Arshavin that flashed across the face
              of Porto’s goal. But Diaby missed and there was nobody in position to
              make the most of Arshavin’s brilliance.</p>
              <p>Until, that is, the hapless Fucile committed another clanger in the
              26th minute, this time in the form of a clearance that went straight to
              Arshavin. First the little Russian beat the full back, then Nuno Coelho
              before presenting Bendtner with a second opportunity to score into an
              empty net.</p>
              <p>Now, presumably, Porto were starting to panic as much as the bookies
              who gave Bendtner odds of 40-1 to score a hat-trick — perhaps Wenger
              had put on a fiver.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/09/article-1256702-08A6AC0B000005DC-20_468x286.jpg" alt="Nicklas Bendtner" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>At full stretch: Bendtner opens the scoring</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It was actually Arshavin who had a touch of the goalmouth jitters.
              He too should have scored in the 34th minute when Nasri accelerated
              into the Porto box and cut the ball back for his team-mate, but
              Arshavin blasted his shot over the bar when a simple pass into the net
              would have done the job.</p>
              <p>Wenger must have cursed at such philanthropy, because then it would
              have taken only one Porto goal to level the tie. A goal that very
              nearly came when Hulk cut in from the right and forced Almunia to make
              a decent save.</p>
              <p>Shortly before the break and Bendtner had two more chances, forcing
              saves from Helton with a header and a long-range shot. He also got
              booked for a rash challenge on Fucile, proving that that he still has
              much to learn.</p>
              <p>Nasri tested Helton after the interval and so did Arshavin, adding
              to Wenger’s concerns since Hulk was proving dangerous down the flanks.
              Falcao might have scored had it not been for Almunia and Nasri then
              cleared a header off the line.</p>

              <p>The Gunners thrashed Porto 5-0 last night to reach the next round.</p>
              <p>"I have a funny feeling," said Wenger. "Maybe it will be good for us to play an English team. We have not done well against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> or <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> this year and it would be good to show what we can do against them.</p>

              <p>The best buy Wenger did this season was to take Sol Campbell back... Imagine had he not done so, Silvestre would be playing this last month...</p>
              <p>This Sol is still solid... He may be old and slower but nothing beats an experienced and calm defender... And at the rate he is going, he may actually make the WC squad with all the problems they got in their defence...</p>
