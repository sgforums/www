              <h3>MARTIN O'NEILL has emerged as the man to replace Rafa Benitez.</h3>
              <p>American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett have identified O'Neill to 
              succeed the Spaniard if Liverpool fail to qualify for next season's 
              Champions League.</p>
              <p>Hicks, Gillett, and managing director Christian Purslow are standing by 
              beleaguered Benitez despite Liverpool's woeful recent run of form.</p>
              <p>But behind the scenes the mood of staunch support for Benitez has shifted as 
              Liverpool's season has lurched towards chaos, with six defeats, one draw and 
              just one win in their last eight games.</p>
              <p>The club are wary of making a knee-jerk reaction but recognise that unless 
              results improve dramatically - and soon - they will have to consider 
              replacing Benitez during the season rather than next summer.</p>
              <p>Kenny Dalglish has been tipped to hold the Anfield fort if Benitez IS sacked 
              before May but he would only be keeping the seat warm for O'Neill (left).</p>
              <p>Wednesday's 1-1 draw with Lyon leaves Liverpool's Champions League campaign in 
              a precarious position and five Premier League defeats already this season 
              means their first title since 1990 is a pipedream.</p>
              <p>Failing to qualify for the Champions League next season would have a huge 
              effect on Liverpool's already shaky financial position.</p>
              <p>The club's budget is based largely on Champions League qualification and an 
              absence from the top four would badly damage any chances of Hicks and 
              Gillett refinancing the club's debt.</p>
              <p>That is why Benitez's position is now being discussed by the club's hierarchy 
              and they have come to the conclusion that O'Neill is the best suited and 
              best placed to take the club forward.</p>
              <p>Twenty months ago, when things were wobbling under Benitez, the club flirted 
              with the idea of recruiting Jurgen Klinsmann. But the initial interest came 
              to nothing and despite having done a good job as German national manager at 
              the 2006 World Cup, Klinsmann's lack of credentials at club level were 
              exposed last season at Bayern Munich, where he was sacked in April. Since 
              then Liverpool have flirted with the idea of luring Jose Mourinho back to 
              England to take up the one job the 'Special One' has consistently said would 
              lure him back to the Premier League.</p>

              <p>Say what you like but pool is a bigger club than Villa. So I do belief O'Neill may want the job... cos its still like a step upwards...

Some people trying to defend him, conveniently blame the owners, but actually its all Rafa's doing that the team is where they are now...

              <p>Lets go look at how much O'Neill and Rafa has been given or spent these last few years... O'Neill has spent a lot lesser compare to Rafa... And still keep Villa in good shape...</p>

              <p>the problem with liverpool is that those players that can perform are not playing, whereas those lousy ones are playing.</p>
              <p>Liverpool should play back a normal 4-4-2.</p>
              <p>Reina as the Gk. Insua as the LB, Johnson as the RB. Skrtel and Agger as the CB.</p>
              <p>Mascherano as the DM. In front of him, play Benayoun in the playmaker role. Kuyt on the ring wing and Babel on the left wing. Play Gerrard as the second striker, and Torres up front.</p>
              <p>This way, pool will look dangerous and their defense would be stronger without Lucas and Carragher.</p>

              <p><br>We ask have Villa spent as much or even close to what Rafa have these last few years? The answer is No... And yet O'Neill still manage to keep them up there... And I belief there is no one else better than O'Neil when we talk about sacrifice quality for depth... Last season Villa had one of the smallest squad in the premier league... probably from not having enough money to buy extras... and his squad quality also came from small money purchased or self developed...</p>
              <p>Players like James Milner, <span style="color: #000000;">Curtis Davies</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">James Collins</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Richard Dunne</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Stephen Warnock</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Steve Sidwell</span>, Stiliyan Petrov, John Carew, <span style="color: #000000;">Emile Heskey</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Nicky Shorey all didn't cost much at the time he bought them... </span>Ashley Young for 9m from Watford, what a buy... today can sell from $20m to $25m... Gabriel Agbonlahor promoted from their own youth squad...</p>
              <p>So I would say he did quite a good job taking a lost Villa back to among the top sides... All at a rather low budget... And he never complain no this, no that, or no money like Rafa, giving excuses all the time...</p>

              <p>1. MON's sides do not play attractive football. They all play like Leicester City during Heskey era.</p>
              <p>2. Talking about Heskey, don't be surprised if MON brings the fellow with him.</p>
              <p>3. MON has his fair share of signing duds. Net player spending is not as small as you think yet he seems to end up claiming to have a small squad.</p>
              <p>4. Quite a few Villa fans think he is more clueless than Rafa at tactics and team selection.</p>

              <p>Big clubs, small clubs, who cares. It's the current crop of players/managers/fans that makes the difference, not the history as it's all about potential.</p>
              <p>Do you see bigger potential in O'Neil compared to Rafa? I don't think so. Rafa knows how to stroke the egos of the bigger players and push them to the edge, although he lacks the nurturing touch of Arsene I may have to admit.</p>
              <p>O'neil, is not bad tactically, manages very well, and creates a fighting unit out of any group of players given to him, but I don't quite see him as a top top manager in the calibre of Alex/Ancelotti/Capello/Rafa/Wenger/Mourinho and such. There's just a different level of pressure working with clubs pushing for a title winning campaign.</p>
              <p>O'neil for Rafa? I don't think so. If Alex Ferguson isn't willing/eager to find him as a replacement, then why should the bungling dynamic/disastrous duo at the Anfield's director box think any different?</p>
