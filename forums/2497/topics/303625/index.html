But what will the Newcastle dressing room make of this sensational appointment, of the decision to bring back a manager who depends on enthusiasm, passion and charisma like no other around?</strong><br><br>I don't suppose the name or reputation means all that much to the likes of Claudio Cacapa, David Rozehnal and Jose Enrique, the latest signings to haplessly try and cure United's defensive woes. These are foreign imports, after all, largely unfamiliar with Geordie folklore. Blank looks would probably meet any mention of the 4-3 classics with Liverpool or the time Keegan's swashbuckling trailblazers led the Premiership by 12 points, only to throw it away in heartbreaking style.<br><br>Why should they, anyway? None of that matters now, especially to a group of players badly in need of direction; a group, no doubt, curious to see what all the fuss is about. Some, of course, don't really need telling. Michael Owen and Nicky Butt, for instance, know all about Keegan's methods, having worked under the great tub-thumper with England.<br><br>Then there is Joey Barton, a signing that came to signify the short, ill-fated reign of Sam Allardyce better than anyone. Barton was handed his Manchester City debut by Keegan, who is set to take charge on Saturday for the visit of Bolton.<br><br>By then, those in the know will have passed on the 'info'. Team-mates in the dark will have been thoroughly briefed on what to expect. Mind you, it won't take long for them to see for themselves. Feel it as well. For when Keegan walks in for the first time and gathers his new charges around for a chat, the aura of the man can't fail to hit home.<br><br>Whether it's Cacapa and Co or the British lads, the new boss' presence will surely have an effect, as it will when it comes to the transfer market. That's going to be one major plus point, surely - the ability of Keegan to attract big-name players, particularly if the bandwagon gathers pace straight away in the form of better results and a more adventurous brand of football.<br><br>On a more cautious note, we are assuming, of course, that Keegan's hunger for the game has been totally replenished during his time away; that, at 56, this is roughly the same character who stood on those steps 13 years ago.<br><br>If not, there wouldn't be much point, would there? Few clubs, after all, would take a chance on employing the grey, jaded figure who left Manchester City nearly three years ago. At that point, the game looked to be up. Keegan's deep well of desire seemed to have run dry.<br><br>We presume, therefore, that Mike Ashley and Chris Mort, owner and chairman at Newcastle, were won over by the old magic during the interview. Nobody talks a better game. No-one can generate excitement quite like King Kev.<br><br></div>

In his autobiography Owen called his time as an England player under Keegan as a "dark phase in my career" which left him questioning his ability. </strong><br><br>But Shearer told BBC 5 Live: "I'm sure what he said in his autobiography will be brought up but they're grown adults. "They'll get over that, it won't be a problem at all I promise you."<br><br></div>
