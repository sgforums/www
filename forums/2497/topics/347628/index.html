              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SEVILLE, Spain - Goals from David Villa
              and Fernando Llorente gave Spain a 2-0 win over England in a
              friendly on Wednesday as substitute David Beckham equalled
              Bobby Moore's record of 108 caps for an England outfield
              player.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The match against the European Champions in Seville was a
              chance for England coach Fabio Capello to assess how far his
              side has advanced and the midfield did a good job of closing
              down Xavi and Andres Iniesta in the opening half hour.</p>
              <p>However, a careless pass by defender Phil Jagielka let
              Spain in to score the opener on 36 minutes.</p>
              <p>Xabi Alonso picked up the loose ball and fired it to Villa
              who jinked his way past several England defenders and sent a
              low shot past David James, the sixth match in a row the
              Valencia striker has been on target for his country.</p>
              <p>Beckham equalled the record of 1966 World Cup winning
              captain Moore when he came on at halftime at the Sanchez
              Pizjuan, one of five changes made by Fabio Capello at the
              break.</p>
              <p>The home side continued to dominate a toothless England and
              substitute Llorente doubled their lead when he outjumped the
              English defenders to nod past Robert Green with just under 10
              minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>Spain, ranked number one in the world by FIFA, are now
              unbeaten in 29 matches stretching back to a 1-0 defeat against
              Romania in Cadiz in November 2006 and Capello was full of
              praise for their performance.</p>
              <p>"This is a team that knows how to play the ball around and
              at the right moment, when you make a mistake, they kill you,"
              the former Real Madrid coach said at a news conference.</p>
              <p>"They still have the same players and are playing in the
              same style as when they won the European Championships and they
              are obviously feeling in great shape on the pitch."</p>
              <p>England were without several regulars, including injured
              midfielders Steven Gerrard and Joe Cole and Manchester United
              striker Wayne Rooney and they hardly threatened the Spain goal.</p>
              <p>A long-range effort from Shaun Wright-Phillips and a
              Carlton Cole shot cleared off the line were the only real
              chances in the second period.</p>
              <p>Gabriel Agbonlahor had a decent opening early in the first
              half but sent his volley just wide while Emile Heskey laboured
              up front to little effect before being replaced at the break by
              Peter Crouch.</p>
              <p>Spain coach Vicente del Bosque said he was happy with the
              team's long unbeaten run but his priority was the World Cup
              qualifier against Turkey on March 28 in Madrid.</p>
              <p>Spain and England both top their qualifying groups for the
              tournament in South Africa with four wins out of four and
              England's next match is against Ukraine at Wembley on April 1.</p>
              <p>"For the first few minutes we were a little bit lost but we
              gradually became better and better," Del Bosque said of his
              side's showing on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"It's not only the quality of the way we play that's the
              key but it's also the spirit in the squad."</p>

              <p>well, as we are so exposed to EPL, we do expect England to do better.</p>
              <p>given this is only a friendly, I do expect Capello to do much better in the WC.</p>
