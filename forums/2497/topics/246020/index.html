            <div class='col-md body'>the only reason why he was good is because there was consistant supply from the wings like becks and giggs. and also tt time they had keane so scholes was given the freedom to roam and play as the playmaker.<br><br>ruuud needs a team to support him. notice that 90% of his goals come from inside the box? he does not dare to shoot from distance and rather pass than to shoot when he is outside.<br><br>when becks left, so were the days of ruud scoring 30 over goals. giggs was still producing but scholes was playing more defensive cos of keane's fallout wif saf.<br><br>saha was bought cos they need a team player who can drift out to the flanks or help back in defence. but no more ruud wad! whyare you still dwelling on the past???</div>
