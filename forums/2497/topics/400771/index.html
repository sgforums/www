              <p><strong>Manchester United have reiterated that the club is not for sale after revealing increased revenues and £95million cash in the bank.</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Under-fire American owners the Glazer family have until now remained distant from talk that the </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">so-called Red Knights consortium of financiers hoped to seize the club with a £1billion bid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">However, they have now gone public to confirm that they will not entertain offers for the Barclays Premier League giants.</span></p>
              <p>The club said in a statement: 'The board notes recent press speculation regarding a possible bid for Manchester United. The owners remain fully committed to their long-term ownership of the club.</p>
              <p>'Manchester United are not for sale and the owners will not entertain any offers.'</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Chief executive David Gill had earlier gone on the offensive, telling <span style="font-style: italic;">The Independent </span>that Sir Alex Ferguson would not have his hands tied in the transfer market this summer.</span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">'The money is there,' said Gill. 'People say Alex is saying that (money is there) because he has to. Anyone who knows Alex Ferguson knows he wouldn't say that if he didn't mean what he said. </span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">'The money is definitely there. The (financial) results will show the figures are about £95m cash. </span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br></span>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>'We are not in a situation whereby Alex is restricted in what he wants to do with the club and his modus operandi as a manager.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">'We have never said: "You can't do that, we have to pay interest (on the debt)." I can look you in the eye and say that. </span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">'He (Ferguson) would say exactly the same thing. People don't believe it. We never said to him: "You can't go for that player because he's too much."'</span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Financial figures covering the last</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">quarter have now confirmed the club has a cash balance of £95.9m and net assets of £794.9m.</span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Revenues for the year rose 14 per cent from £193.3m to £219.3m.</span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Overall debt now stands at £520.9m, although that sum does not include the controversial payment-in-kind (PIK) notes for which the Glazer family are themselves responsible and now attract interest at an eye-watering 16.25 per cent.</span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Despite the debt mountain, the Glazer family have succeeded in making United a<br>far more streamlined operation, with their satellite commercial arm in London<br>netting over £200million alone.</span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">United fans have led a high-profile campaign against the owners because of their concerns about the club's debts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Supporters have made their feelings known by wearing green and gold at Old Trafford, harking back to the club's original Newton Heath colours.</span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">However, Gill rather patronisingly dismissed the protest by claiming the dissenters were in the minority and that many didn't understand want they were doing.<br></span></p>
              <p>'The green and gold campaign and the momentum behind that can get a bit tiring,' said Gill.</p>
              <p>'We understand people's desire to protest and I think it is a minority. It's a visible minority in the stadium.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'Would we prefer not to have them [green and gold scarves]? Yes. They have a right to protest. A lot of the fans clearly care about the club and that is a strength.</strong></p>
              <p>'But a lot of the other fans want to know that the team is playing attractive football, exciting Manchester United-style football, winning football. Who owns it is a bit irrelevant to them.</p>
              <p>'I think that (the green and gold) minority will go away. A lot of people understand what it means but a lot of them don't.'</p>
              <p>Regarding the financial plight of the club, Gill added: 'I firmly believe that the financing we have in place and the growth we have seen in our commercial operations, even with the (annual) interest of £45million, we can sustain that and still be a top, top club.</p>
              <p>'We can invest in the players, invest in the training ground - we have plans for that - invest in the stadium and do those things.'</p>
