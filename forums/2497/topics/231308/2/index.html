If we'd done what we usually do, we may have got something. "When we play one of the big four, a choke goes on for some of the players.<br><br>"They come up against people they are used to seeing on the television, and some of them cannot cope with it. We didn't show heart and soul or passion."<br><br><strong>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez</strong> on the criticism he received after their two cup defeats to Arsenal: "I was surprised, for sure. "Sometimes, people do not understand what you are trying to do and what we are trying to analyse.<br><br>"After the defeats, we needed to show character. I could see that the players were really focused on controlling the game and creating lots of chances."<br><br></div>

We pushed the defence up, scored a few goals, played with a good spirit and dominated the game. "After a run of three league games without a win it is nice to get one. It has been a dark period in that we haven't won, but a light one because we haven't lost despite all our problems.<br><br>"We have missed our special players recently. You saw the way Robben played today - imagine if we had been able to call upon him over Christmas, a lot of the results might have been different."<br><br><strong>Wigan boss Paul Jewell:</strong><br>"I thought at half-time that if we could just nick a goal - even though we didn't look like doing so - we might get something from the game. "But their second goal was an absolute disaster and it really broke us. In fact, the first three goals were avoidable and you can't give away soft goals at this level and get away with it.<br><br>"We have 16 matches left and, yes, it is going to be a battle to stay in this division. I think we need five or six victories and that's what we are aiming for."<br></div>

"There are 15 games to go and we are in a very good position. We played some good football and it was a period we capitalised on - sometimes you don't do that, but we managed to get a three-goal lead by half-time. "We have got Arsenal next week, and with Paul Scholes back it was a chance to give Ryan Giggs a break and give Ji-Sung Park an hour and a bit as he gets more games under his belt."<br><br><strong>Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill:</strong><br>"It is a long, long time without a win now, but I don't think I was ever fooled by our early position and I don't think anyone around the football club was. "We did fine in terms of getting points and results early on, but they have dried up so we have got to do something about it. "Manchester United are a very fine side. We have got a lot of work to do, but we have known that for a long time."<br><br></div>

"I think the sending off hurt us more than them. It allowed them to sit back and hit us on the break.   "We just did not have enough guile to draw Arsenal out. We never really got any momentum to put Arsenal under sustained pressure."<br><br><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:</strong><br>"We were under pressure and we showed we can resist that and still play good football.   "We showed solidarity, good technique and some wonderful movement.  "The sending off looked harsh, although Gilberto reacted when he shouldn't.
