              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fernando Torres</span></abbr> has signed an improved <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> contract.</p>
              <p>Torres has signed a new contract, agreed last season, which is understood to put him on £110,000 a week.</p>
              <p>Liverpool loudly trumpeted that agreement in May, and the new deal
              includes a one-year extension option that could keep Torres at Anfield
              until 2014.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old Spaniard, who is expected to recover from an
              ankle injury to play at Spurs on Sunday, is understood to have seen his
              wages rise from £70,000 a week to £110,000 under the new agreement.</p>
              <p>Under the terms of his original deal, Torres had the option of
              having his wages reviewed this summer and Liverpool have been quick to
              make sure there is no hint of a problem, aware that Manchester City,
              Manchester United and Chelsea have reportedly shown interest in the
              player.</p>
              <p>Manager Rafael Benitez said: "Fernando is one of the best strikers in the game and, at his age, can only get better.</p>
              <p>"Every major side would want him in their team, but he has shown
              how much he wants to achieve success at Liverpool by committing his
              future to the club. He's a special talent, but still has the hunger to
              improve his game."</p>

              <p><strong>Fernando Torres believes Liverpool have the talent and experience to end their long wait for a Premier League title. The Reds have been tipped to mount another strong challenge after finishing just four points behind champions Manchester United last season.</strong> </p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez's men had a good record against the other top teams in 2008/9 and Torres insists he is not worried about the clashes with United and Chelsea. </p>
              <p>He feels Liverpool can make up the difference by claiming wins rather than draws in some of the other tricky fixtures, and he is targeting a fast start at Tottenham on Sunday. </p>
              <p>"We have no problem beating Manchester United or Chelsea but it is games like Sunday's at Tottenham where we need to show our real title intentions," the Spaniard told <em>The Sun</em>. </p>
              <p>"Tottenham is not an easy place to go but these are games we must be winning if this is to finally be our year." </p>
              <p>Torres is convinced that Liverpool can win the title and admits it would be devastating for both the players and supporters to miss out again. </p>
              <p>He said: "I am not thinking can we win the title, I am thinking we have to win the title. </p>
              <p>"We came so close last season but for many of the players it was their first time experiencing the pressure of a Premier League title race. </p>

Is cuz almost every liverpool fan can feel that the title is withing their grasp...it would be a big blow if they dont win it.

              <p>I think general rule of thumb is to get at least 50% of the points against other teams in the Top 4 and have a decent 80% win rate against the other 16 teams to be able to challenge for the title. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anything less than that means you might need to depend a lot on the other teams choking or dropping points.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
