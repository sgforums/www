"We might have to change it a little bit because losing a big player like that just changes the balance of the team.<br><br>If McClaren does go with a direct replacement for Hargreaves, Phil Neville, Scott Parker and Michael Carrick appear to be the viable options.<br><br>McClaren feels in order to be successful, England must be able to adapt to different formations. "They the players have to be intelligent and be able to adapt to different roles and different responsibilities.<br><br>England face Macedonia at Old Trafford before making the trip to Zagreb to take on Slaven Bilic's Croatia in what McClaren believes will be the toughest game of the qualifying campaign.<br><br>He added: "Croatia is a big test for any team. They are a very good team technically.<br><br>"In Croatia you're also dealing with the atmosphere, the intensity of the crowd, so it will be a big test for our players."<br></div>

Gerrard would have been a better captain.<br><br>Now that he is the captain, you can't drop him... he will play every match... he makes too many mistakes. He let the shortest guy on the field, the guy he was suppose to mark score with his head! It looks just like the Liverpool goal in the Community Shield. Again he didn't know the position to cover. I always said, Gallas covered alot of his shortcomings... and now we are seeing the real terry.<br><br>Overall, it was McClaren fault. The FA should think of something fast before its too late.
