This will benefit them but not us.<br><br>Â“We won at Stamford Bridge last year on the sand but only just. It wasnÂ’t easy and it helped they were a man down.<br><br>Â“We prefer to have a good pitch and when they come to the Nou Camp we will water the surface, so we can play a fast passing game on the floor, the way we like.Â”<br><br>Barcelona legend Andoni Zubizarreta insists Chelsea have a responsibility to provide a perfect pitch for such a big game Â— so the teams do not end up playing beach football.<br><br>The former keeper added: Â“I donÂ’t know what to say about this. I donÂ’t know if itÂ’s a question of problems with their pitch, if itÂ’s been done for maintenance.<br><br>Â“But the biggest games, like this one will be in the Champions League, should be played in the best possible conditions that you can achieve with the pitch.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s important to have a good pitch so both teams can play. But you have to make sure you perform no matter what the conditions are.Â”<br><br>Anna Revilla, of BarcelonaÂ’s hardcore London-based supporters group Â‘Pena BlaugranaÂ’, blasted: Â“I canÂ’t believe theyÂ’ve put sand all over the pitch again!<br><br>Â“They did it last year and, even though it was raining before the game, they watered the pitch. It was really bad last year.<br><br>Â“Of course Mourinho is doing this to get at Barcelona. The Barcelona players pass the ball on the floor and if the pitch isnÂ’t smooth itÂ’s not good for us. All the Barca fans will be angry about this. Last year everyone was asking how the Chelsea pitch can be so bad when they have Abramovich and all his millions?<br><br>Â“Now they have put sand on the pitch again this year just when we are coming to play them again Â— thatÂ’s really bad!Â”<br><br>But a Chelsea spokesman last night insisted the sanding of the pitch was merely routine.<br><br>He said: Â“An 18-day break between home fixtures has allowed our groundstaff to carry out routine maintenance work on the pitch.<br><br>Â“The drainage system is being improved to ensure the pitch stays in top condition.<br><br>Â“The international break allows us to carry out this work towards our aim of maintaining our playing surface as one of the best in the league.<br><br>Â“Recent years have seen much investment going into it.Â”<br><br></div>

Drogba, shev, terry all consider good with high ball situation whereas ronaldinho, messi, deco, saviola... all these are rather short and small guys who play better on the ground but would not trouble chelsea in the air...<br><br>So the ground is one of the most important thing... it could play an important part to who wins the match or lose...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Drogba, shev, terry all consider good with high ball situation whereas ronaldinho, messi, deco, saviola... all these are rather short and small guys who play better on the ground but would not trouble chelsea in the air...<br><br>So the ground is one of the most important thing... it could play an important part to who wins the match or lose...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote><span style="color: blue;">O.I.C</span></div>
