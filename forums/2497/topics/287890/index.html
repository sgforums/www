            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/10_03/Jol21310DML_468x544.jpg"><br><br><strong>Tottenham hope to unveil Juande Ramos as their new manager next week after finally sacking Martin Jol amid astonishing scenes at White Hart Lane last night. Amazingly, Jol was called to a meeting with chairman Daniel Levy and his fellow directors before the UEFA Cup tie with Getafe and told that it would be his last match.</strong><br><br>A club statement, released only after the 2-1 defeat, said Jol had resigned but Sportsmail understands that he was forced to stand down in order to get the compensation package he was demanding. Tottenham's players knew nothing of developments until Jol told them in the dressing room after the match, even though news had spread by then to supporters who chanted the popular Dutchman's name during the game. At the same time, Levy was captured on television laughing in the directors' box at the remark of a colleague who had just whispered in his ear.<br><br>On the eve of the match Jol said he had no intention of walking away from White Hart Lane but yesterday afternoon he was informed that his employers had Ramos Â— with former Spurs midfielder Gus Poyet as his assistant Â— lined up to replace him. Jol's future had been in serious doubt since Tottenham chiefs were caught meeting Ramos in Spain earlier this season Â— which former boss David Pleat described as "a tragic day" for Spurs Â— but when an agreement with the Sevilla coach was not then reached, Jol was effectively given a stay of execution.<br><br>Tottenham now believe they have the Spaniard, who is expected to take charge next week, with Poyet among his assistants. Sources at Leeds United said they knew nothing of Poyet's involvement but Elland Road's Uruguayan assistant manager was at Spurs' game at Newcastle on Monday with manager Dennis Wise.<br><br>Ramos' assistant at Sevilla, Ramon Rodriguez Monchi, was at White Hart Lane last night but the fact that neither he nor Ramos speak good English has persuaded them to add the Spanish-speaking Poyet to the staff as well. There were suggestions last night that Tottenham may have to wait until the end of the season to get Ramos but insiders believe they can bring him in immediately.<br><br>Clive Allen, the club's reserve team boss, will be asked to take charge for this weekend's home game with Blackburn. While Jol has guided Tottenham to fifth in the Premier League for the last two years, a breakdown in his relationship with Levy and the chairman's colleagues on the board has led to his departure.<br><br></div>

I personally supported the signing and continue to do so, has not been given the chance to prove his worth yet though<br>Danny Rose - Another for the future<br>Kevin Prince-Boateng - Has only made one appearance thus far, but another who comes with great promise<br>Younes Kaboul - Clearly a talented footballer with the ball at his feet, he needs to become more familiar with the intricacies of his position.</div>
