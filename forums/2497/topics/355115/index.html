              <p class="author">By Soccernet staff</p>
              <p class="author"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/PH2/fergusonbenitez275e.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="200"></p>

              <p class="photoCredit"><em>Benitez has picked a fight with the United boss again.</em></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez has accused Sir Alex Ferguson of being scared of his Liverpool side and talking ''too much'' about other teams. The Anfield chief, despite having the Champions League showdown with Chelsea as his immediate objective, could not resist another swipe at the Manchester United chief as the Premier League race reaches boiling point.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez was responding to claims from Ferguson that the loser of the Liverpool-Chelsea quarter-final will then be United's biggest challenger for the title because they will only have one competition to contend with.</p>
              <p>But the fierce battle with United for the domestic title is clearly Benitez's driving inspiration and he has now added to his previous rant against the current Champions, which momentarily derailed their title push before the draw with Stoke in January.</p>
              <p>He said of Ferguson's claims: ''It is not mind games, I think it maybe is that he is a little bit scared (of us).'' Liverpool took over at the top of the table on Saturday evening with a late winner by Benayoun at Fulham. But less than 24 hours later, United produced a stunning comeback victory over Aston Villa with the decisive goal coming in the fourth minute of injury-time from 17-year-old <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=123651"><span style="color: #000000;">Federico Macheda</span></a>.</p>
              <p>That grabbed the initiative back for the Old Trafford club, but Benitez has come out fighting. He said: ''I do not have a problem with United. Clearly one of us, either Chelsea or us, will end up focusing just on the Premier League after this.</p>
              <p>''I think Sir Alex will be supporting Liverpool in this tie because he knows we are the bigger threat now. ''If we continue in the Champions League maybe he will think we are tired. If we are not in this competition then he knows that we will be a (bigger) threat in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>''If Chelsea are not in the competition, then he knows they will then be a threat also in the league. But he will lose anyway, whoever goes out, because they will still be a big threat to United.</p>
              <p>''You have to prepare well for every single Premier League game, it is tough (to be in the Champions League as well). So he will clearly be supporting us tomorrow and next week.</p>
              <p>''I would like to be worried about both competitions, it means we will continue to be successful. ''We just concentrate on our team, while he likes to talk too much about other teams.''</p>
              <p>Benitez claims he was unmoved by United's late heroics against Villa, saying: ''We knew there would be situations like this, with us one point ahead, or one point behind. And everyone knows five minutes (of injury time) at Old Trafford is a very long time.</p>
              <p>''I watched the game, but once United scored their second you felt they would win the game. ''He (Ferguson) is in the driving seat now and in a better position, but there is still a long way to go and we have confidence. We are pushing them and we will push them until the end.''</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Fergie:  "it was interesting </em><em>Rafa Benitez got a European tie and he’s talking about Alex Ferguson. Fantastic! I didn’t know I was that important.’</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson yesterday taunted Rafael Benitez over Liverpool’s dramatic Champions League collapse and claimed Chelsea are now the main threat to Manchester United’s Barclays Premier League title hopes.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez re-ignited his long-running war of words with Ferguson on the eve of Liverpool’s European clash Chelsea in midweek, claiming the United manager’s habit of talking about Liverpool showed he was ‘scared’ of his arch-rivals.</p>
              <p>But after seeing Chelsea romp to an emphatic 3-1 win at Anfield, Ferguson wasted no time in mocking Benitez in a manner which suggested he had succeeded in distracting the Spaniard.</p>
              <p>Ferguson suggested Benitez was guilty of taking his eye off the ball ahead of Liverpool’s Champions League defeat to Chelsea in midweek by talking about him rather than the task in hand.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘The interesting thing as far as Rafa Benitez is concerned is that he’s got a European tie and he’s talking about Alex Ferguson. Fantastic! I didn’t know I was that important.’</p>
              <p>Asked if he had got under the skin of the Liverpool boss, Ferguson folded his arms and sat back with a satisfied grin.</p>
              <p>‘I have no more comment to make!’ he added, with the mischief of a man who knew he had already said more than enough.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">And, just for good measure, he suggested that relegation-haunted Blackburn – managed by his close pal Sam Allardyce – could pull off a shock result at Anfield today.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Mocked: Benitez</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em></em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>‘If you ask me a question about other teams I’ll give you an opinion. There’s no fault in that. ‘Arsene Wenger was talking about Manchester United a couple of weeks ago, which I tried to dampen down as much as I could because I know the dangers of that. But he was asked a question and he gave a fair answer.’</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson believes the nature of Chelsea’s win over Liverpool will now give them the impetus to press United until the end of the season — a point endorsed by Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger yesterday.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex even compared the impact of the victory to Ryan Giggs’s Cup semi-final winner against Arsenal which propelled United to the Treble a decade ago.‘Chelsea will be absolutely buoyed up,’ said Ferguson. ‘You saw the celebrations at the end. They knew it was an emphatic result. They’ll be flying at the moment.</p>
              <p>‘It does that to you when you get a very important result. I remember when we won the Treble in ’99. You can never forget Giggs’s goal at Villa Park. That lifted everyone. From then on we were unbeatable. Hopefully Chelsea are beatable.’</p>
              <p>United go to Sunderland today with a one-point lead over Liverpool — at home to Blackburn at lunchtime — and a four-point advantage over Chelsea, who entertain Bolton.</p>
              <p>United also have a game in hand but Ferguson is refusing to rely on that and insists he is prepared for the title race to go to the wire. With Rio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans set to miss the trip to the Stadium of Light, Ferguson knows United’s defence will come under scrutiny after conceding 10 goals in four games.</p>
              <p>The problems at the back which were first ruthlessly exposed by Liverpool were still evident in the draw with Porto on Tuesday, and the United boss admitted struggling Sunderland will take hope from that.</p>
