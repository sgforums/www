            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Jose Mourinho has urged those above him at Chelsea to come out and end the speculation about his future.</strong><br><br>Mourinho is contracted to the club until 2010 and maintains that he wants to stay at Stamford Bridge beyond the end of the season.<br><br>Yet speculation persists that a new manager may be appointed in the summer, due to an alleged rift between Mourinho and billionaire owner Roman Abramovich.<br><br>Mourinho admits the Chelsea board have not told him if he will still be in charge next season, and believes the only way for the pressure to be taken off him is for someone to speak out.<br><br>"If I could choose I wouldn't speak. If people higher in the club speak, I don't speak so much. So please speak and give me some free time," he said.<br><br>"Managers and players have the contractual obligation to come and talk and the other people, they can make a choice.<br><br>"I think the same way I take pressure off of my players by speaking more than them, if the people on the top of me could speak and leave me free of this pressure in my life it would be better for me.<br><br>"Supporters? They know. From me they know everything. Imagine if in the end of the season I say to the club 'goodbye, I go', what do the people think about me? This guy is a liar.<br><br>"So no doubts. I've left everything very, very clear. That is what is in my head. If in the end of the season I'm leaving the club you have the right to come to me and say 'Jose, you are a liar'.<br><br>Although Mourinho is keen to stay at Chelsea, he admits there are elements of managing in England that he finds difficult.<br><br>"I don't like the fact that I lost my private life and my family is paying for that and it affect me, and affects my wife and my kids and it affects everybody," he explained.<br><br>"But that's not just me, that's every manager and every player that works at a high level. Our face is in the media every day and that affects all of us." </span></div>
