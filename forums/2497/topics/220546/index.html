            <div class='col-md body'>Returning Neville hands Man Utd fitness boost<br><br>Gary Neville is set to provide Manchester United with a major injury boost ahead of this weekend's trip to Sheffield United.<br><br>After his captain aggravated a calf injury in last week's win at Blackburn, Sir Alex Ferguson immediately withdrew him from the England squad for yesterday's friendly with Holland and claimed he would not be risked for another fortnight.<br><br>However, Neville has now admitted the problem is not quite as extensive as originally feared and he could yet play some part at Bramall Lane as United look for a win to consolidate their position at the Premiership summit.<br><br>'I feel okay,' he told MUTV. 'The injury is not as bad as I first thought.<br><br>'We will see how it goes in training but hopefully I will be in contention for this weekend.'<br><br>Neville has struggled for a consistent runs of games this season and after missing seven of United's 17 games so far this term, will be anxious not to avoid any more.<br><br>Ferguson may have other ideas though, particularly as the Red Devils are facing up to a huge week, which also includes a mouthwatering Champions League trip to Celtic before Chelsea arrive for a Premiership blockbuster on November 26.<br><br>Having won their last six league games, United are certainly entering the most congested period of the season so far in fine form, although Neville understands the need to maintain the momentum.<br><br>'Our form is going well,' he said.<br><br>'We are happy with the way we have been playing. The way we have been passing the ball and moving it around, it is difficult for any team to live with us.<br><br>'But we have to maintain that high level of performance because we are about to embark on our biggest period of the season.<br><br>'We have about 16 matches in the next two months. In the next four weeks alone we play Chelsea, Everton, Middlesbrough and Manchester City, games that are always difficult for us.<br><br>'Up to now, we have done everything that has been asked of us. We want to keep it going.'<br><br>Although United will be overwhelming favourites to emerge victorious from their first Steel City visit in 11 years, Ferguson and his team need no reminding they have not always had it their own way on previous visits to Bramall Lane.<br><br>United's first match of the Premiership era ended in defeat there, while even Sir Matt Busby's title winners were beaten by the Blades 40 years ago.<br><br>And, as the Red Devils have already failed to beat one promoted club this season in Reading, there are enough reasons for Neville to be wary.<br><br>'It will be a battle,' he said.<br><br>'We already know, after playing Reading last season and Wigan this season, that teams who have come up have proved to be difficult opposition.<br><br>'Most teams want to get promoted because they want to play big clubs like Manchester United.<br><br>'Sheffield United are a big club with a big following and they will want to make it difficult for us.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ferguson hints at rest for Neville<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has hinted that Gary Neville, a doubt for this weekends match against Sheffield United, may be rested against Celtic next week as he tries to overcome a calf injury.<br><br>"We tried to get to the root of his injury," Ferguson said on Friday.<br><br>"We tried to rest him in some games in order to give him the proper training. Gary was playing one game, missing training during the week, then playing and missing training again to get treatment, which is no good. It catches up with you if you dont train. We eventually tried to get the fluid cleared up in his calf muscles, to give him proper training, so it didnt reoccur."<br><br>Neville then suffered a further setback, however. "The same thing then happened in his other calf," Ferguson said. "Hes unfortunate, thats all. We may have to look at it for the Celtic match on Tuesday."<br><br>United face the Scottish champions in Glasgow in the UEFA Champions League after Saturdays clash at Bramall lane.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MIDDLESBROUGH v LIVERPOOL: TEAM NEWS<br><br>The 31-year-old has enjoyed many central midfield battles with a player he believes is one of the best in the business.<br><br>But as the debate over Rafael BenitezÂ’s decision to play the England international out wide continues, the Dutchman has no doubts where he is most effective.<br><br>Boateng said: Â“Steven Gerrard, for me, is the best English midfield player in the country. He is the new Paul Scholes.<br><br>Â“He is a very, very talented, gifted player and I always enjoy playing against him.<br><br>Â“But I would rather have him out on the right. In a way, it is a compliment because if you are that good and can play in both positions, it is very, very good.<br><br>Â“But if you asked me where he is less effective, I would say stick him out wide. It makes our job a lot easier.<br><br>Â“But at the same time, he is still a quality player whether he plays from the right or not, and Benitez will be looking for a game where he will play from the right and score goals and say, 'I told you soÂ’.<br><br>Â“But I hope on Saturday, he plays out wide.Â”<br><br>MIDDLESBROUGH v LIVERPOOL: CLASSICS<br><br>Meanwhile, Benitez has moved to set the record straight after Gerrard was reported as saying that he had spoken to the Anfield manager about his unhappiness playing on the right.<br><br>Benitez said: Â“He did not speak to me about this, I spoke to him. I spoke to him before the Arsenal game because I wanted to explain that he will play more games in the centre, but against Arsenal he would play on the right side.<br><br>Â“And yes, it is a possibility that he will play in the centre against Middlesbrough now we have Momo Sissoko out injured for three months.<br><br>Â“I do not think the others are better than Steven there, but remember, I always say we must find the balance for the team.Â”<br><br>ARSENAL 3-0 LIVERPOOL<br><br>He added: Â“Steven is a great player from any position. He plays on the right and plays well, he will score.<br><br>Â“If he plays on the left and plays well, he will score and if he plays in the middle or as a support striker and plays well, he will score.<br><br>Â“It does not matter where you decide to play him, if he is on form he will score from anywhere.<br><br>Â“We have used Bolo Zenden in the middle and I have been really happy with him playing alongside Xabi (Alonso).

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ferguson praise for Rooney</strong><br><br>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hailed Wayne Rooneys decisive double strike after he secured a comeback victory at Sheffield United.<br><br>Rooney struck in the 30th and 75th minutes to keep his side top of the Barclays Premiership after former Old Trafford winger Keith Gillespie had scored his first goal for the Blades to hand them an early lead.<br><br>The brace takes Rooneys tally to seven for United this season, and eight overall, after scoring for England in their 1-1 draw in Holland on Wednesday.<br><br>Rooneys opener came after he sneaked between covering defenders Claude Davis and Captain Phil Jagielka to latch on to a cross from right-back Gary Neville.<br><br>Rooney controlled the ball with his left foot before despatching an angled right-foot shot past goalkeeper Paddy Kenny.<br><br>The winner, 15 minutes from time, saw Rooney flash a right-foot volley beyond Kenny following a cross from left-back Patrice Evra.<br><br>Ferguson said: "They were two marvellous finishes. The first came from a run across the defender. He has caught him on the hop, off-guard, and it was a great strike. The second was terrific. Taking that kind of finish, when you are under pressure and you need to win, it makes it more special."<br><br>The victory sets United up for their top-of-the-table clash with reigning champions Chelsea next week, when Ferguson hopes to avoid controversy.<br><br>"It promises to be a fantastic game, one that everybody is looking forward to and the whole world will be watching," he said.<br><br>"But I saw the controversy coming from down there (Stamford Bridge) about the referee. I hope the game is not decided by a referees decision because it could be a fantastic game. Lets hope thats the case."<br><br>Ferguson praised the all-round application of his side in particular as Neil Warnocks men defended resolutely throughout the game.<br><br>"They proved it was going to be difficult, but the important thing is we kept our patience, kept probing, and we made some good chances," remarked Ferguson.<br><br>"To be honest with you, I was hoping we would get a goal before half time because if we had gone in 1-0 down then it would have been a long road back. It would have made it more difficult for us because they would have been more entrenched, but the goal gave us that bit of patience to wait and wait. By doing that there was always the possibility that we would create the chance that mattered."<br><br>Fortunately for Ferguson, Cristiano Ronaldos glaring miss just before full-time did not prove costly, with the Portugal international ballooning over the bar from just four yards after Ryan Giggs cross.<br><br>Ferguson was able to see the funny side as he said: "He will not miss that again. It was an unusual miss. I think the ball bounced up a bit, but at the end of the day we can put it behind us."<br><br>With Newcastle drawing at Arsenal, Sheffield United have now slipped back into the bottom three, but for Warnock the more important battles lie ahead.<br><br>Appreciating anything gained from this would have been a bonus, Warnock said: "Our season starts now. When I saw the fixtures at the start of the season, I thought the games after this one would be crucial to us. I thought we might have been a few more points adrift, but we are not. We are in the mix and we can start scrapping for points from now on."<br><br>Warnock felt his side produced a solid display, adding: "I couldnt have got any more from them than I did today. There are a lot of positives and we want more of this. We want to be playing United every year."</div>
