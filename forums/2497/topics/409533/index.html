              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Harry Redknapp has launched a last-gasp attempt to sign Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano.</strong></p>
              <p>Fabiano has been Tottenham’s top target throughout the transfer window and Redknapp has made another move for the Brazilian forward.</p>
              <p>World Cup star Fabiano was left on the bench for Sevilla’s 4-1 win at Levante on Saturday night for fear of him being injured while negotiations with Spurs are still ongoing.</p>
              <p>Redknapp is determined to shake up his strike-force and ex-Manchester United striker Giuseppe Rossi – now at Villarreal – and a loan move for AC Milan’s Klaas-Jan Huntelaar are still possibilities.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>But Fabiano, 29, is the man Spurs believe would add a touch of world-class talent to their forward line as they look to compete in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Sevilla are ready to sell after crashing out of the Champions League qualifiers but have put a £25million price tag on Fabiano.</p>
              <p>Redknapp wants to go to £15m and is looking to help balance the books by offloading Robbie Keane.</p>
              <p>West Ham, Aston Villa and Newcastle have been sounded out about Keane.</p>

              <p>The Ghanaian midfielder has fallen down the pecking order at Inter Milan since the arrival of Rafa Benitez and the club have welcomed any interest in him.</p>
              <p>Muntari excelled at Portsmouth during the 2007/08 season, his only year in England, and was taken to the San Siro by Jose Mourinho in a deal worth £12.7million.</p>
              <p>Inter know they are unlikely to recoup anywhere near that initial fee as they understand the 26-year-old's status as a fringe player may drive the price down. They would likely accept a bid of around a third of that.</p>
              <p>Tottenham have no shortage of bodies in midfield capable of putting in the leg work, and in Tom Huddlestone have one of the Premier League's fastest maturing talents.</p>
              <p>However, Muntari's energy, attacking prowess and experience would add a new dimension to the the club as they embark on a first journey through the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Another Tottenham target, Sevilla's Luis Fabiano appears to be out of reach both in desire and financially, but Scott Parker and Ashley Young are still being targeted as Tottenham spend their Champions League cash windfall.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">West Ham</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> have joined the race to sign out-of-favour </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Tottenham </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">striker Robbie Keane.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Fitness concerns over leading man Carlton Cole as well as Benni McCarthy and new boy Frederic Piquionne, have forced Hammers boss Avram Grant into a desperate search around the transfer market for a striker.</p>
              <p>West Ham are pointless in the Premier League and have found the net only twice all season, with one of those coming from the penalty spot.</p>
              <p>And after missing out on the likes of Thierry Henry, Yakubu, Loic Remy and Roque Santa Cruz, Grant's search has bought him back to London, and to the unsettled Keane.</p>

              <p><strong>But he admits financial constraints may prevent him beating the likes of Aston Villa and Newcastle to the Irishman's signature.</strong></p>
              <p>'The club has big, big debts but he’s a player I would like to get,' said the Israeli coach.</p>
              <p>Any deal for Keane depends on Tottenham's own recruitment plans. The London club want to bring another body in up front before they let Keane go.</p>
              <p>'I wouldn't accept an offer for Robbie Keane before the window shuts, not at the moment,' he said. 'We haven’t got anybody else. I couldn’t afford to let him go.'</p>
              <p>Keane has made just two substitute appearances for Spurs this season, continuing his indifferent form. The Irishmen appeared rejuvenated by a loan spell at Celtic in the second half of the campaign and Neil Lennon is another keen to rekindle the relationship.</p>

              <p class="KonaBody">Spurs have turned to the Liverpool forward after their attempts to capture Luis Fabiano, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Emmanuel Adebayor and Guiseppe Rossi all hit dead ends.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">The north London club have made an initial enquiry about taking Babel on a season-long loan, but it is understood that Liverpool would only consider letting the Dutch forward go on a permanent transfer.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">The Merseysiders are keen to recoup the £11.5 million fee they paid for Babel, 23, when he moved from Ajax three years ago.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">White Hart Lane manager Harry Redknapp has become increasingly frustrated in his attempts to capture the big-name striker that he believes is essential to make Tottenham an established Champions League club.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">Chairman Daniel Levy has money to spend after Spurs qualified for the Champions League group stages, but Fabiano signed a new two-year Sevilla deal yesterday and Huntelaar is close to clinching a £10.5m move from AC Milan to Schalke.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">Levy could not agree a fee with Villarreal for £8m-rated Rossi and enquired about taking Adebayor on a season-long loan yesterday but Manchester City do not want to offload players to rivals.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">City confirmed this morning that Adebayor will not be leaving Eastlands during the current transfer window.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">Babel has emerged as Spurs’ latest target because they feel he has more to offer than Robbie Keane, who the Londoners want to offload in the final hours of the window when a deal is done.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">West Ham, Aston Villa and Sunderland are all potential suitors for the Irishman but the Hammers are viewed as the favourites to land his signature.</p>
