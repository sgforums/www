              <h1>Debate: have Chelsea been unfairly treated by Fifa with transfer ban?</h1>
              <h2>Chelsea have said they will launch the "strongest appeal possible" after being slapped with a transfer window ban by Fifa, but do you think the punishment was justified or have the Premier League club been harshly treated?</h2>

              <div class="imageExtras" style="width: 460px;"><span class="caption">Punished: Gael Kakuta has been hit with a four-month playing ban</span></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Yes, it is unfair - John Ley</strong></p>
              <p>Ok, so Fifa have to start somewhere. But why take until now to punish a club so severely for “tapping” up a young player?</p>
              <p>And how can they justify either the severity of the punishment and, more shockingly, the ban imposed on a youngster who was, at the time of the alleged approach, just 15?</p>
              <p>And isn’t it just a tad cynical of football’s governing body to hit Chelsea with the ban just two days after the window had closed.</p>
              <p>Clearly Chelsea knew nothing of this imposing punishment beforehand - surprising in a world when secrets are few - otherwise they would not have allowed Andrei Shevchenko to leave, or even let Shane Cummings sign for Reading on a permanent basis.</p>
              <p>As Chelsea are about to discover now, every injury, every suspension, indeed every player, counts.</p>
              <p>What I find most draconian about this is the four-month ban imposed on the person in question, Gael Kakuta.</p>
              <p>He was two months short of his 16th birthday when he left Lens. Surely he had advisors; surely he had people who told him he was doing no wrong. Or was the blue carrot Chelsea dangled just too great an incentive?</p>
              <p>It appears that Chelsea broke the rules, and they do have a history in that department. But what happens every summer?</p>
              <p>Is it me or is an Arsenal player linked with moves to Spain every closed season?</p>
              <p>And remember Sir Alex Ferguson’s response mid-season when asked if it was true Cristiano Ronaldo was heading for Madrid.</p>
              <p>“I wouldn’t sell them a virus”, said Ferguson famously. But look what happened.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo and Kakuta do not roll off the tongue together but the principle is the same.</p>
              <p>And what about the hundreds of African and South American kids lured away from a lifetime of poverty by the rich of Europe. You are not telling me every transfer of every promising starlet is all above board.</p>
              <p>Chelsea may have to accept that dealing in the January window will be closed to them. But any appeal has to win and allow them back to business for the 2010 summer window.</p>
              <p>Otherwise Fifa will stand accused of a witch-hunt, and turning Kakuta into a household name. After all, who had heard of Jean-Marc Bosman before the famous Bosman ruling?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No, the ban is necessary - Rory Smith</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea fans may cry conspiracy, anti-English or anti-oligarch, or the more enlightened among them may claim they are little more than Fifa’s fall-guy, punished as an example to others over the Gaël Kakuta affair.</p>
              <p>They may be right on the first count, and they certainly are on the second. That, though, is the point.</p>
              <p>Frank Arnesen, Peter Kenyon et al are not the first officials, assuming the Fifa ban on acquiring players until 2011 stands (which it will not), to “induce” a young player to leave the club which nurtured him before he has signed professional terms to join a larger outfit who can pay him more money.</p>
              <p>They have every right to wonder, in fact, why none of their 'Big Four' brethren have been cited for such offences, so strikingly similar to that of Lens are some of the complaints which have emanated from Italy, Germany and Spain about the conduct of Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United.</p>
              <p>But Fifa have to start somewhere. They are the game’s governing body and, as such, they have a duty to protect the poor as well as the rich.</p>
              <p>For too long have all of the game’s big sides - and not just the British ones, either - trampled over their smaller cousins to procure the best talent. It has to be stamped out, worldwide, for the good of the game. That is a phrase Fifa should recognise.</p>
              <p>There is no question that the penalty is harsh. Precedent suggests it will be halved - as was Roma’s, for a similar offence, over the signing of Philippe Mexes - but there was little else Fifa could do.</p>
              <p>Financial penalties, however apparently severe, have little impact on the extravagantly wealthy clubs which inhabit football’s top tier and Fifa have no jurisdiction over the competitions in which Chelsea compete, all of which are run by the FA, the Premier League or Uefa.</p>
              <p>Only by linking punishment to crime - if you will not abide by the rules of the transfer market, we will deny you access to the transfer market - could Fifa have the impact they need, to make clubs sit up and take notice.</p>
              <p>It will be of little solace to Chelsea, but, by being caught and punished, they will have helped stop the pillage of academies worldwide which was simply perpetuating the primacy of the powerful, and for that we will all be grateful in the long run.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> are facing a new threat over their signing of another French youngster.</p>
              <p>The <em>Guardian</em> says <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> face a second legal threat over allegations of poaching young players,
              this time concerning the move of an 11-year-old to Stamford Bridge.
              ASPTT Marseille, the French club who saw Jérémy Boga switch to west
              London last October, are consulting lawyers over whether to make a
              fresh complaint to Fifa.</p>
              <p>Following Fifa's imposition of a transfer ban until January 2011 over <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>'s
              illegal recruitment of the teenage forward Gaël Kakuta from Lens, ASPTT
              Marseille will take legal advice on Tuesday to discuss the case of
              Boga, who had spent five years with the amateur team.</p>

              <p>The French Football Federation have welcomed FIFA's decision to ban <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> from signing players until January 2011.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> were rocked this week by a FIFA ban on signing any players during the
              next two transfer windows after luring teenager Gael Kakuta from Lens,

              <p>French Football Federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes, meanwhile, is pleased with the decision to punish <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>He said: "We had alerted FIFA and the Football Association against such misbehaviour.</p>
              <p>"What these clubs are doing is like what I have seen from Qatar
              in other sports, who sent their sporting directors to Paris to recruit
              and nationalise young athletes.</p>
              <p>"We are perfectly happy to see such misbehaviour being sanctioned.''</p>

              <p>If the parents and the youth in question see it as a glorious opportunity to develop their talent then so be it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their own government cannot force them to stay in their own country and not leave. So why the hell is FIFA trying to babysit these talented youths?</p>
              <p>Unless they are afraid that the french league will be weakened. Which seems like the case. Bullshit imo.</p>
