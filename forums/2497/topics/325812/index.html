              <h1>Schuster: I Am The Last To Know Anything</h1>
              <h2>Bernd Schuster has caused another stir at Real Madrid by telling the press that he is the last to know about how the club's transfer dealings are going this summer.</h2>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The disgruntled German trainer took a swipe at club president Ramón Calderón and sporting director Predrag Mijatovic, having already revealed the lack of communication on previous occasions.</strong><br><br>With the chase for Cristiano Ronaldo looking less likely to produce an outcome that Madrid want, Schuster admitted that he was not kept in the loop about the progress or lack of it. "I am the last to find out anything," he told reporters at the club's Austrian training camp in Irdning.<br><br>"At last I am content because the president has arrived and intends to speak to me and clear things up. We came up with some ideas some time ago that were quite clear. "I do not now if they have changed, but it would be good to find out. I am not that bothered as I am used to be being more or less the last to find things out.<br><br>"Everyone else seems to know things before me. It is not great and nor is not being given any answers. I would like to know more."<br><br>The outburst could see Schuster reprimanded again by Calderón after being reminded on several occasions this season to be more careful about his comments when speaking to the press.<br><br>With Madird focussing on making Ronaldo their only signing for so long, the coach has become unhappy because he was hoping to add a number of new faces to strengthen his squad.</p>

              <h1>Calderón Laughs Off Schuster Outburst</h1>
              <h2>Ramón Calderón believes that Bernd Schuster was either joking or misinterpreted when stating that he was the last to know anything at Real Madrid and confirmed that there would be one or two new signings this summer.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/13265_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Los Merengues' president may not have appeased the German trainer with his words, but he clearly believes that no problem exists within the club. Schuster complained about not being kept informed and hit out at sporting director Predrag Mijatovic for not listening to his requests on new players, but Calderón was taking the outburst seriously.</strong><br><br>"I have not heard what he said, but our relationship is magnificent and I know what he thinks," he said. "I am sure he said thing with a sense of humour and it was taken in the wrong way," he told Marca. <br><br>"He is happy here and has a good relationship with everyone. Real Madrid is a family and I think that he will have said some of those things in an ironic manner. "The coach knows that he is the first one to be told things. I have complete faith in him and there is no problem at all. "I am going to have dinner with the players and everyone is happy and there is a marvellous atmosphere here."<br><br>The Cristiano Ronaldo saga may not end in Madrid's favour and Schuster made it clear that he wants other players to be signed to bolster his squad and Calderón has said that a maximum of two will arrive.<br><br>"The squad is almost complete. Maybe one or two more will come, but two at the most. We do not need any more as we have signed 19 players in two years and this season Rubén De la Red and Javi García came back," he continued. "We have a squad of 25 exceptional players."</p>

              <h1>Schuster Wants A Striker - Report</h1>
              <h2><em>El Mundo Deportivo</em> claims that, despite Bernd Schuster's public statements of admiration for Cristiano Ronaldo and Rafael van der Vaart, what he really now wants is another striker to join the squad...</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/32080_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="250"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Beyond Ruud van Nistelrooy the natural striking options at Madrid are thin. Raúl tends to play behind the 'number 9', while Javier Saviola is apparently still unable to capture his boss' attention.</strong><br><br>Thus coach Bernd Schuster, who is allegedly growing very much tired of the Cristiano Ronaldo soap opera, is seeking to reinforce his side not with a winger but rather a forward<br><br>With Ruud set to play less and less of a role in upcoming seasons due to his advanced age, the search is on for a young gun. Two names thus spring to mind: Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Karim Benzema.<br><br>Benzema would be the harder of the two to land, given that he, his agent and his club president have repeatedly stated that not until next summer at the earlier will he leave Lyon.<br><br>Ajax man Huntelaar, meanwhile, has been linked with moves all across the continent and seems somewhat likely to secure one.<br><br>€20-25m could be enough for Madrid to coax him to the Spanish capital, but Bernabé president Ramon Calderón is apparently saving his pennies for a €90m Cristiano Ronaldo bid.<br><br>It is this Ronaldo infatuation that seems to have put paid to David Villa's chance of being the next Madrid striker. MD also proposes that this is because it was Vila that kept Raúl out of the Spain Euro 2008 squad, which could generate bad blood.</p>
