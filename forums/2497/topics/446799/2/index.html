              <p>Yes, he did call Evra that but this doesn't constitute the fact that he is a racist...This word is often used in South America where he comes from as well as Portugal and it means friend and it is used in a friendly way. Yes, it isn't acceptable in England or other parts of the world and the remarks that he made is of racist nature but we can't deem him as a racist because this may not be his intent especially when he only settled down in England for 8 months. I find it strange that someone like him whose grandparents are blacks would be a racist.</p>
              <p>He has learnt through the hard way so no point continue to harp on this.</p>

              <p>He made a racist remark. He was found guilty by an independent commission lead by a QC. Whether he is a racist or not, we all probably don't know. But the fact is he made the remark, was found guilty and punish for it. So if anyone wants to call him a racist, it's their wish or opinion isn't it? A racist also have to start somewhere right? There always has to be a beginning, a starting point... Perhaps starting with words, then ideology then finally actions right? You can't go anywhere and vouch for it and say for sure he isn't too correct?</p>
              <p>The excuse of where he came from is very lame as everyone knows he has live in Europe for a good number of years already not to mention more than 8 months in England alone.</p>
              <p>For your info, the n word which he used can also constitute as an offensive meaning back in his homeland if you did read the report. It's not only all friendly or brotherly. It also depends on how it's used and to who as well.</p>
              <p>But I find the lie he made in his statement just show the characteristic of the man and he will twist and turn in every situation just to serve his own cause.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LUIS SUAREZ is heading for the Anfield exit door after Liverpool officially branded him a liar. </h2>
              <p>Not even a belated apology is likely to save him. </p>
              <p>Suarez was labelled a "disgrace" by Alex Ferguson for refusing to shake Patrice Evra's hand before Saturday's clash at Old Trafford. </p>
              <p>And yesterday Kop MD Ian Ayre said: "He told us beforehand he would. He was wrong to mislead us and wrong not to offer his hand to Evra." </p>
              <p>The Uruguayan striker had told Anfield bosses earlier in the week he had no problem with the pre-match ritual. </p>
              <p>Ayre said: "We are extremely disappointed with Luis Suarez. </p>
              <p>"He has not only let himself down but also Kenny Dalglish, his team-mates and the club. It has been made absolutely clear to Suarez that his behaviour was not acceptable. </p>
              <p>"He has now apologised. However, all of us have a duty to behave in a responsible manner. </p>
              <p>"We hope that he now understands what is expected of anyone representing Liverpool Football Club." </p>
              <p>Kop manager Dalglish also apologised for his own behaviour in a stormy post-match interview, in which he claimed he had no idea Suarez had refused to shake hands.</p>
              <p>Dalglish said: "Ian Ayre has made the club's position absolutely clear and it is right Suarez has now apologised for what happened at Old Trafford. </p>
              <p>"I was shocked to hear the player had not shaken hands having been told in the week he would do. </p>
              <p>"But all of us have a responsibility to represent this club in a fit and proper manner. </p>
              <p>"When I went on TV after the game I hadn't seen what had happened, but I did not conduct myself in a way befitting a Liverpool manager during that interview and I'd like to apologise for that."</p>
              <p>Liverpool are still to decide what action to take on Suarez, which could lead to a fine and further rap on the knuckles. </p>
              <p>Suarez issued his own apology minutes before Ayre's statement. He said: "I have spoken with the manager and realise I got things wrong. I've not only let him down but also the club and what it stands for and I'm sorry. </p>
              <p>"I made a mistake and I regret what happened. I should have shaken Patrice Evra's hand and I want to apologise." </p>
              <p>Yet these words now look to be too little, too late to save his Kop career beyond the end of the season.</p>

              <p><strong>The Prime Minister and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt are to hold a "round table discussion" with the sport's authorities and players' representatives, according to the Sunday Telegraph.</strong></p>
              <p>The event, scheduled for later this month, comes amid growing fears that high-profile incidents are harming the image of the game in England.</p>
              <p>A fresh spat broke out on Saturday after Liverpool forward Luis Suarez refused to shake hands with Manchester United's Patrice Evra before the teams' match.</p>
              <p>Suarez has only recently returned to action for Liverpool following an eight-match ban for racially abusing Evra during a game in October.</p>
              <p>At a charity reception last month, Mr Cameron said many people had been "concerned by recent events" in the sport.</p>
              <p>"My message is clear: we will not tolerate racism in Britain. It has absolutely no place in our society and where it exists, we will kick it out," he said.</p>
              <p>"Our football governing bodies, clubs and footballers themselves have a vital role to play as role models in this respect."</p>
              <p>A source at the Premier League told the newspaper the talks at Number 10 were expected to be "constructive and positive".</p>

              <p><strong>Suarez has found himself in the spotlight again after refusing to shake Patrice Evra's hand before Liverpool's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds striker was making his first start since he completed an eight-match ban for racially abusing Evra in the reverse fixture at Anfield in October.</p>
              <p>Although it had been claimed earlier in the week that Suarez would shake Evra's hand, the fact he did not meant the entire issue will now bubble on, with the United skipper clearly annoyed and Sir Alex Ferguson so incensed he branded the Uruguayan "a disgrace" immediately after the game.</p>
              <p>And Taylor, who has worked tirelessly to stamp out racism within the game, feels it is time for the Football Association to step in.</p>
              <p>"What Suarez did was disrespectful, inappropriate and embarrassing," he said.</p>
              <p>"If anything, Patrice Evra was the victim and he was prepared to put his hand out.</p>
              <p>"These players are expected to be role models but if we have a situation where nobody accepts the findings of hearings and just carries on regardless, all you get is anarchy.</p>
              <p>"Now the Football Association have to step in because the whole situation has gone too far.</p>
              <p>"Suarez had a chance to put everything to be yesterday, in front of a worldwide audience.</p>
              <p>"The fact that he chose not to is, quite frankly, depressing."</p>

              <p>I think he chickened out at the last minute, change his mind at the last second not to shake Evra hands. why didnt the FA just did away with the handshake, just as it did with the handshake last week for Chelsea vs QPR.</p>
              <p>he was still unrepentent. his days at liverpool is numbered. as for Kenny, hard to say. I remembered glen hoddle was forced to resign in the late 90s as england manager for his views on disabled people being punished for their past lives. if kenny was forced to resign due to this, it is a shame though. He didnt handle this whole affair very well, but the same can be said of the board when he came out with the idea of supporting Suarez via the T shirt and defending Suarez throughout.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Luis Suárez</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s future at </span><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;"> has been placed in doubt after the contrition the club has been accused of lacking throughout his dispute with Patrice Evra emerged in an unprecedented series of statements from Anfield on Sunday.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Suárez, </span><span style="color: #000000;">branded "a disgrace" by Sir Alex Ferguson</span><span style="color: #000000;"> for refusing to shake Evra's hand at Old Trafford on Saturday, </span><span style="color: #000000;">first issued a public apology</span><span style="color: #000000;"> for his actions on the club's website. Ian Ayre, the Liverpool managing director, then released a statement that accused the 25-year-old of misleading the club before </span><span style="color: #000000;">Kenny Dalglish</span><span style="color: #000000;">, himself widely condemned for an interview that followed the </span><span style="color: #000000;">2-1 defeat</span><span style="color: #000000;"> to </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> apologised for conduct not "befitting of a Liverpool manager" during his appearance on Sky.</p>

              <p>Ayre's statement represents the first time Liverpool have criticised their £22.8m signing from Ajax since he racially abused Evra at Anfield last October, behaviour that resulted in an eight-match ban and a £40,000 fine. It reflects the intense anger felt by Liverpool's American owners, Fenway Sports Group, at the damage caused to the club's reputation by Suárez and the striker may yet be fined by his employers for his actions at Old Trafford. How he responds to the public criticism during the final months of the season will have a major influence on his future at the club with Ferguson having insisted he should never play for Liverpool again.</p>
              <p>Dalglish attracted criticism for angrily absolving Suárez of blame for the problems at Old Trafford during an interview with Sky's Geoff Shreeves. Later, the Liverpool manager conducted an interview for the BBC, at which it was made clear he would not take questions on Suárez, but did not attend the main press conference.</p>
              <p>Despite the intervention of the club's owners, it is understood Dalglish changed his stance on Suárez completely after watching a replay of the incident with Evra and, as the statements reflect and his close friend Alan Hansen suggested on Match of the Day on Saturday night, he feels badly let down by a striker he has defended to his own cost throughout the affair.</p>
              <p>"I was shocked to hear that the player had not shaken hands having been told earlier in the week that he would do," Dalglish said. "All of us have a responsibility to represent this club in a fit and proper manner and that applies equally to me as Liverpool manager. When I went on TV after yesterday's game I hadn't seen what had happened but I did not conduct myself in a way befitting of a Liverpool manager during that interview and I'd like to apologise for that."</p>
              <p>It is the statement from Ayre that is most instructive in terms of principal owner John W Henry and chairman Tom Werner's position on the striker. Ayre said: "We are extremely disappointed Luis Suárez did not shake hands with Patrice Evra before yesterday's game. The player had told us beforehand that he would but then chose not to do so. He was wrong to mislead us and wrong not to offer his hand to Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>The controversy brought condemnation from Jeremy Hunt on Sunday. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, the culture secretary said: "It is incredibly depressing. It was very unsporting behaviour and I am sure the Football Association will look to see if any rules were broken."</p>
              <p>He added: "The lesson of the last couple of months is that you can never be complacent. The prime minister is very, very concerned to make sure that we don't go back to the bad old days but also that we are absolutely on our mettle to make sure that the football authorities and the government continue to do everything we can to stamp out this problem."</p>

              <p>3) I am wondering how he can still play in EPL, when he called Evra negro, when they are so many african and black players playing in england. when he called one a negro, he is calling every one of them negro and that is derogatory and inflammatory for obvious reasons.</p>

              <p>the truth is, you would never know what else would happen? from the text commentary i got, Rio got a superb tackle against him, but he was raving and asking for a card for Rio.. Not sure what's that about, maybe, tonight replay.</p>
              <p>as for playing in EPL, Liverpool won't sell him cause if so, his value will drop and Pool will suffer a loss, but they may try to ship him out discreetly.</p>
