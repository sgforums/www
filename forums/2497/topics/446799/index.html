              <p><strong>The Uruguay international, having served an eight-match suspension for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra, had not played since Boxing Day.</strong></p>
              <p>And although he gave his side another dimension when he appeared as a second-half substitute in Monday night's Premier League clash at Anfield, he could not end six weeks' of frustration with a decisive intervention, missing a golden chance from close range late in the game.</p>
              <p>As can be expected with Suarez, his 24-minute cameo was not without incident. He was booked for kicking Scott Parker in the stomach when attempting a close-range volley and also felt he should have had a penalty for handball when he had in fact used his own arm to control.</p>
              <p>However, Tottenham left Anfield seemingly satisfied with a point, as while the home team were enjoying having Suarez available again the visitors were missing their absent manager.</p>
              <p>Harry Redknapp had been due to fly to Merseyside after another day in Southwark Crown Court at his trial into charges of cheating the public revenue, which he denies, but technical problems with his aircraft meant he was left stranded in the south of England.</p>
              <p>Whether the late change of plans affected his team would only be known inside their dressing room but Liverpool threatened as early as the fifth minute, only for Michael Dawson's perfectly-judged challenge to nick the ball away from Andy Carroll inside the penalty area.</p>
              <p>Suarez had a chance to win it after that but headed straight at Friedel from Gerrard's free-kick, while fellow substitute Stewart Downing fired over from range.</p>
              <p>The draw did little to help Liverpool's bid for a finish in the top four, or Tottenham's title chase, but having failed to produce their familiar brand of attacking football the visitors would maybe consider that a point gained.</p>

              <p>Uruguayan Suarez made his Liverpool comeback as a sub after serving an eight-match ban for racially abusing United defender Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>And within minutes he caught Spurs midfielder Scott Parker with a wild kick in the stomach. Ref Michael Oliver showed Suarez a yellow card, but Rooney tweeted: "If ref sees that kick from Suarez and books him for it, it should be red."</p>
              <p>Former United star Gary Neville further fuelled the row when he claimed on Sky: "He's been lucky, the ref's let him off with one there."</p>
              <p>In another incident, pictures showed Suarez apparently grabbing at Parker's eye.</p>
              <p>United and Liverpool meet at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime and Suarez could start after a lively showing against Spurs.</p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Kenny Dalglish said: "It was fantastic for Suarez to be back — but he should never have been out in the first place.</p>
              <p>"Luis has not played since December and it would have been a wee bit unfair to throw him straight in. He's had half an hour here which will do him the world of good."</p>
              <p>Dalglish refused to comment on Rooney's tweet or Neville's TV comments.</p>
              <p>He added: "I don't have a view on them."</p>
              <p>The Uruguayan's return and a cat which held up play by running on to the pitch were the main talking points in a dreadful game.</p>
              <p>Spurs chief Harry Redknapp failed in his desperate dash to make it to Anfield — and must have thought he had got a right result.</p>
              <p>A point meant Spurs cemented their hold on third position but they are now seven points adrift of leaders Manchester City.</p>
              <p>It was Liverpool's <strong>EIGHTH </strong>home draw of the season and they have the worst chance-conversion rate in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>But Dalglish insisted: "We're in a better position than last year."</p>

              Edit: 
              Liverpool has trouble scoring goals again.... 
              Carroll is getting slightly better every game, but his progress is way too slow to be effective for Liverpool's top4 dream this season.

              <p>This Suarez guy is downright low, even as a non-pool fans, i have to say i have never seen a pool player with such low moral before no matter how far back my memory serve me. He cheated in the world cup, bit the ear of another player back in Holland, made racist remarks on blacks, now kicking Parker in such a way that clearly the ball was never even there to be won... and the eye one is even more terrible... Parker could have lost an eye for the rest of his life just over a football match...</p>
              <p>This guy is the sickest and lowest fellow i have seen in the epl since it started, serious. There won't even be an ounce of sorry felt towards him should he suffer a misfortune on the pitch. Not that I am being unkind, but some people just don't deserve it. And he is that kind...</p>

              <p>This Suarez guy is downright low, even as a non-pool fans, i have to say i have never seen a pool player with such low moral before no matter how far back my memory serve me. He cheated in the world cup, bit the ear of another player back in Holland, made racist remarks on blacks, now kicking Parker in such a way that clearly the ball was never even there to be won... and the eye one is even more terrible... Parker could have lost an eye for the rest of his life just over a football match...</p>
              <p>This guy is the sickest and lowest fellow i have seen in the epl since it started, serious. There won't even be an ounce of sorry felt towards him should he suffer a misfortune on the pitch. Not that I am being unkind, but some people just don't deserve it. And he is that kind...</p>

              <p>Lets put it that way, all your comments to-date are anti-Liverpool and not objective at all...At least he is man enough to admit that he made that statement though he could have denied it cos it is Evra words against his and he wasn't caught in camera the way Terry did. Dun forget that Evra has a reputation of his own for wrongful allegations in the past. Mind you, it is perfectly fine to use that word in South America though not in this part of the world so he has now learnt through the hard way so move on.</p>
              <p>He indeed cheated during the World Cup but tell me who wouldn't if they were in his shoes with an almost certain goal coming your way? Didn't Henry cheat as well which sank the hearts of the Irish? Why wasn't that being mentioned then?</p>

              <p>Let's put it this way better... The word is consistency.</p>
              <p>Henry did indeed cheated but in the course of his long career, how often has he done it? Do we see or hear Henry kicking or bitting opponents as well? Whereas for Suarez, in his relatively short career, he have already done a lot more harm than Henry will ever do in his lifetime don't you agree?</p>
              <p>Man enough to admit it? Can I ask you, have you actually read the full report of the commission's finding? It's really not as simple as what you seem to think as just Evra's words against his. You think Suarez actually man enough admitted it by himself?</p>
              <p>There were video footage of different angles that the FA obtain from the broadcaster material that was not broadcast.</p>
              <p>There were experts observations of the footage as well. </p>
              <p>Match referee Marriner's account found to be credible...</p>
              <p>The commission had the opportunity to observe the demeanour of the witness in particular Evra and Suarez to judge their credibility while giving statements.</p>
              <p>Under cross-examination, Suarez first tried to avoid the question until he finally admits to lying and giving a false statement earlier. You can find this on page 62 No. 246 in the report.</p>
              <p>Apart from this, we all know how he cheated and then celebrated in the faces of the Ghana players...</p>
              <p>Perhaps you care to read this first...</p>

              I have to say that his kick on Parker is not intentional as he did try to shove Parker out of his way before rising his leg. But Parker is steady enough to maintain his position and win the ball. During all this time, Suarez's vision is on the ball and therefore did not notice Parker was in his kicking distance.
              
              I does not want to comment on his past action because yes its wrong, but we should not judge him only because his past action, only to deny his bright future ahead.

              Of course they will hate him. His handball eventually prevent Ghana to reach the semi-finals. Its not like he did not get send-off or whatever, even his fellow Uruguay player beside him, also tried to stretch and block the shot with his hand.

              <p>Kindly watch the clip again... Cos i find your excuse rather lame. I have try looking upwards and i can still see very clearly whats next to me from the bottom of my vision. Go ahead, try it yourself.</p>
              <p>Also watch the clip carefully, Parker headed the ball well off before his foot even landed on him.</p>
              <p>I am not saying it's intended or not as we will never know but rather, he should have pull out of such am attempt as he should know from experienced that his foot was never going to reach the ball before Parker's head. It was therefore just another reckless act on his part and totally disregard another fellow professional's well being in my opinion.</p>

              <p>Actually i think only the Pool folks won't agree with me.</p>
              <p>But what can i expect when they can't even agree with their whole nation with regards to him being guilty of making a racist remark...</p>
              <p>Have you read the report yet?</p>
              <p>So what do you think of his cross-examination by the FA's lawyer?</p>
              <p>He lied by knowingly making a false statement to the FA to hide his guilt... Avoided the question several times by the FA's lawyer under cross-examination.</p>
              <p>I said you can find all this on page 62 No. 246 in the FA's independent commission report.</p>
              <p>The guy cheated, then laugh in their faces... Lied to benefit himself, what else is beyond him?</p>
              <p>But to watch Pool fans defend him is the most funniest part for me. As i have said, in my long years following the game, i have never known a pool player with such low morals... Past players have always been men of proper characters at least. This guy just take them to a new low I have never seen before... A racist, a cheat, a liar, a diver, an actor (stimulation), a reckless guy that would kick or bite opponents when he is not happy... lol.</p>
              <p>Oh well, as they say... How the mighty have fallen...</p>

              <p>If you want to talk about cheating, it happens everywhere and all the time unless you are living in your own world. He made a mistake of saying some thing that is unacceptable in this part of the world and he has served his punishment so it is time to move on...Your comments about him is uncalled for especially with regards to his misfortune on the field.</p>
              <p>Evra is a liar and cheater too if you want to bring up the past. He alleged racism against Fulham and Chelsea (including the grounds man) in the past and was suspended for lying. Was he blasted by the Liverpool fans for that?</p>

              <p>Perhaps so, but if we look at the consistency or frequency of it happening with him, i think he is always in there. You mentioned Henry, but what other examples can you mention of him in his long career?</p>
              <p>You seemed to be mistaken, this thread is about suarez and what he has done in the short time period... It really doesn't matter what others did. This thread is about suarez. So there is really no point pulling others in. Cos it doesn't change his characteristic in any way does it? </p>
              <p>And what he said (racist remark) isn't the point i was making now... It's what he did after is what i am now saying... He has no problem making up a lie trying to cover up his guilt by deliberately furnishing a false statement to the FA which was later found out under cross-examination by the lawyer... You see the problem with the characteristic of the man? He twist and turned and i don't just mean on the field. And it wouldn't surprise me one day he will do the same to the club when he wants to leave or have left... Just watch.</p>
              <p>Do you find it strange why almost the whole of the nation has condemn your club while some of you guys remain oblivion to it? Take a little time to think about it...</p>

              <p>It's all in the context. Making racist remarks doesn't really make you a racist.</p>
              <p>We all used to call out racist remarks without knowing it:</p>
              <p> "kling kiahs" , "cheenas" , "malayu kayu", "ah bengs" etc etc</p>
              <p>In essence, the FA finally decided to penalise Suarez just by using racist remarks although they sort of agreed that Suarez is not a racist, that's all. Enough of it. <a class="tinymce_control" href="446799?page=1#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="446799?page=1#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="446799?page=1#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>

              <p>Yes, he did call Evra that but this doesn't constitute the fact that he is a racist...This word is often used in South America where he comes from as well as Portugal and it means friend and it is used in a friendly way. Yes, it isn't acceptable in England or other parts of the world and the remarks that he made is of racist nature but we can't deem him as a racist because this may not be his intent especially when he only settled down in England for 8 months. I find it strange that someone like him whose grandparents are blacks would be a racist.</p>
              <p>He has learnt through the hard way so no point continue to harp on this.</p>

              <p>The only people who can't accept the findings of the independent commission report are the Liverpool fans seriously... They are the only ones who find the ruling by the FA absurd. Let's us not forget suarez had his own laywers to defend him as well as to questioned Evra. </p>
              <p>Other independent bodies from organisations to other club players to former players of Black and white origin have also condemn his behaviour in this case. Enough said i think.</p>
              <p>Your own accident has no barring to this matter really. But just to let you know, you said it yourself. You were trying to head clear with a diving header while the striker was attempting a scissors-kick... I can only conclude that the ball was below your head level which is not the case with Parker's.</p>
