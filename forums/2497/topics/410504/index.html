              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard has backed Gerard Houllier to bring success to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Houllier has finally been confirmed as Martin O'Neill's successor after quitting as technical director of the French Football Federation.</p>
              <p>He will be formally unveiled at a press conference on Friday afternoon before taking charge for the first time in Monday's league encounter at Stoke.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Houllier gave Gerrard his debut at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool </span></a>more than a decade ago and the England skipper has nothing but praise for the Frenchman who spent six years on Merseyside.</p>
              </div>
              <p>He said: 'I've still got quite a close relationship with Gerard. He gave me my chance at the top level and I certainly learnt an awful lot from him.</p>
              <p>'Aston Villa have got themselves a very good manager and I am not surprised Gerard has come back into the Premier League.</p>
              <p>'I know how much he loves football. He has been desperate to get back involved in the Premier League so it is no surprise to me.</p>
              <p>'It has been no surprise to me that Villa have been interested in him because he is a top manager. 'We had a magnificent year in 2001. He came in and had to change an awful lot of things at Liverpool and that is what he is good at.</p>
              <p>'When he comes in, he knows what he wants, and he knows how to get a winning team. That showed by the five trophies we won under him.'</p>
              <p>Houllier suffered with health problems during the latter part of his time with the Reds which led to his assistant, Phil Thompson, having a spell in charge of the team.</p>
              <p>But Gerrard insisted: 'I don't think health is a problem for Gerard. I saw him a few days ago at the Jamie Carragher testimonial at Anfield and he looked superb.</p>
              <p>'He looked really healthy and fresh. I asked him then if he was interested in Aston Villa and he said he was. I really don't think the health will be a problem. I think he will be fine.'</p>
              <p>Houllier is hoping to appoint one of his former Liverpool backroom staff - Patrice Bergues - at Villa Park.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/09/article-1310517-0B18ACBE000005DC-767_468x331.jpg" alt="Return: Houllier enjoyed reasonable success with Liverpool before joining Lyon" width="468" height="331">

              <p><strong>Bergues also worked alongside Houllier at Lens and Lyon at club level as well as with the French Football Federation in the late 1990s.</strong></p>
              <p>Houllier had wanted to bring in Phil Thompson, his number two at Anfield as assistant-manager, but he has opted to remain in his role as a pundit with Sky Sports.</p>
              <p>But before then he will meet the players - including skipper Stiliyan Petrov, Luke Young and James Collins who all backed caretaker boss Kevin MacDonald to become new manager. MacDonald's role under the new regime has still to be confirmed by Villa.</p>

              <p><strong>Gerard Houllier has delivered a stark warning to Aston Villa fans after taking over from Martin O'Neill.</strong></p>
              <p>Despite finishing sixth for the past three seasons, Villa can expect to finish between seventh and 12th according to their new boss.</p>
              <p>The former Liverpool manager, who will no longer take charge of the match against Stoke on Monday, said: 'Aston Villa is not a club on the same level as Liverpool, let's be objective and honest.</p>
              <p>'It's a club that according to me has belonged between seventh and 12th place in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>'But, above all, it's a historic club which has won the European Cup. It's a club which has got good infrastructure and a fine team which is after one thing - to improve year on year.'</p>
              <p>Houllier revealed he rejected other offers before taking charge at Villa and hopes to build on the success achieved under O'Neill.</p>
              <p>He said: 'It was really starting to tickle me. I wanted to go back pitchside. I had, of course, other proposals but this one seemed to be the most interesting in terms of working conditions and environment.'</p>

              <p><strong>Houllier was expected to make his bow in Monday's clash with Stoke but that has now been put on hold, and he is not expected to take over for another fortnight.</strong></p>
              <p>He revealed at his official unveiling on Friday afternoon that he has to agree a<br>departure date from his role of technical director with the French Football<br>Federation.</p>
              <p>If all goes to plan, the 63-year-old is set to be at the helm for the first time for the home Carling Cup game with Blackburn on September 22.</p>
              <p>Houllier will not attend Monday's Barclays Premier League clash at Stoke while he thrashes out the terms of his exit from the FFF.</p>
              <p>He will return to England for the home match with Bolton on September 18 but Kevin MacDonald will remain as caretaker boss for the next few days.</p>
              <p>Houllier said: 'I take great pride in my appointment as manager of Aston Villa. It is a great honour for me.</p>
              <p>'Why am I here? One of the reasons is that I think Randy Lerner [owner] and Paul Faulkner [chief executive] have great enthusiasm, dynamism and honesty and they convinced me of their ambitions for the club.</p>
              <p>'I had a good job with the FFF but I had a desire to return to English football - although it is not a case of unfinished business because I did well at Liverpool and won six trophies.</p>
              <p>Houllier confirmed that MacDonald will not be part of Villa's first-team set-up.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I spoke to Kevin this morning and he prefers to go back to his role as reserve team manager.</p>
              <p>'He has done a very good job and I trust him and I am sure our relationship will be good.'</p>
