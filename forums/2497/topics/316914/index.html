              <h2>BENITEZ: CROUCH WILL COST £15MILLION</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><br><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/05/Others/216890.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="193"></div>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez has slapped a £15million price tag on England striker Peter Crouch on the day that he lost his first-team coach Alex Miller and confirmed that Harry Kewell will leave Liverpool. And the Anfield chief also revealed that he had held talks with Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill over the potential transfer of midfielder Gareth Barry to Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez accepts that Crouch could have his head turned after a frustrating season when he has found first-team chances hard to come by - but the Spaniard insists he will not be leaving on the cheap.</p>
              <p>"Crouch wants to play every week but knows he must fight it out with Fernando Torres," Benitez said. "We keep seeing Portsmouth linked with the player but we have had no offer as yet. "A £15m price tag would not be unreasonable."</p>
              <p>On Kewell's departure, Benitez added: "We have tried to come to an agreement with the player and his agent, but that has not been possible. "Kewell will leave the club at the end of his contract." It is believed that Kewell has rejected a new deal on reduced wages.</p>
              <p>Benitez also explained further the pending saga over Barry, and revealed that nothing more will happen until after this weekend's closing round of league matches. He said: "I have spoken to Martin O'Neill, he knows my ideas. "But we agreed to wait until the end of the season for any more discussions."</p>
              <p>Benitez has also seen coach Alex Miller leave the club to take up a management appointment in Japan with JEF United Chiba. He said: "We have some names to consider and will make an appointment soon."</p>

              <p><strong>£</strong>15m is a fair assessment. if malouda/chelsea can cost the same, crouch should command even more. this is a wacky league where everything is overpriced and if liverpool were to be conservative, it is shortchanging itself.</p>

              <p><strong>Crouch fury over £15m price tag</strong></p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>PETER CROUCH has been left raging after boss Rafa Benitez slapped a £15million price tag on his head. The Liverpool manager insisted yesterday that he will not let the beanpole striker leave on the cheap. And the Spaniard is prepared to keep Crouch for the last year of his contract and lose him for nothing — rather than sell him for less than his transfer value.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But England star Crouch, 27, is outraged at Benitez’s stance — and he feels the Reds are going back on a pre-season gentleman’s agreement. He is adamant Liverpool said they would help him engineer a move this summer, as long as he did the business when called on and did not kick up a fuss when left out.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Crouch believes he kept his side of the bargain and believes the extortionate price tag is an insult that will effectively mean seeing out his Anfield contract from the bench.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Portsmouth are desperately keen to take the 6ft 7in hitman back to Fratton Park but are not keen to pay much beyond £8m.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But Benitez said: “If we receive a very good offer — and by that I mean £15m — we will consider it. I’m happy to keep him.”</p>

              <p>I agree that Crouch should not go cheap, but 15mil is a tad too exorbitant, 10mil would do.</p>
              <p>and if Liverpool were to really sell Crouch, its our loss man. He does not score enough but he did gave opposing defenders a really hard time whenever he plays. i still hope Crouch would stay and Benitez would give him more playing time, he should look at the contributions of Kuyt and especially Voronin.</p>
              <p>as for Harry kewell, its so long and thanks for the good memories. get ur overpaid GBP65k (thats more then Riise, Arbeola, Skrtel, Lucas) ass somewhere</p>

              <p>valuation is very very subjective so we'll leave for the market to determine it.</p>
              <p>i beg to defer your saying of he don't wear England's jersey for nothing, England doesn't have any proven goal scorer after Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer so he is just the balance of whats left then he is the best that there got, cause there is nothing there to choose from in the 1st place</p>

              <p>chelsea is gunning for messi, mah, 100m value. 15m is loose change to abro, so he is not interested. like richman here, ask him buy $100 seiko watch, he'll say "pls dun waste my time."</p>

              <p>is the french league the same standard as english? if judging by your so-called logic, anyone playing regular football and in the 1st eleven, like even the s-league 1st 11 and `top player' like nor alam shah should also be benchmark with the english premier league pay and play scale as well?</p>
              <p>what about shev? he is top of the heaps in serie a but a flop now. how would you then rate shev should he go? of course his value will drop. just becos he comes expensive, will he go `expensive' as well?</p>
              <p>molouda, the player in question, is mediocre in the chelsea line-up. the rest of the team made him look good. but he costs 15m because chelsea, or rather mourinho wants him in. if that is his `fair' value, so be it.</p>
              <p>you compare what is the value of the player now. like shares, past historical value is not indicative of current or future performance. crouch is still prolific by any standard in the games(however little) he play. just because he comes in at a `lesser value', must he then leave at the same `low' value? if, for instance, king kev feels he is worth 12m and take crouch over to nufc, who's for you and me to argue?</p>
              <p>we all know rafa has purposely put a high value on crouch to state his intention that crouch will not leave liverpool `on the easy' or `cheap'. he is a proven scorer and and england international to boot.   </p>
