              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/23/article-0-0D20F40900000578-745_634x451.jpg" alt="Hull's Paul McShane (left) clears the ball from Liverpool striker Andy Carroll" width="634" height="451"></span>

              </div>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Liverpool's preparations for the new Barclays Premier League season suffered an unhappy setback after they slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Hull City.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>All eyes going into this game were on £20million winger Stewart Downing and £16million midfielder Jordan Henderson, who were included in Liverpool's squad for the first time since their respective moves from Aston Villa and Sunderland.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But it turned out to be a forgettable afternoon for Kenny Dalglish's men, as they rarely threatened to create any chances and were undone by their enthusiastic hosts, who capitalised on some poor defending to run out easy winners.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>With the new recruits consigned to the bench for the opening 45 minutes, there was a chance for some with questions hanging over their Anfield careers – such as Joe Cole and Alberto Aquilani – to provide Dalglish with a reminder that they may be able to force their way back into his plans.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool, however, were rather one-paced during the first half and the home side took maximum advantage, charging into a two goal lead. Most significantly, they kept Liverpool's attack comfortably at arm's length during that period.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Both Hull's goals would have graced a far bigger occasion than this pre-season friendly. The first came on 21 minutes from Robert Brady, who bent a right-footed drive past Liverpool goalkeeper Alexander Doni after skipping inside a couple of timid challenges.</span></p>
              <p>
              </p><p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>The second, which arrived on 34 minutes, was even better. Skipper Robert Koren was allowed to advance forward and, after playing a one-two with Aaron McLean, worked an angle to shape a left footed drive tantalisingly past Doni's flailing arms from 25 yards.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>At the other end, Hull keeper Peter Gulacsi – who has only just moved to the KC Stadium on loan from Liverpool – remained untroubled. His old team-mates lacked imagination and seemed intent only on hitting long balls up to David Ngog. It was not a tactic that yielded any success.</span></p>

              <div class="floatRHS"></div>
              <div class="floatRHS"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/07/23/article-0-0D20EE5A00000578-590_306x423.jpg" alt="Charlie Adam" width="306" height="423"></span></div>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>As had been the case in their previous friendlies in China and Malaysia, Dalglish sent a completely new line-up out after the re-start and, with Downing, Henderson, £9m summer signing Charlie Adam and £35m record signing Andy Carroll, it was much more interesting.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Sporting a pair of garish yellow boots, Downing almost made the perfect start to his Anfield career, exchanging deft passes with Dirk Kuyt before cracking a right-footed drive that forced Adriano Basso, Hull's replacement keeper, into evasive action.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>There were some neat interchanges between Henderson and Downing and both Dalglish and Carroll will have been encouraged by Downing's determination to fire in crosses as soon as he received possession out wide.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Any hopes that Liverpool would fashion a comeback, though, were dashed on 58 minutes when Jay Simpson took advantage of some lax marking and poked a finish from 12 yards past Brad Jones after Dele Adebola had chested a cross into his path.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>This might have only been Liverpool's third game since reporting back from their summer break but the fact they have conceded nine goals in that period means Dalglish and his staff have plenty to work on before the serious business begins.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>An understrength Liverpool side lost 3-0 to Galatasaray in Istanbul - their second successive pre-season defeat by that scoreline.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Following their defeat to Hull on Saturday, manager Kenny Dalglish sent out a virtual reserve side in the first half at the Turk Telekom Arena, with only Andy Carroll considered a genuine first-team starter.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Such was the make-up of the team there were five full-backs on the pitch at the start and the disjointedness cost them as former Reds striker Milan Baros hooked home an eighth-minute volley and added a far-post header just before half-time.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The introduction of Dirk Kuyt and Alberto Aquilani at the interval improved the cohesion slightly but when former Bolton striker Johan Elmander crashed home a volley from the edge of the area seven minutes from time the visitors’ difficult night was complete.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool have now conceded three goals in each of their four pre-season friendlies so far.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Liverpool were denied a win against Norwegian outfit Valerenga, after coming from two goals down to lead 3-2 only to squander their advantage with the final whistle approaching.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A last gasp strike from Fellah denied the Merseysiders victory in their penultimate pre-season clash before the start of the season.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Owner John W Henry, who has set Dalglish's side a minimum requirement of reaching the Champions League, was in the stands for the score draw.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Dalglish had named his three major summer signings, Jordan Henderson, Charlie Adam and Stuart Downing in his starting line-up after leaving all three out of the 3-0 defeat to Galatasaray last week.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool's promising start saw Johnson carve open the first half-chance after advancing from full-back before an inviting cross was missed by striker Carroll.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Winger Downing then saw a low drive sail just wide of Valerenga goalkeeper Hirschfeld's post.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, the visitors were left stunned after conceding two goals in four minutes. FIrst, Strand beat the returning Reina from close range before Ogude capitalised on a loose ball to fire past Liverpool's stopper.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Two minutes before the interval striker Andy Carroll struck one back, after an inviting cross from Downing was well taken down by the £35m striker before lashing his shot past Hirschfeld.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>After the break, Liverpool continued to press for the equaliser but had to wait until the introduction of substitute Alberto Aquilani before their breakthrough.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Italian who has been linked with a return to Serie A, crossed for Agger to score his first with little under ten minutes remaining, after his corner was thumped home by the Danish defender.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The pair again combined from a corner, this time with Agger finding the net courtesy of his left-footed strike.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>With seconds remaining Valerenga struck, with boss Dalglish admitting afterwards, 'The important thing is we've got to be better when we don't have the ball - but the boys aren't shy of hard work. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'There's an educated week's training ahead.'</span></p>
