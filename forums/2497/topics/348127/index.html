              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">NICOLAS ANELKA has taken a final swipe at Phil Scolari, insisting: Didier Drogba and I can play together. </h2>
              <p class="article">Chelsea striker Anelka hit a hat-trick in Saturday’s 3-1 FA Cup win at Watford after playing up front with Drogba for just the last 20 minutes. It was a pairing Scolari never tried in his ill-fated seven months in charge at Stamford Bridge. </p>
              <p class="article">The ex-Brazil coach had bust-ups with both strikers because of his policy. But Anelka did not miss the opportunity to point out how effective it was when they got the chance. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: “At the beginning, I started on the right but in the last 20 minutes we played as a pair and it was good.</p>
              <h4>Changed</h4>
              <p class="article">“It was good because a lot of people said we couldn’t play together. But we never really tried to play together. </p>
              <p class="article">“Today, in 20 minutes, we scored three goals. It’s not about me. To play with Didier up front changed the game, and that’s why we scored the goals and won the game.” </p>
              <p class="article">And Anelka is hopeful that new boss Guus Hiddink also noticed the change in the game from his place in the stands.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “Of course we can work as a partnership for Chelsea. “I have said it before and so has Didier but Scolari never tried playing us together. “It was me scoring this time, but it might be Didier next time. That’s good for Chelsea. “I’ve played as a striker all my life. To play on the right or the left is always difficult.”</p>

              <p>Yeah, I guess we have players we won't like but credit to him... His that first or second goal that overhead strike was very good... You can call it a striker's goal...</p>
              <p>To me i think he has shown the best form of his premiership career... Its just that he like the past few chelsea strikers, don't get enough support from the Chelsea midfield and wings...</p>
              <p>I don't know... I just feel that you can't fault someone who is currently the premier league top scorer... cos if so, then what about the rest?</p>

              <h2>CUDICINI - SCOLARI WAS A MISTAKE</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/01/240/Carlo-Cudicini-Tottenham-Hotspur-Stoke-City-P_1845643.jpg" border="0" alt="Cudicini - says Chelsea made a mistake."></div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Carlo Cudicini believes Chelsea made a mistake by appointing Luiz Felipe Scolari as manager.</strong></p>
              <p>Scolari was named as Avram Grant's successor last summer and the Blues made an encouraging start to the season as they set the pace in the Barclays Premier League title race alongside Liverpool.</p>
              <p>However, they struggled to sustain their challenge and Scolari was dismissed on Monday following a disappointing couple of months. Cudicini, who was allowed to join Tottenham in last month's transfer window, does not feel Scolari was suited to a role in English club management.</p>
              <p>"It just didn't work out," the Italian told the <em>Sunday Times</em>. "I didn't say he was the wrong man the day he was appointed because I didn't know him then but now I know he was a mistake.</p>
              <p>"He had been an international coach, not a club manager, for far too long. "It was a different culture for him too. English football is totally different to what he knew and he found it difficult to adapt to the style and speed of the game.</p>
              <p>"He was a very nice guy but not the right person." Jose Mourinho won two Premier League titles with Chelsea and Cudicini admits he was able to adjust to the demands of English football much quicker than Scolari.</p>
              <p>Comparing the two managers, Cudicini added: "Jose adapted very well to English football straight away. "As soon as he arrived he seemed to know the players and what was required - the mentality, the way to train, everything.</p>
              <p>"Scolari just didn't have the same impact."</p>
