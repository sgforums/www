              <h1 class="titlestory">No way France v Ireland can be replayed – FIFA</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>FIFA
              have ruled out the possibility of repaying the France v Republic of
              Ireland World Cup qualifier that cruelly ended Ireland’s chances of
              progressing to the finals.</p>
              <p>One of the most controversial pieces of play in recent football
              history occurred in the second leg at the Stade de France in Paris on
              Wednesday that eventually put France through to the finals and despite
              calls from the Football Association of Ireland, the match will not be
              replayed.</p>
              <p>Late in the game, in the 103rd minute, France forward Thierry
              Henry handballed the ball in the area before providing the assist for
              William Gallas that led to the winning goal that sent Les Bleus through
              to South Africa and knocked Ireland out in the most devastating of
              circumstances.</p>
              <p>Despite Henry admitting he cheated by knocking the ball into his path with his hand, FIFA have said an emphatic no to a replay.</p>
              <p>"There is no way the game can be replayed,” a FIFA source told <em>Press Association Sport</em>.</p>
              <p>"To do so would cause absolute chaos for football. If it was
              replayed, then every match in the future would also be subject to these
              calls for a replay any time a referee misses an incident.</p>
              <p>"FIFA's rules are absolutely clear. Law five states that a
              referee's decision on points of fact are final. That is the end of it.
              You cannot replay the match on this basis.</p>
              <p>"You have to have a rule that says the referee's judgement is always right."</p>
              <p>Ireland coach Giovanni Trapattoni admitted it would be too hard
              to force a replay but insisted an incident like this could easily
              happen again.</p>
              <p>“After the referee decides the game is finished for me. I know
              it’s impossible to replay the game. It must make us think, because it
              can be repeated in the future,” he said.</p>

              <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barcelona</span> striker <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thierry Henry</span> has today issued a statement claiming that replaying <span style="color: #ff0000;">France</span>'s controversial World Cup qualifying play-off with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Republic of Ireland</span> would be "the fairest solution".<br><br>The forward, whose handball in the run-up to William Gallas's extra-time winner for Les Bleus has led to an official request from the FAI to FIFA to replay the game, admits that he controlled the ball with his hands but has denied that he is a cheat.<br><br>"I have said at the time and I will say again that, yes, I handled the ball," he said, according to <em><span style="color: #333332;">Sky Sports News</span></em>.<br><br>"I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area.<br><br>"As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times to be able make a conscious decision.<br><br>"People are viewing slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game.<br><br>"If people look at it in full speed you'll see that it was an instinctive reaction.<br><br>"It is impossible to be anything other than that. I have never denied that the ball was controlled with my hand. I told the Irish players, the referee and the media this after the game.<br><br>"Naturally I feel embarrassed at the way we won and feel extremely sorry for the Irish who definitely deserve to be in South Africa. <br><br>"Of course, the fairest solution would be to replay the game but it is not in my control.<br><br>"There is little more I can do apart from admit that the ball had contact with my hands leading up to our equalising goal and I feel very sorry for the Irish."<br></div>
