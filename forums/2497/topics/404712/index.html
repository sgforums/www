              </div>
              <p>Manchester United last night
              launched a £29million bid for
              Holland World Cup star Wesley
              Sneijder and they are ready
              to compete with arch rivals
              City for his Inter Milan
              team-mate, Mario Balotelli.</p>
              <p>Inter will listen to offers for
              unsettled striker Balotelli, but
              the European champions are
              determined to keep Sneijder
              at the San Siro.</p>
              <p>His agent, Soren Lerby, said
              talks with Inter are scheduled
              after the World Cup to extend
              the midfielder’s contract —
              now worth £3.5m a year after

              <p>But United have made the first
              move in their attempt to lure
              him to Old Trafford and Inter
              president Massimo Moratti
              confirmed: ‘The interest from
              Manchester United in Sneijder
              is real, but I didn’t look into it
              in an attempt not to fall into
              temptation.</p>
              <p>‘I’m following him at the
              World Cup and I think I’ll do
              the same also at Inter for the
              next years. I still haven’t received a good enough offer for
              even one player to leave. We will
              see.’ </p>

              </div>
              <p>Moratti has slapped
               a huge
              £30m price tag on Balotelli’s
              head in response to interest from
              City, and Inter revealed that
              United are also ready to go head
              to head with their derby rivals for
              the talented 19-year-old
              marksman. </p>
              <p>Technical director Marco Branca
              said: ‘There is also interest from
              United and City in Balotelli, but it’s
              very early to say if there will be
              any business done.</p>

              <p>United have played down
              speculation linking left back
              Patrice Evra with a move to
              Barcelona or Juventus.</p>
              <p>The France captain was at the
              centre of a player revolt in his
              country’s World Cup debacle, but
              the decision to give him an extra
              week off this summer was taken
              in May due to Evra’s marathon
              60-game season and for no other
              reason.</p>
              <p>In fact, United believe that
              Manchester will be the best place
              for him to escape the ongoing
              row in France so that he can get
              back to enjoying his football once
              more after the debacle in South
              Africa.</p>
              <p>Evra’s international team-mate,
              Patrick Vieira, says he will not
              play for France again even if he
              receives a call from new national
              boss Laurent Blanc because he
              wants to dedicate the final years
              of his career helping Roberto
              Mancini’s Manchester City win
              trophies.</p>
              <p>City have signed Slovakian Albert
              Rusnak on a three-year deal from
              MFK Kosice after the forward
              impressed on trial.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has dismissed reports that he bid for World Cup sensations Wesley Sneijder and Mesut Ozil and insists that his current Manchester United squad is ‘stronger than last season’.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson jets out on Monday on United’s pre-season tour to Canada, the United States and Mexico content that he is already equipped with the players to land his 12th Premier League title and third European Cup.</p>
              <p>He claimed to be bemused at speculation about his summer transfer dealings, in particular that he had bid £30million for Inter Milan forward Sneijder and that the<br>Dutchman had turned him down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/10/article-0-0A4DD441000005DC-901_468x334.jpg" alt="One of the stars: Wesley Sneijder has greatly impressed at the World Cup" width="468" height="334">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>The United manager said: ‘I believe the squad is stronger than last season with the younger players having another year under their belts. I don’t know where those reports about Sneijder came from. How can anybody turn me down when I haven’t even made a bid?’</strong></p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">Further suggestions that he had now turned his attention to Germany’s supremely talented young midfielder Ozil, who was central to the defeat of England in the last 16, were similarly discounted.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The United tour party will be depleted by the absence of all the players who have been in South Africa for the World Cup, the one exception being newly signed Mexico striker Javier Hernandez, 22, who will join up to play against his former club, Chivas of Guadalajara, on July 30.</p>
              <p>Injuries to Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand and Owen Hargreaves keep them out of the trip but Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes lead a 22-man party on the five-match tour.</p>
              <p>After training at their base in Chicago, United open up against Celtic in Toronto on Friday. They follow that with games against Philadelphia Union on July 21, Kansas City Wizards four days later then the MLS All-Stars in Houston on July 28.</p>
              <p>They fly to Mexico to finish the tour before returning to prepare for the Community Shield against Chelsea at Wembley on August 8.</p>
