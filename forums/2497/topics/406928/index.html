              <h1>Report: Emmanuel Adebayor Told He Can Leave City, Juventus And Milan Interested</h1>
              <h2>Manchester City ace Emmanuel Adebayor is in shock after being 
              told he can leave Eastlands after just one season, with both Juventus 
              and AC Milan waiting in the wings for his signature.</h2>

              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> According to the <em>News of the World</em>, City are prepared 
              to allow the former Arsenal targetman to leave if a permanent deal can 
              be done with either of the Serie A giants Juve or Milan.<br><br>Adebayor
               has his agent scouting Europe for potential destinations, but his 
              £130,000-a-week wages are making loan deals the most viable option, with
               an ambitious bid believed to be on the table from Olympique Marseille.<br><br>The
               Togo international has been told if he stays at City he is likely to 
              play next season, but boss Roberto Mancini desperately needs to cut down
               his 38-man squad to comply with new Premier League regulations that 
              allow a maximum of 25 players.<br><br>The 26-year-old cost £25 million 
              last summer and so far there has been no interest from English clubs for
               the striker who scored just 14 goals.<br><br>The Eastlands club are 
              expected to announce the signing of Inter Milan striker Mario Balotelli 
              this week, which would see Adebayor fall down the pecking order.</span></p>

              <p>I doubt City will let him go cos they only have Tevez and lets say they manage to sign that Italian kid...  Then they would still only have 2 strikers if the likes of Bellamy - seen as a problem player, Jo - not wanted back, Robinho - don't want to return, and Santa - Almost leaving...</p>
              <p>Unless City gets Torres or something, it's hard to imagine them with abundance in wealth going into the season with only 3 established strikers... Cos even 4 shouldn't be a problem for them...</p>

              <p><br>yes bro, i agree your comment. busquet is actually defensive mid player. That is why Yaya was sold. fabregas is creative kind of player. replacing basquet with fabregas will unsettle the team balance. not a wise move.</p>

              <p><br>Maybe it's the $160k per week compare to the $60k a week he got paid ?</p>
