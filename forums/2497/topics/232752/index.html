Ferguson said last night that United had "hit a brick wall" but the club are hoping to break Bayern Munich's resolve after putting an offer in the region of Â£18m into writing.<br><br>David Gill, the United chief executive, faxed the bid through to Bayern after receiving indications that they would finally be willing to allow the midfielder to move. However, it remains a complicated process and there is still a considerable element of doubt about whether the move will be ratified within the transfer window.<br><br>Gill's information is that the Bayern hierarchy cannot agree between themselves and, as a result, he has received mixed signals. One certainty is that Hargreaves does not need any more persuasion, the England international having sought to orchestrate his departure from Bayern with a concerted campaign through the media to make it clear he wants to play in the Premiership.<br><br>His stance has angered the Bayern officials, in particular the president Franz Beckenbauer and the general manager Uli Hoeness. However, it did not stop Hargreaves making his feelings clear yet again last night.<br><br>Ferguson, who described the situation as "difficult", hopes to have an answer over the weekend or early next week, and end a saga that has now dragged on since last summer's World Cup. Hargreaves is close to full fitness after breaking his leg and Ferguson has instructed Gill to do everything he can to bring him in before the end of January.<br><br>"The most important thing is for us to look at ourselves rather than at what Chelsea do," said Ferguson, whose side make their first ever trip to Arsenal's Emirates Stadium tomorrow. "We've got to try and keep our consistency from now until the end of the season. It is going to be consistency that decides it, no question.<br><br>"Our form is good but there have been examples of us being charitable, at West Ham and Newcastle, and these are danger signs for us. We have to make sure nothing like that happens on a regular basis over these last 15 matches. Both teams will drop points, no question about that, and the name of the game is consistency."<br></div>
