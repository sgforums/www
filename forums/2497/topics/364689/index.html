              <p>“Well once again Real Madrid are buying some wonderful gifted players,
              but you can only play with one ball though,” Wilkins told <em>Sky Sports</em>.</p>
              <p>“It will be an interesting season, I will watch with interest what
              happens there. Kaka made his decision. There is a language barrier if
              he came to London.</p>
              <p>“We will add to our players for sure. And we will compete for the Premier <abbr><span class="glossary-term">League. </span></abbr></p>
              <p>&gt;
              He added: “For a foreign player it is difficult to play in the Premier
              League, so are these players taking the comfortable route by opting to
              play for Real Madrid? I don't know, I'm just playing devil's advocate,
              but the Premier League is still the best in the world."</p>

              <h2>WILKINS POP AT FOREIGNERS</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Ray Wilkins
              believes foreign players are taking the easy option by rejecting the
              chance to play in the Premier League and joining Spanish giants Real
              Madrid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea have already missed out on Brazilian superstar Kaka, who
              opted to join the Santiago Bernabeu after leaving AC Milan and
              Valencia's David Villa looks set to follow suit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Blues have been heavily linked with the Spain international,
              however, he appears to have rejected the chance to secure a Stamford
              Bridge deal by claiming he wants to join Real.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea assistant manager Wilkins acknowledges it is entirely up
              to the individual to decide who they join, but he believes they are
              turning down the chance to impress in the best league in the world by
              shunning England's top flight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Do they want the challenge of the Premier League? It's
              difficult to play in the Premier League as a foreign player, especially
              in the first year," he told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Are some of these players taking the slightly softer option in
              going to Real Madrid and staying somewhere where they know and not
              taking up the challenge elsewhere? I don't know. I'm just playing
              devils' advocate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Our league is the best league in the world."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Despite a quiet summer of transfer dealings so far, Wilkins has
              assured Chelsea fans the club will be investing in Carlo Ancelotti's
              squad with quality acquisitions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A number of Ancelotti's former players have been linked with
              moves to London such as Alexandre Pato, Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro
              Gattuso, although, as yet, no players have been signed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We will add players to our squad I'm sure and players of the
              utmost quality who will be prepared to take on the Premier League," he
              continued.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Real have rocked the football world this summer after agreeing a
              world record transfer for Cristiano Ronaldo's services on the back of
              landing Kaka's signature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wilkins admits Real will have one of the most potent attacking
              line-ups throughout the world, especially if they get their hands on
              Franck Ribery, although he questions how they will perform defensively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Once again Real Madrid are putting the roof on the house before the foundations are being put in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"They are buying some wonderfully gifted players. You can only play with one ball.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"With all those gifted players you need people that are going to work within the team structure as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It'll be an interesting season. It'll be one I'll be watching with great interest - how Real do this year."</p>
