            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gigabyte14:</div><div class="quote_body">i think alumnia should take the keeper's place</div></blockquote>Nope, Petr Cech is the best keeper not only in the premiership, but also the world. Only Gianluigi Buffon is capable of challenging that top spot. Bear in mind, Chelsea have been missing their top centrebacks, Ricardo Carvalho and John Terry for weeks. So, credit should be given to Cech for keeping Chelsea still in the hunt for the premiership after Mourinho departure saga!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
