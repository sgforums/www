            <div class='col-md body'>Blades launch legal action<br><br>Sheffield United have begun arbitration proceedings against the Premier League as a result of the Carlos Tevez transfer controversy, with plc chairman Kevin McCabe now proposing that England's top flight comprises 21 teams next season.<br><br>Following relegation, The Blades are bitterly angry at the failure to penalise West Ham with a points deduction despite being found guilty of irregularities in the August signings of Tevez and former Hammer Javier Mascherano.<br><br>A so-called 'Gang of Four' - comprising The Blades, Charlton, Wigan and Fulham - have been canvassing support from their fellow clubs and The Blades have also written to MPs in a bid to generate support for their cause.<br><br>McCabe served arbitration procedure notice on the Premier League on Wednesday to continue the crusade against the perceived injustice, and has again threatened further legal action if the league fails to accept his letter.<br><br>However, the Blades plc chairman has also proposed a scenario whereby Sheffield United would be reinstated to the league without West Ham being demoted, resulting in the Premiership housing 21 teams next season.<br><br>"We are still working towards debating matters with the Premier League, we want to undo the wrong and the injustice of the decision," McCabe told the club's official website.<br><br>"The events off the field of play have culminated in our arbitration procedures.<br><br>"We have written to every MP, explaining the background of the injustice and that it needs to be satisfied for the good of the sport.<br><br>"First and foremost we're doing everything to protect the interests of United.<br><br>"Will the Premier League accept our arbitration letters? Litigation can be pursued and, if it has to be pursued, we'll do it.<br><br>"It is up to the FA Premier League to find a way round this exceptional circumstance where a club which has played by the rules has been relegated at the expense of one club who have fielded ineligible players.<br><br>"The simple answer is why not have 21 clubs in the Premiership next season and relegate four of them at the end. It is not my decision to make but it seems like a very simple solution."<br><br>Wigan chairman Dave Whelan has indicated that the disaffected clubs will seek to prove that West Ham's re-registration of Tevez outside the transfer window - and following the independent commission's findings - was illegal.<br><br>However, the Premier League looks unlikely to bow to McCabe's attempts to establish an arbitration panel, with a spokesman underlining the league's belief that no laws have been broken in the controversial row.<br><br>"We followed our processes to the letter and we ensured to our satisfaction that the third party arrangements in relation to Carlos Tevez's contract have been terminated," said a Premier League spokesman.<br><br>"We are more than happy to meet with officials of Sheffield United or any other aggrieved club to offer clarification and explanation of this and we have written to all 20 clubs with a forensic explanation of the ruling."<br><br>Fifa has already pledged to investigate the row which is threatening to drag the relegation issue out over the summer.<br><br>Story Tools:<br>Print Email this page Messageboards<br></div>
