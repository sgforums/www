              <h1>You're finished: Fabio Capello kills off David Beckham's England career... but doesn't bother to tell him first</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Steven Gerrard rescued Fabio Capello from further ridicule on a night
               when the England manager blundered into a storm about David Beckham’s 
              future.</p>
              <p>Gerrard stuck twice in four minutes after Hungary had
               taken a controversial lead at Wembley with a goal which did not cross 
              the line. </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              </div>
              <p>It seemed a cruel twist on England’s World Cup exit in South Africa 
              but Capello’s revelations that Beckham was ‘probably too old’ to be part
               of the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign dominated the friendly win.</p>
              <p>The former captain’s camp knew nothing of the pre-match revelations.</p>
              <p>‘We
               have to look for new players, young players,’ said Capello afterwards, 
              reiterating comments made in a pre-match TV interview before 
              back-tracking to invite Beckham, 35, to win his 116th cap later in the 
              season.</p>
              <p>‘I hope, when David is OK, he can play here in a 
              friendly at Wembley to say bye-bye and thank you very much. I won’t pick
               him for any more competitive games. I change it. We need players for 
              the future.’ </p>

              <p>This swansong idea points at dates in October and November but if the
               midfielder is fit after his achilles injury, he will be playing for LA 
              Galaxy in the MLS play-offs.</p>
              <p>Beckham’s spokesman confirmed 
              there had been no talks about retiring, adding: ‘He will always be 
              available for his country, when fit and if needed he’ll be there.’</p>
              <p>However,
               Capello added: ‘I think David knows he has no future with the national 
              team because we have to change. I have to look for new players. I have 
              to think about the future.’</p>
              <p>Inspirational Gerrard paid tribute
               to Beckham’s 14-year international career. ‘He has legendary status,’ 
              he said. ‘If he’s played his last game, he’ll be missed because, on and 
              off the pitch, he’s a great guy.</p>
              <p>‘But you never know with 
              David. If he hears that news, it’ll drive him on and he’ll try to prove 
              people wrong. He loves playing for England.’ </p>

              </div>
              <p>Capello was impressed by Michael Dawson, Bobby Zamora, Kieran Gibbs 
              and Jack Wilshere, who won their first caps, and praised the efforts of 
              Adam Johnson and Ashley Young.</p>
              <p>Wilshere spent the previous 
              night in hospital with stomach pains. Senior players were booed and 
              Wayne Rooney, without an England goal for 11 months, was jeered when he 
              was replaced by James Milner, reacting with sarcastic applause.</p>
              <p>Capello
               said: ‘I’m sure the fans love Rooney. He’s a really important England 
              player but we have to wait. He’s not in a good moment and has to play 
              more. He’s one of the most important players in the world and the fans 
              want him to make a difference and play really well. He has had 45 
              minutes in one game, 45 in another and 65 minutes<br>tonight. It’s impossible.’</p>

              <h1>David Beckham: I'll NEVER retire from England duty - but Fabio Capello says midfield hero is finished</h1>

              <p>David Beckham insists he has no intention of retiring from 
              international football despite Fabio Capello's assertion that the 
              midfielder's England career is over.</p>
              <p>The Italian believes that at 35 Beckham is 'too old' to resume his England career during the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>Capello
               made the pronouncement in a TV interview before England's 2-1 win 
              against Hungary on Wednesday night - without even speaking to the 
              veteran. But the former Manchester United does not appear ready to go 
              quietly without a fight.</p>

              <p>'I've always said that I won't retire from playing from my country, 
              whether I never get picked again, play one more game or 10 more games,' 
              said Beckham yesterday, just hours before Capello delivered his verdict 
              on the 115-cap hero.</p>

              <p>Speaking at the Home Depot Center, the home of the Los Angeles 
              Galaxy, Beckham tellingly added: 'Some people say at my age, you kind of
               start not loving football as much as when you were 21, but I still do.'</p>
              <p>As
               if to prove his youthfulness, Beckham's recovering from the devastating
               achilles injury he suffered in March is ahead of schedule.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, Capello delivered the cruellest of public snubs to the complete bewilderment of the global icon.</p>
              <p>‘We have to look for new players, young players,’ said Capello to reiterate comments made in a pre-match TV interview before
              back-tracking to invite Beckham, 35, to win his 116th cap later in the

              <p>Beckham
              joined in light training with his Galaxy team-mates and is scheduled to
              travel to New York for Saturday's game against the Red Bulls.</p>
              <p>His 
              passion to play again as soon as possible has been tempered by the 
              reality of his injury. Beckham said:  'Doctors have told me not to rush 
              coming back because if I re-tear it, I won't play again. That kind of 
              stuck in my mind.'</p>

               Todd Dunivant added: 'You don't want to count David out. Anyone that
