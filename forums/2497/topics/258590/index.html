"He is not an old player - he is not a young player but he is not an old player - and he has a very good age and experience and fitness conditions.<br><br>"If he is correct here and keeps his ambition to improve, and I believe so, then everybody is ready to help him become a better player."<br><br>Jose Mourinho was in Africa on a humanitarian mission with Chelsea's global charity partner, Right to Play.</div>
