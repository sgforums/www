              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The club's pre-season hasn't gone to plan so far. They have conceded three goals in each of their four friendlies, hardly the kind of preparation for breaking into the top four. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And the Reds have not qualified for Europe's elite competition since 2009 after they finished second in the Barclays Premier League, four points behind Manchester United. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Our main goal is to qualify for the Champions League. If we don’t it would be a major disappointment,' said Henry. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The club hope this season will put an end to the doom and gloom which had engulfed Anfield at the end of Rafa Benitez's tenure, followed by Roy Hodgson's fractious spell in charge. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Henry has sanctioned a number of high-profile additions to the team with Jordan Henderson, Stewart Downing (£20million), Jordan Henderson (£16m) and Charlie Adam (£9m) all joining this summer. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>They join Luis Suarez and Andy Carroll who arrived in January from Ajax and Newcastle respectively for a combined total of £58m. </span> </p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Jose Enrique will follow Joey Barton and Kevin Nolan out of Newcastle after Liverpool agreed a £10million deal for the Spanish defender.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Enrique will become the second Newcastle player who has used Twitter to criticise the club’s transfer policy in the last week to move on, following the decision to allow Barton to leave on a free transfer. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And his pending departure comes as Newcastle look to become the first club to issue a blanket ban on their players using Twitter.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Enrique trained with the Newcastle first team, who are preparing for their final pre-season game at home to Fiorentina on Saturday.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 25-year-old former Villarreal defender has been a target for Liverpool since the end of last season, and has delayed opening negotiations over a new contract. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool’s need to sign another defender has become clear in their pre-season friendlies, conceding a total of 15 goals against the Chinese side Guangdong Sunray Cave, a Malaysian XI, Hull, Galatasaray and Valerenga of Norway.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Commenting on Monday’s 3-3 draw in Valerenga, central defender Daniel Agger said: ‘It just wasn’t good enough, especially in the first half. We need to show we can keep a clean sheet and we have got to defend better.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘If you are a footballer, you have to be a perfectionist. We are all the same as defenders. So far we just have to admit that (the way we have played) has not been good enough.’</span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Kenny Dalglish is ready to spend again after he admitted Liverpool’s £100million outlay since January has been ‘necessary’ in their bid to become a superpower again.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Liverpool manager unveiled his £43m trio of summer signings Stewart Downing, Jordan Henderson and Charlie Adam, and is set to re-enter the market armed with owner John W Henry’s millions before the season kicks off a week on Saturday.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The new faces follow the £57.3m January acquisitions of Andy Carroll and Luis Suarez, but the manager has unfinished business in this transfer window. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Newcastle defender Jose Enrique will bring Dalglish’s search for a left back to an end when he becomes Liverpool’s next arrival. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Yet, having lost out to Manchester United for Phil Jones in June, Dalglish is also searching for a central defender in the mould of Bolton’s England man Gary Cahill. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Dalglish, speaking at Liverpool’s Melwood training HQ, said: ‘Spending money does not guarantee you success. (But) I don’t know of any football club that has ever had success that has not spent money. So it is necessary. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'But it’s even more important to spend it wisely. We’ve acted responsibly in the transfer market and we’ve also acted responsibly and respectfully with the owners, who have been fantastically supportive during the window. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘If there is a better owner that is as supportive as John W Henry, then they have done very well for themselves because he’s fantastically supportive, a genuinely good fella. </span></p>

              <p><strong>The Spaniard will now travel to Merseyside to discuss personal terms and undergo a medical following weeks of negotiations between the two clubs.</strong></p>
              <p>A statement on Liverpool’s website said: “The club have now been given permission to discuss personal terms with the player, who will travel to Liverpool to undergo a medical.”</p>
              <p>The left-back was in the last year of his contract at St James’ Park and was unwilling to extend his stay on Tyneside despite offers from the club.</p>
              <p>Last month Enrique was fined for comments made on his Twitter page by the Magpies as he attacked the club’s transfer policy in particularly the sales of captain Kevin Nolan and Andy Carroll.</p>
              <p>It now appears he will become the latest high-profile player at Newcastle to leave the team this summer after four years on Tyneside after joining in 2007 from Villarreal for £6.3m.</p>
              <p>The move will be seen as a coup for Kenny Dalglish who has been a long-term admirer of the defender.</p>
              <p>Enrique will become the Reds' fifth summer signing following the captures of Jordan Henderson, Stewart Downing, Charlie Adam and Alexander Doni.</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But a £10million bid is likely to fall short with Stoke valuing him at £18m and adopting a policy of buying rather than selling.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool view £17m as prohibitive but are mindful of Owen Coyle's initial £3.5m offer for striker David Ngog and will try to negotiate.</span></p>

              <p>The Liverpool boss has spent all summer chasing the defender, who is also wanted by Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Dalglish is poised to offer £10million plus striker David Ngog and young hitman Raheem Sterling, 16, on loan to clinch Cahill's signature.</p>

              <p>For now, Pulis is concentrating on reaching the Europa League group stage by beating Swiss side Thun on their plastic pitch.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> have made an £8m offer for the Uruguay international Sebastián Coates but face competition for his signature as </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Nacional" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/nacional"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Nacional</strong></span></a><strong> encourage an auction for the 20-year-old defender.</strong></p>
              <p>Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool's owner, has met the Uruguay champions' current valuation of their 6ft 6in centre-half as they look to provide the manager, Kenny Dalglish, with his sixth summer signing.</p>
              <p>Nacional this week granted permission to Coates's father, Peter, and agent, Matias Pittini, to discuss the terms of the transfer with Liverpool, who remain firm favourites to sign a player whose profile soared during Uruguay's triumphant Copa América campaign last month. "The offer is very good," Héctor Olmos, Nacional's vice-president, told a radio station on Tuesday. "Coates will surely go to Liverpool."</p>
              <p>Nacional, however, are aware of interest from several Premier League teams, including <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a> and Arsenal, as well as from clubs in Italy, Ukraine and throughout South America, and are attempting to hold out for the highest bidder.</p>
              <p>Coates was valued at €3.5m (£3.06m) when talks were held over a proposed move to Porto before the Copa América and Nacional hope City will top Liverpool's bid in the coming days.</p>
              <p>Roberto Mancini, the City manager, has claimed he wants one more signing to follow the impending arrival of Samir Nasri at the Etihad Stadium but club officials have indicated the France international will represent their final purchase in this window and the club has already acquired a central defender this summer in Stefan Savic.</p>
              <p>Coates, who is in Montevideo and believed to be receptive to a move to the Premier League, said: "This week I will talk about offers and decide whether to go or stay here. What I need is continuity so I don't lose my place in the national team. The Premier League?</p>
              <p>"Do not discard any hypothesis. But the president knows what my family and I want. The market is open until 31 August and I won't stop waiting. Certain leagues have already commenced and to go and play at a club that has already started could be a disadvantage."</p>
              <p>Dalglish, meanwhile, has admitted last season's embarrassing Carling Cup exit at home to Northampton Town will influence Liverpool's approach to their second-round tie at Exeter City on Wednesday, although there will be several changes to the side that beat Arsenal on Saturday and there could be a debut for the 16-year-old winger Raheem Sterling.</p>
              <p>"We had a bad result last year against Northampton at home and we'll do our best to avoid another bad result," said the Liverpool manager, who also hopes to sign Craig Bellamy providing City release the Wales forward on a free.</p>
              <p>"We want to do the very best we can in this competition and, although there will be some changes in the personnel we put out, the attitude should be exactly the same as it was on Saturday at the Emirates. We will give people an opportunity to play. The training has been superb, as has their attitude and commitment, so they deserve a game."</p>
              <p>Liverpool have not played in the second round of the Carling Cup since 1999 and, with no European engagements this season, Jamie Carragher admits the competition has assumed added importance at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Carragher said: "Exeter is a massive game for us. We haven't been in the Carling Cup at this stage for a long time. There's no Europe this season so everybody at the club is determined to do as well as we can in the domestic cups."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> have completed the signing of Uruguay defender </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Sebastian Coates</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> from </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Nacional</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The 20-year-old is understood to have been signed for a fee in the region of £7 million (<span class="st">€</span>8m) after impressing during Uruguay’s victorious Copa America campaign, winning the award for the best young player at the tournament in the process.</p>
              <p>The centre-back had attracted reported interest from Tottenham and was understood to have been offered to Arsenal, however it is Liverpool who jumped to the front of the queue and snapped up the highly-rated youngster.</p>
              <p>It was clear the Anfield club were in the market for a centre-back following the extensive links with Phil Jones before he signed for Manchester United and the need for more numbers in that area was solidified when Sotirios Kyrgiakos left for German side Wolfsburg.</p>
              <p>Coates, who has been capped five times for Uruguay's senior side, has joined Liverpool on a long-term contract and the club was able to confirm the signing after the Nacional youth-product passed a medical as well as being granted a work permit.</p>
              <p>Before he makes his debut for his new club, Coates is due to travel to Kiev where Uruguay are set to face the Ukraine in an international friendly on Friday.</p>
