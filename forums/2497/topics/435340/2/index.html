              <p><br>I don't think that's their point, they don't bother at how much one bring in from selling... Cos it's not a compulsory to spend when you sell right?</p>
              <p>They just see how much you keep spending... Just like United didn't spent the lump sum of Ronaldo's transfer fee at once... Or Newcastle hardly even touch the windfall they got from Andy Carroll's fee to Pool...</p>
              <p>Spend. spend, spend seems to suggest how much you keep spending rather than how much you earn right? And to be fair, Pool have spent a lot since the start of this year no?</p>
              <p>And on your "most important thing" statement, I am not too sure if they have trimmed any of the wages as Bellamy's taken over Cole's package... Also we are not too sure if Pool are still footing part of Cole's salary or not as French clubs normally don't pay very high wages... Aquilani is still similar to last season on loan so don't include... same case with Konchesky's too...</p>
              <p>So, maybe only Torres, Poulsen, Ngog, Kyrgiakos, Jovanovic and Meireles I guess... (Estimate about 100, 40, 40, 60, 90, 60= $390k per week) But I don't think they are paid as much to the combine sum of Carroll, Suares, Henderson, Downing, Charlie Adam, Enrique and Coates right?</p>
              <p>Henderson, Downing, Adam these 3 alone could already take up $200k or more. Enrique and Coates together probably $100k... That leave Carroll and Suares... probably 2 of the biggest earners of that lot... </p>
              <p>So I wouldn't be too sure as the jury is still out on this one... But I doubt your last statement could be true base on the estimates agree?</p>

              <p>I don't find Ngog bad at all... There was a time when Rafa was still there, I was actually quite impress with him for a while... Then he fall out of favour again...</p>
              <p>But if you look longer term, Bellamy is already 32... I am not too sure if he can still bring it or at least keep it going on a weekly basis...</p>
              <p>Owen Coyle has a good eye for strikers... Like how he changed Elmander, <span style="color: #000000;">Ivan Klasnic </span>and <span style="color: #000000;">Daniel Sturridge... or even <span style="color: #000000;">Jack Wilshere came to prominence at Bolton.</span></span></p>
              <p>Just a few months ago, Chelsea wanted to get rid of Sturridge when he showed no signs of improvement after so long. They even tried including him as a makeweight in the Torres deal which Kenny refused to take and demand Anelka instead... 6 months later, how much his stock has increased?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea won't even consider including him in the Meireles deal now even though it is said Kenny now wants him and reject Benayoun... In the end, Chelsea just do a straight cash rather than lose Sturridge... Ngog could very well be the next Sturridge while Bellamy will just fade away very fast for a player at 32 whose strong point is his speed... Anyway, it seems Kenny is having doubts on $35m Carroll though when you bring a 32 yrs old to help out...</span></p>
