              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>FERNANDO TORRES shot down Chelsea’s hopes of a £50million raid and insisted: I want to become an Anfield legend. The Liverpool striker fired 32 goals in his first year in England after a club record £21.5m move from Atletico Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">It sparked claims Chelsea were preparing to test the nerve of Anfield’s power brokers with a world record swoop. But the Spanish hitman, now preparing to lead his country’s bid for Euro 2008 glory, has no plans to pack his bags.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Torres, 24, said: “I feel very confident here. This is my team, my city and Anfield is my pitch. I feel very good. “This was only my first season at Liverpool and I want to play better for many more yet. I’ve only had one good one and I’m very proud of the comparisons, but now is not the moment. “It’s very important for me to make the fans happy. We play football to give them enjoyment. I think they love me and I love them.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Torres has become a Kop cult hero — but the man himself thinks comparisons with greats like Kenny Dalglish, Robbie Fowler and Steven Gerrard are way too soon. He added: “I was with Kenny Dalglish the other week and you could see on people’s faces how much of a hero he is. I want everyone to remember me in 20 years’ time.”</p>

              <h1>Tom Hicks: Fernando Torres is not for sale</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="story">Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks has told Chelsea to forget about making any move for Spanish striker Fernando Torres.</p>
              <p class="story">Despite sacking manager Avram Grant on Saturday, Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich was reported yesterday to be planning to lure the Israeli's transfer targets to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p class="story">The 24-year-old Liverpool forward, who scored 33 goals in his first season since a £23 million move from Atletico Madrid last summer, is a priority and Abramovich is reported to be prepared to offer a world record £50 million to sign Torres.</p>
              <p class="story">With Liverpool's future ownership still uncertain, Chelsea's strategy may assume that such an offer would be impossible to turn down.</p>
              <p class="story">But Hicks told The Daily Telegraph in an email yesterday that no amount of money could persuade them to part company with Torres.</p>
              <p class="story">"We would never consider it," he said.</p>
              <p class="story">Whether Hicks remains in charge to keep his promise on Torres remains to be seen. Liverpool's future ownership hinges on whether his partner, George Gillett, sells out to Dubai International Capital.</p>
              <p class="story">Hicks has said he will block Gillett from cashing in on his 50 per cent stake. But DIC remain confident that the Texan businessman may back down eventually, or that he may have to sell out himself.</p>
