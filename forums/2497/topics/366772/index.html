              <p class="imageCaption">Back in harness: former England partners Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney will both reap benefits</p>
              </div>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1197397" rel="1197397|3| nofollow" href="/sport/football/article-1197397/If-Owen-s-fit-like-cavalry-arriving-goals.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>For everybody, this is a move that works. For Michael Owen, for Sir Alex Ferguson, for Fabio Capello, for Wayne Rooney, for Manchester United, for England. There is no loser here because it is a gamble that the club can well afford.</strong></p>
              <p>If it comes off, there are dividends never previously imagined; if it does not, all sides are merely back where they started.</p>
              <p>The worst that can happen is that Manchester United do not win a fourth title but, having lost Cristiano Ronaldo, the player that provided the bulk of their goals, it could well have worked out like that anyway. Certainly, Ferguson will see this acquisition as one that gives him a greater chance, rather than the raising of the flag of surrender.</p>
              <p>It is a coup from left field that will surprise and disquiet in equal measure. Face it, what defender would truly enjoy facing a fit, firing Owen in a Manchester United shirt next season? If Ferguson can restore him to former glories, there will be no finer goalscorer in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>There are benefits for all here because, despite his eagerness to accept the challenge, Rooney was never going to fill the hole left by Ronaldo's departure. Do the maths. Ronaldo scored 67 goals in two seasons for United, Rooney scored 38, so to pick up the slack he would not have to score another 29 because that total does not include the goals he scored in the first place.</p>
              <p>To compensate fully for Ronaldo's departure, Rooney would need both totals, making 105 in two seasons, substantially above the amount that elevated Ronaldo to the status of the most expensive player in football history. It was never going to happen. Help was required. And what a fit Owen represents is the cavalry coming over the hill with a reinforcement of goals.</p>
              <p>The sums will have been the worry for Ferguson. Losing Ronaldo the player will have hurt, but it is when his goals were removed from the equation that Ferguson would have realised United's numbers no longer added up. And while a player such as Karim Benzema has more potential than a 29-year-old with a recent history of injury problems (and who no longer holds down a place in an international squad that finds room for Carlton Cole), most foreign players take a season to acclimatise to English football.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has no time for that. He needs a man who will hit the ground running, which Owen will, if fit. Even if he scores at the rate of his previous two seasons with Newcastle United, which have been dismissed as failures, he will be a vast improvement on the departing favourite, Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p>Owen scored 23 goals in 62 games in a poor Newcastle team, at a ratio of one every 2.69 games. Tevez scored 34 in 99 games in a magnificent Manchester United team, a rate of 2.97. Last season, his ratio was 3.4.</p>
              <p>There are other, more troubling, statistics, of course, not least Owen's record with Rooney at international level, which suggests incompatibility. It is said that Owen requires an inferior as a foil, doing the work so he can score the goals. And it is true that the statistics suggest he fares better with Emile Heskey, although the same can be said of Rooney, too.</p>
              <p>It is a different Owen that United are signing, though. It is not the player who must have assumed he was first on England's teamsheet at his peak and that the rest had to work to feed him.</p>
              <p>This is a man whose pride has been hurt and who is being kept out of the England squad by Darren Bent and Gabriel Agbonlahor. A man who must, in World Cup year, demonstrate that he can be effective with Rooney, now established as uppermost in Capello's thoughts. He was never going to get that chance and now it has fallen in his lap; right now, there should be no more willing team player than Owen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/03/article-0-0596CF3D000005DC-281_233x275.jpg" alt="Rooney and Owen" width="233" height="275"></div>
              <p><strong>As for Capello, this is a big slice of luck . It has been falsely presumed that he is not an admirer of Owen. This is not the case. </strong></p>
              <p>He immediately identified his limitations as a player, and his style did not fit naturally into England's team shape. Therefore, he has been happy to try other options while Owen has been in indifferent form for Newcastle. He does know, however, the worth of a predatory goalscorer in a tournament.</p>
              <p>Owen may still be an impact substitute rather than a starting player but having tried out a series of strikers who are plainly not world class, there is no doubt that, fit and scoring for a major team, he would be very much back in Capello's thoughts. Also, to forge a relationship with Rooney would take his worth to the England manager to a new level.</p>
              <p>So it makes sense all round that Owen should sign for Manchester United. And it proves one more thing. That the daft brochure hawking a great player like he was a new line at Boden's remains one of the most misguided, chuckleheaded events in the field of sports management.</p>
              <p>The best advertisement for Owen was always the player, not the image or the brand. He scores goals. Lots of goals. And a good judge like Ferguson was never in need of a catalogue to remind him.</p>

              <h1>England boss Fabio Capello believes Manchester United can rejuvenate Michael Owen’s career</h1>
              <div id="article-body">
              <div class="art-o art-align-left"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/jul2009/3/5/michael-owen-pic-ap-831840750.jpg" border="0" alt="Michael Owen (Pic:AP)" width="450" height="306"></div>
              <div class="art-o art-align-left">.</div>
              <div class="art-o art-align-left">.</div>
              <div class="art-o art-align-left">.</div>
              <p><strong>Fabio Capello believes Manchester United can rejuvenate Michael Owen’s career – and give England a huge World Cup boost. Owen has been the forgotten man of England since Capello took charge, restricted to just one 45-minute run-out against France in March 2008. But the England boss feels the striker’s shock switch to Old Trafford can breathe new life into Owen and hand him a better chance of leading the country to glory in South Africa next summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Capello will monitor him intensively next season, looking for signs that Sir Alex Ferguson has indeed pulled off a master-stroke by bringing the 29-year-old to United just as it appeared he was running out of options. Capello remains to be convinced that Owen really can recapture the form and sharpness that made him a crucial member of the national squad from France 98 onwards.</p>
              <p>The England boss does, however, feel that if anybody can unlock the talent within Owen, it is Fergie. And if Owen consistently finds the back of the net for United, that will put him back into the World Cup equation.</p>
              <p>Capello has told close friends that he views the move as a very positive development both for the player and England, hoping that a refocused Owen can bring him an unexpected bonus in World Cup year.</p>
              <p>But the Italian will expect to see a dramatic improvement in the star’s play after he appeared lost and listless as Newcastle’s survival hopes withered and died. If the improvement happens, then Capello is ready to give the striker the chance to close in on Sir Bobby Charlton’s record of 49 goals and play in his fourth World Cup.</p>
              <p>However, he will expect Owen to show more humility than he did in Paris. Capello recognises Owen’s international record – he has 40 goals in 89 matches – but  the coach has never hidden his misgivings over the front-runner’s all-round contribution. His view was simple – if Owen did not score then England were effectively playing with 10 men.</p>
              <div class="advert">
              <p>That perception seemed more than harsh, but Capello had an extra reason for his approach. He believed the rest of the squad had developed a dependency complex, feeling that if “Mo” was not available to bail them out, nobody could deliver the goals required. That thinking clearly irked Owen, who vented his frustrations after his half-time substitution in Paris.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Owen said: “You had better ask the manager what he is trying to achieve. You ask him. “In terms of what he is trying to do, you’d best ask him. Every player wants to play but for now I’m not. I am sure he has seen me play before.”</p>
              <p>Owen’s subsequent pull-out, citing illness when he was seen enjoying himself at Chester races, for the summer friendlies with the USA and Trinidad and Tobago, was a massive own goal, reinforcing Capello’s initial instincts. But as England romped through their World Cup qualifying campaign without Owen, Capello was ready to let bygones be bygones. After all, take away Wayne Rooney, and how many world class strikers do England have? Not many. Not any, probably, with Emile Heskey an unlikely line leader and Capello having doubts about Peter Crouch, Jermain Defoe and Gabriel Agbonlahor.</p>
              <p>Had Owen started and scored for Newcastle in either of their last two Premier League games against Fulham and Aston Villa, he would have been recalled for the summer games against Kazakhstan and Andorra.</p>
              <p>The fact that Toon boss Alan Shearer left him out, giving Owen just 24 minutes at Villa Park, gave Capello little option but to omit him again. It looked as if the one-time emblem of English football was seeing his career peter out. All that changed when Ferguson made first contact.</p>
              <p>Expect to see Capello at Old Trafford very early next term.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Owen will be a more lethal Manchester United marksman than Carlos Tevez.</strong></p>
              <p>That’s the opinion of former England boss Glenn Hoddle.</p>
              <p>Many United fans were angry to see Tevez leave their club and astounded by the recruitment of free agent Owen. But Hoddle said: “It is a superb bit of business by Sir Alex Ferguson. I’m convinced it could be the shrewdest signing of the summer. If Michael can stay relatively fit and be involved in 30 or so games, he can be better for United in front of goal than Tevez. The way United play will suit Michael down to the ground.”</p>
              <p>Hoddle gave Owen his senior England debut in 1998.  He progressed to one of the greatest moments of his career – his wonder goal against Argentina in the World Cup finals that summer.</p>
              <p>Hoddle said: “Possession football and a lot of chances, it couldn’t be better for him.</p>
              <p>“At United he won’t be the focal point of the team. He will have the likes of Rooney, Berbatov and Valencia around him. They are match-winners as well. He will thrive at United.”</p>
              <p>Hoddle is confident that it will be another transfer coup by Ferguson just as Eric Cantona, Teddy Sheringham and Henrik Larsson were.</p>
              <p>They were all surprise sorties into the transfer market by the United boss – and all paid a handsome dividend.</p>
              <p>“I am sure Michael will be the same,” said Hoddle.</p>
