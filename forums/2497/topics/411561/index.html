              <p> </p>
              <p><strong> </strong><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1314047" rel="1314047|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1314047/Burnley-1-Bolton-Wanderers-0-Turf-luck-Coyle-Wanderers-knocked-Wades-stunner.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Owen Coyle endured a torrid time on and off the pitch as Burnley fans vented their fury at him just as forcibly as he feared they might on his return to Turf Moor on Tuesday night.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">All the match programme pleas for Coyle's sterling deeds as Turf Moor boss to be remembered predictably fell on deaf ears as he was barracked mercilessly for defecting to Burnley's vanquished Carling Cup opponents. </span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="font-size: small;">If the noise from the sidelines was deafening, viewing events on the pitch was hardly any more palatable for Coyle, as Bolton were run ragged at times and crashed out to a close-range 45th-minute Wade Elliott goal. </span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Mark Clattenburg bizarrely pointed to the spot, despite keeper Adam Bogdan being the player trying to claw the ball back, but any confusion was swept away as the referee's assistant signalled the ball had crossed the line.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Bolton could have few grumbles, after seeing an inspired Chris Eagles and Jay Rodriguez hit the frame of the goal, and Coyle, gallingly, was forced to see out the final few minutes to strains of 'Judas, Judas, what's the score?'</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/09/21/article-1314047-0B4ABC97000005DC-74_634x354.jpg" alt="High flyer: Wade Elliott scores the winner" width="634" height="354">

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Coyle had one cause for complaint, claiming Chris Iwelumo handled to set up Elliott's winner.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'It was like a volleyball punch, and that's why I approached the referee at half-time,' he said. 'It was disappointing to lose in that manner, but it was a terrific tie. You could say my return gave it some added spice, but after the initial fuss, I can honestly say all my focus was on the game and I was aware of nothing other than a general background noise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Anyway, in the area I grew up in (the Gorbals in Glasgow), you have to fight tooth and nail for everything you get and not let a few names bother you. I know exactly what I did for this club, and nothing can take away the special times. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'For two years, I was a hero. Now I seem to be the villain, but I'll never say anything negative about Burnley. They are passionate fans, and I always thrived on that, so I can't moan when it comes back to bite you on the behind.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">A mere dozen or so fans were on hand to jeer Coyle when he climbed off the Bolton team bus, but the reception was altogether more hostile when he followed the teams onto the pitch shortly before kick-off. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Boos rang round the ground every step of the way from tunnel to technical area. Eight stewards formed a protective ring round him, but the Bolton manager remained undaunted as he passed up the chance to disappear inside the dug-out and, instead, stood defiantly in front of it. </span></p>
