It was a protest at the latest imposition by a demanding coach, Juande Ramos, but it was an oddly understated, respectful one.<br><br>The players registered their thoughts but none would actually speak out. Ramos commanded too much respect and if the burden was heavy, the squad recognised there was a reason. Sevilla have won five trophies in 15 months - statistically they are the world's best club.</strong><br><br>Sevilla have won two Uefa Cups and the Copa del Rey and taken a first Champions League place. They made a challenge on the Spanish title that ended on the final day of last season. They play fast, attacking football of which Ramos is particularly proud. Not bad for a club that won nothing in over half a century, with a budget one 10th of Real Madrid's. Yet when Real sacked Fabio Capello and while the Barcelona board deliberated over Frank Rijkaard, one of the few names not thrown into the ring was that of Ramos.<br><br>Sevilla twice finished fifth before Ramos took them a step further. His reading of opponents, says Julen Lopetegui, who played under him at Rayo, is second to none. "He is the most intelligent I have played under, a genius at analysing the situation and then using the arms he has at his disposal to change the situation. In each game he makes four or five tactical decisions which prove to be decisive."<br><br>Ramos is no dour, tactical coach. His sides play with speed and width, wingers complemented by attacking full-backs. "He loves to get the ball into the penalty area early, after five or six touches," says the former Bolton striker Salva Ballesta, who played under Ramos at MÃ¡laga. "He is the best coach I have worked with. I would highlight his professionalism. He makes the players work with a huge physical and psychological intensity. His sessions are extremely demanding but he manages to make them fun.<br><br>"He is distant with the footballers but has their respect and their affection. He is not a guy who goes round beaming smiles. Maybe if he had been more media-friendly, he could have got a job at Madrid or Barcelona. But make no mistake, if Spurs sign him they will be signing a star."<br><br></div>
