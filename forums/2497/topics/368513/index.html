              <h1>Manchester United Boss Sir Alex Ferguson: Liverpool And England Did Not Protect Michael Owen</h1>
              <h2>Sir Alex has criticised the way his new recruit was handled in his formative years, stating that he would have done things differently...</h2>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></span><strong> has stated he would have handled </strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Michael Owen</strong></span><strong> differently during the early stages of his career, in order to avoid future injury problems. <br></strong><br>Owen is currently with the Manchester United squad in Malaysia, where he rose to fame after three goals in four games for the England U-20 squad in 1997.<br><br>However, speaking ahead of United's first pre-season game against a Malaysian XI, Ferguson explained that too much pressure was subsequently put on Owen, both at club and international level.<br><br>He told the press, "We had Ronnie Wallwork and John Curtis playing in that England Under-20 squad in Malaysia in 1997 and when they came back we gave them six weeks off.<br><br>"But Michael went straight into the Liverpool first team then a year later was playing in the World Cup for England. That was unfair to a young player to have that kind of strain and intensity one summer after another.<br><br>"I wouldn’t have done that but he was such a talent that Liverpool needed him in the team and then England needed him in the World Cup.”<br><br>Ferguson then once again expressed his confidence in Owen's ability to score goals at the highest level, continuing, "Experience is vital and I know Michael will score a lot of goals for us.<br><br>"He will give us experience in the penalty box. That is what he has been great at for years.”</p>
