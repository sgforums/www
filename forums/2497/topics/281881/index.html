Only if the foul on Patrice Evra was not even deemed worthy of a booking could Chelsea possibly succeed.<br><br>It leaves Terry and the FA in an embarrassing situation, particularly after the controversy that erupted in the wake of last season's encounter at Tottenham, when the Chelsea skipper clashed with referee Graham Poll.<br><br>If found guilty, the FA will again have to take a hard line against the captain of the national team.<br><br>Dean has withdrawn from his Carling Cup duties Â— where he was due to take charge of Tuesday's match between West Bromwich and Cardiff Â— with an injury collected at Old Trafford. It is his decision to pull out.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Where else have we seen a player grabbing the referee's hand, holding on to his card when he was about to flash it... Only Terry does this, he thinks he is quite a big shot now that he is England's captain... I have mentioned this before and some here came out with the reason that he was only defending his team... But i belief he has gone over-board a number of times already since he became England's captain. His punishment last season was so minimun that he probably thought that he could now get away with anything cos he is England's captain...<br><br>I guess he felt that he was big enough in status to had a go at mourinho too when he questioned his recent form... Anyway, i never felt Terry was a top defender when it comes to defending... only a decent one that can score once in a while and was always lucky to have players like Gallas, Carvalho and Rio to cover his short-comings... But now while Carvalho is out, he only have Ben Haim and Alex who have expose his defending short-comings...<br><br>I think its wasn't much of a surprise that jose questioned his form... I think Terry played a major part in Chelsea's recent bad run even while Jose was still there... Lost to Villa, Draw at home to Blackburn and even worse Rosenberg... It was Terry's poor man marking that led to Rosenberg's goal and Tevez's too.</div>
