            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Knight pleads innocence</strong><br><br>New signing Zat Knight has pleaded his innocence after being 'inadvertently' caught up in a drugs raid at his home.<br><br>Knight was arrested with his brother at the family home in Birmingham just hours before he was paraded as Villa's new Â£3.5million signing but the player says he is completely innocent.<br><br>The defender was taken to the police station and had to answer questions but it is expected no further action will be taken against him.<br><br>"I have done nothing wrong," Knight revealed. "The police said they had to bring me to a station, and they were just doing their job, so I co-operated with them - I was in a police cell for about five minutes and no more than that.<br><br>"I got into a police car with them because the area was congested but the police officers were good as gold, and I understand they were just doing their job.<br><br>"I just answered some questions and then the police dropped me at home. I haven't spoken to the other members of my family about it."<br><br>Aston Villa spokesman Phil Mepham said: "At no point was Zat ever considered to be a suspect but because he was caught up in the inquiry he was, as a matter of course, detained for questioning. His conduct throughout was described by the police as exemplary and no charges were made and none are expected."</div>
