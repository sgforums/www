              <p><strong>MILAN, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Los Angeles Galaxy have rejected AC
              Milan's first offer for David Beckham, the Italian club's chief
              executive Adriano Galliani said on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 33-year-old England midfielder is on loan at Milan until
              March 9 but has said he wants to stay with the Serie A team
              permanently.</p>
              <p>"We made an offer to Galaxy which they have not accepted,"
              Galliani told Sky television at Milan's home league game with
              Reggina.</p>
              <p>"For now we are a long way apart but there is still a month
              to go," he added without going into details about the offer.</p>
              <p>For technical reasons Beckham's loan is actually until June,
              meaning Milan can talk to Galaxy outside of the transfer window
              which closed last Monday.</p>
              <p>However, there is a written agreement that he goes back to
              the U.S. in March.</p>
              <p>The Galaxy have said Beckham will return to Los Angeles as
              scheduled unless Milan come up with a substantially higher
              offer.</p>
              <p>"If David ultimately is an asset for this team, we want him
              back," Tim Leiweke, chief executive of AEG, the entertainment
              conglomerate that owns the Galaxy, told the Los Angeles Times on
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>"If David ultimately has a hunger and a desire to come help
              us make the impact on the pitch that we wanted to make with him
              but haven't done yet, then he's an important member of this team
              and our intention is to bring him back.</p>
              <p><strong>GALAXY COMPENSATION</strong></p>
              <p>"Clearly, if David's in a position where he wants to finish
              the season in Milan and Milan in turn compensates the Galaxy so
              that we can suffer no damages to our fans or to our team, then
              we'll take a look at it.</p>
              <p>"But we have made it very clear to them that we expect David
              back here March 9. They agree and understand we own the
              contract. They understand the only way we do this is if, when
              this is all said and done, the Galaxy benefits.</p>
              <p>"If the Galaxy comes out better without David than with
              David, then we'll take a look at it."</p>
              <p>Former England captain Beckham joined the Galaxy in 2007 on
              a five-year deal as part of an orchestrated bid to lift American
              soccer to a new level.</p>
              <p>Two unsuccessful seasons later, however, he has set his
              sights on a permanent move to Italy to help him play one more
              World Cup with England in South Africa next year.</p>
              <p>After scoring just five goals for the Galaxy in 30 games
              since his arrival in Major League Soccer (MLS), Beckham has
              remembered what it is like to play soccer in the top flight.</p>
              <p>"We understand his infatuation with playing on (one of) the
              world's most popular club teams and we understand his trying to
              mentally get around the idea of coming back to play with a team
              that didn't make the playoffs in MLS last year," Leiweke said.</p>
              <p>"That said, David and us actually are talking. He has never
              forced our hand on anything. David has made it very clear that
              if our decision is to bring him back here, he will return.
              Period."</p>
