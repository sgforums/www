              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>The Football Association is to implement a new initiative aimed at improving the behaviour of players and coaches.</strong></p>
              <p>The Respect campaign will be launched across all
              levels of the game and the FA has set out guidelines in an attempt to
              stamp out some of the unsavoury scenes that have become more
              commonplace in recent seasons.</p>
              <p>From now on only the captain will
              be allowed to approach the referee, while all players will be asked to
              adhere to basic codes of conduct.</p>
              <p>Referees have been told to deal
              firmly with any show of dissent, while measures have also been taken to
              stop spectators impeding other officials.</p>
              <p>Respect will be applied
              by the FA in partnership with the Premier League, Football League, PFA,
              LMA and PGMO (referees body) at professional game level, and with
              County FAs and regional leagues at grassroots level.</p>
              <h4>Four steps</h4>
              <p>The programme is championing four practical steps which grassroots leagues will be invited to sign up to:</p>
              <p><strong>1. </strong>Codes
              of Conduct for players, referees, coaches and spectators. The codes of
              conduct set down basic principles which everyone must accept and adhere
              to, with related actions for repeated breaches.</p>
              <p><strong>2. </strong>Designated
              Spectator's Area demarcated by touchline barriers, keeping spectators
              about two metres back from the pitch. This allows the assistant
              referees to perform their function unimpeded, and in the pilot scheme
              has demonstrated a marked restraining effect on spectator behaviour.
              Spectators will be on the opposite touchline to the coaches.</p>
              <p><strong>3. </strong>Captain taking responsibility.</p>
              <p>While
              the captain does not have any special privileges under the Laws of the
              Game, captains will be expected to take on more responsibility for the
              conduct of their team. The captain will act as the main contact point
              for the referee, and will be called over to an incident involving a
              team-mate even if he/she is some distance away.</p>
              <p><strong>4. </strong>Referee managing the game.</p>
              <p>Referees
              have been instructed to work with captains to manage the players and
              the game effectively. They have also been reminded of their
              responsibility to control the game by applying the Laws of the Game and
              dealing firmly with any open show of dissent by players. The
              instruction to referees is to stay and deal with dissent rather than
              moving away.</p>
              <h5>Toolkit</h5>
              <p>Leagues are encouraged to opt into the programme by adopting the "Respect toolkit" provided by The FA. This includes:</p>
              <p>Guidance notes on the operation of the Respect steps, with versions tailored specifically to clubs, leagues, and referees.</p>
              <p>Order forms for obtaining touchline barriers at a specially negotiated rate</p>
              <p>Codes of conduct</p>
              <p>Captain's guidance leaflets and Respect armbands</p>
              <h5>Community Shield</h5>
              <p>The
              programme will be launched at this Sunday's Community Shield between
              Manchester United and Portsmouth and a number of steps have been agreed
              with the sides:</p>
              <p>Referee managing the game (applying the Laws of the Game)</p>
              <p>Captain taking responsibility</p>
              <p>Pre-match briefing meeting with referee and managers/captain</p>
              <p>Team handshake before kick-off</p>
              <p>Improved behaviour in the technical area</p>
              <p>Both
              teams and the referees will wear Respect T-shirts during the warm-up
              and the match shirts will feature Respect on the sleeve badges.</p>
              <p>FA chief executive Brian Barwick said: "The Respect programme is a top priority for The FA and for the game as a whole.</p>
              <p>"We
              are trying to change a climate within the game and that takes time, but
              I am confident that this joint commitment will make a real difference.</p>
              <p>"The
              promotional film will really help raise awareness of this important
              issue - it needs everyone to look at their own behaviour."</p>
