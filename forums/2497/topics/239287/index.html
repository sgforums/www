            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">A late goal from Cristiano Ronaldo handed Manchester United a barely deserved 2-1 win at Fulham.<br><br>The Cottagers were much the better side for long spells of the contest and led through Brian McBride's goal on 17 minutes.<br><br>Ryan Giggs netted a leveller on 29 minutes and the points looked set to be shared, only for Ronaldo to pop up with a deflected finish three minutes from time to take The Red Devils nine points clear of Chelsea.<br><br>Fulham came out like a side looking to shake off the effects of last week's defeat to Tottenham and Alexei Smertin and Papa Bouba Diop laid down early markers with shots on goal.<br><br>Simon Davies looked filled with purpose as he made a number of decent runs down the right early on and sent a dipping volley just wide of goal with Edwin van der Sar beaten.<br><br>The Premiership leaders took 11 minutes to fashion an opening, but Nemanja Vidic's header from a corner was no threat to Jan Lastuvka's goal.<br><br>Manchester United's early efforts were extremely lacklustre and Fulham secured the opening goal their play merited on 17 minutes.<br><br>United contributed to their own downfall as Vidic and Van der Sar got their wires crossed and McBride showed excellent composure to slot a shot in off a post from ten yards with the retreating Vidic and Rio Ferdinand unable to effect a clearance.<br><br>United were in dire need of some inspiration and after Ronaldo had fired a shot just wide they found some from their captain Giggs.<br><br>The Welshman, who was handed the armband due to Gary Neville's absence, was picked out superbly by Wayne Rooney and he did justice to the fine cross by volleying home from a tight angle.<br><br>Fulham's response was positive, as McBride headed wide and Carlos Bocanegra shot weakly towards goal after a loose ball fell his way in the box.<br><br>Despite being way below their optimum, United should really have had their noses in front before the break as Patrice Evra dragged a shot wide of goal after latching onto a loose ball in the area.<br><br>Fulham's start to the second half mirrored their efforts of the opening 45 minutes and it took a fantastic one-handed save from Van der Sar to deny Davies who had shown great skill to turn and volley towards the bottom corner.<br><br>Van der Sar was a spectator on 52 minutes as Michael Brown whipped in a superb cross to the far post and Tomasz Radzinski thudded a header against the crossbar.<br><br>United were cut open just past the hour mark as Davies collected a neat pass and strode into the box, but the Welshman found Van der Sar the equal of his powerful drive and the Dutch keeper was also able to clasp the follow-up effort.<br><br>Van der Sar certainly merited his match fee against his former club and McBride was the next Fulham player to find the keeper in excellent form, as his low shot which was destined for the bottom corner was clasped by the big Dutchman.<br><br>United finally exerted some pressure on the Fulham goal in the final 15 minutes and Ronaldo nicked a winner with two minutes left on the clock.<br><br>The Portuguese collected a ball on the left and skipped inside Philippe Christanval and fired a shot beyond Lastuvka with the aid of a deflection.<br><br>There was still drama in the last minute as Van der Sar appeared to fell Heidar Helguson in the box, but referee Peter Walton waved away Fulham's appeals as United claimed the points.<br></span></div>
