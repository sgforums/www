              <p class="article-icon-links-container"> </p>
              <p><strong>Roy Keane will today be named manager of Ipswich Town and given massive funds to take the club back to the Barclays Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>The Portman Road hierarchy wanted a new man in place for the final two games of<br>the season after sacking Jim Magilton yesterday. Keane’s box-office appeal, together with a track record of winning the Championship, which he achieved with Sunderland two years ago, made him the choice of Ipswich owner Marcus Evans and new chief executive Simon Clegg.</p>
              <p>Last night, 37-year-old Keane accepted Ipswich’s offer after being given assurances that he will be allowed the freedom to do the job his own way, without interference from the board.</p>
              <p>After quitting Sunderland just before Christmas, Keane complained that Ellis Short, the club’s majority shareholder, had meddled in team matters. Keane, who will move from Cheshire to East Anglia, might be alarmed by the way his new employers handled the departure of Magilton, given that Evans sacked him over the phone yesterday.</p>
              <p>Magilton, 39, had been manager at Portman Road almost three years and paid the price for failing to make the play-offs this season despite significant investment in the squad.</p>
              <p>Now Keane will have the task of deciding which of the 15 players out of contract in the summer will be awarded a new deal. Clegg, the former chief executive of the British Olympic Association who only took up his post on Monday, said: ‘We want a winner. We have been speaking to a number of people with proven track records.’</p>
              <p>Magilton’s No 2 John Gorman, the former England assistant manager, has also left.</p>

              <p><strong>Bryan Klug, first-team coach under Magilton, was yesterday put in temporary charge but Keane may step in for Saturday’s trip to Cardiff and Ipswich’s last game of the season at home to Coventry on May 3. Tony Loughlan, who was part of Keane’s Sunderland staff, is expected to rejoin him at Ipswich.</strong></p>
              <p>After leaving Sunderland, Keane made it clear that he would not work anywhere without a large degree of autonomy. ‘It started with a demand to know where I had been the previous day, that he wanted me available at all times,’ Keane said<br>earlier this year about the conversations with Short which preceded his departure from the Stadium of Light.</p>

              <p><strong>Ipswich have appointed former Sunderland boss Roy Keane
                                      on a two-year deal.</strong></p>
              <p>The Championship side dismissed Jim Magilton on Wednesday after
                                      nearly three years in charge after the club failed to challenge for
                                      promotion this season.</p>
              <p>And, after chief executive Simon Clegg confirmed the club wanted
                                      a manager with a proven track record at this level, Keane has
                                      accepted the challenge of taking the club into the top flight.</p>
              <p>“I truly believe that I am joining a club that has the
                                      potential, ambition and infrastructure to once again be a Premier
                                      League side,” Keane said.</p>
              <p>“The club’s owner and chief executive impressed upon me their
                                      total focus on achieving this quest at the earliest opportunity and
                                      I can’t wait to get started.”</p>
              <p>Owner Marcus Evans added: “I am delighted Roy has agreed to join
                                      us and we are completely aligned in our ambitions for Ipswich
                                      Town.</p>
              <p>“He has extensive contacts in the game and is a proven winner
                                      who encourages his team to play the attractive football that
                                      Ipswich Town fans have come to expect.</p>
              <p>“I believe he is the right man to take this club to where we
                                      want to be – The Premier League.”</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Both feet first: Keane marked the start of his Ipswich career with some more forthright opinions</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1172990" rel="1172990|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1172990/Keane-warpath-snipe-loser-Hughes-Sunderland-chief.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Roy Keane stunned the football world on his first day back in management on Thursday with a wide-ranging attack on his former team-mates and his old club.</p>
              <p>Keane, who has signed a two-year contract with Ipswich, picked out Manchester United's Double winners Mark Hughes and Steve Bruce.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Until an ex-team-mate of mine from that 1994 team goes on and really achieves something then I would not agree they are successful managers.</p>
              <p>'Sparky and Brucey have not won a trophy, have they? They have the potential.'</p>
              <p>Keane also claimed he left <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/sunderland.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Sunderland </span></a>because majority shareholder Ellis Short began meddling in 'team affairs'. He said: 'One of the big conditions I had when I went to Sunderland was that there would be no interference with team affairs.</p>
              <p>'When someone tries to move the goalposts, it has nothing to do with contracts, it is about a promise with people at the club. You have to be relaxed and have trust in the people you are working with. I told them 5,000 times not to interfere.'</p>
              <p>He also launched a vicious barb at former Ireland team-mate Tony Cascarino, who said in print Keane would never get another managerial job after resigning from Sunderland. Keane said: 'The day I worry about him will be a very sad day in my life.'</p>
              <p>Ipswich have 15 players out of contract this summer and they fear a snap judgment from their new boss.</p>
              <p>Text messages have been bouncing between Suffolk and Wearside since Keane's appointment and, despite the Irishman promising patience after acting too rashly at Sunderland, this one summed up the mood: 'I'm out of contract this summer, Roy's coming. Get me out of here!'</p>
              <p>Keane was not worried about his reputation. He added: 'Whatever people say about me, I am comfortable about myself.'</p>
