              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>Andre Villas-Boas has identified Jack Rodwell as the first major brick in rebuilding his Chelsea team and is confident he will land the Everton midfielder next month.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Chelsea manager needs to add youth as well as quality to his ageing side and, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>understands, he sees the 20-year-old England international as a key part of the process.</span></p>
              <p><span>While Everton are sure to demand around £20million for a player who recently made his breakthrough on the international stage, Chelsea are expected to start the bidding nearer £12m.</span></p>
              <p><span>Sources at Goodison Park already believe Rodwell is Stamford Bridge-bound and question whether he will appear in an Everton shirt again, given his latest injury setback.</span></p>
              <p><span>Since impressing for England against Spain and  Sweden last month, he has played only 27 minutes of Barclays Premier League football. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>He will miss Everton’s Christmas fixtures against Swansea and Sunderland after suffering fresh damage to a recently  sustained hamstring problem. He was on the bench for  Everton’s 1-1 draw with Norwich on Saturday but aggravated his injury in the warm-up.</span></p>
              <p><span>

              <p><span>Everton manager David Moyes said: ‘I got told just before kick-off that even if I needed Jack he wouldn’t be able to go on because he felt it in the warm-up. If he felt it against Norwich, I would think he wouldn’t be available for Wednesday night.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>The problem is not expected to deter Villas-Boas, however. Despite a difficult first half of the season, the Portuguese appears to have the backing of Roman Abramovich in making some important changes next month.</span></p>
              <p><span>As <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>revealed last month, Bolton’s Gary Cahill is another player on his shopping list and someone who would certainly be a useful addition to the Chelsea squad given the defensive problems they have endured and the fact that Alex has been told he is no longer required.</span></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/12/19/article-2076329-0EB4834600000578-795_306x423.jpg" alt="Poster boy: Rodwell wants to compete at the London Olympics" width="306" height="423">

              </div>
              <p><span>Rodwell is perhaps more interesting. Fabio Capello seems to think he has a bright future with England and he would provide Villas-Boas with a useful option at a time when the Chelsea team, and in particular the midfield, is in transition. </span></p>
              <p><span>A new midfield has developed in recent weeks, with Oriol Romeu, Ramires and Raul  Meireles forming a decent unit. </span></p>
              <p><span>But beyond those three  Villas-Boas clearly has concerns. Frank Lampard is 33 and no longer able to command a first-team place. The feeling is that he could soon be heading elsewhere if Chelsea are reluctant to offer him a new contract. </span></p>
              <p><span>Michael Essien is 30 next year but his career is in danger of being cut short by a series of serious knee injuries, his last being a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season training. </span></p>
              <p><span>John Mikel Obi was once described by Jose Mourinho as ‘gold’ and the battle Chelsea had with Manchester United for his services suggested he would develop into a world-beater. This season, though, he has lost his place to the 20-year-old Romeu. </span></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span>Rodwell would not be a direct replacement for any of them. But he is an elegant ball player with the athleticism to get from  box to box with ease. For  England he showed some great touches as well as genuine pace and an eye for goal.</span></p>
              <p><span>It remains to be seen, however, if he would be more suited to a defensive role or whether he could develop into another Lampard. But the feeling is that Rodwell would thrive in the company of the top international footballers Chelsea already possess. </span></p>
