              <p>Ancelotti singled out Ashley Cole's goal as the best of the bunch. His strike was the 18,000th in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> but the England left-back hurt his ankle in scoring it.</p>
              <p>"Maybe the best goal was Ashley's goal," said Ancelotti. "It was
              fantastic movement, fantastic dribbling and a fantastic goal. Then he
              had a problem with his ankle so we took him off for precaution."</p>

              <p>No Drogba, no Essien, but <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>'s players had manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> beaming after their amazing 7-2 triumph over <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sunderland</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Two goals apiece from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Frank Lampard</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Nicolas Anelka</span></abbr> plus others from Michael Ballack, Florent Malouda and Ashley Cole set the seal on a fabulous afternoon for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The Blues remain top of the Barclays <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> by a single point from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> but have a game in hand on their rivals.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sunderland</span></abbr> managed two consolation goals from substitute Bolo Zenden and Darren
              Bent but with eight first-team players missing, they could not cope
              with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"I think that was maybe the best performance this season," said Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>"We played very well until the end of the match. We started the game
              very well. I'm very happy because it's an important time for us.</p>
              <p>"Without the African players we maybe could have some problems.
              I always said I have a fantastic squad and today other players played
              very well, especially Juliano Belletti in a new position for him, so it
              is a good moment for us.</p>
              <p>"We played a lot of times without Drogba, and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Nicolas Anelka</span></abbr> did very well in the past. He also did very well today. Nicolas is a
              fantastic striker, he is a top striker, and we are very happy to have
              him in our squad.</p>
              <p>"We don't want to send a message to the other teams. This
              performance for us is very good because it improves our motivation and
              improves our determination to do better if it is possible.</p>
              <p>"These are important matches for us because we can also play without the African players.</p>
              <p>"But I have a fantastic squad and in this period I will use other players."</p>

              </span></p><p style="text-align: left;">Chelsea put hapless Sunderland to the sword with a 7-2 demolition at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Nicholas Anelka and Frank Lampard helped themselves to two apiece while Ashley Cole, Florent Malouda and Michael Ballack all chipped in as Carlo Ancelotti’s side ran riot in their first league outing of 2010.<br><br>Substitute
              Bolo Zenden  and Darren Bent netted second half consolations for the
              injury-hit visitors who were on the wrong end of a nine-goal thriller
              in the capital. <br><br>Steve Bruce, looking for a first win in eight Premier League games partnered Kenwyne Jones with England hopeful Darren Bent in an attacking 4-4-2 formation.<br><br>In
              the absence of their African contingent, Chelsea opted to play Nicholas
              Anelka as a lone striker supported by Joe Cole and Florent Malouda.<br><br>The home side began much the brighter and wasted no time in breaking the deadlock.<br><br>Michael Ballack sent <strong>Nicholas Anelka</strong> on his way having picked the ball up in the middle of the park and the
              Frenchman provided a cool finish past Marton Fulop on eight minutes.<br><br>Chelsea’s defense has been unusually porous this season and Sunderland could have been level straight from the restart.<br><br>Petr
              Cech was hesitant when coming for a teasing center and was fortunate to
              see the ball avoid the attentions of Sunderland’s frontline.<br><br>But the game was all but over as a contest inside 20 minutes.<br><br><strong>Florent Malouda</strong> was afforded far too much room and his firm drive beat Fulop to double Chelsea’s advantage.<br><br>Sunderland
              were unable to cope with the pace and purpose of the home side’s attack
              but their third came from the unlikely source of <strong>Ashley Cole</strong>.<br><br>With
              a typical marauding run forward the England left back showed great
              composure in the area to deftly flick over Fulop on 22 minutes.<br><br>Shell
              shocked Sunderland rallied and began to compete in the middle of the
              park but Chelsea were always a danger on the counter attack.<br><br>There was no respite for Steve Bruce’s beleaguered defense as <strong>Frank Lampard</strong> made it four on the half hour mark.<br><br>Ashley Cole provided a teasing cross into the Sunderland box and Lampard slid in to claim his tenth goal of the season.<br><br>Sunderland’s best chance of the half fell to Daryl Murphy but his shot was well blocked by Cech minutes before the interval.</p>

Birmingham, their next opponent may show better quality but the match is played at the Bridge so, still a Blues win but by a much smaller margin.

              <p>under 4-4-2 diamond he was a ML. he is no longer running into the box to score goals. the match aganist sunderland, chelsea played 4-3-3, which was the formation last season.</p>
