              <p><strong>Diego Maradona has demanded two state-of-the-art bidet toilets be installed for him at Argentina's World Cup base camp in South Africa.</strong></p>
              <p>Builders were rushed in to carry out a £1,400 overhaul of the football legend's private suite after his aides complained that the existing bathroom facilities would not meet his 'high standards.'</p>
              <p>His bedroom now includes two bathrooms, each featuring a bidet  toilets, which according to a South African newspaper retail for £311 each.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">They feature a heated seat, a warm air blow-dryer and front and rear bidet wands.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The toilet is available on www.sandman.com, which describes it as 'the best toilet seat in the world.'</p>
              <p>Colin Stier, the manager at the High Performance Centre in Pretoria where the team will stay, said Maradona's aides had made the demand.</p>
              <p>'(Bidets) are quite common in Argentina but hard to get hold of here,' he said.</p>
              <p>'In the end we managed to track down a seat which has bidet nozzles, but to make it fit we ended up having to replace the whole bathroom too.'</p>
              <p>'Of course we were happy to do so. If it makes Diego more comfortable during his stay then it's worth the effort.' </p>

              <p><strong>Maradona and Argentina's squad will arrive in South Africa later this week.</strong></p>
              <p>Maradona's private suite at the centre, which is operate by the University of Pretoria, was created by knocking two existing bedrooms together.</p>
              <p>The request was one of many made by the Argentinian team, which only narrowly qualified for the World Cup after a string of poor results under Maradona's leadership</p>
              <p>Other requests including a demand for rooms to be painted white, and for six Playstations to be installed for players to use during their free time.</p>
              <p>The Argentinian FA also demanded 10 hot dishes be served every day alongside no less than 14 different salads at every meal.</p>
              <p>Every dinner must include at least three pasta sauces and no fewer than three desserts.</p>
              <p>The team also demanded South African braai at least once every three days and requested that ice cream be made available at all times throughout their stay.</p>
              <p>The catering details were revealed by South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper during an interview with HPC kitchen manager Linda Tyrrell.</p>

              <p><strong>Argentina's rivals have also made a string of demands ahead of their arrival in South Africa.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazilian team demanded their pool be heated to exactly 32 C by the time the players arrive at the Fairway Hotel in Johannesburg.</p>
              <p>Hotel marketing assistant Ariska van der Westhuizen also said the squad would bring along two of their own Portuguese chefs, but 'would not be taking over the kitchen'.</p>
              <p>They also ordered hot coffee and cookies - but said that there was to be no chocolate.</p>
              <p>The Mexican players, who will stay at the Thaba Ya Batswana lodge near Johannesburg, requested their own priest who will conduct services during the tournament in a church on the premises.</p>
              <p>The Italian team has flown in specialist gym equipment ahead of their arrival and will bring their own pasta with them from Rome.</p>
              <p>Managers for the New Zealand team have enquired about arranging golf lessons for some of their players during the tournament.</p>
              <p>These demands contrast starkly with the more budget requests from the Slovakian players - who simply asked for a pair of table tennis tables and an electronic dartboard.</p>
