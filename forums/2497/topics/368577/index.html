              Milan have confirmed they are in talks with Barcelona about the sale of
              Zlatan Ibrahimovic, with Samuel Eto'o also up for discussion.</span></p>

              </span></p><p>Inter supremo Massimo Moratti has been locked in talks with Barca over the past week about numerous subjects.</p>
              <p>They have already agreed terms on Maxwell's move from Italy to
              Catalunya, whilst they are set to take Alexander Hleb from the Spanish
              club.</p>
              <p>Now they are also talking about the possible transfer of Sweden
              striker Ibrahimovic, which could also see Eto'o move to the San Siro.</p>
              <p>"We have closed the negotiations for Maxwell and now we are trying to end the talks over Hleb," Moratti told Sky Sport Italia.</p>
              <p>"Obviously we have spoken about other things also, because they
              were interested to know something about Ibrahimovic and to talk about
              Eto'o, two players at the same level.</p>
              <p>"There is the possibility to do an operation with these two players.</p>
              <p>"What are the odds of Ibrahimovic leaving Inter? I don't like to
              frame things this way, I don't know right now, we'll have to wait and
              see what the player wants.</p>
              <p>"In any case, if the matter should be taken all the way to completion, then Eto'o would be in the deal."</p>
              <p>Reports in both Spain and Italy suggest the clubs are close to
              agreeing terms on the deal which would see Inter receive 40million
              euros plus Eto'o and Hleb on loan for a year.</p>

              <p><strong>MILAN</strong> - Massimo Moratti spoke briefly to Sky Sport Italia after this Thursday evening's meeting with Barcelona president and the Catalan club's sporting director Txiki Beguiristain.</p>
              <p>This is what the Inter president had to say:</p>
              <p><strong>President, is it true? <br></strong>"At the end of last season when the championship ended, I and Laporta said we would meet soon. I wasn't expecting to see him this evening, but he was passing through Milan. We concluded negotiations for Maxwell and I'm pleased he's going to play for a great club like Barcelona because he's an excellent player. Now we are trying to conclude for Hleb, and we obviously talked about other things because for them it was interesting to know something about Ibrahimovic. We also spoke about Eto'o to understand if it's possible to do a deal with these two players. But this meeting was something between two presidents to understand if there are other possibilities to work together."</p>
              <p><strong>What are the possibilities of Zlatan Ibrahimovic going to play for Barcelona? <br></strong>"There's no need for percentages. I think it's to do with the desire of the player and the rapport that exists between myself and Laporta. We will see."</p>
              <p><strong>Eto'o to Inter. A possibility? <br></strong>"If an operation of this kind was carried out, it would regard both players."</p>
              <p><strong>Will there be another meeting with Laporta? <br></strong>"Maybe we will meet halfway. No meetings have been arranged."</p>
