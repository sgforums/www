              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Rangers duo Barry Ferguson and
                  Allan McGregor are understood to have been sent home from training by
                  the Scottish Premier League giants.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The news comes after the
                  pair were dropped from the starting line-up for Scotland's crucial
                  World Cup qualifier against Iceland in midweek.</p>
              <p>Scotland manager George Burley benched his skipper and his Gers
                  team-mate after it was discovered that both had undertaken an all night
                  drinking session after the 3-0 defeat to Holland on Saturday.</p>
              <p>However the controversy didn't end there. Both were then
                  photographed on the bench making obscene gestures in front of a packed
                  Hampden Park crowd.</p>
              <p>Scotland coped well without the pair as they went on to win 2-1 and keep their World Cup dream alive.</p>
              <p>But the recent sequence of events could spell the end of not
                  just Ferguson's tenure as Scotland captain but his international future
                  as a whole.</p>

              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Barry
              Ferguson and Allan McGregor have been banned from representing Scotland
              ever again and suspended without pay for two weeks by Rangers.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The club handed out the
              maximum sanction available after the pair were summoned to a meeting
              with chief executive Martin Bain having been sent home from training
              earlier in the day.</p>
              <p>Both players were involved in a drinking session at Scotland's
              team hotel at the weekend and then enraged club and national team
              bosses by apparently making V-signs while on the bench after being
              dropped for Wednesday's 2-1 win over Iceland at Hampden.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Football Association claimed the matter was closed
              on Thursday, but they have now announced Ferguson and McGregor will no
              longer be considered for international selection.</p>
              <p>The SFA have been besieged by phone calls and e-mails from Scotland fans.</p>
              <p>It is understood the negative reaction from supporters and
              supporters' groups added to the pressure for the matter to be discussed
              again.</p>
              <p>Following a further meeting between chief executive Gordon
              Smith and manager George Burley, sanctioned by the SFA board, it was
              decided neither player would play for Scotland again.</p>
              <p>Scotland boss George Burley insisted after Wednesday's game that both players would still be involved in future squads.</p>
              <p>But, following a summit between Burley and chief executive Gordon Smith, the SFA have performed a dramatic u-turn.</p>
              <p>An SFA spokesman said: "In light of the events of the past 48
              hours and following further discussions between the national team
              manager and the chief executive, it has been decided that Barry
              Ferguson and Allan McGregor will no longer be considered for
              international selection by Scotland.</p>
              <p>"This action has been taken in the best interest of the squad, the fans and the country.</p>
              <p>"We are determined to qualify for the World Cup and we must
              ensure that nothing is allowed to distract us from achieving this
              goal."</p>
              <p>Ferguson - who has been stripped of the Rangers captaincy - and
              McGregor were called to a meeting with Bain at Murray Park, where they
              were informed of the action being taken by the club.</p>
              <p>Bain said: "The overall conduct of the players during the last
              week while on Scotland duty has, regrettably, fallen considerably short
              of the standards expected by Rangers Football Club and our supporters
              and has brought the club into disrepute.</p>
              <p>"The management of the club has taken the view that this has damaged both Rangers and Scotland and is unacceptable.</p>
              <p>"Even though our club is entering the critical stage of the
              league season and the later stages of the Scottish Cup, appropriate
              disciplinary action was required."</p>
              <p>Rangers has agreed with the players that part of their deducted wages will be donated to charity.</p>
              <p>Both players issued an apology for their actions and spoke of
              their disappointment that their international careers are now over.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "I deeply regret what happened last weekend and
              the events during the last week and apologise wholeheartedly for the
              embarrassment caused to Scotland, Rangers, both sets of supporters and
              my friends and family.</p>
              <p>"I have always considered playing for Rangers and Scotland an
              honour and a privilege and nothing will change that and I am bitterly
              disappointed by the announcement that I will not be selected for
              Scotland again."</p>
              <p>McGregor - who made his competitive debut against Holland on
              Saturday - added: "I was absolutely delighted to be selected for
              Scotland last weekend and I am deeply sorry over what has happened
              since then.</p>
              <p>"We all make mistakes in life and I am very disappointed to have let Rangers, Scotland, my family, all the fans down.</p>
              <p>"I am also desperately disappointed that I will not be selected again for Scotland at this stage in my career."</p>
