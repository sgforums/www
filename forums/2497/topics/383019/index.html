              </div>
              <p><br>Everton
              chief executive Robert Elstone has revealed that the club are
              considering their best course of action after plans for a new stadium
              in Kirkby were rejected by the government yesterday.<br><br>The Â£400
              million proposal was turned down due to the negative impact it was felt
              a supermarket that was part of the development would have on local
              businesses.<br><em><br></em>Elstone also hinted that the Toffees were now prepared to consider sharing a ground with neighbours Liverpool.<br><br>"If
              the scheme was rejected in a way that means we can amend it or tailor
              it to give it greater chance of success than that's clearly something
              we'll look at," Elstone told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.<br><br>"We'll sit down with the partners and review the decision before we make our next steps on that particular point."<br><br>As
              for whether the club's current ground Goodison Park can be upgraded,
              Elstone doesn't feel that the potential for redevelopment exists.<br><br>"It's
              a very small site, it's locked in by houses and businesses and a church
              and a pub and a school, so to redevelop would be incredibly
              challenging," he explained.<br><br>"When something is challenging and perhaps ambitious the other word that often goes with that is expensive. <br><br>"We
              believe redevelopment of Goodison is very, very expensive. Future
              stadium potential for Everton is not necessarily about land, it's more
              about the cash, the affordability.<br><br>"That was the beauty of the
              Kirkby scheme which did come with a substantial subsidy from Tesco. So
              any alternative is going to have to address affordability.<br><br>"I
              would say as well that Kirkby for a long, long time has divided the
              club and divided the fans. And who knows really the proportion of fans
              who were for or against it - we don't know that.<br><br>"I think now is
              the time for the club to be reunited, because for 130 years we have
              been united. Fans, partners, all of us really need to get behind the
              next steps for Everon whatever they might be."<br><br>As a result,
              Elstone felt that the possiblity of sharing a new stadium with
              Liverpool was now an option to be seriously considered.<br><br>"Perhaps
              it will, and it's certainly one of the options that we will need to
              cover. I come back to what I've just said though," he added.<br><br>"A shared stadium is an option perhaps if it's affordable. It's the affordability point we have to look at.<br><br>"Where
              we can raise money, potentially Liverpool will have to contribute to
              that. Liverpool City Council perhaps might need to find some money.<br><br>"So
              it's affordability on the shared stadium, it's not any deep-seated
              opposition to sharing. Our history is one of creation and innovation
              and if we're the first major English club to look at sharing then we're
              not scared of making those decisions."</p>
