              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LONDON - Europe's leading clubs
              will have to adjust their ticket prices for corporate clients
              next season if they are to preserve revenues, analysts say.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clubs will be increasingly prepared to lower prices to
              retain their prestige customers as the global economic crisis
              squeezes budgets.</p>
              <p>"It's a buyers' market, and at clubs where corporate
              capacity is not sold out prices may be flexible," said Alex
              Byars, senior manager in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte.</p>
              <p>Some expect ticket renewal for next season to be even
              tougher than in 2008.</p>
              <p>"I see signs of contraction in corporate hospitality in 2009
              and 2010," Marco Fassone, chief marketing officer at Juventus,
              told Reuters.</p>
              <p>Many premium seats are taken by small businesses who are
              closest to the difficulties experienced in the economy at the
              moment.</p>
              <p>"I expect corporate hospitality to come under considerable
              pressure," said Paul Blakey, senior lecturer in sports
              management at the Northumbria University.</p>
              <p>Top European soccer clubs draw up to 40 percent of their
              matchday revenues on corporate seats, according to the
              consultancy group Deloitte.</p>
              <p>About 10-15 percent of seating at modern stadiums, Deloitte
              say, is reserved for businessmen and professionals, who pay up
              to 6,000 euros ($7,545) per season for benefits including
              exclusive seats, car parking, special dinners and player
              appearances.</p>
              <p>As a result of the crisis, English Premier League club
              Blackburn Rovers slashed their corporate hospitality prices in
              January, while there has been a widespread price discounting for
              some games.</p>
              <p><strong>MIXED SCENARIO</strong></p>
              <p>However, those clubs whose revamped stadiums reach above 95
              percent of capacity are in a better position to weather the
              crisis.</p>
              <p>"On the corporate side, we are less challenged than others,"
              Arsenal's new chief executive Ivan Gazidis said this week.</p>
              <p>The London club largely benefits from sell-out league
              attendances, averaging 60,100.</p>
              <p>In Italy, where Serie A top flight league is second only to
              the English Premier League in terms of total revenues, stadiums
              are in desperate need of an overhaul.</p>
              <p>"Italian soccer clubs have not yet developed an adequate
              corporate offer," said Michele Costantini, marketing director at
              Italy's travel agency Sport Incentive Travel.</p>
              <p>Juventus -- whose matchday income accounts for seven percent
              of the clubs' total revenues -- is trying to make up the
              difference.</p>
              <p>The Turin club is looking to increase its corporate fan base
              and will offer 3,500 premium seats instead of the current 500
              when its new 40,000 seater stadium opens in 2011.</p>
              <p>While general tickets prices will remain unchanged, premium
              seats will cost from a minimum of 2,000 euros per season to
              about 6,000 euros, depending on the benefits included.</p>
              <p>"From 2011 we expect to increase our revenues from the
              stadium to about 30 million euros. We may still be far from
              British clubs revenues, but this means a lot to us," Juve's
              Fassone said.</p>
