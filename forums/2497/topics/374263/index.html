              <h2>UEFA DIVING CLAMPDOWN ENDS WITH EDUARDO</h2>
              <p><img src="http://images.football365.com/09/08/240/Eduardo-Manchester-United-Arsenal-Premier-Lea_2353986.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></p>
              <p><br> <span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p><strong>UEFA's supposed clampdown on diving has been brought to a halt after just one case.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In an admission that is bound to further infuriate Arsenal after
              Eduardo was suspended for two matches for diving, the governing body
              has, reports The Times, 'confirmed that there are no plans to institute
              a regular programme of video referral for matches under its
              jurisdiction or issue an anti-diving directive'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rather than set a precedent that UEFA are determined to follow,
              the charge and subsequent banning of Eduardo is thus set to remain an
              arbitrary one-off, principally motivated by what The Times calls an
              'unfortunate series of coincidences'. It would appear, as F365 reported
              at the time, that Eduardo has only been singled out because he
              committed his dive in a match against Scottish opponents broadcast on
              free-for-all television on a day of the week when no other high-profile
              games were being played.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'Article 10 (1c), which was introduced by Uefa as a consequence
              of the furore that followed Rivaldo's feigning antics when playing for
              Brazil in the 2002 World Cup, exists to punish the worst offenders, but
              there is no appetite at Uefa to mount a wholesale campaign against
              diving through the retrospective use of video technology,' reports the
              newspaper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal have still yet to decide whether to appeal against
              Eduardo's suspension, with the governing body unable to provide the
              club with the rationale for banning the Croatian until later today. To
              date, all UEFA have faxed to the club is a single paragraph of text
              that reads, 'Having examined all the documents of the case which the
              player charged had likewise examined the control and disciplinary body
              decides that the player Eduardo is suspended for two Uefa club
              competition matches.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The anomaly in that judgement is that Eduardo has been suspended
              for an offence that the rulebook stipulates should only receive a
              caution. Any hope that the governing body would issue an amendment to
              instigate a wider clampdown has, unfortunately, already been dashed.
              'Although Eduardo's suspension is similar to that which might accompany
              a red card, Uefa will not now ask referees to send players off for such
              offences,' reports The Guardian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While the news will meet with general disappointment, Uefa's
              handling of the Eduardo case perhaps suggests that their withdrawal is
              just as well. Of the two faxes sent to Arsenal on the matter, one
              failed to arrive and the other was sent to the offices of Arsenal
              Ladies at the club's Hertfordshire training ground.</p>
