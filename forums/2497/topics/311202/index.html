              leg break after Taylor's two-footed tackle but while the Blues camp has

              believes the defender is culpable.</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger initially suggested Taylor should face a life ban for the foul but swiftly retracted his comments.</p>
              <p>"Of course I blame him," said Fabregas.</p>
              <p>"He did it and he knows why he did it. Of course he is not going to say he did it on purpose, he will never say that.</p>
              <p>"But a very good player is injured for a year and the player who
              committed the tackle is suspended for three little games. It is very,
              very unfair."</p>

              <h1>Gold launches Fabregas broadside</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">Birmingham chairman David Gold has slammed Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas' verbal attack on defender Martin Taylor.</span></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/07/12/330/davidgold2_605353.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Taylor has completed his three-match ban after
              being sent off against the Gunners three and a half weeks ago for the
              challenge which saw Eduardo suffer a broken leg.</p>
              <p>Fabregas has claimed it is unfair Taylor can return so soon
              after missing the games with Tottenham, Portsmouth and Newcastle, while
              Eduardo will be sidelined for a year.</p>
              <p>But Gold believes the Spaniard's comments are out of order and
              is concerned Taylor will be haunted by the incident for the remainder
              of his career.</p>
              <p>He said: "Fabregas has got this wrong and I will stand by
              Martin through thick and thin over this. It may be his opinion but I
              would ask him to listen to the majority of voices who have been in the
              main supportive of Taylor.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't a malicious tackle, Martin is incapable of such vengeance. Look at the body language.</p>
              <p>"Why is Fabregas still talking about this three weeks after the
              event? I don't deny that Martin has to take responsibility but he
              (Fabregas) is talking about there being intent.</p>
              <p>"Is he saying he thinks Martin went into the tackle to
              deliberately hurt Eduardo? If he is then it's outrageous and it does
              the player, his football club and football no favours at all.</p>
              <p>"This could have happened to anybody and let's hope Fabregas is
              not involved in something similar one day where he accidentally injures
              a player.</p>
              <p>"It's time to get off Martin's back and that includes Fabregas
              and people like Sepp Blatter. They don't know Martin Taylor. I do and I
              know it was an out-and-out accident with absolutely no meanness of
              spirit - but he is being demonised.</p>
              <p>"This is an ill-informed judgment by Fabregas and it does not stand up because it is 'guess-timation' on his part."</p>
              <p>Gold added: "Martin is a professional and will get on with his
              game, but I fear he will suffer because of this. The incident will stay
              with him for the rest of his days because he is not the person that
              Fabregas has portrayed him to be.</p>
              <p>"If he was, he would get over it because dirty players do, but Martin is a man of conscience."</p>

              <h1>FA rule out further ban for Taylor</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">The Football Association have rejected FIFA's
              call to impose a longer ban on Martin Taylor for the foul that broke
              Eduardo's leg.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/07/12/330/Martin_Taylor_609051.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="233"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The world governing body had asked the FA to
              increase the Birmingham defender's punishment after he was suspended
              for three matches after being sent off for serious foul play.</p>
              <p>FIFA's disciplinary chief Marcel Mathier studied the file of the incident and then said the FA should reconsider their decision.</p>
              <p>But the FA have stuck to their guns and say the ban will not be
              changed because there was no clear case of intent on Taylor's part when
              he went in to tackle Arsenal's Croatian striker. They also insist
              disciplinary procedures should not be changed mid-way through a season.</p>
              <p>However, they will review the whole issue of dangerous tackles and will set up a meeting with FIFA officials for their view.</p>
              <p>An FA spokesman said: "It would be unreasonable at this stage of
              the season to change our disciplinary procedures purely on the basis of
              one case.</p>
              <p>"That would be a dangerous precedent to set.</p>
              <p>"Serious foul play carries a three-match ban and the only cases
              where that has been increased is where there has been a clear case of
              intent and no-one is suggesting that happened in this case.</p>
              <p>"We will be reviewing our procedures at the end of the season
              and consulting with the whole game, and dangerous tackles are certainly
              an area we will be looking at.</p>
              <p>"We will also be requesting a meeting with FIFA for their input."</p>
              <p>FIFA president Sepp Blatter has taken a personal interest in the
              Taylor/Eduardo case and it was he who demanded the file be sent to his
              disciplinary head.</p>
              <p>He has also called for much tougher punishments for players who commit dangerous tackles.</p>
              <p>FIFA said in a statement: "The file on the sanction imposed by
              the FA on the player Martin Taylor was received and thoroughly reviewed
              by the chairman of the FIFA disciplinary committee.</p>
              <p>"A letter was then sent requesting the FA to once again review the incident in detail and reconsider the sanction."</p>

              <h1>Birmingham's Taylor plays his first game since making THAT tackle</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/martintaylorAHR_468x324.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Martin Taylor resumed his football career on Tuesday night, 24 days after the tackle that broke Eduardo's leg and shocked the world of football.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Birmingham defender made his comeback following his three-match ban for the reserves in a 3-3 draw with Spurs at Solihull Moors.</p>
              <p>It was a night of mixed fortune for Taylor. He nodded down a 10th-minute corner for colleague Jake Jervis to open the scoring before some neat skill by Spurs' Adel Taarabt put the 28-year-old on his backside as Tomas Pekhart levelled.</p>
              <p>A string of high-profile figures, from FIFA president Sepp Blatter to Manchester United assistant Carlos Quieroz, have criticised the stopper following the challenge.</p>
              <p>But there was at least some good news as the FA threw out FIFA's request to hit the defender with a more severe punishment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>An FA spokesman said: "It would be unreasonable at this stage of the season to change our disciplinary procedure on the basis of one case. 'Serious foul play carries a threematch ban and the only cases where that has been increased is where there has been a clear case of intent and no one is suggesting that happened in this instance."</p>
