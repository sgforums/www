              <h1>Listening to football at the wheel is "dangerous"</h1>
              <p>LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Listening to commentary of soccer
              matches on the radio while driving can be dangerous, leading
              motorists to risk smashes during exciting moments, according to
              research published on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>The study by scientists at Britain's University of Leicester
              found that goals, penalties and red cards caused fans to lose
              concentration and drive more erratically.</p>
              <p>The report, published to coincide with the Champions League
              final between Manchester United and Barcelona on Wednesday, had
              advice for those planning to listen to the game in a car.</p>
              <p>"It is concluded that -- where possible -- football fans
              should ask someone else to drive during important matches such
              as the Champions League final," Professor Michael Pont said.</p>
              <p>The report estimated that two million motorists had had an
              accident or near miss while listening to sport on the radio.</p>
              <p>"It is widely accepted that the distraction of talking on a
              hand-held mobile phone may lead to accidents, but other
              activities may have a similar impact -- such as listening to
              sport on the radio," said Pont.</p>
              <p>"The results we obtained suggest that, particularly during
              high-pressure situations within games, there was a very marked
              impact on the behaviour of the subjects of this study."</p>
              <p>The research, which studied participants' behaviour on a
              driving simulator, found that football fans would speed or
              suddenly slow down, overtake and get closer to other vehicles on
              the road as games developed.</p>
              <p>One driver, a Chelsea fan, reacted to a Barcelona player
              being sent off during a match between the two clubs by
              accelerating, and trying to overtake and change lanes
              frequently.</p>
              <p>The behaviour of football fans behind the wheel was very
              different from that of the casual listener which was far more
              consistent, the study found.</p>
