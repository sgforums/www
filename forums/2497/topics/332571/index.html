              <h1>Ranieri Could Be Sacked This Weekend</h1>
              <h2>According to the latest reports in Italy, Claudio Ranieri could be sacked this weekend if Juventus fail to beat Palermo, with Ciro Ferrara replacing him as coach.</h2>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ranieri is under intense pressure at the Stadio Olimpico after a poor run of results which has seen the Bianoconeri draw their last three games.</strong><br><br>This included a humiliating 2-2 draw away at Belarus minnows BATE Borisov in the Champions League, a game that they had to fight back from 2-0 down in.<br><br>It was already reported in Tuttosport this morning that Cesare Prandelli was being lined up as a replacement for Ranieri at the end of the season if he failed to win any trophies again.<br><br>Now there are reports that The Tinkerman could be sacked as early as this weekend if his side fails to beat Palermo at home in Serie A.<br><br>There are claims that the club’s former defensive star Ciro Ferrara, who won seven Scudetti (one revoked) with the club between 1994 and 2005, could be the man taking over the reigns.<br><br>Ferrara is currently working with the Bianconeri, and he is now fully qualified to be a head coach after completing his qualifications at Coverciano in the summer.<br><br>The 41-year-old was part of the Italy technical staff during the 2006 World Cup success, and still joins the Azzurri for all Italy fixtures under Marcello Lippi.<br><br>He is much loved by the Juventus fans, who remember him as a world class defender during his playing days.</p>

              <p><br>But you have to admit that his tactical and his first team selection has been rather baffling so far. Neved is too old to be playing 3 games in a week and yet he let neved to so. Though i caould say nothing more about it since Neved perform so well in all those games =/ He ought to give Giovinco more playing time especially since he always seems to impress whenever he's playing.</p>
