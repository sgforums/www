              <h3 class="padding-bottom-7">LAUGHING Luis Suarez was accused of cheating Mansfield out of the FA Cup yesterday.</h3>
              <p>The controversial Liverpool striker caused a storm with his second-half winner after teeing it up with his hand.</p>
              <p>Mansfield staff felt they had been cheated and ESPN match commentator Jon Champion said: “That, I’m afraid, is the work of a cheat.”</p>
              <p>Stags chairman John Radford fumed: “We should be getting a replay.”</p>
              <p>Mansfield keeper Alan Marriott said: “When you see Luis laughing as he kicks the ball across the line — he knows himself what happened.</p>
              <p>“Even Stewart Downing said to us that he could not believe top officials had missed that.</p>
              <p>“When it turns out to be the decisive goal, it’s a sickener for everyone.</p>
              <p>“I know a lot of people have called him a cheat in the past. It’s a natural reaction.</p>
              <p>“People sometimes put their hands up.”</p>
              <p>Fans chanted “cheat” at the Uruguayan.</p>
              <p>A home fan ran on to the pitch and said something to Suarez — but he did not react.</p>
              <p>Suarez made no mention of the incident in a tweet after the game. He wrote: “All the team played well. I congratulate them all for the great effort.</p>
              <p>“Happy to have moved on to the next phase.”</p>
              <p>Suarez’s 59th-minute goal put Liverpool 2-0 up after Daniel Sturridge had earlier scored on his debut and Matt Green pulled one back.</p>
              <p>Referee Andre Marriner and his offcials missed the handball.</p>
              <p>Kop boss Brendan Rodgers admitted: “It hit his hand but it wasn’t deliberate.”</p>
              <p>Liverpool go to Oldham in the next round.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Mansfield chairman John Radford has ensured the row over the controversial Luis Suarez goal rumbles on by making the extraordinary claim that Liverpool’s own directors are embarrassed by the actions of the club’s Uruguay striker.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Blue Square Bet Premier club are counting the cost of Sunday’s 2-1 FA Cup third-round defeat by Liverpool at Field Mill, with initial estimates suggesting a replay at Anfield would have brought them more than £600,000.</span></p>
              <p><span>Comments from Mansfield’s owner and chairman - made after the full implications of the goal sunk in - will perhaps inflame a situation already so sensitive that ESPN felt moved to apologise publicly for on-air suggestions from commentator Jon Champion that Suarez had cheated.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘To be honest the  Liverpool directors felt embarrassed,’ said Radford. ‘That’s it. I would have been absolutely embarrassed had it been one of our players.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘I’d have been embarrassed and the man should be embarrassed. Referees have a <span style="color: #000000;">hard</span> time but to do it deliberately then celebrate is the hardest thing.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘To cheat, maybe that’s OK in sport. But to cheat and then  celebrate cheating, that is the worst thing you can do. It’s always disappointing when things happen.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘I’m going to be biased every time because I’m watching a Premier League referee in charge of a game between a non-League side and a Premier side and some of the decisions were hurtful.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘When you get a professional player like Suarez and when they kiss the hand after a deliberate foul then of course it hurts.’ <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Asked if Suarez was gloating, he added: ‘Well, obviously he was. It was like, "Hang on, I can get away with this". If one of my players had done that I’d be embarrassed. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I was looking for a fair and true competition and that was one incident in the game that made me feel like...well...'</span></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Regular watchers of Barclays Premier League football will know Suarez always celebrates a goal by kissing a tattoo of his daughter’s name on his wrist. Nevertheless, Mansfield’s ire will not subside.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>As Liverpool look ahead to a Premier League game at Manchester United on Sunday — expected attendance 76,500 — and Mansfield prepare to host  Kidderminster — anticipated  attendance 2,500 — in the Blue Square Bet Premier, it is perhaps understandable Radford has been left rueing a 2-1 defeat. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>With Suarez’s handball prior to Liverpool’s second goal proving decisive, Mansfield are reflecting on missing out on 45 per cent of replay gate receipts plus more TV <span style="color: #000000;">money</span> had the second game been shown live next week.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Radford, who bankrolls Mansfield with his own money, did not try to hide his frustration and disappointment as he widened his attack on Sunday’s opponents.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>He said: ‘They have denied us a replay but it doesn’t matter. I know I’m big enough and daft enough to be able to stand up for the club and take us forward. It’s hurtful for the league we are in because we are playing at the likes of Luton and Grimsby. The profile would have been good.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>‘Did you not hear our fans? Did you not hear how loud they were? Compared to Liverpool fans they are true fans. It’s not like Liverpool fans are not true fans, but it was proper fans that were there for us.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>‘They paid their £20 for a ticket and they had queued up overnight to get them.  Liverpool fans were probably all corporate because we outsung them at the game. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘As Mansfield chairman, local club, local boy, born and bred, supporting the team, it’s not business. This is the team I love.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘I’m here for the passion, as against  Liverpool, where it’s all about business.What happened was a killer. It was a killer and a shame that a professional would do that sort of thing to a non-League team.’ <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Radford’s wife, Carolyn, the club’s chief executive, added in an exclusive column on Sportsmail Online: ‘We all have that "what if" feeling. With Liverpool playing Oldham in the next round, we could even have had a chance of getting through that one.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘The goal was really frustrating for us. He got such an advantage and then kissed his hand. I think the reaction from Liverpool showed that even they thought it shouldn’t have been allowed.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘It’s difficult to know if he is a cheat. If it was deliberate he should have owned up.’ <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Her husband’s view was more  categorical. ‘One day, cheats will never prosper,’ he said.</span></p>
