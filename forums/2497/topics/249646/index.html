"He's got the full support of the board and that is really important, I just hope that addresses (the speculation).

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ROMAN ABRAMOVICH told Jose Mourinho he can stay as Chelsea boss Â— after the coach vowed to compromise in the future. As SunSport revealed yesterday, Mourinho was so desperate to keep his job he accepted the ownerÂ’s vision of a new structure. It includes the possible introduction of a general manager and a new member of coaching staff. Mourinho had feared he would lose his job to Jurgen Klinsmann. Sun revealed last week how Chelsea had offered Spurs legend Klinsmann Â£6.4million a year to take over as boss. But Klinsmann refused to uproot his family from their US home Â— and the German still said Â‘NoÂ’ even when Chelsea indicated they might go to Â£7m a year.</strong><br><br>It was a major shock to Abramovich, who thought if you throw enough money at people, they crack. The Klinsmann snub opened the way for a U-turn over Mourinho. The manager had heart-to-heart talks with chief executive Peter Kenyon in light of The SunÂ’s revelations. He ducked the Press conference at West Ham following ChelseaÂ’s 4-1 win on Wednesday. Then a chat between Mourinho and Eugene Tenenbaum Â— AbramovichÂ’s right-hand man Â— on Thursday paved the way for the dramatic U-turn, announced yesterday. Kenyon was instructed by Abramovich to end the speculation by declaring the Portuguese manager will still be coach next season.<br><br>Kenyon said: Â“There has been a lot of speculation and I would like to be clear on one thing: We support Jose as manager. Â“Jose has a contract to 2010 and he wants to stay. We are not going to sack him, he has the clubÂ’s support. ThatÂ’s the situation and we are agreed on it. Â“Hopefully this will end the speculation and I think it should. As far as we are all concerned what is most important is that it is business as usual at Chelsea and putting all our energy into winning the three remaining trophies.Â”<br><br>Abramovich will now meet with Mourinho next week when the issues of how to move forward will be discussed and differences resolved. MourinhoÂ’s family Â— especially his 10-year-old daughter Matilde Â— were instrumental in guiding him to do everything possible to keep his job as they want to stay in London. While KenyonÂ’s statement will be welcomed by Mourinho, the approach for Klinsmann means the relationship between board and manager has been damaged.<br><br>With MourinhoÂ’s future apparently sorted, Kenyon was unable to offer any certainties over the contract situations of Frank Lampard and John Terry, which now look set to drag on until after the end of the season. Kenyon said: Â“John Terry and Frank Lampard are not yet completed. ThatÂ’s football. Â“WhatÂ’s important to remember about contract speculation is that there are only two definitive stages, when the discussions start and when they end. At the moment we are in between. Â“Again, I donÂ’t want anything to deflect us from our main goal, winning matches and trophies. And both John and Frank agree.Â”<br><br></div>
