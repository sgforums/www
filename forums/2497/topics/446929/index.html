              <p class="imageCaption">Leaving the building: Fabio Capello departs Wembley Stadium following his dramatic meeting with the FA</p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Fabio Capello resigned as England manager after an explosive meeting in the FA chairman’s office, leaving the way clear for Harry Redknapp to succeed him.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>On one of the most extraordinary days in the history of English football, Redknapp was cleared of all tax evasion charges at Southwark Crown Court just hours before the Italian walked into showdown talks with David Bernstein at Wembley.</span></p>
              <p><span>Bernstein was furious with Capello for an outburst on Italian television in which he criticised the FA’s decision to strip John Terry of the captaincy.</span></p>
              <p><span>Capello was stunned by accusations of a gross breach of protocol when he met Bernstein and FA general secretary Alex Horne and he was in no mood to back down. Instead the manager, angered that he was not consulted over last week’s decision to take the armband off Terry, has walked out with immediate effect, along with his coaching staff.</span></p>
              <p><span>Wayne Rooney took to Twitter to lead the call for Redknapp. ‘Gutted Capello has quit,’ he posted. ‘Good guy and top coach. Got to be english to replace him. Harry Redknapp for me.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Tottenham are planning to fight an approach for their manager. His contract at White Hart Lane has 15 months to run but chairman Daniel Levy is already considering a new offer which he hopes will persuade the 64-year-old to stay with a side pushing for the Barclays Premier League title and close to Champions League qualification.</span></p>
              <p><span>The fact Capello has quit means any compensation, something the FA would not discuss on Wednesday, would be minimal.</span></p>
              <p><span>The FA will announce their plans at a noon press conference at Wembley on Wednesday. They will reveal who will take charge of the national team for the friendly against Holland later this month, with the expectation being that they will turn to Under 21 manager Stuart Pearce and director of football development and Club England board member Sir Trevor Brooking.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>But in the longer term it seems inevitable that England will turn to Redknapp, who is already known to have widespread  support among the players.</span></p>
              <p><span>On Wednesday night the Spurs manager was at home with his wife Sandra, exhausted after a  harrowing 13-day court ordeal.</span></p>
              <p><span>One sticking point could be his salary, given that the FA are keen to see that their next manager earns considerably less than Capello’s £6million a year.</span></p>
              <p><span>But the clamour for Redknapp will be huge and the FA will try to play on the fact that no English manager would turn down an offer to take charge of the national side.</span></p>
              <p><span>Martin O’Neill, who was interviewed for the job in 2006, ruled himself out and backed his Spurs counterpart. The Sunderland boss said: ‘If there is anyone to succeed Fabio Capello, Harry Redknapp has earned that right and he will be the next England manager.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘It is terribly disappointing. Fabio Capello has earned the right — having taken the team to the Euros — to go the whole distance and it is really disappointing. He is not only a fantastic manager but earned that opportunity and if it is because of the John Terry incident that is very, very sad indeed.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Capello arrived at Wembley at around 11am on Wednesday and was in the offices for six hours. He was entirely without allies, having alienated Bernstein, previously a supporter, with his comments on Italian TV.</span></p>
              <p><span>

              <p><span>Bernstein has led from the front since Terry’s trial for allegedly racially abusing Anton Ferdinand was adjourned until after the European Championship, and he had a mandate from the FA board to take personal charge of the talks.</span></p>
              <p><span>The FA directors had no intention of backing down after taking the moral lead on the Terry situation. They considered it inappropriate for the defender to captain the England team when he was facing such a serious charge — one he denies — and it was Capello’s failure to recognise the sensitivity of the issue that has ultimately led to his downfall.</span></p>
              <p><span>After the meeting Capello cleared his desk, leaving Bernstein to ring the rest of the board to explain that the breakdown in trust was irretrievable. It is understood he received their support.</span></p>
              <p><span>In a statement, the FA said: ‘The Football Association can confirm that Fabio Capello has today resigned as England manager.</span></p>
              <p><span>

              <p><span>'This follows a meeting involving FA chairman David Bernstein, FA general secretary Alex Horne and Fabio Capello at Wembley Stadium.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘The discussions focused on the FA board’s decision to remove the England team captaincy from John Terry, and Fabio Capello’s response through an Italian broadcast interview. In a meeting for over an hour, Fabio’s resignation was accepted and he will leave the post of England manager with immediate effect.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>Bernstein said: ‘I would like to stress that during today’s meeting and throughout his time as England manager, Fabio has conducted himself in an extremely professional manner. We have accepted Fabio’s resignation, agreeing this is the right decision. We would like to thank Fabio for his work with the England team and wish him every success in the future.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Capello told an Italian news agency: ‘I leave England and I will not say anything else.’</span></p>

              <p><span>Capello’s son Pierfilippo said: ‘I have spoken with dad and he is fine. For the time being we are not going to say anything because that is the agreement we have with the FA. We shall see how things go and then maybe we will speak. It is too early to say what he will do.’</span></p>
              <p><span>The game’s leading figures were stunned. Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand, who earlier revealed he was not interested in taking over the captaincy from Terry, tweeting: ‘So Capello resigns . . . what now . . . ’</span></p>
              <p><span>Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere said on Twitter: ‘Shocked about news on Fabio Capello . . . gutted to be honest, gave me my 1st cap and believed in me! Thank you Mr Capello! #GreatManager.’</span></p>

              <p>it'll be crazy for redknapp to leave spurs when they are doing so well this season.</p>

              <p>The England job is his dream job and i think many englishmen will want nothing more than having that on his CV for the rest of his career. Also, it isn't as intense throughout the season, only during the tournament periods. He gets to travel not just around the country weekly but around Europe and the world as well... So it's not exactly a crazy idea should he want it as we come to think the Spurs clubs isn't as rich, he may lose his best players in June like they have always. The club can't even afford Adebayor's transfer fee let alone his salary to make his stay permanent... Modric may also leave as their best offer of $100k isn't good enough to keep him when $150 to $180 awaits elsewhere...</p>
              <p>So it would be silly to turn down the biggest job offer of his career to stay at Spurs i think should he be offered the job.</p>
              <p>As for Capello, i think he took the opportunity to chicken out at the last minute with 4 months plus left on his time. The team already don't look good under him, and with the added problems of Rooney won't be available, Lampard look over the hill, Gerrard injury prone, Terry slowing down a lot, Rio also injury prone... He has to build an almost new side from most of the younger players going into this tournament... So better to chicken out early and save his err... good name... lol.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Capello maybe inclined to favouritsm, but at the end of the day, isn't every other manager. They would have their own preferences and confidence in different individuals. But honestly, I think if John Terry did not stir trouble in the first place, this wouldn't have happened. I think John Terry has lost the respect of his team mates and nation and shouldn't be representing them as a captain anyway. Poor Capello, I'm sure he didn't really want to leave with the Euros being so near.</p></div>

              <p>But as least; <span class="echo-item-text">no one don't idolise a player that sleeps with his brother's wife for 8 years. <br>                   - &gt;bribe referees. <br>                   -&gt; rely on referees to bail the team out of tough times. <br>                   -&gt; don't have players that steal donuts. <br>                      AND have an owner that actually cares about the club and not looking to just make profit out of it. <br></span></p>
