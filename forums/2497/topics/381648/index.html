              challenge that broke the Sunderland star's arm.</p>
              <p class="article-small padding-bottom-7">Scot Gordon, 26, is out for at least two months after the sickening clash with 
              the Spurs striker in Saturday's 2-0 defeat at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p class="article-small padding-bottom-7">He said: "I thought at the time it was a poor challenge - and after looking at 
              it again I haven't changed my mind.</p>
              <p class="article-small padding-bottom-7">"It's always dangerous diving down at the feet of strikers but I feel Jermain 
              might have done more to avoid the collision."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MUM'S the word as far as Jermain Defoe is concerned.</h2>
              <p class="article">In fact, the Spurs and England striker reckons his mother, Sandra, is as scary 
              as Fabio Capello.</p>
              <p class="article">Defoe's mum was so angry after his red card for blatantly stamping on 
              Portsmouth's Aaron Mokoena last month she could not watch the TV highlights.</p>
              <p class="article">And Defoe admits it was not something England boss Capello wanted to see 
              either because he has demanded his players stay disciplined.</p>

              <p class="article">The Tottenham hitman, 27, said: "My mum is my toughest critic.</p>
              <p class="article">"I called her after the game and she asked me what I did. I said 'Watch it on 
              Match of the Day'.</p>
              <p class="article">"But she said she didn't want to because she'd give me a mouthful.</p>
              <p class="article">"I'm glad she didn't see it. My grandad did, though, and gave me a bit of 
              stick. Your family are the ones who were there at the beginning and gave me 
              the support and belief to achieve what I've achieved today.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's how they view you that's the most important thing.</p>
              <p class="article">"My Spurs boss Harry Redknapp wasn't happy and, of course, I worried what the 
              England manager might think.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's a World Cup year so you want to try and do everything right. I don't 
              want to let myself down.</p>
              <p class="article">"I'd worked hard, got my goal and you don't want to spoil it by getting sent 
              off doing silly things like that when you can avoid those situations.</p>
              <p class="article">"The England manager doesn't want to see players getting sent off. He's told 
              us one of the most important things is to keep 11 players on the pitch.</p>
              <p class="article">"He wants 11 players coming off at the end of the game.</p>
              <p class="article">"At this level, you can't afford to be a man down. You just can't.</p>
              <p class="article">"And we're role models. You don't want kids doing things like that, emulating 
              what they've seen on TV."</p>
              <p class="article">So what came over Defoe?</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "Maybe it happened because I was going back to my old club and 
              getting a bit of stick.</p>
              <p class="article">"Maybe I was just too fired up before the game.</p>
              <p class="article">"It was out of character. I don't even get booked any more, I try not to get 
              involved or talk to the referee.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's frustration and you can't afford that, especially in a massive 
              tournament like the World Cup finals.</p>
              <p class="article">"Going down to 10 men, you give the other team the advantage and you could 
              lose the game.</p>
              <p class="article">"You'd let your team-mates down, your country down, plus the manager and the 
              staff. Some people say it's important to have that fire in your belly but 
              you've got to control it and be professional.</p>
              <p class="article">"Players will try and wind you up. That's normal, so you've got to try and 
              keep cool.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's difficult, everyone loses it, but I'm old enough to keep myself cool. I 
              know what's right and wrong. It definitely won't happen again."</p>
              <p class="article">Defoe is back in the England reckoning for the friendly against Brazil here in 
              Doha tomorrow having missed the last two internationals against Ukraine and 
              Belarus with a couple of broken fingers.</p>
              <p class="article">His mum had an opinion on that, too.</p>
              <p class="article">Defoe said: "I was getting a bit of stick off my mum, who was saying 'You 
              can't miss a game with a broken finger'. But it wasn't right. I only played 
              one game, 20 minutes against Bolton and I forced it, really. I should have 
              rested for three weeks.</p>
              <p class="article">"I wasn't too worried that it would affect my England chances, though.</p>
              <div class="float-right width-300 padding-left-10 padding-bottom-10 padding-top-10"></div>
              <p class="article">"I've always told myself to stay positive, keep working hard and getting your 
              goals for your club. Hopefully, that will then get you in the squad."</p>
              <p class="article">Italian World Cup winner Dino Zoff has backed fellow countryman Capello to 
              take England to glory in South Africa next year.</p>
              <p class="article">Zoff, who lifted the coveted trophy in 1982, was born just down the road from 
              Capello near Fruili and played 112 times for Italy in a career spanning 15 
              years between 1968 and 1983.</p>
              <p class="article">The former keeper, 67, said: "The World Cup is Capello's.</p>
              <p class="article">"Fabio has proved himself to be a great catch for England and I really believe 
              he can take them all the way to success. The only problem they will have is 
              tiredness as they will be coming from a long season in the Premier League 
              and it is tough - but with Capello they have a winner.</p>
              <p class="article">"Italy have great potential but repeating their win of 2006 will be very 
              difficult, though I think they will make the final four.</p>
              <p class="article">"What if Francesco Totti and Alessandro Nesta came back?</p>
              <p class="article">"Well, it would be different because Marcello Lippi would be able to call upon 
              two valuable players who could help take the team to the next level.</p>
              <p class="article">"As for Argentina, I do not think they will go far and they could encounter 
              difficulties.</p>
              <p class="article">"But I believe Brazil will always be there because of their tradition and 
              players."</p>
