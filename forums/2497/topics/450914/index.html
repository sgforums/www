              <p> </p>
              <p>Tom Henning Ovrebo, the referee of the controversial Champions League semi-final between Chelsea and Barcelona in 2009, has admitted that he made mistakes in the game that denied the Premier League side a place in the final.</p>
              <p>Ovrebo found himself at the centre of a firestorm at Stamford Bridge at the end of the second leg three years ago, having rejected four reasonable penalty claims from the home side - then managed by Guus Hiddink - during the 90 minutes, as they eventually went out to Andres Iniesta's last-minute strike.</p>
              <p>The Norwegian official was confronted by Michael Ballack and Didier Drogba even before the final whistle, and subsequently received death threats from a section of irate Chelsea fans. Ovrebo has now revealed that he still receives threatening messages, and has admitted that he did not enforce the laws correctly during the game at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"I still get a few death threats, but they go straight into the garbage box. I don't take them seriously, although sometimes I wonder about the people who send them," Ovrebo told <em>The Times</em>. "Just yesterday I got an email from a Chelsea fan saying he wanted to kill me and my family.</p>
              <p>"Everyone who knows the laws of the game knows I should have done things differently, but that's the life of a referee. In a strange way, I was actually satisfied with the way we all managed to keep calm in a tense situation."</p>
              <p>He added: "On the pitch I did my best. I shouldn't have to apologise as mistakes are part of the game."</p>
              <p>Drogba was subsequently given a five-game ban by UEFA for his outburst at the final whistle, with team-mate Jose Bosingwa given a three-game suspension. Ovrebo feels no ill-will towards the Ivorian, however, after the pair reconciled their differences at the disciplinary hearing.</p>
              <p>"It was a very challenging match and with the angry scenes after the final whistle it became less enjoyable," Ovrebo noted. "Some players got too emotional and behaved badly, but no one got killed. It's important to put it into perspective.</p>
              <p>"It helped me as a referee ... if I can cope with Drogba screaming at me, I can cope with anything - although he's a nice guy, really."</p>
              <p>The Blues have the chance to gain revenge on the Spanish club, as they face them in the Champions League semi-finals again this season. The first leg takes place at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday</p>

              Chelsea won by a goal from drogba.  But look at the statistics! 4 shots at goal against barca's 24. At home??? What are the chances of them surviving in the reverse tie?  Chelsea can forget it.  Look at their lousy defense.
              
              It'll be real boring if it ends up an all Spanish final.

              <p>Chelsea actually played well, well at least better than Utd against Barca in last year's final. Utd were scared, Chelsea brave. When playing against Barca, closing down has to be quick...no matter how skilful they are. Of course, luck played a part too.</p>
              <p>You look at Barca and really, they are also like any other good players. Many of them have played for teams in the past which did not dominate possession of up to 80% of the game. They can also feel vulnerable at times...just that Guardiola is an excellent coach.</p>

              </div>
              <div id="article-body-blocks">
              <p><strong>When the half-time whistle went, Leo Messi turned and looked to the sky, a pained expression etched across his face. The players headed for the tunnel; Messi bit his lip and silently ambled after them, lost in thought, still mulling over his role in the opening goal perhaps. It was not his normal role.</strong></p>
              <p>There was no clever finish here, no dashing run, no assist. Instead he had given the ball away. It was <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span style="color: #000000;">'s goal, not </span><span style="color: #000000;">Barcelona</span>'s. There were still 45 minutes to remedy the mistake and Messi certainly tried to do just that but the expression would be much the same at the final whistle too.</p>
              <p>Messi had been caught in possession by Frank Lampard. Suddenly space opened up before Chelsea in a way it never would before Barcelona. The swift attack was on. Out it went to Ramires, across to Didier Drogba and Chelsea had the lead. It was the last action of the first half. A moment before Messi had stood stretching uneasily after being left on the floor by Raul Meireles. This, though, hurt more. Roberto Di Matteo had sought counsel over how to approach Barcelona. Play deep, deny space, spring forward quickly – "like motorbikes" in Cesc Fábregas's prophetic words. It had worked.</p>
              <p>There had been no home comforts for Barcelona, even though one director described this city as like a second home. London holds a special place in the Catalan collective conscience. It was here that they won their hugely symbolic first European Cup in 1992 – a success that the club's vice-president celebrated by stripping down to his boxer shorts and taking a late-night dip in the freezing, filthy waters of the Thames – and where they won the tournament against Manchester United last year. Then there was 2009, a stage for the Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo, sure, but stage for Andrés Iniesta too.</p>
              <p>And, though it has gone unnoticed in Britain, it was also here in 2006 that the Spanish press said a 19-year-old Messi had graduated against Chelsea: "Messi se doctoró," ran the headlines. Asier del Horno almost sent him to the doctor's. In England Messi was accused of diving. In Spain his display was considered confirmation of an emerging and very special talent.</p>
              <p>Messi became the best. And yet he had not scored against Chelsea even though, as Frank Lampard put it, every time you put on the telly he scores two as standard. In fact Chelsea were unbeaten against Spanish opponents in 13 games, going back to that 2-1 Barça win here in 2006. Messi had scored 243 goals for Barça, none in six games against Chelsea. That is seven now. Barcelona may have had 72% of the ball but Chelsea were rewarded for their organisation and commitment.</p>
              <p>Space denied, in the first half Messi was often found dropping deep and occasionally flickered into life as Barça built their attacks and Chelsea lay in wait. He had a shot charged down just after the quarter hour, immediately reaching the loose ball to find Iniesta, who drew a save from Petr Cech.</p>
              <p>He leapt high to force Cech into another save from his header 10 minutes later and there was a real Messi moment two minutes before half-time, when he robbed Mikel John Obi and dashed through, the ball not so much tied to his foot as seeming to follow him faithfully. He slipped it through to Fábregas. The shot was dinked over the keeper but cleared off the line. A moment later Messi scuffed a shot wide. "Who are ya?" chanted Chelsea's fans. Soon they had an answer they never expected: the man who helped them take the lead.</p>
              <p>Messi disappeared down the tunnel chewing on that moment. He reappeared determined to put it right. There was more dynamism now, more intent, more directness. What there was not was a way through. A shot in the opening minute, blocked, and one of those hold-your-breath moments as he surged away from one challenge and took aim. Gary Cahill, though, came flying across to block. It was not the first time and it would not be the last: as Chelsea constructed a barrier on the edge of their box, Cahill was often the quickest out. John Terry, too, dived in to block him. His reward: Messi's shirt.</p>
              <p>Messi did not desist. He drew free-kicks on the edge of the box – the first from Mikel's hand, the second from Ramires' foul. He was then felled further out as he tried to weave through. The opportunities came to nought: Messi and Daniel Alves hit the wall, Xavi floated over. Another free-kick came, won by Messi once more. This time he clipped it in for Carles Puyol's header. Cech saved.</p>
              <p>There was even time for him to find Pedro in the last minute, only for the ball to come back off the post and Sergio Busquets to put the rebound over the bar.</p>
              <p>This was a strange night at Stamford Bridge for Messi, departing at full-time wearing an expression much like the one he wore at half-time. Look at the list of this game's key moments: with the exception of Alexis Sánchez's shot off the bar Messi was at the heart of all of them. Unfortunately for Barça, that included the only goal of this game, Chelsea's goal.</p>

              <p>The injustice they suffered in 2009 made them had an extra punch in this... But it just wasn't Chelsea playing better alone but rather Barce don't look like the same as before too... I guess some players have become older as well like Xavi.</p>
              <p>Barce had many chances but either cech saved or they just missed. Maybe you just can't beat history as Barce are hoping to become the first club to retain the CL title...</p>

              <p><strong>Didier Drogba is an indispensable indulgence <br></strong>He spent much of the game lying down, strolling offside or watching his team-mates chase the ball but it was no surprise that he scored. Frustrating he may be but he was the one player who made Barcelona nervous, spinning his man a couple of times in the first half before striking. It shouldn’t work, but it does.<br><br><strong>Possession is over-rated<br></strong>At one stage in the first half, Barcelona had 70 per cent possession; Chelsea looked like they were playing a different sport. Perhaps their dominance took the urgency out of their play but Barcelona did not create the chances you would expect. Chelsea deserve credit for not getting too frustrated: when the opening came, they struck. <br><br><strong>Ashley Cole is the best in the business</strong> <br>He is the one Chelsea player you are certain would make it into the Barcelona team. He was actually caught playing Alexis onside early in the game but was imperious after that. Had the confidence to take his time over his passing, cleared one off the line and even tried the odd trick.<br><br><strong>High line is Barca’s weak spot</strong> <br>So high up the pitch and so hard do they press that, if you can beat the first line of closing players, Barcelona can be opened up in transition. Look at Drogba’s goal: it was two passes from when Lampard tackled Messi before the ball was in the net. You win the ball so rarely in dangerous positions that these are the chances you need to take.<br><br><strong>Roberto Di Matteo is a lucky man </strong><br>The Chelsea manager seems to be able to channel contingency in his favour. In the past few weeks we’ve seen Chelsea scoring offside goals and goals where the ball doesn’t cross the line; last night he had the ball coming back off the bar, cleared off the line and Barca hitting the post in the last minute. He must hope his lucky streak holds.</p>

              <p>I saw the interview and Pep Guardiola looked frustrated and said chelsea defended with 11 men in the box! Not 11 men in their own half but 11 men in their box alone... lol.</p>
              <p>But I guess whatever works right?</p>
              <p>I hope Chelsea beat Barce on tue... I think it may happen as history isn't on Barce's side. And they played almost their full team against Real yesterday while Chelsea rested 8 players.</p>

              chelsea beat barcelona 1-2 at nou camp with Torres scoring the winning goal at 90th minute.
                  Liona messi missed a penalty.  How did they fail to beat a 10-men chelsea?
                  
                  Will di Matteo lose the final and end up like avrant grant?  
              Chelsea will be without Terry, mireles, ivanovic and Ramires in the final.

              <p>I don't understand why the Barcelona players keep saying the defeat was unjust. How is it unjust when it was clear that barcelona had no way around chelseas tactics?</p>
              <p>I think they just couldn't accept the fact that they had lost it, after the game had been served on a silver platter for them.</p>
              <p>1) Messi had the chance to sent barcelona through but he missed the penatly. They were unable to hold their lead despite having one extra men. I sitll think Messi is a world class player thou.</p>
              <p>2) 3 defenders were in their own half with Ramires when he counter attacked. Days prior to the first leg, Barcelona already knew what chelseas tactics were, which is to defend deep and find an target men on counter attack and yet failed to stop them despite knowing this?</p>
              <p>3) Barcelona had absoulty 0 ariel threat in the box.They just keep playing the ball on the ground and trying to stretch chelseas defense with through balls but chelsea were solid and pack men into their box.</p>
              <p>4) Victor Valdes is  one of the most overated goal keepers ever.</p>
              <p>5) Barcelona keep insisting they wasted a host of chances but it was chelsea who keep pressure on the Barcelona players and pressured them into wasting their chances. It was more credits to chelseas tactics honestly.</p>
              <p>As much as I wanted Barcelona to go through, some thing weren't meant to be. I think Guardiola bettter start worrying about barcelonas future because without Messi, Xavi or iniesta, Barcelona just look ordinary.</p>
              <p>And grats to chelsea even thou I think Real Madrid would proberly win the CL with so many unavailable players for chelsea. Lets not mention Real are also way more adaptable to different tactics and Mourinho knows most of the chelsea players inside out.</p>
