              <h1 class="titlestory">Evans has ambitions to be captain of Man Utd and Northern Ireland</h1>
              <p>Jonny Evans is not taking for granted his excellent start to his <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> career.</p>
              <p>The Northern Ireland international recognises that his career will
              only turn out well if he stays focused and continues to work hard.</p>
              <p>"I have played more games in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> than I expected but it is so easy to fall away so we needed full commitment," Evans  told the <em>News of the World.</em></p>
              <p>"You only have to look at this club to see how many young lads came through and played as many as 50 or 60 games.</p>
              <p>"They leave United and spend the rest of their career going down
              and down. It's hard to stay at the top and you have to keep pushing
              yourself every day.</p>
              <p>"That's why the medals I won last season just had to be put
              away immediately. They are now in a Marks and Spencer's bag back at
              home."</p>
              <p>Evans appreciates all the help he has received from United boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> but knows he must always strive to repay the faith shown in him.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> gives his players great support and that helps immensely," he said.</p>
              <p>"But you can't upset him and if he thinks you are taking your
              eye off football he has shown in the past that he is quite prepared to
              get rid of you.</p>
              <p>The 21 year old remains highly ambitious and hopes he can carve his own name into United folklore over the course of his career.</p>
              <p>"One day I would like to be captain of United and captain for my country," he said.</p>
              <p>"I want to get to the level that George Best and Sir Bobby Charlton  got to.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ryan Giggs</span></abbr> will be remembered here for many generations.</p>
              <p>"It would be nice to get somewhere near that level and be remembered as part of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>'s history."</p>
