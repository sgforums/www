              <p>I don't mind having tevez in Chelsea, but i really don't want to see Chelsea spending massive amounts of money anymore.</p>
              <p>I want to see the likes of Sturridge given the chance, but i don't know why Ancelotti doesn't seem to trust youngsters, maybe its the old italian mentality of only trusting those old and experienced ones.</p>

              <p>this guy has a pretty volatile temper. no matter what your manager does, you don't diss him in front of the whole world, no matter how pumped one's adrenalin is during or after the match.</p>
              <p>I wished man u could have kept him but it seems fergie had his reasons as well. He openly goaded fergie a few times when it was apparent that he may not be bought from his loan spell. Example was how after scoring one goal, ran to the united bench, he put his hands on his ears, gesturing to the crowd to cheer for him, doing all that in front of the gaffer.</p>

              <p>this puzzles me too.. it seems his primary reason for quitting is like shifting goal posts leh.. one min, family, then wages, then another PL club.</p>
              <p>Is it Tevez or Kia that is planning all these??</p>
              <p>Smart of MUFC to wash their hands, but if Chelsea want to try, go ahead. perhaps they may have better people management.</p>
