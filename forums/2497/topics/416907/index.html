              <p><span><strong>Mario Balotelli had to be separated from Manchester City teammate Jerome Boateng after the two players were involved in a furious bustup in training on Friday.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Balotelli, 20, reacted angrily to a tackle from behind by the 22-year-old Germany defender, who retaliated by grabbing the striker by the throat in front of manager Roberto Mancini and the rest of the squad.</span></p>
              <p><span>The two players appeared to make up afterwards but Mancini had words with his £23million signing from Inter Milan as he tried to calm him down.</span></p>
              <p><span>The confrontation will raise more concerns over Balotelli's suspect temperament after he was sent off for lashing out at West Brom last month. </span></p>
              <p><span>A City official insisted: 'It was a minor flare-up lasting a few seconds and a reflection of the competitive edge the players apply to training every day. It's not something we are remotely concerned about.'</span></p>
              <p><span>However, questions will once again be asked about the harmony in Mancini's dressing room following spats involving Emmanuel Adebayor and Vincent Kompany, and James Milner and Yaya Toure this season.</span></p>

              <p><span>'That's down to me and the club,' he added. 'The club might say, "If there's a chance to play, go and play". If not, I will have to stay here.</span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLOS TEVEZ is fuming with Roberto Mancini for subbing him so often.</h2>
              <p>Manchester City boss Mancini took off his skipper for the 11th time this season against Bolton.</p>
              <p>It is why the Argentine star exploded at the Italian in the 90th minute of City's 1-0 victory.</p>
              <p>A club insider said: "Carlos isn't happy he keeps getting taken off.</p>
              <p>"He wasn't tired against Bolton and was playing well, so didn't see why he should be replaced.</p>
              <p>"It has been happening all season and he cannot understand why Mancini keeps doing it to him."</p>
              <p>Tevez's frustration boiled over because he has scored in seven Premier League games for City this season and they have won them all.</p>
              <p>They have won only one when he has not scored.</p>
              <p>He feels he is more than doing his bit for his manager but is not being given the same respect in return.</p>
              <p>In contrast to Tevez, Spanish winger David Silva is the second most subbed City player - taken off just five times.</p>
              <p>Mancini has a stormy relationship with Tevez and claims that he is not bothered by his striker's touchline reaction.</p>
              <p>He said yesterday: "It is not a big thing.</p>
              <p>"I am happy when one player doesn't want to leave the pitch.</p>
              <p>"Tevez is very important for the team but I took the decision and I think it was the right decision."</p>
              <p>Only Bolton's Swedish forward Johan Elmander has been subbed more than Tevez this season.</p>
              <p>Boss Owen Coyle has withdrawn him 12 times.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=846343&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5739"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Tevez,
               26, has long been rumoured to be unhappy at Eastlands, but the latest 
              developments have shocked the club's billionaire owners, who may now 
              have to part with him in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>The 
              Argentine is reported to be stressed about living away from his two 
              daughters, who are in Argentina, while his relationship with City's 
              Italian manager, Roberto Mancini, has been stretched to breaking point.</p>
              <p>Tevez
               reacted angrily to being substituted by Mancini last weekend and now 
              wants out of the club who paid around £30 million to persuade him to 
              move away from Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The striker has netted 39 goals 
              in 60 games for the club and rose to captain the side, but has always 
              admitted that he has fallen out of love with the game and could walk 
              away from it at any minute.</p>
              <p>A close friend of Tevez told <em>ESPNsoccernet</em>:
                "There is no offer for him, and it is not far off to say that he might
               even walk away from football because of his personal problems."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Homesick Carlos Tevez has rocked Manchester City by telling them he wants to quit the club.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Tevez has shocked club officials by handing in an official written transfer request after deciding that he cannot carry on with his life in Manchester.</span></p>
              <p><span>The 26-year-old is said to be suffering distress at being separated from his two daughters, who live in Argentina, while his relationship with City's Italian manager, Roberto Mancini, has been stretched to breaking point.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But that is already out-of-date and City's wish to offer him a lucrative five-year deal in the summer is just a pipedream. The club would ideally want at least £35million for Tevez and that is if they can get their heads around losing him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But the player will hope they accept his personal reasons for wanting to leave. He has complained in the past about missing his family and he makes regular trips back to Argentina.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Although respected by other City players, his lack of fluent English means he often cuts an isolated figure and, significantly, he did not attend the club's Christmas party last Saturday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">A big admirer of City's previous manager, Mark Hughes, Tevez does not enjoy the same relationship with Mancini.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The pair clashed in the dressing-room at half-time during this season's home game against Newcastle and Tevez was visibly angered by being taken off against Bolton. </span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER CITY have turned down Carlos Tevez's shock transfer request.</h2>
              <p>The Argie striker is fed-up with boss Roberto Mancini and is desperate for a return home to be with his family.</p>
              <p>But the club have refused his plea and launched a fierce attack on his agent.</p>
              <p>A City statement read: "It is with disappointment that we confirm to our supporters that Carlos Tevez has submitted a written transfer request. The club can also confirm that the request has been rejected.</p>
              <p>"The club remains disappointed by this situation and particularly with the actions of Carlos' representative.</p>
              <p>"Roberto Mancini and all at the club have shown, and will continue to show, sensitivity to Carlos' personal circumstances including the issue of his family being based overseas.</p>
              <p>"Indeed following his suspension as a result of the game against Bolton, Carlos requested, and was given, special dispensation by the manager to take leave overseas.</p>
              <p>"The written transfer request is in stark contrast to Carlos' stated position in both public and club contexts.</p>
              <p>"Significantly, over recent months, the club has also received numerous requests from Carlos' representative to renegotiate and improve his playing contract as well as more recently a request to extend that contract by another year.</p>
              <p>"However, in line with the club's policy of not negotiating playing contracts mid-season this has not been granted.</p>
              <p>"Carlos' current five-year contract has three and a half years to run and he is the highest paid player at the Manchester City Football Club.</p>
              <p>"This is both an unfortunate and unwelcome distraction and the club will remain focused on the games ahead in what is turning out to be a very promising season. The door remains open for Carlos to be selected to play."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>It is surely no coincidence that in the week when Carlo Ancelotti, the Chelsea manager, suddenly appeared happy and announced he had the backing of the owner and money to spend, Carlos Tevez asked to leave Manchester City. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea is the only game left for Tevez in England now. He has burnt his bridges at Manchester United, Liverpool are currently off the radar as a destination for major talent and Arsenal do not sign £30million players. We don't know why, they just don't. Tevez would be too rich for Tottenham's blood, too.</span></p>
              <p><span>This leaves Chelsea, and a serious challenge to progress at City. Until now, all the talk has been of persuading world class players to join the club; nobody contemplated that as early as this winter they would need to coax one to stay. Trouble was predicted if City finished fourth or worse, but in the summer, not now. </span></p>
              <p><span>Bottom line: the Tevez issue shows how hard it is for a club, no matter its spending power, to break into the elite. Chelsea had been improving gradually for years when Jose Mourinho took over. He was the icing on the cake. By contrast, City had barely come back from the shops with the ingredients when Roberto Mancini arrived. Is it any wonder their concept seems at times half-baked?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Tevez is selfless on the field, but high maintenance off it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Occasionally, both elements of his nature emerge, as happened at Bolton. After his usual hard shift, Tevez confronted Mancini on the touchline when substituted. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The City boss took a huge risk this season by adding Mario Balotelli to an already incendiary mix at the club. Tevez has clashed with the Italy striker as well as his manager, and is said to be unhappy with the way the club is run.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">For all the talk of homesickness and disenchantment with football, unless Tevez wants out to return to play in South America - or makes good on a threat to retire from football completely - few will believe his transfer request is motivated by personal rather than professional matters. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">If the opportunity that piques his interest is a move to Chelsea, Tevez will be derided and his current employers made a laughing stock. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Selling him would represent a far greater public humiliation than the failed bid for Kaka, given the capital City made out of Tevez's signing when it happened. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Sir Alex Ferguson has always seemed disproportionately furious at those 'Welcome to Manchester' posters. He will be revelling in this. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">What happens next is fascinating. City - as expected - have rejected the transfer request, but the story does not necessarily end there. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">They can afford to keep Tevez, but a disaffected player is of no use, particularly if his mood alters and his form dries up, as it did for the Argentina star in the early months of last season. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">If City are ultimately driven to sell, particularly to Chelsea, their mission will be publicly redefined. The elite do not lose important contracted players to major rivals and, if they do, it is looked upon as a sign of weakness. If Tevez were sold to Chelsea, major transfer targets would look at City and wonder. </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The damage would be felt long beyond January and only winning the Barclays Premier League could reverse it. Can City achieve this without Tevez? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">His goals this season include winners against Chelsea, Blackpool and Bolton; it is hard to imagine City in the top four without him, let alone as champions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Yet if Sheik Mansour insists he stays - and remember this is no tantrum, but a formal, written transfer request made after talks with Garry Cook, the chief executive - tensions would rise. Such are the growing pains of a wannabe elite club. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Lose Mancini, and City bow to player power; lose Tevez, and the title may go to Stamford Bridge with him; keep both, and the training ground is a powder keg. Only City could wake up to a headache like this on the day they go joint top of the Premier League. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Welcome to Manchester? They most certainly are.</span></p>
