              <h1>WORLD CUP 2010: France 1 South Africa 2: Hosts sign off with a win 
              as French farce comes to a miserable end</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>France exited the World Cup at the first round stage with barely a 
              whimper 
              after this humbling defeat by the host nation at the Free State Stadium.</p>
              <p>Neither team will play a part in the business end of the 
              World Cup as Uruguay and Mexico took the top two places in Group A - the
               Mexicans finishing above South Africa on goal difference.</p>
              <p>On a
               day of drama Raymond Domenech stripped Patrice Evra of the captaincy 
              and 
              handed the armband to Alou Diarra instead.</p>
              <p>Then the coach, set to be replaced by Laurent Blanc, also saw his
               side reduced to 
              10 men after 26 minutes of this Group A game when Yoann Gourcuff was 
              sent off.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/22/article-0-0A260729000005DC-291_468x296.jpg" alt="Heads up: Khumalo (left) rises above the French defence to nod 
              home the opener" width="468" height="296">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Heads up: Khumalo (left) rises above the French 
              defence to nod home the opener</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Evra was dropped after the 
              squad boycotted a training session after striker 
              Nicolas Anelka was expelled following a row with Domenech.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United full-back cut a lonely figure on the bench 
              on another 
              dreadful day for France.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/22/article-1288685-0A264045000005DC-196_468x268.jpg" alt="They all count: Mphela doubles South Africa's lead from close 
              range" width="468" height="268">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>They all count: Mphela doubles South Africa's 
              lead from close range</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Yet they could have opened the scoring in the third minute when 
              Gourcuff 
              released Andre-Pierre Gignac. He had a clear sight of goal but only 
              succeeded in 
              drilling a shot into the arms of Moneeb Josephs.</p>
              <p>France were rocked in the 20th minute when South Africa made the 
              breakthrough, which led to pandemonium in the stadium.</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris failed to cut out a corner from Siphiwe 
              Tshabalala and 
              Bongani Khumalo took advantage to score with a header at the back post.</p>
              <p>It might have been worse for the former world champions five 
              minutes later 
              but Katlego Mphela dragged a shot narrowly wide of the post.</p>
              <p>France's troubles increased, however in the 26th minute when they
               were 
              reduced to 10 men with Gourcuff sent off by Colombian referee Oscar Ruiz
               for an 
              aerial challenge on Macbeth Sibaya.</p>
              <p>Domenech could not believe what was happening and held his head 
              in 
              frustration at seeing his side down on numbers.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/22/article-1288685-0A264DDE000005DC-636_468x493.jpg" alt="Bad to worse: Gourcuff receives his marching orders as Sibaya lies
               flat out" width="468" height="493">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Bad to worse: Gourcuff receives his marching 
              orders as Sibaya lies flat out</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>South Africa were growing in confidence and Tshabalala whipped a 
              free-kick 
              over the bar in the 34th minute before they extended their lead three 
              minutes 
              later.</p>
              <p>Mphela clipped the ball home after being sent up by Bernard 
              Parker with 
              France in disarray at the back.</p>
              <p>Steven Pienaar then found the net for South Africa but his effort
               was 
              disallowed and Mphela saw his shot turned around the post by Lloris.</p>
              <p>Malouda was introduced at the start of the second half but France
               were soon 
              pegged back. Parker sent his shot into arms of Lloris and Mphela's 
              effort 
              clipped the outside of the post.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Too little too late: Malouda can't mis</em><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/22/article-1288685-0A2676D4000005DC-34_468x300.jpg" alt="Too little too late: Malouda can't miss as he taps home France's

              taps home France's only goal</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>France could not contain Mphela and the goalkeeper did well to push 
              away his 
              powerful drive in the 58th minute.</p>
              <p>However South Africa were caught napping in the 70th minute and 
              failed to 
              track Malouda, who pulled a goal back following a cross from Franck 
              Ribery.</p>
              <p>That was as good as it got for France, whose only point in the 
              group came 
              against Uruguay.</p>
              <p>It was a bitter sweet win for South Africa as they have become 
              the first host 
              nation to be eliminated at the first round stage of the finals.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>in 1998 when the french won the world cup, gct at that time was still pm &amp; in his national day rally he said france won due the ft they have in the team. in the subsequent world cup gct was asked why france didn't win, he said not enough new ft....lol...i wonder what he has to say with the decline in french football now....if there's a parallel sg can draw from here is that while talents are good, they can be very destructive without loyalty...</p></div>

              <p>Ah, how the mighty have fallen. From grand finalists in 2006 to a mutinous rabble in 2010. The commentator was not far off the mark when he said that mobs would storm the Bastille over this utterly pathetic attitude they displayed. </p>
