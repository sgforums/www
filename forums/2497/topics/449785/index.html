              <p><span><strong>Manchester City have decided to offload Edin Dzeko at the end of the season in a move that had already alerted Juventus and Real Madrid.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>City manager Roberto Mancini has let it be known he will listen to offers for Dzeko after noting the striker’s unrest over limited opportunities in the starting line-up and sensing they will become even scarcer.</span></p>
              <p><span>Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho is a firm admirer of the 26-year old, while Juventus’ transfer priority this summer is to recruit a proven finisher who can give them the same cutting edge Zlatan Ibrahimovic provides for AC Milan.</span></p>
              <p><span>Real Madrid’s Gonzalo Higuain is the name at the top of Juve’s wanted list, but they are also considering the claims of Dzeko, Liverpool’s Luis Suarez and Internacional’s Tottenham target Leandro Damiao.</span></p>
              <p><span>Higuain looks like having a say in shaping Dzeko’s destiny after it emerged he also figures prominently on Mancini’s summer wish-list.</span></p>
              <p><span>Juventus bosses feel Ibrahimovic’s matchwinning flair for Milan is the only difference between the sides and have vowed to rectify their one shortcoming before the start of next season. </span></p>

              <p>The Manchester City boss plans a £37m double raid on Lille for striker Eden Hazard and left-back Lucas Digne.</p>
              <p>The Italian is desperate to avoid a repeat of the last three months that have shown his expensive squad found wanting after losing key midfielders and defenders to international duty and injury.</p>
              <p>His job is currently safe — but that could change if City continue to unravel during the last seven games starting with today’s clash at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>If Mancini does stay, he wants to ensure the same difficulties do not re-occur in 12 months time.</p>
              <p>He said: “We lost Yaya and Kolo Toure for the African Nations Cup, had some injuries and lost Vincent Kompany, Joleon Lescott and Sergio Aguero in the last two games. Maybe next year if we lose two important players, we can have another two good players and we can change.</p>
              <p>“We finished our job to build a strong team. Now it’s enough to put in three or four more players with a strong mentality.”</p>
              <p>Belgian superstar Hazard is high on City’s wishlist after Mancini made a personal check on the £30m-rated winger.</p>
              <p>Mancini also wants Digne, 18, a French youth international who recently broke into the first team.</p>
              <p>But the Italian reckons these last few weeks have shown United have the squad to go the distance.</p>
              <p>He said: “The difference is in 20 players, not the 11, and because they are used to staying on top, they play without problems.”</p>

              He really cmi.
              210 million in 2 years and only an FA cup to show?
              Might as well get a better manager.
              Isnt it true city started to unravel after the tevez problem?

              <p>I believe this is the curse of wealth, as applied to football teams.</p>
              <p>Mancini has forgotten the essence of what it takes to build a football team. Money can buy you good <strong>players</strong>, but it doesn't buy you a good <strong>team</strong>.</p>
              <p>In the end all you get is a bunch of money-minded primadonnas who are more concerned with their wealth than their team.</p>
              <p>He really should learn from Newcastle. They built a solid, well-rounded team with a much smaller budget than what he has.</p>

              <p>The main problem isn't just the players, the real problem is the pressure.</p>
              <p>Many teams don't really know the feeling until they really experienced it for themselves. How to handle it as it builds up week in, week out. Going into every match needing to win and yet afraid others will score against you kind.</p>
              <p>If we watch carefully, it's always the pressure time from Feb to May that you suddenly see good teams mis-passing, making mistakes, losing temper, feeling nervy that they normally don't earlier part of the season. Many have done so, even as far back as Kevin Keegan's Newcastle time. Arsenal done so the most cos of too many youngsters didn't know how to handle it. And even Chelsea, Mourinho's Chelsea in their 1st and 2nd year, they didn't have any problem cos they kind of won the title in Feb, Mar. However in his 3rd year when there was a real challenger putting pressure on his team. They just suddenly didn't know how to play their usual self. City is just starting to find out what it is and Mancini is also learning how it feels. But i think the experience gain will be useful to them in the future. It's not that he doesn't have a better squad of 20 players man for man to United, they didn't know how to handle the pressure as we see players like <span style="color: #000000;">Aguero, Dzeko, Nasri, Silva so good at the start, suddenly become nothing special. </span></p>
              <p>I bet once the title race is over, when the pressure is gone, you will see the City of old again.</p>

Saying Tevez will never play again at that moment, then take him back later when others have been doing all the hard work while he was halfway across he world playing golf ...

              <h1>Balotelli is 'finished' at City, says Mancini after striker is sent off in defeat at Arsenal</h1>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mancini even urged the FA to ban Balotelli for the rest of the season then claimed the bad boy’s career will be over in “two or three years” unless he changes his style.</strong></p>
              <p>The City boss was furious after Balotelli was shown two yellow cards and Manchester United opened up an eight-point lead with six Premier League games to play.</p>
              <p>Balotelli will now be sold this summer after his latest shame.</p>
              <p>The £25million striker was also lucky not to get a straight red card earlier for a shocking lunge on Arsenal’s Alex Song.</p>
              <p>When asked whether Balotelli will be sold, Mancini said: “Probably – but I don’t know. I am finished. We have six games and he will not play in the next six games.</p>
              <p>“I think that Mario should have been sent off after 10 minutes. Balotelli is a fantastic player, I can continue to play with Mario on the pitch but every time we’ll risk having him sent off.</p>
              <p>“He needs to change his behaviour if he wants to improve his life. I’ve seen players finished in two or three years with huge talent. He needs to change. He must change it. I hope for him he will.</p>
              <p>“He’s not a bad guy. He’s a fantastic player. But, at this moment, I’m very sorry for him because he continues to lose his talent, his quality.</p>
              <p>“I hope, for him, he can understand that he’s in a bad way for his future, and he can change his behaviour in the future.”</p>
              <p>Balotelli has already served two long bans for a red card and the FA took retrospective action for a stamp on Scott Parker.</p>
              <p>That means the FA could ban him for six games if referee Martin Atkinson admits he missed Balotelli’s earlier indiscretion and the case is reviewed by video evidence.</p>
              <p>City as good as surrendered the title due to Mikel Arteta’s late winner, which lifted Arsenal back up to third.</p>
