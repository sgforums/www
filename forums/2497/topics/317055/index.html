              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>JERMAINE JENAS reckons Tottenham are about to overtake Arsenal as North London's No 1 team.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Spurs star believes his side can mount a serious challenge for a Champions League spot next season.</p>
              <p class="article">And even though Tottenham are struggling for a top-10 finish this term, Jenas is convinced they can get the better of Arsene Wenger's men.</p>
              <p class="article">The England midfielder, 25, said: "We can definitely overtake Arsenal next year. We always want to climb and get as high as we can in the table, so hopefully if we can keep progressing we can top them.</p>
              <p class="article">“The Champions League is definitely the creme de la creme and although winning the Carling Cup was fantastic, I think a lot of people would sooner see us fighting for a Champions League place.</p>
              <p class="article">“If you look at the players that we’ve got we know full well that we’ve under-achieved in the league this season.</p>
              <p class="article">“Last year, all people were talking about was us finishing fourth and getting a Champions League place and look what happened.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s a tough league - only Newcastle and Everton have shifted Liverpool from that fourth spot in recent years.</p>
              <p class="article">“Apart from those two, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal have had those top four places for a long time.</p>
              <p class="article">“You look at the Champions League final this year and it proves how strong the Premier League is and how difficult it is to break into that top four.</p>
              <p class="article">“Don’t get me wrong, we want to be successful and every player wants to be playing Champions League football but it’s going to be tough and we’re going to have to work hard for it if we want it.</p>
              <p class="article">“Everyone’s looking at us as a positive club and one that’s moving forward but I can’t help but stress, especially after this season, we’ve <strong>GOT</strong> to do it.”</p>
              <p class="article">Jenas revealed much of the credit for Tottenham’s turnaround in fortunes has been down to the arrival of Juande Ramos as manager.</p>
              <p class="article">The Spaniard replaced the axed Martin Jol in October, with the club languishing in the relegation zone .</p>
              <p class="article">Since then, Spurs have climbed the table and won silverware for the first time since 1999 by beating Chelsea in the Carling Cup Final in February.</p>
              <p class="article">Jenas lines up against Liverpool at home tomorrow knowing victory against the Reds, coupled with West Ham dropping points against Aston Villa, will ensure a top-10 finish for the North Londoners.</p>
              <p class="article">Jenas said: “Juande has been fantastic for us. He’s come in and made us a good team and in making us a good team he’s allowed the likes of myself to have a lot more freedom.</p>
              <p class="article">“Whereas before I was covering too much ground or doing things that I shouldn’t have been doing, things not in my area for example, I was able to conserve that energy and put it into something more useful, getting forward and scoring more goals and creating more chances.</p>
              <p class="article">“He’s a manager who’s been there, done it and won things and he’s produced. He got us a trophy and started churning out some good performances from us.</p>
              <p class="article">“So in making us more solid as a unit he’s allowed us as individuals to express ourselves to the best of our ability.”</p>
              <p class="article">But Jenas insists Spurs need to learn how to kill teams off if they are to progress and challenge for further silverware next season.</p>
              <p class="article">The club have won just 11 league games all season but would have earned a higher-placed finish had they not squandered leads in some of the 13 games they have drawn this term.</p>
              <p class="article">Speaking at the launch of the PSP Go! Messenger service, Jenas added: “We need to be more clinical and get a killer instinct. There have been a number of games, especially towards the end of the season, where we went 1-0 up and were dominating the game.</p>
              <p class="article">“But then we took our foot of the pedal instead of going on and getting a second and third goal to kill the game off completely, so that’s where we definitely need to improve.”</p>
              <p class="article">Spurs have already made moves in the transfer market to bolster their striking options, with £16.5million Croatian star Luka Modric the latest signing in Ramos’ White Hart Lane revolution.</p>
              <p class="article">Jenas said: I’ve not met him yet but most of what I know of him is from the Croatia game against England.</p>
              <p class="article">“He was superb in that game, as were the whole Croatian side. He looks very technically gifted and very creative, like an old-fashioned No 10 , so it’s great to have him at the club.</p>
              <p class="article">“I think the club is going in the right direction - and showing the purpose to go in the right direction - which is all you ask for as a player and a fan.</p>
              <p class="article">“You want your team to be up there competing with the best and I think signing the likes of Luka is a statement of intent about where the club is going.”</p>
              <p class="article">One man crucial to Tottenham’s chances of tasting further success is Dimitar Berbatov, but rumours of a move away from White Hart Lane refuse to go away.</p>
              <p class="article">Jenas added: “Dimi’s a top player and he’s proved that for us over the last couple of years. If he’s got ambitions to be at the club or not be at the club then I’m sure we’ll see what happens come this summer, but I’m hopeful that he stays.</p>
              <p class="article">“He’s up there with the best I’ve played with. I’ve been fortunate to play with a number of top strikers and Dimi’s ability is second to none. He came here as a bit of an unknown to some but he’s proved what he’s worth.”</p>
              <p class="article">But despite improvements on the domestic front for Jenas, the former Newcastle ace is gutted by England’s failure to qualify for this summer’s European Championship.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "It was devastating not to qualify. It’s weird that we’re not going to be there this summer and as a team and as a player it was a really, really tough thing to get over.”</p>
              <p class="article">But after scoring for England in Fabio Capello’s first game in charge of the national side in the 2-1 friendly win over Switzerland in March, he is now targeting a regular place in the Three Lions’ starting eleven.</p>
              <p class="article">Jenas added: “I want to stake my claim for a starting place for the World Cup 2010 qualifiers. I want to be in there, it’s as simple as that.</p>
              <p class="article">“There are England shirts to be fought for and I want to be part of it. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard are top players and they’ve had those positions for a long time now, and rightly so.</p>
              <p class="article">“But I think it’s only right that the likes of myself, Gareth Barry and Owen Hargreaves are knocking on the door because I’m sure that’s what the England manager wants.”</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>‘<span style="color: #ff0000;">ARSENAL</span> are staring into the abyss’</strong> read SunSport yesterday — and I must agree.</p>
              <p class="article">When key players begin to leave a club at the top of their profession, you know something is wrong.</p>
              <p class="article">We’re not talking about a mid-table or lower club but one of the big four.</p>
              <p class="article">Mathieu Flamini has gone and Alex Hleb looks set to follow.</p>
              <p class="article">The message is simple — we are no longer at a club that is going anywhere.</p>
              <p class="article">I’m afraid Arsene Wenger has to stand accountable. There is no doubt he has created some great teams.</p>
              <p class="article">But the club have gone three years without a trophy.</p>
              <p class="article">The big problem is Wenger has fought shy of buying big-name players. It’s OK saying you are building a team as he is now.</p>
              <p class="article">But often you need big players for the here and now.</p>
              <p class="article">Big-name players bring on younger ones.</p>
              <p class="article">They also attract better quality. Dennis Bergkamp is the classic example.</p>
              <p class="article">He was bought just before Wenger arrived and I doubt whether the Dutchman would have been there had it been up to the Frenchman.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet as much as Eric Cantona kick-started things at Manchester United, so did Bergkamp at Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="article">The mentality under Wenger seems all wrong when the going has got tough of late.</p>
              <p class="article">Alex Ferguson tells his men ‘It’s us against them’. Wenger says ‘They are all against us’.</p>
              <p class="article">This persecution complex rubs off on players — as if fate decides what will happen to them rather than their own actions.</p>
              <p class="article">When Wenger first arrived he was a picture of composure. Now he resembles Basil Fawlty on the sidelines.</p>
              <p class="article">The Gunners have been hit by injuries this season. Yet Fergie has had to deal with that as well — likewise Avram Grant at Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">Four points does not look a big gap at the top with a game to go.</p>
              <p class="article">But it is huge in a title race that has been as tight as this.</p>
              <p class="article">You can play as much pretty football as you like but when trophies don’t follow, questions begin to be asked. And they need to be asked of Arsenal.</p>

Already they have started strengthening their team even before the season is over... Modric is a big player, his arrival shows their intent... and with an owner willing to support with his $$$, Spurs could add another 2 to 3 players to what they already have bought including Hutton and Woodgate... Gareth Bale return for next season could give them a very impressive looking defend... Now i belief they will be looking for a more able goalkeeper...</p></div>

              <p>I seriously belief Spurs could overtake the gunners very soon...
              maybe even next year... And with Berbatov to sell, it will add
              another 20 to 30 million to their transfer budget... And who knows,
              they my actually get Villa as his replacement... And in Modric,
              they may have a player as capable as Fabregas but more importantly,
              they have a cover for him in Jenas which gunners don't have for
              Fab...</p>

              <p>spurs can never overtake arsenal next season dispite 2 or 3 first team player at arsenal are leaving.</p>
              <p>reason?</p>
              <p>they dont have a reliable defence, babartov are leaving, lennon a 1/3 season player, and a unsteady goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>how many player ramos can buy? maybe  i think he need to buy 5-6 players of top quality to mount a challenge. spurs are just not churning enough good enough player from the youth academy.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i would gathered that Spurs wouldn't be able to overtake Arsenal next season, they might have looked strong with their current team but Arsenal shouldn't be written off just because some players are leaving, just like when Henry left they are being written off (i'm guilty as charged too) but they surprised everybody with a very strong run earlier this season, and as i've said, their failure is due to their lack in depth hence if they're to bring in a couple more players next season they'll still be in the running for top 4 come next season, whereas Spurs would probably still only be the top team below the top 4, strong as they are but probably wouldn't be able to last the pace of a season.</p></div>
