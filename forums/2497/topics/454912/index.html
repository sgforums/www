              <p><strong>Leighton Baines has admitted that cash-strapped Everton may be forced to sell him to Manchester United.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <p>Sunday Mirror Sport revealed in April that Sir Alex Ferguson had targeted the 27-year-old left-back as a replacement for Patrice Evra – and United are expected to step up their bid to land him by tabling a £12million offer this week.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="body ">
              <p>United are also ready to hijack Tottenham’s attempt to sign Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho from Porto by making a £30m bid.</p>
              <p>But landing Baines will be Ferguson’s next piece of business after spending £20m to recruit Shinji Kagawa from Borussia ­Dortmund and Nick Powell from Crewe last month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="captify" title="Nicked: Manchester United have already signed Nick Powell from Crewe Alexander" src="http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article879895.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Manchester+United's+new+signing+Nick+Powell+from+Crewe+Alexander+poses+with+Manchester+United's+Chief+Executive+David+Gill+" alt="Manchester United's new signing Nick Powell" width="615" height="625"></p>

              <p><strong>United were hoping to take advantage of Everton’s crippling financial situation by ­getting the England defender at a ­knock-down price of £5m.</strong></p>
              <p>Everton value Baines at £15m, but will ­accept less as they look to give ­manager David Moyes some funds of his own for summer signings.</p>
              <p>Baines is happy at Goodison Park after signing for his hometown club in a £6m deal from Wigan five years ago.</p>
              <p>But he is aware of both United’s interest and Everton’s track record in recent years of being forced to cash in on their best players.</p>
              <p>Baines said: “I’m aware of what’s been said about United, but I don’t know much beyond that.</p>
              <p>“It can be a problem for ­Everton given the financial situation at the club.</p>
              <p>“Over the years the manager has lost players I am sure he would have liked to have kept hold of.</p>
              <p>“Maybe the club has needed the money or maybe they have received a substantial bid for a player.</p>
              <p>“The club has always done good business in that sense because the manager has ­always done a good job bringing players in for a certain amount of money.</p>
              <p>“When players have moved on he (Moyes) has always been quite savvy about the way he has gone about his business.</p>
              <p>“Losing players hasn’t really hindered us because the team never seems to perform worse than it did before.</p>
              <p>“Maybe it would have been nice, though, to have hung on to some of the players that have left, added a couple ourselves, and ­actually improved as a team.”</p>
              <p>United are also tracking Moutinho ­following his outstanding performances for Portugal at Euro 2012.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>The 25-year-old was being earmarked by Tottenham as a replacement for Luka Modric if the Croatian midfielder moves to Real ­Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>But Moutinho’s head has been turned by the new interest from Old Trafford – and United have been told that they will get their man if a fee can be agreed with Porto.</p>
              <p>Moutinho has a £40m buy-out clause in his contract, but a bid of around £30m would persuade Porto to sell.</p>
              <p>He was signed for Porto by Andre Villas-Boas two years ago and was expected to follow his former boss to White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson knows he must strengthen his midfield after being forced to bring Paul Scholes back out of retirement last season as great rivals Manchester City took the title.</p>
