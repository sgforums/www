              <h2>ALMUNIA SEES WENGER `SUFFERING`</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia believes manager Arsene Wenger is "suffering" from the club's lack of silverware.</p>
              <p>The Gunners have failed to lift a trophy since they defeated Manchester United on penalties in the 2005 FA Cup final.</p>
              <p>Wenger's side have since come close to glory but ultimately
              fallen at the final hurdle in both Champions League and League Cup
              showpieces.</p>
              <p>Wenger remains confident ahead of the new season that glory is
              on the horizon, and Almunia is hopeful his boss is soon rewarded for
              his efforts.</p>
              <p>"When time passes and you don't win anything it's not easy for the boss," said Almunia.</p>
              <p>"You can see the face of the boss every day. It is calm and
              relaxed but I think, inside, he is suffering because he can't give the
              people what they want. And the patience of people can run out.</p>
              <p>"The boss is very experienced, and puts a lot of effort into
              doing things differently - in not spending money and giving
              opportunities to young people.</p>
              <p>"I hope, and I think, he will be rewarded one day. It's a long period without anything being won.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal is a big, big club and people are not happy with
              semi-finals. People want celebrations and street parties. As players we
              need that too, to have us touching medals, to have something in our
              hands we can always remember.</p>
              <p>"Semi-finals will not be very well remembered in a few years. People need something more."</p>
              <p>Spain-born Almunia also confirmed he is continuing to consider
              applying for a British passport as he weighs up the possibility of
              playing for England.</p>
              <p>"I've been informed what I need to do (to gain British citizenship)," he told the <em>Guardian</em>.</p>
              <p>"If I take the decision I don't think it's difficult to get citizenship. It could be very quick - and soon.</p>
              <p>"I have to see what people think because it's not an easy decision. I'm 32 so I don't want any problems with anyone.</p>
              <p>"This is not a silly thing. You are playing with the hearts of
              people. It [an England cap] is not something you can buy in a shop. I
              don't want to disturb anybody."</p>
