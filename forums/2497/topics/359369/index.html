              <h3>MANCHESTER CITY are ready to splash £18million on Liverpool's Xabi Alonso.</h3>
              <p>City boss Mark Hughes can get his man for the right price as Kop manager Rafa Benitez edges closer to the £8m signing of Aston Villa's Gareth Barry. </p>
              <p>Benitez is not actively trying to sell Alonso but a mega-City bid for the Spanish playmaker will be accepted. Liverpool hope City's interest will flush out other bids but Alonso would need persuading to move. </p>
              <p>If he is forced out of Anfield, the 27-year-old would prefer a move to long-term admirers Real Madrid or Arsene Wenger's Arsenal. </p>
              <p>But moneybags City could blow their rivals away as Hughes looks to build a team capable of qualifying for the Champions League. </p>
              <p>A source close to City said: "Alonso has proved this season that he is the type of player Hughes needs. He is totally at home in English football, has great experience and he would fit straight in. </p>
              <p>"City do need strong characters because everybody has seen the problems Robinho has been causing behind the scenes. It's down to the player. There are other clubs looking but financially Liverpool and Alonso will not find a better deal."</p>

              <p>this city is really bonkers.. instead of throwing their target lists around, why don't they really focus on how they want to play, and get the necessary players..</p>
              <p>given their wealth, they could pluck good technical players from serie A, La Liga, German league or else, get some scouts out to Eastern block, where Serbia or even Russian. Instead, they are trying to dig other teams' mainstay where they have to pay thru their noses and worse, U have to suffer at their wages demand.</p>
              <p>I do hope that they can dig out some real gems and proft EPL as a whole.</p>

              <p>RAFA Benitez today claimed Xabi Alonso’s quality is making him a marked man for Liverpool’s Premier League opponents – as the Reds boss prepares to do without the services of his midfield playmaker at West Ham.</p>
              <p>An ankle injury has forced Alonso out of Liverpool’s clash with the Hammers this evening, meaning the Reds boss will have to make at least one enforced change to his starting line up.</p>
              <p>The Spanish midfielder has failed to recover from the knock picked up following a dangerous lunge by Newcastle’s Joey Barton last weekend.</p>
              <p>Though Benitez has refused to publicly criticise Barton for the challenge he believes the fact that the Newcastle man became the sixth player this season to be sent off for a foul on Alonso suggests a pattern is clearly emerging.</p>
              <p>“I think it is because he is a holding midfielder with quality and all the other teams know that if they push him and put him under pressure it will be more difficult for us,” said Benitez.</p>
              <p>“That is the only reason for me. It is not because he is aggressive or has bad behaviour on the pitch or anything like that.</p>
              <p>“It’s just because he has quality.</p>
              <p>“The majority of teams play defensively and also put one player close to him and it is just because he has quality.”</p>
