              <h1>WORLD CUP 2010: England suffer shattering blow with captain Rio 
              Ferdinand ruled out of tournament<br></h1>

              <p>England's World Cup plans have been thrown into chaos with Rio 
              Ferdinand ruled out of the tournament with a knee injury.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand
               was taken to hospital in South Africa for a scan after sustaining an 
              injury to his left knee during the final moments of Friday's training 
              session in Rustenburg.</p>
              <p>He left hospital on crutches and has 
              since returned to England's training headquarters.</p>
              <p>Sportsmail 
              understands Ferdinand will be sidelined for at least three weeks, ending
               any hopes of playing in the finals.</p>
              <p>Tottenham defender Michael 
              Dawson is on his way to South Africa having been called up as an 
              emergency standby.</p>

              <p>The huge blow comes just eight days before England's World Cup 
              campaign kicks off against the United States.</p>
              <p>Ledley
              King and Jamie Carragher will both now fancy their chances of a place
              in England's defence for their World Cup opener on June 12.</p>

              <p>'He has 
              just gone to hospital for a scan. We hope it will not be so bad

              <p>Vice-captain Steven Gerrard will now wear the captain's armband in 
              South Africa.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand had been optimistic of enjoying an 
              injury-free World Cup after a season dogged by problems at Manchester 
              United.</p>
              <p>He made just 21 appearances for his club this
              season, starting only 13 Premier League games, in a season disrupted by
              a back injury.</p>

              <p>Didier Drogba is set to miss out on the World Cup after breaking his 
              arm in Ivory Coast's friendly match with Japan.</p>
              <p>Drogba 
              collapsed under a heavy challenge with Marcus Tanaka, just minutes after
               the opposition defender had deflected the Chelsea striker's free-kick 
              into his own net. </p>
              <p>Team spokesman Eric Kacou confirmed that 
              doctors had diagnosed the arm fracture after he was taken off 15 minutes
               into the Elephant's 2-0 friendly win.</p>
              <p>Kacou said: 'It is a 
              fracture in his right arm. The doctor hasn't said yet whether he can 
              play in the World Cup.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Agony: Drogba appeared to be in some pain 
              straight after the tackle from Tanaka</p>
              <p>And manager Sven Goran 
              Eriksson conceded that losing Drogba would be a huge blow to his side's 
              chances in South Africa.</p>
              <p>He said: 'It's very worrying, he is our captain, one of the best 
              strikers in the world. It [his challenge] wasn't bad or stupid. He 
              didn't want to hurt anyone. Football is a game of contact '</p>
              <p>The 
              injury is devastating news for the team as Drogba was in sparkling form 
              for Chelsea last season.</p>
              <p>He scored 37 goals in 44 appearances as 
              Carlo Ancelotti's men landed the Premier League and FA Cup double.</p>

              <p>yes you are right. england always disappoints and fail to deliver when the competition started. england played sucky football, long balls to strikers and midfield cant even string 5-6 passes without losing possession. how to be a world beater with this brand of football. it has been a pain to watch england play like this for the past 10 years.</p>

              <p><br>so far I have not seen Gerrard do it in an england shirt. I hope he does, but I doubt so. even messi, for his mazy dribbling skills, is not able to do it in an argentina shirt so far, but then messi is only 22 and gerrard is 30 already.</p>

              <p>Nigeria suffered a blow just under a week away fromn the start of the
               World Cup as they announced that star midfielder Mikel John Obi had 
              been left out of the squad because he did not want to aggravate a knee 
              injury.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old Chelsea star - who follows club team-mates
               Michael Ballack, Michael Essien and possibly Didier Drogba in missing 
              out on the finals because of injury - is likely to be replaced by one of
               the seven players dropped from the squad at their training camp in 
              England last Monday.</p>
              <p>"We have dropped Mikel from the World Cup 
              squad after he told the team he did not want to put his career at risk 
              as his knee injury has yet to fully heal after a recent surgery," 
              disclosed top team official Emmanuel Attah on Saturday morning.</p>
              <p>Nigeria
               are drawn in Group B along with two-time champions Argentina, Euro 2004
               winners Greece and 2002 World Cup semi-finalists South Korea and play 
              their first match on June 12 against Argentina.</p>

              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Netherlands winger Arjen Robben had to limp off with an injury 
              during the 6-1 friendly win over Hungary.<br><br>The Bayern Munich man 
              came on as a second half substitute and scored just past the hour mark 
              and again ten minutes from time, but failed to finish the game when he 
              was taken off four minutes from the end.<br><br>Robben attempted a 
              backheel but crumbled to the ground in pain as he clutched his left leg 
              in pain with what looked like a suspected hamstring pull. He was able to
               get back on to his feet to trudge off the pitch with the assistance of 
              the medical team.<br><br>There were worrying scenes as Robben went 
              straight down the tunnel into the dressing room accompanied by Dirk Kuyt instead of 
              just getting treatment on the bench.<br><br>According to Dutch TV, 
              Robben has since been taken to hospital for MRI scans on his hamstring 
              and Oranje coach Bert van Marwijk has confirmed that the 26-year-old 
              winger will not travel with the rest of the squad to South Africa
