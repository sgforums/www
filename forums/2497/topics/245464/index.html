We might need a bit longer than 115 seconds, Steve.<br><br>1. Was Frank Lampard fit to play against Andorra on Wednesday night?<br><br>2. Was Lampard dropped?<br><br>Advertisement3. If he was dropped, why was McClaren afraid to admit it?<br><br>4. Did the condition of Lampard's wrist injury deteriorate before or after McClaren had told the players the team?<br><br>5. If Lampard had been ruled out by his wrist injury, why did England doctor Leif Sward tell a reporter from Sky Television he was fit minutes before Wednesday night's game?<br><br>6. If Lampard was fit, why wasn't he sitting on the England bench?<br><br>7. Were England's medical team able to provide a cast for Lampard's injured arm that would have been acceptable to the match officials?<br><br>8. Did McClaren offer Lampard a place among the England substitutes and if not, why not?<br><br>9. If McClaren was only forced to leave Lampard out because of injury, was he really going to drop Owen Hargreaves, the man he had described a couple of weeks earlier as the team's 'glue', if Lampard had been fit?<br><br>10. If Lampard was fit, as Sward said, why did McClaren allow the FA to release a statement saying he had not picked Lampard because he was injured?<br><br>11. Will Lampard start the match away in Estonia in June?<br><br>12. Why did McClaren attend a meeting called by Lampard on Wednesday afternoon and also attended by an FA official?<br><br>13. Was there, in fact, more than one meeting surrounding the issue of Lampard's absence?<br><br>14. Were the FA complicit in a cover-up over Lampard's position?<br><br>15. Why were other England players astonished by McClaren's refusal to clarify the position over Lampard?<br><br>16. Has McClaren's authority over the England team now been fatally undermined?<br><br>17. Do FA board members know about the issues surrounding Lampard's non-involvement in the match?<br><br>18. If they do, will that affect their loyalty towards McClaren?<br><br>19. Is it acceptable to the FA that their manager does not consider himself accountable to the decent majority of England supporters?<br><br>20. Is McClaren's mismanagement of the whole issue the final mistake that will force him out of the England job?<br></div>
