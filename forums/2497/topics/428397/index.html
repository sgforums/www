              <h1>Real Madrid 1 Barcelona 0 (aet): Head boy Ronaldo claims Copa del Rey glory for Jose</h1>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Jose Mourinho won the Spanish Cup thanks to a towering extra-time header from Cristiano Ronaldo and then declared: ‘Just keep calling me a trophy-winning coach.’ </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Real Madrid boss had been accused by former Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff of being only a ‘titles manager’ and, after winning his first silverware in Spain,he said: ‘A few days ago someone called me “a coach for winning titles and not a coach for playing football”. Well, thanks very much, I like being a coach who wins trophies.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho disappeared down the tunnel at the final whistle as his players celebrated the club’s 18th Spanish Cup. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>‘The game was over and I went to the dressing room and tried to call my family,’ he said. ‘I rested a bit and let the players enjoy their moment. We were better in the first half and they were better in the second half but we came good at the end.’ </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The clasico cup final was a gruelling marathon for Madrid, who dominated the first half, lost control of the game in the second, and then won it in the 102nd minute with Ronaldo’s 42nd goal of the season — his first in open play against Barcelona. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The first half was a story of near misses for Ronaldo, played at centre forward and a constant threat with Mesut Ozil supplying the ammunition from midfield. He failed to get contact on to a superb Ozil through-ball and then fired straight at Pinto from the same player’s pass. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">With the usually faultless Sergi Busquets misplacing passes in midfield, Barca enjoyed none of their usual domination of possession.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">An enraged Mourinho left his dug-out to vent his anger when Xabi Alonso took a free-kick short instead of hitting it long to Ronaldo and that summed up the game plan. </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p> </p>

              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;">But though the football was direct it was swift and effective and had Pepe’s header gone in instead of hitting the crossbar at the end of the first half it would given Madrid a deserved lead.    </span></p>
              <p class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Barcelona were a different side after the break with Messi rejuvenated and Ronaldo looking more isolated. The Argentine’s pass sent Pedro through and the Spain World Cup winner wheeled away to celebrate only for the flag to go up for offside. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Mourinho reacted by replacing the tiring Ozil with Emmanuel Adebayor, who was booked immediately for flattening Javier Mascherano. Casillas then saved brilliantly from Messi, Villa and Iniesta as Madrid hung on. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But they had the last chances of normal time with Ronaldo and Angel Di Maria going close and in the first period of extra time they finished the job as Ronaldo finally delivered. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho, who claimed his 18th title and has now won a trophy every year since 2003, will hope to get the better of Barca again when they meet in the Champions League semi-final.</span></p>

              <p>mourinho is a tactical genuis. He played his midfield high up into barca's defence and retreated them whenever barca moved near the centre line. This made barca's midfield congested and they couldn't do their usual short passing. The madrid players were also very charged up and they pressed on every ball, read many crosses correctly and it was a surprise cosndiering that just a few days ago in la liga, barca had 70% of possession at the bernabeu.</p>
              <p>Then 2nd half came and real lost quite a bit of vigour due to the intense running in the first half. Barca were launching wave after wave of attacks and then after a while, madrid fought back and began launching counter attacks with breathtaking pace. The game plan wouldn't have worked if ronaldo hadn't been super fit. He's been sprinting up and down non-stop....gotta give credit to him. He's got a bad boy reputation but last night, he ran the entire 120 mins....very very fit of him.</p>
              <p>I would think that mourinho is very lucky. He could have lost to what I thought was a legitimate barca goal ruled offside. Then again, he's said before: "The luck of champions." I am going to watch the barca madrid home and away matches next week!!</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">After Cristiano Ronaldo's terrific header settled a cagey Copa del Rey final in extra time, Real took to the streets of the Spanish capital on an open top bus to celebrate not just the claiming of the trophy but also getting one over on the old enemy, Barcelona.</span><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span>And it seems those jubilant scenes got all too much for defender Sergio Ramos who, as he balanced the giant</span><span> 15kg</span></span><span style="font-size: small;"> piece of silverware on his head, somehow let loose his grip and dropped the cup beneath the wheels of the bus. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">World Cup winner Ramos later claimed the trophy was 'ok', but television pictures showed emergency services gathering up the broken pieces and returning them to the team on board. The cup was then absent from the traditional celebration spot of the Plaza de Cibeles in central Madrid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Later, the Spain defender made light of the incident on Twitter.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Madrid's victory in the second of four 'clasicos' secured a first domestic cup in 18 years and handed Jose Mourinho's side the momentum going into next week's Champions League semi-final showdown with their Catalan rivals.</span><span style="font-size: small;"><br></span>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The victory also maintains Mourinho's record of having won a trophy every year since 2003, excluding 2007/08 when he was not in club management. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Spanish reports said 60,000 fans gathered at Cibeles to celebrate the club's first silverware under coach Jose Mourinho.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'After two complicated years, winning the Copa del Rey is a relief,' Madrid captain Iker Casillas said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">P.S.</span> So while Barcelona slipped off to lick their wounds and plot revenge on Madrid, </span><span>Gerard Pique probably found it a little easier to get over </span><span>the cup final defeat as he was greeted in the stands with  a kiss from one of the planet's most desirable women, who just so happens to be his girlfriend </span><span>Shakira. </span></span></p>

              <p>mourinho is a tactical genuis. He played his midfield high up into barca's defence and retreated them whenever barca moved near the centre line. This made barca's midfield congested and they couldn't do their usual short passing. The madrid players were also very charged up and they pressed on every ball, read many crosses correctly and it was a surprise cosndiering that just a few days ago in la liga, barca had 70% of possession at the bernabeu.</p>
              <p>Then 2nd half came and real lost quite a bit of vigour due to the intense running in the first half. Barca were launching wave after wave of attacks and then after a while, madrid fought back and began launching counter attacks with breathtaking pace. The game plan wouldn't have worked if ronaldo hadn't been super fit. He's been sprinting up and down non-stop....gotta give credit to him. He's got a bad boy reputation but last night, he ran the entire 120 mins....very very fit of him.</p>
              <p>I would think that mourinho is very lucky. He could have lost to what I thought was a legitimate barca goal ruled offside. Then again, he's said before: "The luck of champions." I am going to watch the barca madrid home and away matches next week!!</p>

              <p><br>I think Barce is more keen on the bigger prize at stake... Resting Carles Puyol and Victor Valdes in this seems rather strange...</p>
              <p>They will play each other again very soon...</p>

              <h1>Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2: Messi's wonder goal brings light to game of shame in Spain </h1>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/04/27/article-1381233-0BCCD87100000578-962_634x433.jpg" alt="Messi magic: Two goals from Barca's talismanic forward settled the first leg" width="634" height="433"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Messi magic: Two goals from Barca's talismanic forward settled the first leg</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>For those who came to Madrid in search of pure football, Lionel Messi supplied it with a flash of brilliance three minutes from time. Until then, it was pure poison. Tense and disjointed as a football match, truly absorbing as a piece of theatre.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Real Madrid's Pepe was sent off for lunging over the ball at Daniel Alves, Jose Mourinho was ordered into the stands for persistently disputing the decision and Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper was dismissed for his part in a tunnel skirmish.</span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Messi scored both goals. The first, a deft finish at the near post. The second, a divine piece of skill, a jinking dribble from almost halfway capped with a precise finish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It was a beautiful goal from a beautiful player but this was far from beautiful football. At times it was downright ugly, undoubtedly influenced by the proximity to two previous games in this El Clasico series and an inflammatory verbal duel between Mourinho and Pep Guardiola on the eve of this Champions League semi-final.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As Barca's players cavorted in celebration after the final whistle, referee Wolfgang Stark left the pitch beneath two police riot shields and UEFA locked both teams inside the dressing rooms for a 'cooling off ' period. Expect the sanctions to fly - mainly in the direction of the Real manager.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho can expect to be banned from the touchline for next week's second leg. Sergio Ramos will also be missing in the Nou Camp next week, having collected a booking, as will Pepe.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/04/27/article-1381233-0BCCC60200000578-82_634x452.jpg" alt="Flashpoint: Players and club officials clash as the two teams head to the tunnel at half time" width="634" height="452"></span>
              <p class="imageCaption">Flashpoint: Players and club officials clash as the two teams head to the tunnel at half time </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>This did not prevent Mourinho launching into another controversial monologue after the defeat, accusing UEFA of conspiring to help Barcelona. This time, Guardiola refused to engage in the squabble.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Guardiola's team did themselves little credit either, guilty of diving and play-acting, pressurising the referee. This was as unpalatable as any of Real's dirty tricks. Where they can take some plaudits is for their philosophy. Never did they stop trying to pass the ball and attack a team sent out to draw 0-0.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Early on, Ramos misjudged a header on halfway and pawed it down with his hand. Stark and his assistants missed the offence and the visitors were spitting mad, crowding the German referee, hands on heads in shock.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Seeing red: Pepe receives his marching orders for a late challenge in the second half</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Barca passed and passed. Xavi caught a volley sweet from 25 yards but it was straight at Iker Casillas, then David Villa ducked in from the right and curled a low shot inches wide of the far post.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Cristiano Ronaldo became frustrated as the visitors zipped the ball around him. At one point, midway through the first half, he threw his hands down in anger and refused to chase any more. He stood and sulked, hands on hips, inside the centre circle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ronaldo glanced right, seeking encouragement from Mourinho.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">None came. The Bernabeu crowd registered its disapproval and he stirred into life again but the former Manchester United winger was never at his electrifying best. There is unlikely to be a Wembley reunion with Sir Alex Ferguson, who was in Madrid to see the game.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Pepe forced a save of sorts from Victor Valdes, with a header from an Alonso free-kick. Real were tempted out a little more, with Marcelo becoming influential from left back, linking with Angel di Maria.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This would prove to be their best spell but it was soon eclipsed by more confrontation. Barcelona claimed Di Maria had dived when Stark booked Alves as half-time loomed.</span> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Pedro was checked by Alvaro Arbeloa as he broke on a counterattack and the Barca striker rolled on the turf clutching his face in an at tempt to get the former Liverpool defender into trouble.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Guardiola had to be restrained as he tried to invade the pitch and opponents clashed. Barcelona players were miming use of the elbow at the referee but replays showed there was no elbow involved and Pedro had over-reacted. Sergio Busquets was soon at it, too, writhing in faux agony after being brushed off the ball as Marcelo rampaged forward.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Another skirmish erupted as the players and staff funnelled into the tunnel at half-time. Ramos, Seydou Keita and Valdes were all involved and Mourinho's sidekick Rui Faria was not far away but it was Jose Pinto, Barcelona's reserve keeper, who pushed a UEFA delegate and was dismissed during the interval.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Pinto has a reputation for misbehaviour on the bench. Earlier this season, he was punished for mimmicking the referee's whistle and stopping opponents in their tracks.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Mourinho replaced Mesut Ozil with Emmanuel Adebayor at halftime. He had started with the same system he used in last week's Copa del Rey final win, with Ronaldo and Di Maria as wide strikers and Ozil drifting behind them. They did not ave enough possession to make it work, so on came Adebayor to hold the ball up. He had little effect either. Not much you can do without the ball.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ramos was shown yellow in the second half when he checked Messi in full flight. Javier Mascherano was also booked for an innocuous trip which had Pepe flipping around.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The next card was red for Pepe for a studs-up challenge on Alves. The Bernabeu revolted and Mourinho applauded sarcastically. Had he left it at that, he would probably have escaped but he continued his dissent, sticking up his thumbs and shouting on to the pitch. The Special One was sent to the stands.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Amid the chaos, Messi pounced with his 51st and 52nd goals of the season. After the second, the little Argentine turned to soak the applause from the small section of Barcelona fans wedged into a top corner of the Bernabeu. Various objects rained down on him from the tiers of white.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It was that kind of night.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho has conceded that his side have no chance of reaching the Champions League final after </strong><a href="/report?id=315488&amp;cc=5739"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><strong>a 2-0 first-leg defeat</strong></span></a><strong> to rivals Barcelona at the Bernabeu.</strong></p>
              <p>Mourinho was sent to the stands in a tempestous game that saw Barcelona substitute goalkeeper Pinto sent off at half-time, before Madrid midfielder Pepe was dismissed for a tackle on Javier Mascherano. Lionel Messi exploited the space to claim a late brace and now Mourinho feels his side are out of the tie.</p>
              <p>"The return game is mission impossible,'' he told the press after the game. ''Barcelona has qualified for the final. Sometimes I feel disgusted about this football world of ours. Yes, we have already been knocked out.</p>
              <p>''We had the intention to keep the game at 0-0, then bring on a striker, then a third phase with a No. 10 behind three forwards. But the ref didn't allow it.''</p>
              <p>Mourinho continued his post-match rant by targeting Barcelona's record of playing against ten-men in the competition, most notably their win over Chelsea in the semi-final in 2009.</p>
              <p>"I just have one question: Why?,'' he added. ''Why Ovrebo [Chelsea vs. Barcelona referee in 2007 semi-final], Busacca [Barcelona vs. Arsenal in this year's Champions League], Stark? In each semi-final it is the same. We are talking about an absolutely fantastic team. Why didn't Chelsea make the final? Why did Inter have to be saved by a miracle?</p>
              <p>''Congratulations to Barcelona. But I just do not understand why Barcelona always receive the help of the referee. All my life I will be asking myself this question, and one day I hope to receive an answer.</p>
              <p>''I am not too sad, I have a great family. But I don't understand why Barcelona have this power. It happened two years ago to Chelsea (in the 2009 semi-finals), almost to my Inter last year, and also to Arsenal this year.</p>
              <p>''Why do the opponents of Barcelona always have a man sent off? Where does this power come from? Maybe it is to give more publicity to UNICEF, maybe because of the power of (Spanish federation president Jose Angel) Villar in UEFA.''</p>
              <p>Turning his attention to Pep Guardiola, Mourinho said: ''Barcelona are a great team on and off the pitch, but winning like that doesn't leave the same taste.</p>
              <p>''I have already won two Champions Leagues, and I won them on the pitch, with two teams that weren't Barcelona. I won one with Porto, a small team from a weaker league. And I won another with Inter, sweating and fighting hard.</p>
              <p>''Josep Guardiola is a fantastic football coach, but the Champions League he won was an embarrassment because of what happened at Stamford Bridge - it was a scandal. And if he wins it this year, he will win after the scandal at the Bernabeu. Let's hope he gets the chance to win a clean Champions League (in future), without scandals.</p>
              <p>''Guardiola deserves to win a Champions League normally. That's what I wish because he is a very good coach who I respect as a person for his fantastic treatment in four years with him.</p>
              <p>''I respect him a lot as a coach and as a person, I hope that one day he will win a clean Champions League, with no incidents behind it.''</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, who was largely anonymous as an attacking presence during the game and showed visible frustration with the way Madrid were playing said: "Do I like to play in a defensive team like Madrid? No, but I have to adapt to what the coach wants.</p>
              <p>"Playing against 10 men isn't easy. 0-0 would have been a good result. 2-0 is very difficult. Messi played very well, but it's easier against ten."</p>
              <p>However, Ronaldo also agreed with his coach's assessment of how Barcelona extend their influence over the game.</p>
              <p>"It's always the same with them [Barcelona]. This is the fourth consecutive season that something like this has happened. [Jose] Mourinho is right, just look at what happened with Arsenal, Chelsea and Inter," he added. "They [Barcelona] are a fantastic team, but they also have a lot of influence, both on and off the pitch."</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Barcelona have confirmed a board meeting will be held later today as the club consider action against Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho implied the Catalan giants receive favourable treatment from referees and claimed the club had yet to win a 'clean' Champions League title under Pep Guardiola.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The outburst came shortly after Guardiola's side won 2-0 at the Bernabeu in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final with the Portuguese particularly angry at the dismissal of makeshift midfielder Pepe for a challenge on Dani Alves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Barcelona's directors are due to convene at 5pm to discuss how best to move forward.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A statement on the club's website this morning read: 'There will be an 'extraordinary' meeting of the board to discuss the action to be taken after the events of the Bernabeu.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Later there will be a press conference (6pm BST).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'At the press conference after the game, Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho harshly criticised referee Wolfgang Stark and suggested Barcelona receive favourable treatment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The Legal Services of FC Barcelona are considering reporting the Real Madrid coach to the Disciplinary Commission of UEFA.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho's anger stemmed from the decision of German referee Wolfgang Stark to send off Pepe for a foul on Dani Alves on the hour mark, with the former Chelsea boss being sent to the stands too for his protests. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho said: 'Guardiola is a fantastic coach, but he has won one Champions League which I would be ashamed to win after the scandal at Stamford Bridge and this year, if he wins it again, it will be after the scandal at the Bernabeu. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I hope that one day he will win a clean Champions League, with no incidents behind it.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The first 'scandal' Mourinho was referring to was the Champions League semi-final between Barca and Chelsea in 2009, when the Catalan club progressed through to the final following a controversial second leg in London. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Andres Iniesta's injury-time strike earned Barca an away-goals win, but at the final whistle Chelsea's players confronted referee Tom Ovrebo, who had waved away at least four penalty appeals during the game. Barca would go on to beat Manchester United in the final. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho, who last season saw his Inter Milan side reduced to 10 men in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final at Barca but still progressed through to the final, did not stop there either in his post-match rant last night.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He added: 'Today it's clear that against Barcelona you have no chance. 'I don't understand why. I don't know if it's the publicity of UNICEF (the club's shirt sponsor), I don't know if it's the friendship of (Spanish football federation president Angel Maria) Villar at UEFA, where he is vice-president, I don't know if it's because they are very nice, but they have got this power. The rest of us have no chance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Why couldn't Chelsea reach the final two years ago? It was a miracle that Inter reached the final last year. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I am here just to ask this question and I hope to get the answer one day.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, Barca boss Guardiola is not assuming the tie is already over heading into next week's second leg at the Nou Camp. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We are a step away from the final, but we will carry on respecting Madrid, very, very much,' said Guardiola, who refused to respond to questions about Mourinho's comments. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho remains defiant despite facing disciplinary action by UEFA following his 'inappropriate comments' after Wednesday's Champions League home defeat to Barcelona.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Portuguese manager implied after his team's 2-0 loss to Barca in their semi-final first leg that the Catalan club receive favourable treatment from referees and claimed Barcelona had yet to win a 'clean' Champions League title under coach Pep Guardiola.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Asked about the UEFA charges he faces, Mourinho, who was sent off during that game, said:: 'I am very well, thank you. I am in good health and working as always. I don't want to discuss this any further and for a simple reason. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'An image is worth more than 1000 words and there are so many images from that game that were shown all over the world, that I have nothing else to add.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Whoever criticises my words is criticising those images and those who criticise those images think they come from photoshop or are a video montage. But they are real.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mourinho said the recent events have only strengthened his bond with the Bernabeu side. The former Chelsea manager joined Real from Inter Milan last summer and still has four years to run on his current contract.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, reports in recent months have linked Mourinho with a move away from Real at the end of the season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'To remain at Real Madrid makes more sense than ever before,' he said. "Now I have more willingness to continue in charge of Real Madrid for what this means. This (Madrid) jersey is white, and white now has more significance.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Barcelona vice-president Carles Villarubi has hit out at Real Madrid's decision to report the Catalans to UEFA for unsporting conduct and claimed <em>Los Blancos</em> are under the spell of coach</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Jose Mourinho</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong> </p>
              </div>
              <p>Real announced their intention to report Barca to UEFA on Thursday, with the nine-time European Cup winners angry with what they perceived to be play-acting from their rivals.</p>
              <p>It came shortly after Barcelona themselves announced that they would be reporting Mourinho after the Portuguese coach insulted both the Catalan club and Pep Guardiola after Wednesday night's Champions League semi-final first leg.</p>
              <p>After the game, Mourinho launched an astonishing attack on Barca, claiming they receive help from UEFA and questioning the club's agreement with UNICEF.</p>
              <p>Although Guardiola failed to respond to Mourinho in his press conference immediately afterwards, Barca decided to take action against the Portuguese following an extraordinary board meeting.</p>
              <p>But Madrid immediately hit back by announcing on their website their intention to report Barca for unsporting conduct in Wednesday's match. Villarubi, though, says Madrid have no grounds to report Barca.</p>
              <p>"What Madrid did yesterday is adhere to something that has already been judged [by the referees]," he told radio station <em>RAC1</em>.</p>
              <p>"UEFA, represented by the four officials [at the game], has already made its judgment on this topic, so Madrid have no grounds to report us on this basis."</p>
              <p>And the Barca vice-president believes the decision is simply a media strategy on the part of Madrid.</p>
              <p>"Real Madrid's reaction with this complaint is a media strategy aiming to get the media talking," he said. "The club are being totally abducted by the figure of Jose Mourinho.</p>
              <p>"What worries me about their press release is that it could be construed that Real Madrid as an institution supports the statements made by Mourinho and that would provoke a serious institutional conflict between the two entities."</p>
