              <p><strong>Manchester United topped the television money list for the 2009-10 Premier League season.</strong></p>
              <p>United's income of £52.996 million from broadcast rights was £167,000 more than title-winners Chelsea and was achieved by virtue of having the most matches broadcast live.</p>
              <p>United had 24 games screened, two more than Chelsea and one more than Arsenal, who finished third in the money table with £51.712 million.</p>
              <p>The league's richest club Manchester City finished fourth, one above their actual placing in the table, to secure £49.627 million with Champions League qualifiers Tottenham £167,000 behind having had two fewer (20) televised matches.</p>
              <p>Liverpool (£48 million) and Aston Villa (£45.9 million) made up the top seven, although the latter suffered from having just 16 live matches.</p>
              <p>Domestic broadcast revenue is separated into three parts for Premier League clubs: half is shared equally, 25% is paid in relation to their final position in the table and the remainder is based on how often the club is shown on television with each guaranteed a minimum of ten live games a season.</p>
              <p>All money received from overseas broadcast rights, sponsorship and licensing revenue is split equally (£10,122,612) between the 20 clubs.</p>
              <p>A Premier League spokesman said: "Selling our broadcast rights collectively, combined with the Premier League's distribution formulas, means that every pound generated centrally has an increased distributive effect both within the league and in relation to our external commitments.</p>
              <p>"This model, based on distributing revenue equitably and responsibly, has been the key factor in the growth of the league over the last 18 seasons. All money received through the sale of our broadcast rights in foreign territories is split equally amongst the 20 clubs.</p>
              <p>"This provides a platform for clubs to challenge in the competition, while rewarding investment and success."</p>
              <p>The three relegated clubs Burnley, Hull and Portsmouth received £33.8 million, £32.6 million and £31.8 million respectively. However, Pompey, currently in administration with debts around £135 million, are unlikely to see much of that.</p>
              <p>Television cash is distributed via a number of different instalments throughout the year and a £7 million payment in January was diverted by the Premier League to pay off clubs owed money by Portsmouth.</p>
