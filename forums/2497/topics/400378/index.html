              <h1>Fabio Capello: I will call the seven players who will miss out on 
              England World Cup squad<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Fabio Capello will contact the seven players who fail to make the 
              final cut for the World Cup in South Africa individually, breaking the 
              news to them in a private telephone call.</p>
              <p>The England manager 
              named 30 players in his provisional squad and he admits he is dreading 
              the moment when he has to reduce it to the 23 names he will submit to 
              FIFA on June 1.</p>
              <p>Asked if selecting his goalkeeper was the hardest
               decision he faced, Capello replied: 'No. Absolutely not. The hardest 
              decision will be when I have to decide the 23 players and the seven that
               have to go home.</p>

              </div>
              <p>'They know I have to choose. You have to understand that I have to 
              choose. But to be in the top 30 players of the national team is really 
              important.</p>
              <p>'I will decide on June 1 but I will phone the seven 
              who will not go. We have to wait until after the Japan game (on Sunday) 
              before making a final decision, to see if there are any injuries.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>D-day: Gareth Barry will discover on Tuesday 
              whether his ankle injury will rule him out of South Africa</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Seven names could become six on Tuesday if the specialist who 
              examines Gareth Barry's ankle is not happy with the progress that has 
              been made.Â </p>
              <p>Last week Barry said he thought his ankle ligaments, damaged during Manchester City's 1-0 defeat by Tottenham at Eastlands on May 5, were healing well,
               but only if his medical staff are confident that the midfielder will 
              train in another fortnight will Capello risk taking him to Rustenburg.</p>
              <p>For
               Barry Tuesday is D-day.</p>
