              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>BIG PHIL SCOLARI was unveiled as Chelsea boss today and immeadiately insisted: I'm not the Special One.</strong> </p>
              <p class="article">Instead, the Brazilian insisted he was a "so-so" manager and was only special to his friends and family. Jose Mourinho famously dubbed himself 'The Special One' when he joined the Blues in 2004.</p>
              <p class="article">But Scolari said: "I am special for my friends, my family and my country, not more. "As a manager, I am so-so." Scolari went on to reveal he hopes to keep striker Didier Drogba at Chelsea. He added: "I like him. He is 200 per cent part of my plans." </p>
              <p class="article">The Brazilian also confirmed John Terry would stay on as Chelsea skipper. He said: "I like him as a captain, I like him as a player. Yesterday he came to my room and said 'I am John Terry'. I replied 'I know you' and we spoke. "The captain is John Terry and second captain is Lampard. But we want more captains inside the team."</p>
              <p class="article">Scolari has been linked with a number of big-name signings but he insists he will look at the Blues squad before entering the transfer market. He added: "I don't know now how many changes I need because I need to watch training, I need to know the players. </p>
              <p class="article">"When you are on the outside you have one idea - when you are inside the group you need to know the group, the characters, the qualities. "After this it's possible to say how many changes I want or we need or don't need." </p>
              <p class="article">Ex-Chelsea bosses Avram Grant and Mourinho were criticised for their ugly style of football. But Scolari claimed: "We will try to play beautiful football. "But sometimes if you want to win some games you don't play beautiful. </p>
              <p class="article">"Sure I want both - to win and play beautiful. Sometimes it's impossible. "I think we have to think and to value all the competitions we participate in. "After that we try to follow our own way to try to win as much as we can. "I'm not going to give a priority to any of the competitions. All of them will be important."</p>

              <p><strong>SCOLARI CONFERENCE AT A GLANCE</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>* Frank Lampard has told Scolari "he wants to stay and play for Chelsea for many years". </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* Didier Drogba is '200%' part of Scolari's new plans. </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* John Terry will remain captain and Lampard will be his deputy. </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* Scolari has previously voted for both Drogba and Terry in World Player of the Year awards. </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* He believes that Chelsea have the "potential to win all competitions that they have entered". </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* Scolari will not confirm how many new players will be needed at Chelsea. </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* Scolari has not advised Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid. </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* He believes ManYoo are not a one-man team so winning the title will be difficult for Chelsea whether he stays or goes. </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* He has met 'Mr Roman' twice and they had "normal conversations about football". </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* Scolari aims to play "beautiful football" but admits that it is not always possible. </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>* He says he is special for his "friend, family and country" but as a manager he is just "so-so". </em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
