              <p>Jimmy Bullard, who completed a move, believed to be priced at 5 million pounds from Fulham Football Club to Hull City.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I NEVER FELT WANTED AT FULHAM.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>New Hull signing Jimmy Bullard has responded to statements from his
                  old club Fulham that his contract demands meant he had to leave Craven
                  Cottage.</p>
              <p>"I spoke in the summer," he explained in <em>The Guardian</em>.</p>
              <p>"They said come back in November and we'll talk and that was it really.
                  That's when it got held up and I knew where I stood. It made it easy
                  for me. The only club that I knew of being interested was Hull. The
                  rest was paper talk.</p>
              <p>"I've heard a lot of talk about wages and demands and I can honestly say that I don't play football for money," he added.</p>
              <p>"I came up to Hull because of the ambitions and I want to play
                  for a club that wants me, simple as that. I've never been interested in
                  money.</p>
              <p>"I wasn't asking for anything really. I was in contract talks
                  but the talks only went as far as 'we're not going to offer you any
                  sort of contract' so talking about years of contracts just wasn't
                  there.</p>
              <p>That's what I was told so it (Fulham boss Roy Hodgson's interpretation) is a bit mind-boggling really.</p>
              <p>"I went in and asked and they wouldn't give me a thought. It was
                  a weird discussion. I was a bit upset that I never had the backing from
                  the manager or the club."</p>
