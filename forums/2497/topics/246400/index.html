            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2007/04/03/MarkHughes128.jpg"><br><br><strong>Mark Hughes has been identified by senior figures at Chelsea as a leading candidate to take over as their manager in the summer if, as expected, Jose Mourinho leaves Stamford Bridge.</strong><br><br>The Blackburn Rovers manager, who had a productive three-year spell with Chelsea towards the end of his playing career, has transformed Rovers since taking over from Graeme Souness in September 2004 and will send his side out against Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final this month. The Premiership champions admire the job the 43-year-old has done at Ewood Park with Rovers comfortably avoiding relegation in his first season and finishing sixth last term to qualify for the Uefa Cup.<br><br>Mourinho has a contract until 2010 but there is an acceptance at Chelsea, rarely expressed publicly, that the breakdown in his relationship with Roman Abramovich will see him leave in the summer, regardless of whether he steers the team to an unprecedented quadruple. They have won the Carling Cup and could add the Champions League, the Premiership and the FA Cup before the end of the season.<br><br>While Chelsea have offered no comment on Mourinho's future, a number of high- profile potential successors have been mentioned, including the Barcelona coach, Frank Rijkaard, and Marcello Lippi, who won the World Cup with Italy last summer. The Russia coach, Guus Hiddink, would also be in contention, although Hughes' credentials are also viewed favourably within the upper echelons at Chelsea.<br><br>With Abramovich reluctant to maintain the lavish level of spending Mourinho has enjoyed, there is a sense that the summer would provide a timely opportunity for a shift in emphasis towards a British-style set-up. That will have an impact on transfer policy - the Reading midfielder Steve Sidwell, a free agent in the summer, has attracted interest - but also their managerial approach.<br><br>Hughes is one of the strongest British contenders given his relative success during a five-year spell in charge of Wales, with whom he narrowly failed to qualify for Euro 2004. He has made further strides this season, with Blackburn revived in the league after a sluggish start and reaching the knock-out stages of the Uefa Cup and a second FA Cup semi-final in three years.<br><br></div>
