              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Chelsea are reported to be closing in on a sensational deal to appoint Andres Villas-Boas.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Porto manager has a £13.2million release clause in his contract, which Blues owner Roman Abramovich is believed to be ready to activate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Reports in Portugal suggest Villas-Boas is now on his way to London to discuss taking over from sacked Carlo Ancelotti.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 33-year-old is widely regarded as the next Jose Mourinho given the similarities in his incredible rise with Porto. Villas-Boas also worked in Mourinho's backroom team during his spell at Stamford Bridge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Inter Milan were also interested in luring Villas-Boas but they have refused to pay his huge release fee.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Porto president Pinta da Costa has already admitted he is resigned to eventually losing his star manager.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: 'Villas-Boas has a contract and a clause of €15m. If someone deposits €15million into our account and he wants to go, we can not do anything because it is something that is contractually specified.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>It is not yet clear whether Villas-Boas has been targeted to work alongside Guus Hiddink, who has been at the centre of a tug-of-war between Chelsea and his current employers Turkey.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, Hiddink may well assume a sporting director role with Villas-Boas in charge of coaching and team selection at the Barclays Premier League runners-up.</span></p>

              ROMAN ABRAMOVICH is splashing a world record £13.25million to make Andre Villas-Boas boss of Chelsea. </strong></div>

              <p>That is the astonishing cost of the release clause to take Villas-Boas, 33, from Porto - a record for any football manager transfer.</p>
              <p>And Blues owner Rom could fork out another £26.5m for the Portuguese club's striker Falcao.</p>
              <p>Porto defender Alvaro Perreira admitted last night: "Andre Villas-Boas went to Chelsea. Abramovich took our manager.</p>
              <p>"We have to thank the coach for all the work and trophies won with us."</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas, who learned his trade under Sir Bobby Robson and Jose Mourinho, took charge at Porto last summer.</p>
              <p>He led them to four trophies in one season - the Europa League plus the Portuguese League, Cup and Super Cup.</p>
              <p>Colombian Falcao, who has two years left on his contract, was a key member of that side.</p>
              <p>He scored a record 17 goals in Europe, including the winner in the final against Braga.</p>
              <p>Claudio Mossi, a Falcao agent, said last night: "If Villas-Boas is the new coach of Chelsea it is normal for players that are closest to follow him."</p>
              <p>Falcao is a huge admirer of Villas-Boas and said: "It's thanks to him that every player felt relevant and he kept us all motivated. This was decisive."</p>
              <p>Falcao joined Porto in 2009 and has an astonishing 41 goals in just 50 appearances.</p>

              <div><em>Villas-Boas, told Porto he would meet the 15million euro release clause in his contract himself</em></div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <p></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Chelsea moved a step closer to landing their primary managerial target when Porto confirmed Andre Villas-Boas intended to resign his post at the Portuguese champions. </strong></p>
              <p>Villas-Boas, who at just 33 years of age will become the youngest manager in the Barclays Premier League should he complete a switch to west London, told Porto he would meet the 15million euro release clause in his contract himself, paving the way for him to replace Carlo Ancelotti at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Porto made a statement to the Portuguese Securities Market Commission which read: "FC Porto was notified of the intention of Andre Villas-Boas to resign from his contract with the club by triggering the release clause immediately.</p>
              <p>"The contract will be terminated once the required amount is paid."</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas, who led Porto to the domestic double and Europa League success last season, has worked for Chelsea before as part of Jose Mourinho's backroom staff and speaks good English.</p>
              <p>If he does succeed Ancelotti - the Italian was sacked at the end of last season - one of his first moves could be to sign Porto's star striker Falcao, the £25m-rated Colombian having impressed as the Dragons won the Europa League final at Dublin's Aviva Stadium, where the 25-year-old netted the only goal against Braga.</p>
              <p>With Chelsea having stepped up their pursuit of the former Academica boss, question marks now surround the future of Guus Hiddink.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman, who enjoyed a successful spell as caretaker boss of Chelsea in 2009, was thought to be in line for a return to Stamford Bridge, although reports have suggested he would prefer to remain as a coach and not move upstairs into a sporting director role.</p>
              <p>His agent today threw up an alternative by refusing to dismiss a link with Inter Milan, who themselves had been interested in Villas-Boas.</p>
              <p>The coaching role at the San Siro is likely to be vacated by Leonardo shortly, with the former AC Milan boss poised to become Paris St Germain's new sporting director.</p>
              <p>Inter have been frustrated in their attempts to recruit Sinisa Mihajlovic, Marcelo Bielsa and now Villas-Boas but Cees van Nieuwenhuizen said Hiddink, currently in charge of the Turkish national side, "would evaluate" Inter's offer should the Nerazzurri reach an agreement with his current employers.</p>
              <p>"We have never spoken to (Inter president Massimo) Moratti," Van Nieuwenhuizen told the Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper.</p>
              <p>"Hiddink has a contract with the Turkish federation and therefore before any talks can begin, Moratti must contact the (Turkish) federation and say he is interested in Guus.</p>
              <p>"He is contracted until 2012 so, for the time being, there is no possibility that he can coach Inter.</p>
              <p>"If Inter reached an agreement with Turkey? Well at that point Hiddink would certainly evaluate the Nerazzurri offer but he is a professional and he has never broken a contract in his whole career."</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Chelsea are celebrating the arrival of Andre Villas-Boas as the club's new manager on a three-year deal. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Porto boss follows in the footsteps of his old boss Jose Mourinho after the Blues paid his £13.2million release fee. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A Chelsea statement issued on Wednesday morning hailed his appointment - and its wording appeared to deliver a snub to the initial favourite for the post, Guus Hiddink.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It read: 'Andre was the outstanding candidate for the job. He is one of the most talented young managers in football today and has already achieved much in a relatively short space of time. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'His ambition, drive and determination matches that of Chelsea and we are confident Andre's leadership of the team will result in greater successes in major domestic and European competitions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Andre will bring his coaching experience back to a club he is already very familiar with, having previously worked here for three years. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He has always been highly regarded at Chelsea and everyone here looks forward to welcoming him back and working with him.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Villas-Boas, who previously served Chelsea as an assistant to Mourinho, is expected now to set his sights on bringing with him to Stamford Bridge some of his most prized possessions at Porto. </span></p>

              </div>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>It is understood he wants striker Falcao and midfielder Joao Moutinho, two key members of the side he guided to a European and domestic treble this season. Porto president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa immediately put a price on their heads last night, valuing Falcao at £26.5m and Moutinho at £35.5m. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Villas-Boas could also move for two members of his coaching staff - fitness coach Jose Maria Rocha and opposition scout Daniel Sousa. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Chelsea secured the 33-year-old after payment of his £13.2million release clause was completed - while he continued to relax on holiday. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Portuguese will not travel to London but remain on his summer break, although he may be joined today by a Chelsea delegation sent out to complete formalities. The plan is to introduce him officially next month, once he has spent a few days working with the players in training. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rapid progress in securing Villas-Boas was made on Tuesday, with Porto promoting their assistant coach, Vitor Pereira, to the role of manager and informing the Portuguese stock exchange that the release clause had been paid and that their contract with Villas-Boas had been terminated.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Guus Hiddink</strong></span><strong> and not André Villas-Boas was </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Roman Abramovich</strong></span><strong>'s first choice to become </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong>'s new manager, according to the Dutchman's agent, Cees van Nieuwenhuizen. The Portuguese coach was appointed last week by Chelsea, with a £13.3m fee paid to Porto to secure the 33-year-old's release.</strong></p>
              <p>Van Nieuwenhuizen, whose version of events is disputed by senior Chelsea sources, said that Hiddink was approached first, but that his client's determination to honour his contract as Turkey's coach prevented him from returning to Stamford Bridge. Van Nieuwenhuizen said: "He has never broken a contract."</p>
              <p>Hiddink told Abramovich he intended to stay loyal to Turkey until qualification for next summer's European Championship was achieved, and Chelsea respected his wishes "because of the good relationship Guus has with Abramovich", according to Nieuwenhuizen.</p>
              <p>"Every now and then they talk, they see each other, and Guus would say: 'I have a contract so it's no use considering a position for me at Chelsea.' I think Abramovich has respected that position."</p>
              <p>Given the nature of that relationship and Hiddink's success in winning the FA Cup when he took over as Chelsea's caretaker manager in 2009 after Luiz Felipe Scolari was sacked, was it particularly difficult for Hiddink to turn the club down?</p>
              <p>"No. When he signed with Turkey he realised he would be in this position in principle through at least to the European Championship, so he's a professional," Van Nieuwenhuizen said. The agent added that the 64-year-old was well-used to being linked with prestigious club positions. "Massimo Moratti [Internazionale's president] also mentioned last week that he wanted Guus Hiddink. And Guus has already been connected in the past a couple of times, related to big clubs, not only Chelsea."</p>
              <p>However, Van Nieuwenhuizen does not believe Hiddink will retire after his work with Turkey is done.</p>
