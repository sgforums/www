Let's see what happens," Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani was quoted as saying on the club's Web site (www.acmilan.com).<br><br>"Everything, then, will depend on the results of the medical. There are still a lot of things to do."<br><br>Galliani did not say when the three-times FIFA World Player of the Year would undergo the medical, but Italian media reported he was expected to fly in to Milan later on Thursday for an examination at the club's training base outside the city.<br><br>Asked to confirm rumours that the 30-year-old might appear in the stands of the San Siro to watch Milan's Italian Cup semi-final against AS Roma on Thursday, Galliani said: "Yes, that's still possible".<br><br>Spanish media reported Milan had made a six million-euro ($7.79 million) offer for Ronaldo.<br><br>Daily El Mundo said on its Web page (www.elmundo.es) that Ronaldo would sign an 18-month contract with Milan who would offer him the chance to end his career at the club if he lived up to expectations.<br><br>Ronaldo has been angling to leave Real ever since club coach Fabio Capello made it clear the Brazilian did not feature in his plans for the side.<br><br>A transfer to Milan would represent a return to familiar territory for the striker, who played for Inter Milan between 1997 and 2002.<br><br></div>

The two clubs have been haggling over the finer details of Ronaldo's transfer for several days after he completed a medical and agreed personal terms at the San Siro on Friday, but have finally settled on a fee of about Â£5m. Ricardo Oliveira, who only joined Milan in the summer from Real Betis, will move to the BernabÃ©u on loan as part of the deal.<br><br>"I know that Ronaldo is Milan's," said Real coach Fabio Capello. "I wish him good luck, that he does what he used to be able to do: that is be a great player."<br><br>Milan made a bid for Ronaldo in August - before they had moved for Oliveira - but were told at the time he was not for sale. He has fallen out of favour at Real since, however, and hasn't played since a January 7 defeat at Deportivo La CoruÃ±a.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Ronaldo may be fat and slow, but at Â£5m he's a bargain</strong></span><br><br>Thirty years old and a three-time Fifa world player of the year, Ronaldo has, with the exception of the last four months, always scored goals in industrial quantities at Real Madrid. Even his 'disappointing' World Cup last summer saw him net three. Despite that, he's set to cost goal-shy Milan an exceedingly trim Â£5m.<br><br>Of course, Ronaldo will be cup-tied and unable to help the Rossoneri in their European campaign. There are the risks too that his arrival will disturb the balance of the Milanello locker room, or that he'll go the way of some other recent Milan salvage projects, like last year's blowout Christian Vieri, or Fernando Redondo, who famously signed for Milan from Real Madrid only to suffer a career-ending injury on the very first day of training. However, given that Milan have just lost forward Marco Borriello to a doping suspension, and have only the thus-far disappointing Ricardo Oliveira and Pippo Inzaghi available to partner Alberto Gilardino, Big Ron is still worth a punt and then some.<br><br>For a start, he's already brought Milan worldwide publicity - and for a club languishing a humiliating 30 points behind their former stooges Inter, the value of grabbing the limelight shouldn't be underestimated. Milan, it says, will not go quietly into that dark night. And neither will Ronaldo. At a time when he could have been cashing in his CV on football's new frontiers, his return to the city of Milan amid calls of high treason from Inter (the club that nursed him through 2 Â½ years of ruptured knees only to then see him do one to Madrid) underlines his desire to prove himself again at the top of the game.<br><br>Ronaldo's days of scampering 50 yards up past gob-smacked defenders may be over, but at Milan that won't matter; all he'll be asked to do is stand around and poach to his heart's content.</div>
