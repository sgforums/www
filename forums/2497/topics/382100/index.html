              <p>Chelsea captain John Terry
              believes that the club will spend big in January due to avert any
              problems caused by the loss of players to the African Nations Cup.<br><br>The
              CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport) has temporarily suspended the
              transfer ban imposed on the west London club, which would bar them from
              operating on the market for two consecutive transfer windows. <br><br>Terry
              believes that when this is coupled with the club's African stars
              leaving for international duty, they will have to bring in some
              reinforcements to steady the ship.<br><br>"It's good news about the transfer ban being 
              suspended but we lose four good players to the African Nations Cup in 
              January anyway," Terry is quoted in <em>The Sun</em> as saying.<br><br>"I'm sure the club and the manager [Carlo Ancelotti] are looking into that and having good talks 
              with Roman [Abramovich].<br><br>"I wouldn't be surprised if we do go out and buy because we don't know what's 
              going to happen in the summer - or the following summer."</p>
              <div id="TixyyLink" style="border: medium none; overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"><br></div>
              <p>The
              Stamford Bridge coffers have traditionally been quiet around the winter
              transfer period. The last time the club went on a mid-season shopping
              spree was in 2008, when they bought Nicolas Anelka, Branislav Ivanovic
              and Franco di Santo to counter the call-ups of Michael Essien, Didier
              Drogba, Salomon Kalou and John Obi Mikel.<br><br>That same quartet is set to
              ship out to Angola this time around, but Terry believes that this
              should not pose a problem when it comes to the question of their title
              rivals reducing the Blues' five-point lead in the league.<br><br>"We're going well at the minute and we're lucky enough to have a big 
              squad with good players who can come in if we get a couple of injuries," he said.<br><br>"Looking at it realistically, we're maybe going to be suspended in the summer 
              window and maybe another one after that.
              <br>"The manager has great experience and he knows what we need."</p>
