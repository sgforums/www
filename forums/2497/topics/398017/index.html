              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">WAYNE ROONEY has been voted Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers' Association.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Manchester United striker topped the poll of journalists with just over 81 per cent of votes cast.</p>
              <p class="article">Rooney, 24, finished ahead of Chelsea forward Didier Drogba and Manchester City's Carlos Tevez to win the prestigious accolade, which has been running since 1948.</p>
              <p class="article">The award is the England star's second of the season after he was named the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year last week.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I am delighted to win an award with so much history and tradition.</p>
              <p class="article">"To follow a long line of wonderful players who have been honoured by the Football Writers' Association since 1948 gives me real pride.</p>
              <p class="article">"I would like to take this opportunity to thank my manager at United, Sir Alex Ferguson, the coaching staff and my team-mates, without whose help and support this award would not have been possible.</p>
              <p class="article">"Also a big thanks to my family and friends for their constant support, which is always appreciated.</p>
              <p class="article">"I thank the Football Writers' Association members who voted for me and I look forward to personally collecting my award at the Footballer of the Year dinner in London on May 13."</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson meanwhile returned the compliment, revealing he thought the award was a foregone conclusion.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "We expected that. It was a foregone conclusio</p>
              <p class="article">"I thought he would win both awards and deservedly so because he has elevated himself to a tremendous level now.</p>
              <p class="article">"He has brought maturity and authority to his game.</p>
              <p class="article">"It usually starts to show itself when young players move into their mid-20s and that is the case with Wayne now.</p>
              <p class="article">"Unfortunately the boy has had a couple of injuries recently but the season as a whole has been terrific."</p>
