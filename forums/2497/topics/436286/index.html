              <div class="KonaBody"> </div>
              <p class="KonaBody">Spurs have agreed terms in principle with Manchester City and the Togolese forward is expected to make his debut against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday night.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">The two clubs have been locked in talks for weeks over the structure of the deal. City were initially reluctant to pay a large portion of Adebayor’s £170,000-a-week wages but eventually relented and will pay £85,000-a-week of the 27-year-old’s earnings to complete the switch.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">However, Spurs will pay a loan fee to City to take Adebayor for the season, which is believed to be at least £2m.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">Goal.com understands that Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has also negotiated a £12m deal to make the move permanent at the end of the season as manager Harry Redknapp finally closes in on a striker who can lead the line and score vital goals for his team.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">Once Real Madrid cooled their interest in the former Arsenal striker, he made it clear to the City hierarchy that he wanted to move to White Hart Lane despite interest from other clubs such as Marseille.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">City manager Roberto Mancini has not included Adebayor in his pre-season preparations and made it known to the player, who was signed by Mark Hughes two years ago, that he would not be included in the 25-man squad to be submitted to the Premier League at the end of the transfer window.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">The impending arrival of Adebayor, following the £2.2m (€2.5m) sale of Robbie Keane to LA Galaxy, will allow Spurs to continue the rejig of their forward line.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">Levy is then expected to turn his attention to offloading Peter Crouch, who has been the subject of a bid from Stoke City.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Spurs</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>are closing in on the signing of Lassana Diarra from Real Madrid while Emmanuel Adebayor is expected on loan from Manchester City as the club finally come to life in the transfer market. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>The hold-up in both deals has been wages. Tottenham have a strict salary structure and if they matched what either player was on it would break it.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Adebayor is reportedly on £170,000 per week while Diarra is on £85,000 per week after tax in Spain. One way of resolving the dispute is by paying the players a fee up front or even paying the clubs an added fee that can be used to subsidise their salary.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Spurs are refusing to negotiate on Luka Modric however. One source claimed Chelsea bid £30 million for the player last week but Spurs insist they have received no bid and would reject it in any case.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>The player is understood to be growing increasingly frustrated by chairman Daniel Levy’s intransigence, but remains committed to playing for Spurs and is expected to be named in the team to play Manchester United tomorrow.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>While Harry Redknapp has made it clear he is open to a deal at the right price, Levy is holding his line.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>With 27 players over 21 in their squad and only 25 eligible under Premier League rules, the pressure is on to sell players.</p>
              <p>Stoke still hope they might be able to do a deal for Wilson Palacios and would also go for Peter Crouch or Jermaine Jenas at the right price.</p>
              <p>Spurs want to sell Alan Hutton, Sébastien Bassong and David Bentley but need to reduce their asking price if they are to generate interest.</p>
              <p>Niko Kranjcar, a target for Sunderland, is another who could go, even with the current problems with injury in midfield.</p>

              <h1>Spurs close on Parker signing</h1>
              <p>West Ham boss Sam Allardyce expects Tottenham to complete the signing of England midfielder Scott Parker "in the next 24 hours or so."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="thickbox" title="Parker: Looks set for Tottenham" href="http://images.football365.com/11/07/800x600/Scott-Parker_2619302.jpg"><img src="http://images.football365.com/11/07/640/Scott-Parker_2619302.jpg" alt="Parker: Looks set for Tottenham"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Parker was left out of the West Ham squad which travelled to Nottingham Forest on Sunday as a transfer to Spurs, believed to be worth £6million, neared a conclusion.</strong></p>
              <p>Allardyce told Sky Sports: "There are some negotiations going on and I don't think he would be mentally right to play.</p>
              <p>"It will come to fruition in the next 24 hours or so."</p>
              <p>Tottenham are expected to include a loan deal for one of their youngsters in the package.</p>
              <p>Parker, who joined the Hammers from Newcastle for £7million in 2007, was named Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year last season despite the club finishing bottom of the Premier League.</p>

              <h1>Palacios poised for Stoke move</h1>
              <p>Wilson Palacios has undergone a medical at Stoke on Sunday ahead of his £6million switch, Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp has confirmed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="thickbox" title="Palacios: On brink of Stoke switch" href="http://images.football365.com/11/08/800x600/Wilson-Palacios_2634376.jpg"><img src="http://images.football365.com/11/08/640/Wilson-Palacios_2634376.jpg" alt="Palacios: On brink of Stoke switch"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Midfielder Palacios has not played for Tottenham this season and is not in Redknapp's plans as he intends to complete a move for West Ham's Scott Parker before the transfer window closes on Wednesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>Stoke chairman Peter Coates confirmed the Potters were in discussions with Tottenham last week and the Honduras international looks set to move to the Britannia stadium.</p>
              <p>"Wilson Palacios is having a medical at Stoke," Redknapp said after Sunday's 5-1 defeat to Manchester City.</p>
              <p>Peter Crouch has also been linked with a move to the Potters, but Redknapp does not want to see the striker leave.</p>
              <p>"I don't know what the latest situation is with Crouchy," the 64-year-old said.</p>
              <p>"People say we want to sell Crouch to Stoke and it's in the papers every day. Crouchy has to play under that. It's very difficult.</p>
              <p>"As far as I know he is staying."</p>
              <p>Parker's move to White Hart Lane is likely to move a step closer if Palacios moves on to the Britannia Stadium.</p>
              <p>The England midfielder appears to have played his last game for the Hammers after being left out of the club's matchday squad for Sunday's 4-1 win at Nottingham Forest.</p>
              <p>Stoke manager Tony Pulis refused to confirm whether Stoke were close to signing Palacios and Crouch but insists the club wage structure will not be broken.</p>
              <p>Pulis said: "I've been told there is money available, that there is a pot of money, if I can find the right players.</p>
              <p>"There is money there and I'm just hoping and praying we can get players in who will help us again.</p>
              <p>"But the wage structure won't be broken. The basic wage at our club won't change."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SCOTT PARKER handed West Ham a written transfer request last night in a bid to seal his dream switch to Tottenham.</h2>
              <p>The England midfielder made the dramatic move after talks between the clubs threatened to stall.</p>
              <p>Parker, 30, hopes his decision will help clear the final hurdle in his proposed £6million deal to North London.</p>
              <p>His request means he will no longer receive a huge loyalty payout when he quits Upton Park.</p>
              <p>Parker said: "I have had four fantastic years here and will never forget all the support I have had.</p>
              <p>"The manager and the board have tried hard to convince me to stay.</p>
              <p>"But at this stage in my career I need to be playing in the Premier League, especially now I am involved with England."</p>
              <p>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp said: "He's a good character, a proper family man and a real good pro."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">SCOTT PARKER has completed his switch across London from West Ham to Spurs.</h2>
              <p>The 2011 Football Writers' Player of the Year had submitted a formal transfer request to his Upton Park bosses yesterday.</p>
              <p>His prospective move was one of the worst kept secrets of the summer.</p>
              <p>Parker had spent four seasons at West Ham but was concerned that the club's relegation to the Championship would affect his England chances.</p>
              <p>The combative midfielder was left out of the West Ham team that beat Nottingham Forest 4-1 at the weekend.</p>
              <p>But he was ironically named in Fabio Capello's squad for the upcoming games with Bulgaria and wWles.</p>
              <p>Parker will join up with his new Tottenham team-mates when he returns from England duty next week.</p>

              <p>he is 30 already.  how long more can he play at the pace he played last season?</p>
              <p>i think its crazy to pay so much for him.  and his wages is way too high too.</p>
