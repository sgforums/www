              <p style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 15px;"><span></span></p>
              </div>
              <p class="art-txt-first">Shay Given is not worried 
              about losing his Mancster City place, while Joe Hart admits he will 
              consider his future if he is not number one.</p>
              <p>The two shot-stoppers will both be vying for a place 
              in Roberto Mancini's first team, as big-spending City look to break into
               the Premier League's top four and even challenge for the title.</p>
              <p>Hart, 23, spent last season on loan at Birmingham and quickly 
              established himself as first-choice at St Andrews, going on to have an 
              impressive campaign.</p>
              <p>Given, meanwhile, started 35 league games and only missed the 
              last three matches because he dislocated his shoulder against Arsenal.</p>
              <p>The 34-year-old Republic of Ireland international does not fear 
              the competition from Hart, and revealed the two keepers have a good 
              relationship.</p>
              <p>"Joe is eager to establish himself for City and England but I have that hunger as well," he told The People.</p>
              <p>"If you look at the other top goalkeepers in the Premier League 
              like Edwin van der Sar, Brad Friedel and David James, they're all in 
              their late 30s or even 40.</p>
              <p>"Joe is a very good keeper and he proved that last season at 
              Birmingham. He had a fantastic year, was player of the season there and 
              he will quite rightly feel that he should be playing now.</p>
              <p>"But I was bitterly disappointed to miss the last three games of 
              last season and I am as desperate as anyone to start the opening game.</p>
              <p>"I knew I was joining a club with huge ambitions and if you look 
              through all areas of the squad, there is competition for every place. 
              That's how it should be at a top team.</p>
              <p>"It will give both of us an extra edge and I'm looking forward to it.</p>
              <p>"It's definitely good to have that rivalry now Joe is back at the
               club but at 34 I am an experienced goalkeeper and I don't worry about 
              an error costing me my place in the team."</p>
              <p>Hart was part of the England squad which woefully crashed out of 
              the World Cup this summer, although he played no part in the tournament 
              despite the disastrous error from Robert Green against the USA.</p>
              <p>He is keen to get more pitch-time under his belt and hopes he can
               do enough to play a part in City's campaign, despite his positive 
              relationship with Given.</p>
              <p>He added: "I have a great relationship with Shay. He came in the 
              January before last and came straight in for me. I thought he was a good
               guy and I felt I did my best for him.</p>
              <p>"We've got a good relationship. It's not even discussed between us, it's down to the manager.</p>
              <p>"We're both doing our best to catch his eye and play. We're both 
              the kind of people who will get on with it. That's what I admire a lot 
              about Shay he'll play on regardless.</p>
              <p>"But this is a big season for me and I intend to do everything I can to make sure it's a success.</p>
              <p>"All I want to do is play but if that's not the case then I'll have to reconsider what's going on.</p>
              <p>"At the moment, I'm just really concentrating on getting that No.1 spot after Birmingham gave me a chance last season."</p>
