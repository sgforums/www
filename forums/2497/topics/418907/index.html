              <p>I have used their fanzone for 5 years and finaly gave up. Let me give you a brief history of Manchester United fanzone. Back in 2003, the fanzone was flooded by Muppets who blasted the manager for not hiring big signings and whenever the club drew 1-1 or lost a game, the muppets would go in force and start lambasting our beloved SAF and the club. The club lacked full time moderators. It was going out of control. Many long time contributers left.</p>
              <p>Then as recent as 2009, the club started bringing back some moderation by introducing some long time forumers as moderators. At first they sounded nice people. However, it was not long, they started purging anyone that they deemed as muppets or glory hunters. I was picked on and regularly abused because of my Asian background. Further the fanzone forums were unfriendly. I complained about the regular abuse I receive but no action was taken because some of the abusers were friends of the moderators. Some of the abuse were racially motivated but the abusers were clever not to say any racial abuse or risk being deleted. Then the abusers started to attack the moderators and the moderators removed them. Problems started when a long time contributor was wrongly accused of something and his account was removed. That person got so angry that he created a lot of accounts and started spamming the whole spam zone. The moderators have limited power and feeling frustrated that the fanzone went out of control, they started quiting one by one.</p>
              <p>Then everything is back to chaos. However, I would never go back there because if I try to say anything constructive like even a slight comment on the beloved rooney or anyone else, I would be slated, accused of being a scouser fanÂ and receive abuse. Of course I support the club, manager and players but the forum should allow some room for constructive comments. I got so frustrated, I finally left the forum.</p>
