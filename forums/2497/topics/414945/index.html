              <p>Schweinsteiger’s current contract with the German champions expires in 2012 and the player has been linked with the Blancos in the past. Ballack, who himself left Bayern for Chelsea in 2006, knows that his compatriot has a tough choice to make.</p>
              <p>"Only he will be able to feel what is right for him for the future,” Ballack told <em>Kicker </em>magazine.</p>
              <p>"Of course every footballer is attracted to certain things and Bastian will feel these also. But there are not that many big clubs around and Bayern is one of them.</p>
              <p>"On the other hand, Real Madrid or Manchester United are both attractive and he would fit in well at both clubs."</p>
              <p>His excellent form was praised by Ballack, who was in awe of witnessing the Germany international single handedly help Bayern past Werder Bremen in the DFB Pokal and put in some impressive performances in both the Bundesliga and the Champions League too.<br><br>"I'm very impressed with what Bastian Schweinsteiger has shown so far this term. Despite playing at the World Cup and going through a difficult period with Bayern, he always makes his mark on the game if he plays," he continued<em></em>.<br><br>"He has great charisma, a good personality, performs well and scores important goals. Everything is going just perfect for him. He takes his responsibilities and is currently in a phase of his career where he's nearing top form."</p>

              <p><strong>Schweinsteiger close to deciding Bayern future</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/media/ALeqM5iylF5pVMSEdvit7sHsGMLXR0cR7A?docId=photo_1289587554478-1-0&amp;size=s2" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Bayern Munich's Bastian Schweinsteiger has said he is close to making
               a decsion about his future, but has yet to commit to the German 
              champions and admits he is eager for Champions League success.</strong></p>
              <p>The
               26-year-old is out of contract with Munich in June 2012, but if he 
              fails to sign an extension in the winter break, Bayern may consider 
              selling him at the end of the season, rather than risk losing him on a 
              free transfer.</p>
              <p>The Germany vice-captain, who was superb in South 
              Africa when the national side finished third at the World Cup, said 
              several clubs have expressed an interest with both Manchester United and
               Real Madrid linked to the German.</p>
              <p>"There are three to four clubs who could be potential employers in 2012," Schweinsteiger told SID, a subsidiary of AFP.</p>
              <p>But the 83-times capped Schweinsteiger says he is close to making his mind up.</p>
              <p>"Yes, I am leaning towards a decision," Schweinsteiger said in an interview with German television channel Sport1.</p>
              <p>"Bayern's footballing skills have developed greatly in the last year, which was nice to see."</p>
              <p>Schweinsteiger
               also praised Dutch coach Louis van Gaal who led Bayern to the Champions
               League final, when they lost to Inter Milan, and won the domestic 
              league and cup double.</p>
              <p>"Last season, we have seen how far he can bring on a team," said Schweinsteiger.</p>
              <p>"I hope he stays at Bayern for a long time. He works well with the club."</p>
              <p>But
               Schweinsteiger has said he will only decide his future once the winter 
              break begins just before Christmas and is prepared to quit Munich to win
               more European silverware.</p>
              <p>"My goal is to win the Champions League and I've always said that I can do that at other clubs," he said.</p>
              <p>Bayern
               Munich have already extended the contract of Germany defender Philipp 
              Lahm until 2016 and the German giants are hoping to offer Schweinsteiger
               a similar deal.</p>

              <p>the only clubs who can pay the hefty transfer fees are probably, real, man city, man utd and chelsea, inter.</p>
              <p>but considering he want UCL success, i take man city out of the loop.</p>
              <p>if real want to get this man, he would go. because there are few germans in real and all seem to be playing well under mourinho, khedira and ozil.</p>
