              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson is not a huge fan of World Cups. Bloated summer tournaments tend to take his players away for too long, inflate values of those he covets and usually take place without the presence of his beloved Scotland.</strong></p>
              <p>Right now, though, the Manchester United manager has reason to be thankful for Ecuador's presence at the Germany finals of 2006. Had it not been for their efforts then, Fergie may not now be weighing up the £20million arrival of Antonio Valencia.</p>
              <p>It was while he was slogging wearily round Germany with Radio 5 Live that former Wigan manager Paul Jewell spotted 23-year-old Valencia bolstering Ecuador's efforts. Within weeks, the hitherto unknown midfield player was resident at the JJB Stadium.</p>
              <p>Valencia now stands on the brink of a move to Old Trafford where - in all likelihood - he will be used as a replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>A move from the JJB Stadium is 'inevitable' said his manager Steve Bruce this week. When news of interest from United first broke in January, Bruce made him wear a red shirt in training. With a smile, of course. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It certainly has been some journey for a player who only a matter of four years ago was playing his football to relatively little fanfare in Spain.</p>
              <p>What stands before him now represents a much sterner challenge and Valencia will need to produce a little of what he showed in flashes last night if he is to take his football to the next level.</p>
              <p>Built like a middle-weight boxer, Valencia is nevertheless 'sprinter quick'. That became apparent in only the second minute. Scampering on to a clearance and quickly gaining a yard on Nemanja Vidic, his balance and upper body strength matched his turn of pace impressively.</p>
              <p>Sadly his finish was rather less polished and passed the wrong side of the post by a yard. Standing in the rain on the touchline - he always stands up when it is getting nervy - Ferguson must not have known whether to smile or grimace. So he did neither. He just chewed.</p>
              <p>Soon after - as Wigan troubled United persistently on the break - Valencia robbed Patrice Evra to begin a move that eventually gave Maynor Figueroa an opportunity to shoot over.</p>
              <p>Then, seconds before the interval Valencia was dashing devilishly at United's retreating defenders again, this time combining terrifically to set up scorer Hugo Rodallega on the edge of the area. This time the shot was dragged wide.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has always liked pace in his players. It is pretty much a pre-requisite these days. In Valencia, however, he would also appear to be on the verge of taking a player with a work ethic certainly not always associated with Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Last night - as United laid relentless siege to the Wigan goal during the last half hour - Valencia fulfilled his defensive duties, doubling up with Mario Melchiot to shackle Wayne Rooney and restrict the advances of Evra.</p>
              <p>It takes something pretty special to impress Ferguson but last night Valencia will have done so. Jewell - shamefully unemployed these days - may have found him something.</p>
