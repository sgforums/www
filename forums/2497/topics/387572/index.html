              </div>
              <p><em>Dimitar Berbatov will head a sensational clear-out of £80m of Manchester United talent at the end of the season.</em></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has run out of patience with the £30.75m striker after 18 months of inconsistent performances.</p>
              <p>And
              the United boss is also looking to offload underachieving trio
              Anderson, Nani and Zoran Tosic as well as unsettled central defender
              Nemanja Vidic.</p>
              <p>It will signal the biggest overhaul of a United
              squad since 1995 when Ferguson dumped Paul Ince, Andrei Kanchelskis,
              Mark Hughes to clear the way for youngsters like David Beckham, Paul
              Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers.</p>
              <p>The United boss believes he can finally land long-term target Karim
              Benzema following the Frenchman’s failure to settle at Real Madrid
              following his £30m summer transfer from Lyon.</p>
              <p>But first he will
              look to raise cash by selling Berbatov, who has become the most
              expensive flop in Old Trafford history since moving from Tottenham.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian has scored just 20 goals in 66 appearances for United.</p>
              <p>He has been carrying a knee injury that required an exploratory operation last month.</p>
              <p>But
              while the blame for United’s shock FA Cup home defeat at the hands of
              League One Leeds last week has been widely placed on the shoulders of
              several of the club’s younger players, some fingers inside the club
              have also been pointed at Berbatov.</p>
              <p>A United insider said: “The
              four midfield players got a lot of criticism after the Leeds game, but
              the biggest underperformer was Berbatov.</p>
              <p>“People say he’s got a great touch, and that isn’t in doubt, but this game is also about hunger and workrate.</p>
              <p>“To
              put it bluntly, Berbatov doesn’t run around enough for this United team
              – and it hasn’t gone unnoticed by the people that matter most.”</p>
              <p>Nani,
              a £17m signing from Sporting Lisbon in 2007, is also on borrowed time
              after failing to even come close to grasping the opportunity to fill
              Cristiano Ronaldo’s boots.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese winger has played just
              once since criticising Ferguson over a lack of first-team opportunities
              whilst away on international duty in early November, although he has
              been sidelined by a month by an ankle problem.</p>
              <p>Nani, 23, was
              hoping the departure of Ronaldo would give him more scope to become
              United’s playmaker, but he has struggled to cope with the physical
              demands of the English game.</p>
              <p>Anderson was substituted after
              failing to make an impact against Leeds and is another who has not
              given value for money after United paid Porto £18m for his services two
              years ago.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian international feels he has not been
              given enough chances to impress in his favourite position as an
              attacking midfielder.</p>
              <p>He said: “If I said I’m not disappointed things I’d be lying.</p>
              <p>“Of
              course I’m disappointed because a player of my ability, who is used to
              playing at attacking role and scoring goals like I did at Porto, then
              it makes me sad.</p>
              <p>“I have only scored one goal for the club, but I can’t be dispirited.</p>
              <p>“My first goal has to be to get back to the condition I was in at Porto and to get a run of games like I did there.</p>
              <p>“Then I want to start scoring goals and deciding games because that’s important for my career.”</p>
              <p>Anderson, though, is running out of chances with Ferguson, who feels the 21-year-old’s development has stalled.</p>
              <p>It’s
              a similar scenario with Tosic, who arrived from Partisan Belgrade with
              a terrific reputation for £7m but has made only a handful appearances
              and has struggled to settle in Manchester.</p>
              <p>Vidic once again
              reiterated a desire to stay at Old Trafford during the week after
              dropping out of team to face Leeds with a late injury.</p>
              <p>The
              Serbian has been targeted by Real Madrid, who are aware of United’s
              reluctance to reward Vidic with a new contract that would put him in
              line with the club’s £100,000-a-week top earners.</p>
              <p>And Ferguson
              will allow the Spanish club to get their man if they show a willingness
              to pay more than £20m for a player who has struggled with fitness
              problems this season and will turn 29 in the autumn.</p>
              <p>With Scholes
              hinting that he will retire at the end of the season and keeper Edwin
              van der Sar also considering his options, it promises to be a busy
              summer for United.</p>
              <p>Ferguson have to take significant losses on Berbatov, Nani, Anderson and Tosic.</p>
              <p>And
              that will put even more pressure on the Glazer family who own the club
              to come up with significant transfer funds whilst once again finding
              £70m to service the interest on the club’s £700m debts.</p>

              <p>man utd will miss out of at least 2-3 season of EPL titles if they head a massive clear out. which of coz also includes the retirement of gary N, scholes, Giggs, VDS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is how chelsea and arsenal got to win that 3 season of EPL titles when man utd are going for transition.</p>

              <p>Aiya he is just another flop like Veron. World class player but not a United player. I wonder why Chelsea cough up millions to buy our flop 'Veron' LOL</p>
