              <p>Firstly, Ah Ben is responsible for driving Alonso away.</p>
              <p>Two incident:</p>
              <p>- Ask him play champion league away game when his gf is going to give birth.</p>
              <p>- Chase Barry and put Alonso in the freezer.</p>
              <p>Alonso never really wanted to leave.</p>
              <p>But, if your manager already bay song you, there is no point staying around.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben also know this, that is why he agreed for the transfer.</p>
              <p>The stupid drama that erupt last season about Ah Ben having full control of the player sale that was caused by buying Keane.</p>
              <p>Now, he have all the control and the cash.</p>
              <p>What have he delivered so far ?</p>
              <p>Throughout his stay, his insistence on sticking to one player, crouch, sissoko, kuyt and lucas have caused more harm to Liverpool than help.</p>
              <p>When crouch have become a asset from liability, Ah Ben sold him.</p>
              <p>Does Liverpool have any youth talent ?</p>
              <p>Yes, but I am shocked to hear that he loan out Nemeth for this season when we in need of new ideas up front.</p>
              <p>So, have the squad really improved under Ah Ben ?</p>
              <p>When we are on the verge of gaining momentum in the title race, the foundation is rocked once again through sale of key players with injured replacement.</p>
              <p>It is not that Liverpool dun have talented players.</p>
              <p>It is the stubbornness of the manager in not switching the formation and competent usage of players that is not working.</p>
              <p>If the fans and the press have to turn "coach and manager" for Liverpool every time, why do we still need him in the 1st place ?</p>
              <p>I am not putting Ah Ben as the scape goat for the recent defeat but I am fed-up with seeing him repeat the same mistakes for every season.</p>

              <p>I feel a lot of the points made here is rather true... We just can't blame the 2 yanks over everything...</p>
              <p>On a side note, I think the Glazers took over of United is one of the best thing to happen to the club in the last decade... Cos the club was beginning to show signs of slipping out of the top during the Chelsea years... But some of the fans still don't realised this and won't appreciate their contributions.</p>
              <p>The 2 yanks has given Rafa almost full control, even getting rid of their CEO to suit him... What more can he ask when they don't even bother him with team matters... Like who he must play or cannot play...</p>
              <p>Before they came, I can't remember Pool spending $20m on a single player that often, but since they took over, Rafa has had his $20m player for the last 3 yrs... Torres, Keane &amp; now this new Italian player... In between got those $10m above ones as well like Mascherano, Babel... So, I feel its not fair to blame them for all the problems lor... Rafa has to share half of it cos he runs the team at the end of the day...</p>

              <p>If King Kenny can take over Ah Ben and improve the teamwork of Liverpool, why not ?</p>
              <p>If the best eleven men dun work, replace them with players that can play.</p>
              <p>Or else the youth squad and reserve squad are playing for nothing if they cannot get into 1st team.</p>
              <p>Arsenal squad was looked down upon but they have shown the fruit of their labour now.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben have himself to blame if he cannot improve on his managerial style and tactics.</p>
              <p>He is ending up like Ah Hou at the ending stage.</p>
