              <h1>Blue day for John Terry: Chelsea skipper’s fury as blunders let Manchester United go top<br><br>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/17/article-1221202-06DBA057000005DC-273_306x423.jpg" alt="John Terry" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>Post traumatic stress: Chelsea skipper John Terry takes Aston Villa's second goal rather badly</em><br><br></p>
              </h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>John Terry blew his top as a fatal weakness in the </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>defence was exposed by </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span></a><strong>'s big guns.</strong></p>
              <p>The England captain was incandescent with rage at his team's awful marking after they conceded twice from corners to lose 2-1 at Villa Park, gifting top spot in the Barclays Premier League to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The defeat was Chelsea's second in successive away matches, following their humiliation at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wigan-athletic.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Wigan</span></a>, and the defence which once seemed impregnable now looks to be rocking at set-pieces.</p>
              <p>Hulking centre-backs Richard Dunne and James Collins did the damage for Villa with a goal in each half after Didier Drogba had given Chelsea the lead - and it wasn't just Terry who raged with frustration.</p>
              <p>Drogba and defender Ashley Cole also had a fierce argument on the pitch over the problems at the back and manager Carlo Ancelotti laid into Chelsea's approach for the third away trip in a row.</p>
              <p>The Italian, who knows defensive frailties could pose a threat to his side's title challenge, said: 'On the set-plays we need to do better. We need to apply more pressure and more markers in the box.</p>
              <p>'At Wigan, we made the same mistake for the first goal and we have to work to improve the situation because it's important.</p>
              <p>'We have a lot of very good jumpers, like Didier Drogba, John Terry, Ricardo Carvalho, and we have to pay more attention, with more concentration in the box. We have worked on the set-plays but have to maintain focus. There are things we can improve and set-plays are one of these.'</p>
              <p>Chelsea actually won in the Champions League at Apoel Nicosia between these two defeats. However, their poor showing in Cyprus still had Ancelotti reverting to his native tongue to lambast his players because his English was not good enough to express the level of his anger.</p>
              <p>Villa manager Martin O'Neill insisted his side should have won by more yesterday after being denied a penalty early in the game. But his argument that Villa were well worth a victory - and that it wasn't based purely on set-pieces -fell on deaf ears after Frank Lampard, Ricardo Carvalho and Nicolas Anelka all shared the blame for Chelsea's setback.</p>
              <p>Terry was still furious as he left the ground but goalkeeper Petr Cech, who was defended by Ancelotti, admitted the defeat was a blow to Chelsea's title hopes.</p>
              <p>He said: 'We gave United a chance to get in front of us and it is three points dropped unnecessarily.</p>

              <p><br>Not really, United have been living on their luck these last few matches... The 2 own goals saved them from droping more points...</p>
              <p>How I look at it is they won't be so lucky all the time, and if I am honest, they don't look very good at all... So unless they buck up, they will soon pay the price as well...</p>
              <p>Something is not right at Chelsea also though not as serious... I find that Carlos shouldn't change Lampard from his usual position... Lampard isn't as effective so far cos he is playing on the side of the diamond rather than at the top... But a quick changeback should do the trick... And Deco, though impressive in that position but he isn't effective.</p>
              <p>The team of the moment must be Arsenal.</p>
              <p>They are looking very impressive, RVP seems to have found his old form back and is banging in the goals for them now... So for me, gunners is the form team of the moment...</p>

              <p>HAHAHA this is funny...</p>
              <p>Yeah no team is unbeatable this season... Man utd has been quite lucky up to now.. they should have lost to arsenal but in the end they still won thanks to an abou diaby own goal...</p>
              <p>Chelsea seems strong at first but now internal problems and weakness at the back are being exposed.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are rather shitty this season, having lost the last 2 games and losing 4 out of 9 games, is enough said about their title credentials. Without gerrard and torres, they are nothing.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, has been written off at the start of the season, having not bought anyone except vermaelen to replace adebayor and toure. Howver, having changed to a 4-3-3 formation, they are banging in goals like nothing. With arshavin, RvP, rosicky and fabregas, their offense are superb. Lets not forget nasri, walcott, eduardo and bendtner.</p>
              <p>Also, lets not forget spurs and villa. They have the ability to break into the big 4 this season. Moneybag City as well. The most likely big 4 to surrender their status is liverpool, based on recent performances.</p>
              <p>Therefore, next 2 weeks would be critical as Man utd would face liverpool, before taking on blackburn. Chelsea face the hard tackling teams like blackburn and bolton. Arsenal takes on west ham and spurs in 2 london derbies. Liverpool will take on fulham the week after next.</p>
              <p>So therefore, all the big 4 are facing tough games against each other or the slightly better teams during the next 2 weeks. Thus, end of october, we would be able to see which are the teams that definitely have what it takes to win the crown this season, would a runaway leader emerge or would the competition still be as competitive as it has been for the past few weeks.</p>
