              <p>JT cheated on his buddy and now he seems to be exonerated with all that support as evident at stamford bridge last sunday.</p>
              <p>I think I know why....99.9% of fans in the stadium were men. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> If they had been women, JT would have been stoned to death lol.</p>

              <p>JT cheated on his wife not his buddy......HIS WIFE!!</p>
              <p>Why is all the focus on bridge when terry's wife, Toni, is the real victim?</p>
              <p>Vanessa Perroncel had nothing to do with Bridge when they begin the affair...</p>

              <p>Terry cheated on his wife and on his friendship with Bridge. He even cheated on the England FA. The fact that he was willing to pay hundred of thousands to keep her from telling the world what he did or said during their relationship... said it all.</p>
              <p>We may say Terry is rich enough and won't feel a thing but for a guy who goes behind his club back and conduct personal tours for just $10,000 and sold his box seats at Wembley stadium which he was not allowed to do for $4,000... You can certainly say for sure he will feel a very big pinch when the reported sum of ($400k to $800k) to keep Ms Perroncel from exposing his behaviour during their fling will hurt him.</p>
              <p>As for those Stamford Bridge fans... Bridge has left them. It would have been interesting to know how they would react if Bridge was still a well liked member of the club. We can only say they support their sportsman blindly. But if they were personally involved, then they will understand how sick Terry's behaviour was towards Bridge.</p>
              <p>Cheating on one's wife, we can say it's quite common nowadays. But cheating on her with her good friend and the mother of his team-mate and close friend's son... I mean, this have to be the most heartless kind of cheating. Let's see what the Everton fans have to say about it tomorrow... Maybe more new chants will be made...</p>

              <p>Maybe JT actually cheated on MU fans worldwide, otherwise why will you only see mainly one "general kind of ppl" who keep bitching on the twisted part of the story.</p>
              <p>And TS is prob a blind fool. Go search the highlights of the last few games &amp; see if more women support JT or guys.</p>
