              <p><strong>England's Howard Webb has been chosen to referee Sunday's World Cup final.</strong></p>
              <p>Webb will be the first Englishman to referee the final since Jack Taylor in 1974 and the first official to take charge of the European Cup final and the World Cup final in the same year.</p>
              <p>The 38-year-old policeman from Rotherham will be joined by his assistants Darren Cann and Michael Mullarkey for the clash between Spain and Holland at Johannesburg's Soccer City.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Chosen by FIFA's referees committee last night, Webb has taken three matches in this World Cup so far, starting off with Spain's shock defeat by Switzerland.</p>
              </div>
              <p>There was some unhappiness in Spain but Webb's team impressed when Italy met Slovakia with Cann making the right call on a disallowed equaliser from Fabio Quagliarella.</p>
              <p>In the last-16 clash between Brazil and Chile, Mullarkey was praised for his decision to allow Luis Fabiano's goal at a time when Chile's defenders were claiming offside. Taylor was famous for becoming the first referee in World Cup history to award a penalty in a final.</p>
              <p>In Munich 36 years ago he actually awarded two, with Franz Beckenbauer pointing to the fact that he was 'an Englishman' when he awarded the first of the two penalties to the Dutch for a foul by Uli Hoeness on Johan Cruyff. Perhaps ominously for the Dutch, the German hosts went on to win 2-1.</p>

              <p><strong>At the European « sneijder in snub to fergie - Page 95 Championship two years ago Webb was sent home early by UEFA, having allowed a first-half goal from Poland in a group match with Austria that should have been disallowed for offside.</strong></p>
              <p>It was when Webb received death threats from Poland for correctly awarding Austria a penalty in stoppage time that the real controversy erupted, however.</p>
              <p>Even Poland's then prime minister, Donald Tusk, said he wanted to 'kill' Webb, forcing the referee to leave Austria in disguise.</p>
              <p>Taylor, now 80, praised Webb for his performances here in South Africa. 'I've seen a lot of Howard over the years and I've felt he's the best referee we have had for a long time. He's athletic, very fit and in the prime of his career. He would be ideal.</p>

              <p><strong>'I was in the 1966 World Cup squad and refereed in 1970 too, so by the time the World Cup in 1974 came round I was fairly experienced. But it's a fantastic honour and Howard has done very well to get it.'</strong></p>
              <p>Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the FA Premier League, added: 'We see the hard work and professionalism of Howard Webb, Darren Cann and Mike Mullarkey week in, week out when they are officiating in the Barclays Premier League. So it is great to see their fantastic season - where they have already represented English refereeing in the UEFA Champions League final - topped off with the ultimate appointment, the FIFA World Cup final.</p>
              <p>'Credit must to go the Professional Game Match Officials too. The support, training and assessment processes they have in place mean we benefit from having the best prepared officials. Clearly this has been an advantage to Howard and his team.’</p>
