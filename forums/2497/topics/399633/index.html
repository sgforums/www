              <p><em><span style="color: #800080;">Stevie is Mr Liverpool</span></em> (icon).  Unlikely he will want to depart his beloved Club for any rivals in England (unless a opportunity to go overseas).  He had turned down Chelsea before.. furthermore ManCity w/o UCL next season won't even tempt Torres...  There are lots of speculation on possible transfers... but i can't see it happening before World Cup games...</p>

              <p>Then what? Keep asking Fernando to stay go through all shit with us?<br>He's a world class player who deserves medals.</p>
              <p>Imo, I don't expect players to stick through thick and thin with us during difficult periods, like the current one. Especially nowadays, when money is ruling the footballing world. No doubts of course, I know that Fernando is one the lesser ones around who do not look up to '$$$'.</p>
              <p>He gave us what we want already, goals. But we're not 'repaying' him with what he hopes? He joined us for medals, but till now he had none. Realistically, I don't see the team being able to win the league next season also, although, of course, I would very much want see that happen. No one will remember how good or pacy you're when you've nothing to show off.</p>
              <p>He gave the club what he had/could already, he's a truely legend in my heart</p>

              <p>Adebayor to replace Fernando? Not a very good one I would say, but don't expect City to come with Carlos right? lol.</p>
              <p>Ireland okay luh, but definitely not in the same league as Steven or Frank.</p>
              <p>Micah Richards can play in the center also. And imo, I would prefer him in the center than right-back. so.. ya. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>He gave the club what he had/could already, he's a truely legend
              in my heart</p>
              <p> Fair deal right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Adebayor to replace Fernando? Not a very good one I would say,
              but don't expect City to come with Carlos right? lol.</p>
              <p>Ireland okay luh, but definitely not in the same league as
              Steven or Frank.</p>
              <p>Micah Richards can play in the center also. And imo, I would
              prefer him in the center than right-back. so.. ya. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm sorry but I don't think that what, <span><span>Sotirios Kyrgiakos fellow is of any
              gooood.<br></span></span></p>

              <p>Imagine how Fernando is feeling now after putting his heart and soul into a club he supported since a child? I can feel for him luh, his frustration etc.</p>
              <p>If he wants to leave, I wish him all e best.</p>
              <p>Of course, i wish he will stay <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>this kind of rumours has no merit. would liverpool able to pay the kind of wages adebayor is getting? maybe pay straight 60million + ireland is more viable option.</p>
              <p>i believe adebayor also wont leave man city coz he cant get the kind of salary from any other clubs. mercenary like him will know the maths.</p>
