            <div class='col-md body'>DIMITAR BERBATOV has sensationally told Spurs he would like to join a Â‘bigÂ’ club -tott putting Manchester United on red alert.<br><br>In a bombshell interview with SunSport, the Bulgarian superstarÂ’s agent Emil Dantchev last night revealed: Â“I have already spoken to the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, and told him that if a club that corresponds to DimitarÂ’s class and ambition comes in with an offer that suits his current club in January, he would like to be allowed to go.<br><br>"Dimitar is OK at Tottenham. I would not say he is happy. But his performances for the club are a testament to his commitment to the fans and his team-mates.<br><br>Â“He has never stopped trying and scoring goals to help the team.<br><br>Â“Fans must understand Dimitar is 27 next month and time is running out for him to play for a club that can match his ambition.Â”<br><br>That club ideally would be one of the Premier LeagueÂ’s big four Â— United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool Â— or the likes of AC Milan, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, who are also following the situation closely.<br><br>The news will be a bitter blow to Spurs supporters, as well as boss Juande Ramos.<br><br>Ramos refused to give assurances Berbatov would not be sold in January, following the strikerÂ’s four-goal haul in the 6-4 win over Reading.<br><br>United, who failed to land the striker with a Â£19m bid last summer, are certain to line up a new offer. They will need Â£25m this time.<br><br>Dantchev added: Â“I would like to stress this is not about money. This is about sporting ambition.<br><br>Â“Nor has it anything to do with new manager Juande Ramos. Dimitar is perfectly happy with Ramos and the way he is working.<br><br>Â“But after TottenhamÂ’s bad start to the season, it is unlikely they will have the chance to do something big this season.<br><br>Â“It is a long-term plan for them. Dimitar wants to fulfil his potential and win trophies now.<br><br>Â“He would definitely consider a move outside of England. That is not the issue. What matters is it is a club that matches his ambition and his level and there are only five or six around Europe.<br><br>Â“Two clubs outside of England and one from the Premier League are interested in him.Â”<br><br>Ramos said: Â“Football is an open market in January. Any player has a chance of changing teams if there is an offer. So I canÂ’t give any assurances.Â”<br><br>Speaking to SunSport in November, Levy refused to rule out the chance Berbatov could be sold next month.<br><br>But speaking on the clubÂ’s official website last night, he said: Â“Once again, for the record, we are not a selling club.Â”<br></div>

United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been given all the encouragement he needed to launch a January move for Berbatov after the striker's agent, Emil Dantchev, admitted that the player wants to 'play for a club that can match his ambition'. </strong><br><br>While Spurs chairman Daniel But now that signs are emerging that Tottenham's resolve is weakening, Ferguson is determined to be at the head of the queue for his top target. Dantchev's admission that two clubs from outside the Barclays Premier League are also on the trail of Berbatov will mean Ferguson must act fast if he is to finally get his man. Manchester City are also understood to be keen on Berbatov, but despite chairman Thaksin Shinawatra's millions, the Bulgarian's clear preference is Old Trafford.<br><br>However, competition from the likes of AC Milan, Inter Milan and Real Madrid is sure to drive up the price. In addition, Levy's reputation for driving a hard bargain Â— he managed to prise Â£18.6million out of United for Michael Carrick 18 months agoÂ— will mean Ferguson will have to dig deep if he is to fend off the competition.<br><br>Levy will be looking for a healthy profit on the player who cost Â£10.9m when he moved from Bayer Leverkusen, with a fee in the region of Â£25m the target. But Ferguson's desire to add the skill and guile of Berbatov Â— who scored four goals in the 6-4 win against Reading on Saturday Â— to his already formidable forward line is such that he is determined to outbid even Europe's biggest clubs.<br><br>Levy insisted on Sunday that Spurs are 'not a selling club', behind the scenes the north London club are preparing for life without Berbatov. Tottenham's army of European scouts have been handed the unenviable task of finding a replacement by sporting director Damien Comolli Â— news that will be music to the ears of Ferguson. The United boss had feared that Spurs would not be willing to sell in January under any circumstances.<br><br></div>
