              <p><strong>Manchester United were given an
              early scare at Newcastle United on Wednesday before hitting back
              for a 2-1 victory that restored their seven-point cushion at the
              top of the Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Newcastle's Peter Lovenkrands became the first player to
              score past United keeper Edwin van der Sar in the league for
              more than 21 hours with a ninth-minute tap-in but Wayne Rooney
              levelled and Dimitar Berbatov sealed the points after the break.</p>
              <p>United's 11th consecutive league victory took them to 65
              points from 27 games. Chelsea and Liverpool, who have both
              played a game more, are both back on 58 with time running out.</p>
              <p>Fourth-placed <strong>Aston Villa</strong>'s Champions League ambitions were
              dealt a blow with a 2-0 loss at <strong>Manchester City</strong> while <strong>Stoke City </strong>climbed out of the bottom three with a 2-0 home victory over
              <strong>Bolton Wanderers</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>West Ham United</strong> won 1-0 at <strong>Wigan Athletic</strong>.</p>
              <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong> shook off the disappointment of losing to
              Manchester United in Sunday's League Cup final with a 4-0
              hammering of <strong>Middlesbrough </strong>to ease their relegation worries.</p>
              <p>Fifth-placed <strong>Everton </strong>drew 0-0 at <strong>Blackburn Rovers</strong> while <strong>Hull
              City </strong>scored late to beat <strong>Fulham </strong>1-0 at Craven Cottage to halt
              their recent slide.</p>
              <p>United, who are closing in on an 18th league title, saw
              their lead reduced by Chelsea and Liverpool on Tuesday and their
              rivals would have been hoping for a favour from a Newcastle side
              is desperate need of points.</p>
              <p>They could not have been expecting Van der Sar to offer them
              a chink of light, but the veteran Dutchman did just that after
              nine minutes when he spilled a cross from Jonas Gutierrez and
              Dane Lovenkrands was on hand to punish the error.</p>
              <p>"We got off to a terrible start and Newcastle were on top,"
              United manager Alex Ferguson, who was clearly not happy with his
              side's early efforts, told Sky Sports.</p>
              <p>"Edwin said himself he made a mess of it. It was a hairy
              spell for us. It was going to happen sometime," he added,
              referring to Van der Sar's rare slip.</p>
              <p>United were at sixes and sevens early on and they were
              lucky to see Obafemi Martins shoot into the side-netting when he
              had a great chance to put Newcastle 2-0 ahead.</p>
              <p>Normal service was resumed after 20 minutes when Rooney, who
              missed United's League Cup final success through illness, beat
              Steve Harper with a shot on the turn.</p>
              <p>A niggly first half ended with Cristiano Ronaldo and Steven
              Taylor getting involved near the touchline and Rio Ferdinand
              receiving a yellow card.</p>
              <p>Taylor was badly at fault for United's winner after 56
              minutes when he attempted to chest the ball back to his keeper
              but instead gave the ball to Park Ji-sung who in turn fed
              Berbatov to score with ease.</p>
              <p>"We required a lot of grit at times," said Ferguson.
              "Whenever you come back from 1-0 down to win you must be
              pleased."</p>
              <p>Villa were looking for an eighth consecutive away league
              victory but were second best at Manchester City who won with
              goals from Elano and Shaun Wright-Phillips.</p>
              <p>They are now just three points above Arsenal in the race for
              the final Champions League berth.</p>
