            <div class='col-md body'>Terry wants management clause in Blues contract<br><br>John Terry has revealed he spoke to Chelsea about becoming manager at the end of a nine-year contract during contract talks at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>The England captain last month reported there had been 'no movement' on his contract situation at Stamford Bridge - but he remains adamant he wants to stay at the club for the rest of his career.<br><br>The 26-year-old confirmed that talks between himself and the club had broken down but insisted the situation was not irretrievable.<br><br>However, he has now revealed further details.<br><br>Terry told the BBC: 'I'd certainly like to manage one day. When we were speaking about my contract with Chelsea we were talking about a nine-year contract maybe with an option to manage at the end of it.<br><br>'That is certainly the way I want to go, I want to get my badges and then make that decision at the end of it.'<br><br>Terry also paid tribute to his boss at Stamford Bridge, Jose Mourinho, and when asked what was so special about the Portuguese, explained: 'Everything about the man. First and foremost he is a great man. On a personal one to one basis he's always there for you and if you need to speak to him his door is always open on both a personal and football level.<br><br>'Tactically he is so spot on. We have team meetings and he doesn't waffle on for 20,30 minutes - it's a 10-minute meeting.'<br><br>Terry admitted he would like to see David Beckham - who he succeeded as England skipper - back in the national squad.<br><br>'Of course. He's a great player. That is Steve McClaren's decision to pick and drop players but he is still a world-class player.<br><br>'I was speaking to him, he is getting back fit and he would love to come back for his country and play.<br><br>'With his good looks and everything he brought a different perception to being England captain.<br><br>'First and foremost, he was a fantastic talent. He's been really good with me over the last six months since I've taken over. He was the first person along with Steven Gerrard to congratulate me.'<br><br>Terry freely admitted England have been disappointing as they fail to impress in their bid to qualify for Euro 2008.<br><br>However, the London-born defender cannot pinpoint the reason behind England's poor performances.<br><br>'The group of players have come out publicly and said we have under-achieved recently, we are not playing to the potential we can and that is the most frustrating thing for Steve McClaren.<br><br>'We do that week in week out for our clubs but we get to that level and the lads are just not doing it and we take that responsibility ourselves and we need to improve - simple as that.'<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Huh? That's one weird clause. If the manager at the end of that year is doing great, he would have to be booted for Terry, whose management skill and credibility is unknown? He might not be another Roy Keane or Mark Hughes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no wonder the contract is stalled.. hes a good central back, but no one can tell if hes a good manager or not, to put that in his contract clause is a bit of arrogant in his part  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
