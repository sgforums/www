              <h1>Shakhtar Donetsk 1 Fulham 1: Roy Hodgson's heroes rewarded with Juventus clash</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Fulham pulled off their greatest result in European competition last night to set up a last-16 clash with the mighty Juventus.</p>
              <p>However,
              their success was marred by an injury-time red card for Danny Murphy,
              who was judged to have kicked out at right back Darijo Srna by the
              corner flag.</p>
              <p>The midfielder will miss at least the first
              leg against the Italian giants, who later in the evening saw off Ajax
              thanks to a goalless draw which earned a 2-1 aggregate win.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/25/article-1253821-08780A94000005DC-808_468x316.jpg" alt="Brede Hangeland (left) celebrates with his Fulham team-mates" width="468" height="316">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Joy: Brede Hangeland (left) celebrates with his Fulham team-mates</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Roy Hodgson hailed Shakhtar as the best side he had faced in 35
              years of management, but his troops thwarted the UEFA Cup holders
              thanks to stunning defensive performances from centre-half Brede
              Hangeland and goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer.</p>
              <p>Hangeland was also
              the hero at the other end, heading a 33rd-minute goal against the run
              of play that Shakhtar never quite recovered from.</p>
              <p>Jadson
              pulled one back with 21 minutes to play, but Fulham held on,
              restricting the home side to mostly long-range efforts and taking
              advantage of a 2-1 lead from the first leg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/25/article-1253821-0878181D000005DC-374_306x423.jpg" alt="Brede Hangeland (top left) scores" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Brave: Brede Hangeland (top left) scores</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But Bobby Zamora, who pushed his England claims with a hard-working
              performance as an often isolated lone striker, may have lost his chance
              of being called up by Fabio Capello by aggravating an achilles injury
              that forced him off with 18 minutes to play.</p>
              <p>'This Shakhtar
              team is as good as any team I have come across in 35 years, and perhaps
              over two games, they may feel they deserved to win,' said Hodgson.</p>
              <p>It
              has been a wonderful night for the club. Shakhtar showed what a good
              team they are; their ability to pass and keep the ball is as good as
              I've seen.</p>
              <p>'Most of the testing came from long shots, which
              was a credit to us. The only thing that marred the evening was the
              sending-off.'</p>
              <p>Fulham will not appeal the decision, but the
              normally placid Hodgson did lose his rag after a hard challenge minutes
              before left Damien Duff floored.</p>
              <p>Ilsinho was booked and
              Hodgson appeared to lay into the wrong man - impressive substitute
              Douglas Costa - for which he apologised.</p>
              <p>This was supposed
              to have been a night when a Shakhtar victory followed Donetsk
              celebrating the inauguration of local man Viktor Yanukovych as the
              country's president.</p>
              <p>A pre-match poll on the club's website had asked not if Shakhtar would win, but by which scenario.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/25/article-1253821-087808D9000005DC-305_468x341.jpg" alt="Bobby Zamora battles" width="468" height="341">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>The hard yards: Bobby Zamora battles with the Shakhtar defence</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Both clubs put out the same line-ups as in the first legs and
              Shakhtar started at a frantic pace. Neither of Fulham's English left
              backs could stake their claim to replace Wayne Bridge in Fabio
              Capello's thoughts, with Paul Konchesky still out with an ankle injury
              and on-loan Nicky Shorey not part of the UEFA squad.</p>
              <p>While
              they could have been accused of trying to walk the ball into the net a
              week before, this time they set about peppering Schwarzer's goal from
              distance as soon as they got sight.</p>

              </div>
              <p>By half an hour in, they had racked up 11 shots and nine corners,
              but it was Fulham who took the lead with their first meaningful attack.</p>
              <p>Zamora won a free-kick down the right, Murphy crossed it in
              and Hangeland nodded in only his third Fulham goal from eight yards.</p>
              <p>The
              crowd of almost 50,000 were silenced and Shakhtar struggled to retain
              their composure, seeming to get in their way and firing increasingly
              poor long-range efforts as the break approached.</p>
              <p>The
              Ukrainians were better after boss Mircea Lucescu had got at them, but
              Fulham's defence - Hangeland in particular - blocked everything thrown
              at them Shakhtar improved with the introduction of Douglas Costa, who
              fashioned the equaliser by skinning Stephen Kelly and cutting it back
              from the right for Jadson to score from 10 yards.</p>
              <p>But the
              winner never came. Lucescu cried conspiracy, claiming the Norwegian
              officials embraced with their Fulham compatriots at the end. Fulham
              deserved their glory, though.</p>
