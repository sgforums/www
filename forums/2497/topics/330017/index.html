              <p>Let's get the <a href="http://languagecaster.com/football-language-resources/football-cliches/">clich√©s</a> out the way first. A win is a win. We'll take the three points. There
              are no easy games in international football. We all gave two million
              per cent.<br> <br> Now let's get real. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andorra">Andorra</a> are rubbish. It's not surprising. All the men of marriable age play
              international football. Frankly there is no point whatsoever in a team
              like that playing dozens of qualifying matches.</p>
              <p>They are about as likely to win an international football match as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7603307.stm">Andy Murray</a> is to win a beauty pageant.</p>
              <p>Andorra
              do not really play football - they play a football version of piling up
              the furniture against the door stop a baddie getting into your bedroom.
              It kind-of works too if the baddie in question is as <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7593908.stm">witless as England</a>.</p>
              <p>But surely it's time that the minor nations - and I mean the ones that are not so much minnows as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill">krill</a> - can have their own pre-qualifying shindig and we can find out which
              one of San Marino, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg and Andorra and Scotland
              (joke!) are allowed to join the party.</p>
              <p>Actually, I give it four years before England have a bit of pre-qualifying to do. <br> The question that really arises from Saturday - and might well be confirmed come Wednesday is this - is it time to accept that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7602786.stm">England are a poor football team</a>?</p>
              <p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img class="mt-image-none" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/robborobson/fabio_robbo462.jpg" alt="fabio_robbo462.jpg" width="462" height="342"></span><br> <br> There's not a bloke in that squad who can raise his game to the heights
              necessary, is there? Why is it that Lampard is still there, plying his
              horribly average trade when there must be a case for putting a bucket
              of cod in there in his stead?</p>
              <p>Why is it that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7603135.stm">Rooney is a worse player now than when he was 17</a>?  Shrek is slowly but surely turning into the bloody donkey!</p>
              <p>Look at the lad Murray last night - brilliant!  How can a sportsman get progressively worse between the ages of 17 and 21?</p>
              <p>Why is Beckham still there, mobile as a fencepost, when Walcott,
              Bentley, Agbonlahor, Young, Lennon, my mum, the bucket of cod's brother
              are all left out?</p>
              <p>I like Becks, but he's done with and it's time the lad was left to
              his showbiz pals and we play a footballer on the right and not a brand.</p>
              <p>Even a Boro fan has to accept that Stew Downing is not up to it at
              international level. Defoe is still a desperate pick, Heskey without
              Owen is pointless. All right Emile had a great season last year - three
              goals he scored - and he's honest. But that's it.</p>
              <p>Until Joe Cole came on I've seen more wit and invention in a <a href="http://www.itv.com/Lifestyle/jeremykyle/default.htm">Jeremy Kyle</a> monologue. Not that I saw the game live cos I'm one of millions who
              think Setanta is some sort of drab Eastern European car that runs on
              potato peelings.</p>
              <p>Is it beyond the brainless trolls of terrestrial TV land to cough up
              for a highlights programme? Frankly you'd think Setanta would be paying
              us to watch highlights of Andorra v England any road.</p>
              <p>I mean, ITV were happy to show the <a href="http://socceraid.unicef.org.uk/">Soccer Aid</a> farce last night on prime-time. Obviously it's great to raise the money
              for UNICEF but why does the attachment of the word "charity" to a big
              event seem to give permission for the product to be rubbish?</p>
              <p>Actually I'm going to stop there cos if I'm honest I'm just gut-wrenchingly narked that <a href="http://www.garethgates.com/">Gareth Gates</a> gets to share the Wembley turf with Romario and Figo and the rest of us
              sit around with envious faces trying to work out who the hell half the
              celebrities are.</p>
              <p>Mind you Deayton marking Figo is more comprehensible than some of the omissions from the Fab squad.</p>
              <p>Though they seem to turn the three lions on their chest into the toothless flea-bitten kind that mince along <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/">Yellow Brick Roads with the other friends of Dorothy</a>, I'm not sure the players are entirely to blame.</p>
              <p>No Ashton, no Agbonlahor, no Young, no Owen, no sense. At least there are some reasons for optimism.</p>
              <p>Capello's obvious fury makes a welcome change from them tiny frowns from Sven and Smiley Steve's feeble brolly and coffee faff.</p>
              <p>Two-up and Cole and Rooney start to coast around the place like it's job done. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7597191.stm">Good lad Fabio, give 'em a good old slagging</a>.</p>
              <p>But the fact is that this England side scares no one. Except their
              own fans. Ferdinand and Gerrard would help, even if Stevie G is
              bleating that he never got his favourite position ever.</p>
              <p>Ask Paul Scholes if he thinks it's fair. I think <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7602774.stm">Wednesday night against Croatia</a>, that reality will bite and we'll finally realise that we're not good enough.</p>
              <p>And that could - only could - result in England playing a brand of football that is, God help us, English.</p>
              <p>Obviously we'll miss the scintillating continental style interplay
              between Terry, Lescott, Johnson and Cole at the back, with no one more
              than 200 yards near them.</p>
              <p>But maybe a lot of pace, energy, direction, verve... you know, the
              way Liverpool play when Rafa wants them to win...the way Man Utd
              play...hell, the way Chelsea played in the opening game of the season
              might just mean that the team can become greater than the sum of its
              parts.</p>
              <p>It does require that the players understand their roles - and that
              means 4-4-2. Dull yes, but then that matches an England footballer's
              mind. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6035559.stm">Remember when McClaren played a Donadonian 5-3-2 in Zagreb</a>?  A lot to ask of a team with the IQ of an armchair.</p>
              <p>But when I think about England I feel like a bloke looking for a date at a supermodel convention - I'm just clutching at straws.<br> <br> In fact let's just settle for supporting a Scot for a change. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7603307.stm">C'mon Murray, son</a>.</p>

                  footballer's mind. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6035559.stm">Remember when McClaren played a Donadonian 5-3-2 in
                  Zagreb</a>? A lot to ask of a team with the IQ of an armchair.</p>
              <p>But when I think about England I feel like a bloke looking for a
                  date at a supermodel convention - I'm just clutching at
                  straws.<br> <br> In fact let's just settle for supporting a Scot for a change.

              <p>¬†<strong>I used to hate England a lot because everyone are so unbearably
              cocky. From the fans to the media to the coaches. Remember the
              pre-match talks before they faced Croatia? How they dismissed Croatia.
              Now Capello has brought them down to earth so they shut up and worked
              hard against Andorra. But I can't help this is what England fans
              deserve if they keep showing their opponents such disrespect. What do
              they expect Andorra to do? If I face Mike Tyson in the ring, do i go
              defensive and hide or come out all punches flying? They should have
              just come out to do a professional job and win and let it be. If they
              get frustrated by defensive tactics then its their own failure not to
              be able to find the good final pass to the strikers. Face it England
              fans, your team was poor.</strong></p>
