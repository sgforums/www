              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Portsmouth chief executive Peter Storrie has said he will stay with the club - and admitted it would be "daft and stupid" to sack Paul Hart.</span></p>
              <p><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Pompey missed a host of chances in a 1-0 home defeat against Everton yesterday - their seventh successive setback - and remain anchored to the foot of the table.</p>
              <p>Today's newspapers have suggested time is not on Paul Hart's side, with former Celtic boss Gordon Strachan one of the names to be linked to the club.</p>
              <p>However, Storrie believes Hart can turn things around.</p>
              <p>He said: "It's okay people saying 'go and change things' but look at the performance yesterday - and the support.</p>
              <p>"It was a very strong performance we think we can build on for the future. You'd be daft and stupid to change it."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Storrie remains optimistic the spending power of new owner Sulaiman Al Fahim will soon make the squad stronger.</p>
              <p>He continued on Radio Five Live's Sportsweek: "He's said there's £50million coming, publicly at a meeting to supporters on Friday night.</p>
              <p>"Sulaiman showed the board documentation to say the money's there. We hope it all comes to fruition in the next few days.</p>
              <p>"We can only go by what he's told the fans and what we've seen."</p>
              <p>Storrie has ended speculation he will leave the club, adding: "Making sure the club is sound and the finances come in has always been the main issue for me,</p>
              <p>so I'm very happy to stay and continue being at a club I've enjoy being at for the last seven years."</p>
              <p>He appreciated Pompey fans singing his name at yesterday's game, adding: "It makes you feel quite humble, to be honest - they didn't need to do it but I appreciate it very much.</p>
              <p>"If they feel like that I want to be there to continue to help and wouldn't walk out on the club.</p>
              <p>"It's been a hard eight or nine months but I thought we played extremely well yesterday and were unfortunate not to win.</p>
              <p>"Then the crowd chant your name - it makes you think 'this doesn't happen to many chief executives'."</p>
              <p>Storrie admitted the Hampshire club's financial problems prevented the club from being able to replace quality players such as Peter Crouch, Sylvain Distin and Nico Kranjcar during the transfer window.</p>
              <p>He explained: "There's been a massive change and we've had to bring players in at the last minute but the performance yesterday was the best for some while.</p>
              <p>"We're confident the players will turn it around - and they are too."</p>
              <p>Storrie refuted suggestions the new arrivals are not good enough for the Premier League.</p>
              <p>He explained: "All the players we've brought have either played in the Premier League, come from the Premier League, or played in top leagues in Europe.</p>
              <p>And he remains convinced the club will maintain their top flight status, despite making the worst start in Premier League history.</p>
              <p>He added: "We're still hanging in there and hopefully this finance will mean the hard work over the last six or seven months will come to fruition and we'll be strong.</p>
              <p>"We're confident - if you see players' heads down you'd be worried or not creating chances, but we should have had something in five out of the seven games."</p>
