              <p>Inter thoroughly deserved to be European champions. Congrats to Mourinho, his players, and everyone associated with the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, the incoming Inter manager would have <strong>big</strong> shoes to fill, with Inter as defending european champion and not forgetting the winner of the past 5 (or is it 6, 7?) Scudetto titles. I wonder who would it be.....</p>

              <p>In my opinion, Bayern were the better side last night... Only
              thing was Inter had the Mourinho blueprint of a team... They were
              more determined from front to back. The defenders were like Terry
              and Carvalho used to be, diving in with their bodies to block
              any shots that the Bayern strikers made...</p>
              <p>Inter probably had only 1/3 of the position up until
              the second goal and Bayern had the better movement too... Only
              problem was without Ribery, it was only left to Robben who
              terrorist the Inter defence on his own throughout the match
              but had no one to assist him. And also without Ribery, Inter was
              able to concentrate fully on Robben putting 2 men on him each time
              he went on his dazzling runs...</p>
              <p>Overall, Inter had a better keeper and a better striker... That
              reminds me of another thing... Argentina have such an abundance of
              attacking talents like Higuain, Aguero, Tevez, Milito and not
              to forget Messi as well... I wonder who gets to start their
              match at the WC... I am thinking Aguero could be first choice
              if Messi is move to the wing... Higuain, Tevez and Milito
              might have to fight for the other spot... Oh yeah, and there is
              this Martin Palermo from Boca Juniors as well... Wonder what
              are his chance of even getting a minute in SA...</p>

              <p>Mourinho will fail if he becomes the next manager of RM.</p>
              <p>We all know mourinho likes to play defensively from his managing of inter and chelsea and hes someone who wouldn't mind sacraficing attractive football for results which is against the "entertaining" football set by the board of RM/fans.</p>
              <p>At real madrid, they don't even have a decent defender, only individualist such as CR and kaka who couldn't careless about moving back to defence when the opposition is in posession of the ball.</p>
              <p>So unless hes willing to kick out some of the galactico and replace them with team players, he is going to fail badly.</p>
              <p>RM also have a policy of keeping their galacticos and bringing  galacticos every season which will then bring about another problem when it comes to transfer management. Same problem he faced at chelsea.</p>
              <p>So either mourinho changes his game plan or the RM board has to budge. If none of them are willing to compromise I just don't see him being successful at RM.</p>
              <p>Even then it is stupid of RM to hire mourinho. Mourinho will kill everything that RM stood for. I guess the people at  RM are too desperate for a trophy they are willing to sacrifice their global brand.</p>

              <p>imo, the only way to beat mourinho is to have another mourinho. Then they frustrate the shit out of each other with their defensive, methodical play lol. Why mourinho wins is because these teams like to attack. And he works hard at tactics and details, that's why he's luckier.</p>
              <p>when mourinho goes RM, that will be very interesting. With the best attacking team in the world, Barca...and what's more they have bought David Villa. It will be interesting how he pits his wits against the likes of messi and xavi. And yes, RM will become a boring team.....then when he wins the La Liga and UCL with them, what's next? Bring Notts County to the EPL and UCL hahaha.</p>
