              <p>Wayne Rooney believes England can achieve Euro 2012 glory 
              after he fired the Three Lions into the quarter-finals by scoring the 
              winner against Ukraine on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Rooney headed home a deflected Steven Gerrard cross in the 48<sup>th</sup> minute in the final Group D clash to seal England’s spot in the final 
              eight with a 1-0 victory. 2006 World Cup winners Italy lie in wait, but 
              Rooney insists all remaining teams in the tournament will be hoping to 
              avoid England.</p>
              <p>“Italy will be difficult for us but we 
              believe in ourselves,” he said. “We expect to do well as a team, whether
               people expect us to or not. We have stuck together, worked hard and we 
              have a belief.</p>
              <p>"We’re group winners and ready for the 
              challenges ahead. We know our qualities and what we are capable of. Not 
              many teams will fancy playing us. We are difficult to break down and 
              have players to score goals.”</p>
              <p>Rooney had not scored in an 
              international tournament since the European Championship eight years 
              ago. But after making a goalscoring return from a two-match suspension 
              in Donetsk, the striker was quick to praise his team-mates, in 
              particular skipper Gerrard.</p>
              <p>“I haven’t scored in a major 
              tournament in a while and it was nice to do that with the winning goal,”
               said Rooney. “The whole team was fantastic; we defended really well and
               stuck in there at times against a difficult crowd. Our fans were 
              brilliant and we deserved the win.</p>
              <p>“It was great to get 
              three points and it’s always a great feeling to score. My overall game 
              could have been a bit better but it was my first game for a while.</p>
              <p>"The
               one thing I was delighted with was that I was always putting myself in 
              goalscoring opportunities. I could have done better with a couple more 
              but I got the goal and its three points.</p>
              <p>“Steven's delivery
               has been exceptional in this tournament. He's a world-class player and I
               thought tonight he was really brilliant. He drove us on at times. We're
               lucky to have a player like that in the team."</p>

              <p>Steven Gerrard says England are gaining momentum all the time as they head into their quarter-final meeting with Italy</p>
              <p>Roy
               Hodgson’s England finished top of Group D thanks to a 1-0 win against 
              Ukraine on Tuesday and Gerrard admitted the performance against the 
              co-hosts in Donetsk “wasn’t fantastic” but said the team had done what 
              they needed to do as Wayne Rooney’s goal secured victory.</p>
              <p>It meant
               England, around whom pre-tournament expectations were low, emerged from
               the group unbeaten with seven points after drawing their opener against
               France and then coming back from 2-1 down to defeat Sweden 3-2.</p>
              <p>“We
               came into this group, a difficult group, and the idea was to try and 
              win it,” Gerrard said. “No-one believed in us at the start, but we're 
              gaining momentum as we go along.</p>
              <p>“The performance wasn't 
              fantastic, but we worked hard and got the result. Wayne Rooney's goal 
              was a tap-in - but if he keeps scoring tap-ins for us, we'll go a long 
              way. He is important to the team and the nation.”</p>
              <p>The 
              Liverpool captain said England had “found a better level of performance”
               and explained: “We have been criticised in the past - we can take that,
               but you've seen the reaction.</p>
              <p>“It is not nice to be criticised, 
              but you need to respond. We'll take each game as it comes. The Italians 
              are next, and they're very strong defensively.</p>
              <p>“You need a bit of luck to do well in these competitions. Let's hope we get a bit more along the way.”</p>
              <p>Gerrard's
               fellow midfielder Scott Parker urged fans to remain realistic despite 
              England’s progress, telling the FA website the team were not “all of a 
              sudden going to turn into Spain".</p>
              <p>“The more we progress, we put more pressure on ourselves," he said. "We'll keep taking it step by step - and then who knows?”</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper
               Joe Hart praised both matchwinner Rooney and England’s supporters, in 
              Ukraine and at home. The Manchester City star said: “We've listened to 
              the support of these magnificent people today, the brilliant people at 
              home have wished us well, and we're just really proud.</p>
              <p>“Wayne Rooney returned and scored a goal like Wayne Rooney does, because that's the type of player he is.</p>
              <p>“We
               can achieve what we came here to achieve - we came to win games. France
               was a tough start, yet we felt we could have won it, and now we've won 
              these last two games.”</p>
              <p>Midfielder James Milner hailed the 
              togetherness in the England camp and said: “It is pleasing we are 
              improving, and the more time we spend together we will get stronger and 
              stronger,” while Joleon Lescott, who scored England’s opening goal of 
              the tournament against the French, said: “We want to continue to 
              progress and get as far as we can.”</p>

              i dont understand why they think the penalty shoot-out loss is hard to take.
