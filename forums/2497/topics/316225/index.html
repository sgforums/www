              <h2>This Summer, Liverpool Mostly Need...</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o10/zocosss/Liverpool.gif" alt="image"></div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p>There's no doubt that the gap has been cut. The gulf of over 20 points to last season's champions has been halved this season, due in the most part to the addition of Fernando Torres and the benefit of a full campaign from the almost unbreachable Javier Mascherano.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But ManYoo and Chelsea will undoubtedly spend again this summer (the former on a striker and the latter on flair) and Liverpool will need to spend again simply to ensure that the gap does not grow again. If they intend to actually compete for the title, they will need to spend more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We take a look at the current Liverpool squad and speculate about the areas that need to be strengthened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>GOALKEEPER</strong><br>Questions continue to be asked about Jose Reina - and particularly his comfort under high balls - but this summer's goalkeeping priority will be in providing competition for the Spaniard rather than procuring a replacement. If his price continues to be prohibitive and Scott Carson returns, that problem will be solved. If not, someone other than Charles Itandje is needed to warn Reina that he is not entirely untouchable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>RIGHT-BACK</strong><br>The only thing regular about the right-back situation at Liverpool this season has been the regularity of the switch between Steve Finnan and Alvaro Arbeloa. Rafa is clearly not convinced by either - Jamie Carragher's inclusion at right-back in the big games tells a very clear story - and neither would walk into another top four side. Possible replacements are hardly two a penny (as the high asking prices for Dani Alves and Jose Bosingwa suggest) but Schalke's Brazilian right-back Rafinha and Borussia Dortmund's Philipp Degen are names often mentioned in despatches.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>LEFT-BACK</strong><br>Rafa's ridiculously protracted chase of Gabriel Heinze last summer suggests that he knew he needed cover on the left side of defence, with John-Arne Riise, Fabiano Aurelio and an out-of-position Alvaro Arbeloa his only options. When you consider that his rivals have Patrice Evra, Ashley Cole and Gael Clichy in that position, you can see how Liverpool's squad falls short. Riise will exit this summer and he is likely to be replaced - don't be surprised if Wayne Bridge finally leaves Chelsea for the lure of regular Champions League footbal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>CENTRE-HALF</strong><br>Injury to Daniel Agger left Liverpool woefully short in the centre at the start of the season as anyone with eyes in their head could see that Sami Hyypia was not an option to play a full season. Rafa reacted - probably too late - in bringing in Martin Skrtel in January, but that does mean that it's one area of the pitch which need not worry the Reds chequebook this summer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>RIGHT MIDFIELD</strong><br>The fact that Rafa has preferred an enthusiastic but limited Golden Retriever on the right side of midfield in the latter half of the season gives you an indication of the lack of faith he has in either Jermaine Pennant and Yossi Benayoun, who sit firmly in the box labelled 'decent Premier League player' along with the likes of Darren Fletcher and Shaun Wright-Phillips. There are reasons these players are substitutes for Big Four sides, but the difference is that Liverpool have no better alternative to keep the average players on the bench. This is where the big money should be spent this summer, though talk of getting Roma's Mancini for just £4m should see fans rubbing their hands together with glee. Fans may be split on talk of David Bentley - a player capable of making the step up or another 7/10 player?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>LEFT MIDFIELD</strong><br>Harry Kewell should finally shift his arse and his massive wages out of Anfield this summer to leave Ryan Babel and Benayoun as the only real options (assuming Riise's exit), with both playing out of position. Babel could yet become the answer to that conundrum - though he would prefer to play up front - but it's fair to say that they are being linked with Gareth Barry for a reason, and it's not because they fancy he will replace either Javier Mascherano or Xabi Alonso in the middle. Mancini could also play on the left, but Barry's steadiness (and versatility) could well appeal to Rafa. One interesting little rumour nugget had Guillem Balague suggesting that Liverpool would buy an England international midfielder and it would be a 'surprise'. We could perhaps throw the name of Joe Cole into the mix at this point...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>CENTRAL MIDFIELD</strong><br>It will be a surprise if this is where the money is spent this summer as they boast quite a quartet in Mascherano, Alonso, Lucas and Stevie Gerrard, with Damien Plessis capable of filling in where necessary. The capture of Barry would obviously provide other options - particularly if Alonso exits - while someone like Cole could certainly play in the hole in the stead of Gerrard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>STRIKER</strong><br>If Peter Crouch was pondering whether to exit Liverpool this summer, his mind should have been made up by the fact that he was still sat on the bench at the end of a Champions League semi-final in which the Reds needed goals. He will have no shortage of options if he decides to exit, but his replacement will be decided by budget. A big budget and you're looking at Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, a smaller budget and you're maybe looking at Kenwyne Jones.</p>

              <p>i think rafa is one of the over rated manager in the EPL.</p>
              <p>look at the nos of flops he has sign over the 4 years incharge at liverpool.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FLOPS</span></p>
              <p>Alvaro Arbeloa</p>
              <p>Diouf ,Diao,Kvarme,Biscan,Cheyrou,josemi ,nunez</p>
              <p>Traore, sissoko, zenden,cisse,pellegrino, kuyt,</p>
              <p>the only star he manage to sign is torres and javier and skrtel</p>
              <p>he has no patience with his players nor interest in their development. he just want instant success. i bet even players like adebayor, flamini, walcott,toure, will neverbe given time to developed their game.</p>
              <p>Yes , liverpool need to strengthen , but rafa has to stop signing flops!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the latest name being link with liverpool is barry. do  rafa really know what he is buying or buy for the sake to please the fans. delivering nothing but dreams to fans like yourself.</p>

              <p><strong>ROY KEANE will try to persuade Kenwyne Jones that he can achieve his dreams with Sunderland after knocking back an initial enquiry from Liverpool. </strong></p>
              <p><a id="more"></a></p>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>Reds boss Rafa Benitez is ready to pay around £10million for the hitman — and Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United are also looking. Peter Crouch was touted as a makeweight in a deal that would have seen Sunderland also pick up £9million cash.</p>
              <p>Keane, however, has been hugely impressed by Jones' first season in the top flight after a £6m switch from Southampton. The Trinidad star has only bagged seven goals but boss Keane has described him as ‘the best striker in the division'.</p>
              <p>Keane is willing to offload more than 10 of the players that have kept Sunderland in the Premier League for another season. Jones, though, is not one of those.</p>

              <p><a id="more"></a></p>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>Liverpool's giant striker was devastated at being ignored during the Champions League exit at Chelsea, even when a goal down. Having confirmed that he is considering leaving Merseyside at the end of the season, Portsmouth will now step up their bid to clinch a £6million deal.</p>
              <p>Manager Rafa Benitez made Crouch a new offer, but will not stand in the way of a move for his £7m signing. The England ace has a year left on his contract and the offer seemed more about preserving value than making him part of long-term plans.</p>
              <p>There has been a steady deterioration in his relationship with Benitez. A source close to the player said: "Crouchy loves it here but if Rafa stays, he goes. It's as simple as that."</p>

              <p>what liverpool needs is to have RAFA sit down and set his goals right.</p>
              <p>He only goes for the UCL, rotating his players to keep them fresh so he got an edge over the opposing teams and of course, hope the return legs is in anfield.</p>
              <p>Else, he is gone.</p>

              <p>there is no stability in liverpool player.</p>
              <p>why rafa dont play babel more often. he already a good wing man.</p>
              <p>lasy year alonso still a key man for rafa, this year javier, next year barry. cant see why he keep tingering with the player position and games.</p>
              <p>conclusion: Sack rafa get rikaard!!</p>

              <p>i think rafa is one of the over rated manager in the EPL.</p>
              <p>look at the nos of flops he has sign over the 4 years incharge at liverpool.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FLOPS</span></p>
              <p>Alvaro Arbeloa</p>
              <p>Diouf ,Diao,Kvarme,Biscan,Cheyrou,josemi ,nunez</p>
              <p>Traore, sissoko, zenden,cisse,pellegrino, kuyt,</p>
              <p>the only star he manage to sign is torres and javier and skrtel</p>
              <p>he has no patience with his players nor interest in their development. he just want instant success. i bet even players like adebayor, flamini, walcott,toure, will neverbe given time to developed their game.</p>
              <p>Yes , liverpool need to strengthen , but rafa has to stop signing flops!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the latest name being link with liverpool is barry. do  rafa really know what he is buying or buy for the sake to please the fans. delivering nothing but dreams to fans like yourself.</p>

              <p>i think ur list a bit wrong, diouf, diao, kvarme, biscan, cheyrou, traore, cisse were all bought by houllier, not to mention sinama and le tallec. he inherited a very average squad from houllier, n wif limited $$$, aft wat houllier spent on diouf n cisse, nth much he can do. the big problem wif him n houllier is the same, playing players out of position, think of kuyt, cisse, finnan, heskey, kewell, the list goes on. i wont say he is an overrated manager, the record speaks for itself. 5 cup finals, not many teams can boast that record. not even chelsea (no offence)</p>

              <p><strong>Reds Kop the cost of Kewell</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>HARRY KEWELL will have cost Liverpool a massive £157,554 a GAME when his Anfield career comes to an end this month.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Reds are releasing their Aussie winger, 29, after just 139 appearances for the Kop in five years — and just 18 over the last two. Gerard Houllier signed him from Leeds for £5million in July 2003, with the rest of the astronomical sum being made up by wages.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Fulham are keen to take him to London, while Tottenham were interested a year ago. Kewell will be one of a host of departures as boss Rafa Benitez makes wholesale changes.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The highest profile is set to be Peter Crouch, who has emerged as a key figure in the Reds’ bid for Aston Villa midfielder Gareth Barry. Villa chief Martin O’Neill would prefer to get the England striker, plus around £8m, for Barry but has so far been offered keeper Scott Carson, John Arne Riise and Jermaine Pennant.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool’s new stadium on Stanley Park was approved yesterday — for the third time. The Reds have twice won permission from the city council but had to reapply after changes were deemed necessary.</p>

              <h1>Lee lined up as Benitez assistant</h1>
              <p><br><strong>Sammy Lee is now the firm favourite to be appointed as assistant to Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez. Lee was instantly earmarked on Friday as a potential replacement for coach Alex Miller, who has left the club to take up a management position in Japan.</strong></p>
              <p>Initially Benitez would say only, 'we have several names under consideration', but he pointedly refused to rule out Lee's return to Anfield. But sources at the club claim that Lee is Benitez's first-choice for the post and co-owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks have been asked for their approval.</p>
              <p>Benitez has not had an assistant since Pako Ayesteran left the club under a cloud earlier in the season - he is still on `gardening leave'. Miller was officially a coach rather than assistant, but Benitez now seems certain to appoint a replacement for the more senior role.</p>
              <p>Lee's appointment would crucially give Benitez a club legend and Merseyside man at his side. A criticism of the manager's backroom staff has always been that it has too many Spanish coaches without local knowledge. Lee was sacked by Bolton earlier in the season after taking over from Sam Allardyce as manager, having previously worked as a coach under former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier at Anfield.</p>
              <p>In an eight-year playing career for the Reds, Lee amassed a glittering array of honours that included three league titles, two European Cups and four League Cups. Lee moved on to QPR, Osasuna, Southampton and Bolton as his playing career came to an end and returned to Anfield in 1993 as reserve coach under Graeme Souness. He was promoted to first-team coach by Houllier in 1999.</p>
              <p>In July 2004 he left Anfield for a second time to become a full-time member of the England coaching set-up. He was given his first full-time managerial job at Bolton in March 2007 but survived just 14 games and has been out of the game since then.</p>
