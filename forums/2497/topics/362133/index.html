              <div class="photowrap">Guus Hiddink was handed the FA Cup as a going-away present as Chelsea
              recovered from conceding the fastest goal in final history to beat
              Everton 2-1.
              <p>The contest was less than half a minute old when Louis Saha found the net for the Merseysiders.</p>
              <p>It
              was to be a high point for Everton though as Didier Drogba levelled
              before Frank Lampard's 20-yard strike just evaded the despairing dive
              of Tim Howard 18 minutes from time.</p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/DJ/20090530/lamp350_DarrenWalsh.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="200"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apart from allowing Ashley
              Cole to become the first player since the 19th century to collect five
              winners' medals, the victory, Chelsea's second in three years at the
              new Wembley, is a reminder of the stability Hiddink has brought to
              Stamford Bridge since replacing the hapless Luiz Felipe Scolari in
              February.</p>
              <p>And if, as expected, Carlo Ancelotti is confirmed as
              permanent boss when Hiddink returns to his full-time job with Russia,
              the Italian has been given a pretty successful man to follow.</p>
              <p>After
              a pair of tepid semi-finals, the Wembley authorities changed the pitch
              and their groundsman in the hope of getting something better in place
              for their showpiece occasion. The reward came after exactly 25 seconds.</p>
              <p>If there is a more unlucky player in world football at the moment than Saha, he must get some pretty bad fortune.</p>
              <p>During
              a brief period on loan at Newcastle much earlier in his career, Saha
              was overlooked for one FA Cup final. Of the three he sat out at
              Manchester United, he was fit for just one - in 2004, but he was
              ineligible.</p>
              <p>In addition to that, a booking during a brief
              substitute appearance in the World Cup semi-final in Germany three
              years ago meant he was suspended for France's eventual defeat by Italy.</p>
              <p>So
              there was a fair bit of venom in his left foot when Marouane Fellaini
              guided Michael Essien's weak clearance into the former Manchester
              United man's path.</p>
              <p>Saha met the ball perfectly, leaving Petr Cech with not a hope of keeping it out.</p>
              <p>The
              Everton supporters, far more noisy than their Chelsea counterparts
              anyway, erupted in joy, Peter Reid among them, daring to believe this
              year, as in their last appearance 14 seasons ago, they would leave
              Wembley as winners.</p>
              <p>If there is a downside to scoring quite so early, it is the length of time left to hang on.</p>
              <p>Everton
              did try to keep pushing forward. It was just that they were not allowed
              to as Chelsea shook off that massive initial disappointment and slowly
              but purposefully turned the screw.</p>
              <p>Tony Hibbert is what is known
              in the trade as an honest professional. Dedicated to his task, what he
              lacks in ability, he tries to make up for in effort.</p>
              <p>Sometimes though, it is not enough.</p>
              <p>Booked
              after eight minutes for a needless ankle tap on Malouda, he was then
              repeatedly exposed by the French wide-man, a clear case of Chelsea
              targeting an individual within opposition ranks.</p>
              <p>More than any
              other player, Malouda has benefited from working with Hiddink and the
              Dutchman's departure for Moscow will be keenly felt by the former Lyon
              man, acquired at the not inconsiderable cost of £13.5million by Jose
              Mourinho.</p>
              <p>And, assisted by Cole, the pair caused mayhem down the Everton right virtually at will.</p>
              <p>Malouda
              delivered the cross that invited Drogba's powerful finish for the
              Chelsea equaliser, Cole had the angled drive that should have put them
              in front.</p>
              <p>Before that Malouda had just fired over and with
              Lampard's dipping effort virtually skimming the Everton crossbar, it
              was not really a surprise when David Moyes introduced Lars Jacobsen at
              the break.</p>
              <p>The move worked to the extent Chelsea were forced to
              go infield to make ground, Nicolas Anelka going mightily close with a
              deft lob.</p>
              <p>However, in stemming such an obvious flow of attacks on
              their goal, Everton found it easier to relieve the pressure and apply
              some of their own.</p>
              <p>Saha went close with virtually their first
              decent opening since he scored and spirits started to rise again among
              the Toffees faithful. How quickly they were crushed.</p>
              <p>After
              collecting Anelka's lay-off, Lampard was assisted by a slight slip as
              he checked inside Phil Neville - allowing him a couple of extra seconds
              to get a sight of Everton's goal and he duly drilled home from 20 yards.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              were twice controversially denied a third, first when referee Howard
              Webb decided Malouda's effort had not crossed the line after crashing
              back off the bar when TV replays showed it had, then when the official
              booked Lampard for diving when Stephen Pienaar had stuck out a leg for
              him to fall over.</p>
              <p>It did not matter. Hiddink richly deserved to wave goodbye with a glint of silverware in his eye.</p>
