              <h3>THEO WALCOTT is growing frustrated and disappointed at Arsenal’s refusal to offer him a new deal. </h3>
              <p>The England star has just 18 months to run on his present contract, yet no definite offer has been made. His advisors have had just one preliminary meeting with club officials but there was no concrete offer or even outline of terms.</p>
              <h4>Shadow</h4>
              <p>Walcott’s camp feel he is being taken for granted and the uncertainty over Arsene Wenger’s long-term position has also cast a shadow on the teenager’s future at The Emirates. </p>
              <p>A source close to Walcott said: “There is no doubt Theo is frustrated at the lack of action over a new deal. “The club said talks would start in October because they wanted to see how Theo started the season.</p>
              <p>“Theo accepted that because he has the utmost respect for Arsene Wenger. Most people would agree Theo was one of Arsenal’s best players until he picked up his latest shoulder injury. “He was doing well for both his club and country but still nothing happened on the contract front.</p>
              <h4>Rumours</h4>
              <p>“The fact is, he feels as if he’s being taken for granted at the moment, as if people simply expect him to sign a contract.” </p>
              <p><em>Sport </em>understands Walcott is also concerned by rumours Wenger might be driven into Real Madrid’s arms by the boardroom power struggle at the Emirates. Wenger has been instrumental in Walcott’s dev- elopment and the 19-year-old England winger feels a huge bond of loyalty towards his manager. But he is wary of committing himself to any long-term deal if he feels that boss Wenger could walk away at the end of the season to join the Spanish giants. </p>
              <p>Theoretically, he could buy himself out of the last year of his contract in May for £1million — a year’s money — but that is not something Walcott or his advisors are contemplating at the moment.</p>
              <h4>Limbo</h4>
              <p>They are hopeful the arrival of new Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis will help speed up talks but there has been no indication so far the club even have a deal structured. </p>
              <p>Robin van Persie is another player in limbo at The Emirates after talks on his contract extension stalled. The 25-year-old Dutch striker — who has hit 10 goals so far this season — felt he was close to agreeing a new £80,000-a-week deal only to be left hanging on by the board.</p>
              <h4>Thrash</h4>
              <p>His agent is now demanding a meeting with Gazidis — not only to thrash out the finer points of a deal but also to find out what Arsenal’s transfer plans are in the next month. </p>
              <p>There is a feeling within the dressing room that the Gunners’ season could implode unless Wenger and the board make substantial moves during the transfer window.</p>
              <p>With skipper Cesc Fabregas out for four months with a knee problem and Ivory Coast centre-half Kolo Toure seemingly unsettled, Wenger goes into 2009 facing the most testing time of his Arsenal reign.</p>

              <h1>Walcott Will Not Leave Arsenal - Agent</h1>
              <h2>Despite the
              rumours generated yesterday of the possible departure of Theo Walcott
              from Arsenal, his agent reassured the fans that the young player is
              staying put.</h2>
              <p>Colin Gordon, the agent of Arsenal forward Theo Walcott, has confirmed that his client will not be leaving his current club.<br><br>Thanks
              to Article 17, which would allow Walcott to leave the club for just
              €400,000, all major European clubs were linked to the player yesterday.<br><br>"Yes, it's true about Article 17," confirmed the player's agent to <em>Calciomercato.it</em>. "There's this opportunity, but we have no intention of taking advantage of this.<br><br>"Arsenal believed in Walcott when he was just 17-years-old, and we know what gratitude means.<br><br>Gordon also denied that Walcott is unhappy with his contract situation and that there are problems with its renewal.<br><br>"That's absolutely untrue," he continued. "We are negotiating with Arsenal and we are doing so very serenely.<br><br>"I think that we will not have any difficulty to renew the contract."<br><br>Italian teams like Inter, Juventus and Milan have shown interest in Walcott, but Gordon was not surprised.<br><br>"I
              think that it's normal," explained the agent. "He's a fantastic and
              very young player. He has all the credentials to attract the interest
              of such teams.<br><br>"Right now we are talking to Arsenal, but in football ‘never say never’."<br><br>Walcott has been at Arsenal since 2006, and has played in a total of 54 games, scoring five goals in the English Premier League.</p>
