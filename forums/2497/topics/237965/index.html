            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea assistant manager Steve Clarke insists the poor state of the Stamford Bridge pitch will not be a leveller in their FA Cup fifth round tie against Norwich.<br><br>A new surface was put down in December but will be replaced again after this weekend because of its rapid deterioration.<br><br>However, Clarke does not believe the pitch will have much bearing on the outcome of the game against The Canaries.<br><br>"The pitch has been poor since December when we changed it. We're having to change it again and we hope this time it will be better," Clarke said.<br><br>"But it hasn't affected our performances at home. The pitch is poor - but it's not a leveller for Norwich.<br><br>"We played on poor pitches against Wycombe and Forest. If you have the class it should be enough."<br><br>The FA Cup is a major priority for Jose Mourinho's side this season, especially with the final at the new Wembley, as Chelsea were the last winners at the old stadium.<br><br>"The fact it's back at Wembley gives everybody an extra edge to make the final," Clarke continued. "The first final at the new Wembley will be a great occasion, as was the last one."<br><br>Saturday's game begins a busy week of fixtures for Chelsea, with the UEFA Champions League tie with Porto in midweek and the Carling Cup final against Arsenal the following Sunday.<br><br>Clarke added: "We've got a busy week coming up, and the squad will be used fully - but the team we'll put out in the FA Cup will be strong because it's a competition we want to win.<br><br>"We have an idea of what teams we want to play in certain matches. We haven't spoken much about the Carling Cup final - but we've talked briefly on the Norwich and Porto games."<br><br>Meanwhile, Chelsea have denied reports the increased revenue from next season will go towards player wages rather than reducing ticket prices for fans.<br><br>"The reports this morning are a total misinterpretation of what was said in the fans forum. No decision has yet been made over ticket prices for next season and Chelsea representatives were very clear on this from the outset," a club statement read.<br><br>"Any suggestion to the contrary is totally wrong."</div>
