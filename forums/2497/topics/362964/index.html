              <h1>Notts County set for Middle East takeover</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Notts_County.jpg" alt="Notts County" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>Notts County, the world's oldest
              football league club, said on Thursday that a Middle East
              consortium was taking them over in a multi-million pound deal.</strong></p>
              <p>Notts, formed in 1862 but languishing in the lower reaches
              of the English League for many years, said on its website that Munto Finance Limited, owned by
              several Middle-East based businessmen, had agreed to buy the
              club once the usual financial diligence checks had been made.</p>
              <p>Describing the deal as one worth "multi-millions" the club
              said in the statement: "The group wants complete control of the
              Magpies and has ambitious plans to restore the fortunes of the
              world's oldest football league club."</p>
              <p>The club, who finished the recently ended season 19th in
              League Two, would become the fourth in England
              to be taken over by Middle Eastern interests following Premier
              League Manchester City, and Portsmouth, where due diligence
              tests are starting before they are acquired by new Arab owners.</p>
              <p>Egyptian Mohamed Al Fayed has also owned Premier League Fulham
              for 12 years.</p>
              <p><strong>TAKEOVER PROCESS</strong></p>
              <p>The club's chairman John Armstrong-Holmes said in a
              statement that two of the Munto group were appointed to Notts
              County's board on Tuesday to assist in the takeover process.</p>
              <p>He also told Sky Sports News the money involved was
              "substantial" and that the funds were in place for the
              takeover.</p>
              <p>Asked why millionaire businessmen from the Middle East
              would want to invest in a club like Notts County,
              Armstrong-Holmes explained: "Manchester United are probably
              about a billion pounds in debt, something like that I hear,
              they have to spend about 50 million pounds plus a year just to
              service that debt.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool were 300 million pounds in debt, they want
              another 300 million pounds or more for their new stadium, so
              when you look at Notts County as a proposition, rather than
              those propositions, what a success story.</p>
              <p>"You can take the world's oldest football league club,
              progress it through the leagues gradually with a common sense
              approach, rather than throw all that money into a banker's pot
              or someone else's pot."</p>
              <p>Despite being founder-members of the Football League in
              1888, Notts County have had very little success. They won the
              FA Cup in 1894 but their best ever seasons in the top flight
              were third-placed finishes in 1891 and 1901.</p>
              <p>They last played
              in the top division in the 1991/92 season - the final Division
              One season before the Premier League began.</p>

              The debt amount may seem bigger but you need to look at the stability of the club and the yearly profits it generates before comparing...
                  
              While United are probably in debt of around $650m, But they have a yearly net profit of around $80 to $90 million... After servicing the interest on their loan at about $45m yearly, they are still left with about $40m... Their loan period is said to be 7 to 10 yrs... Bottomline is they are not making a loss...
                  
              Liverpool on the other hand is totally different... Without a strong marketing arm bringing in the dollars, the profits made on the field may not be enough to even service their $350m loan... It is said that they are required to pay a sum of $36m per year in interest alone...
                  
              So, the sum owe isn't the important factor... Its the ability to pay and service it which is more important... And finally, its not 1 billion...

              <p>Yea right. As if you do not know that the glazer's took on world record loan and buy Man U and then load the loan on the club.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Poolman, u r the only one actively opening threads, and joining any thread that has an iota of bad stuff about Man U. Think about it.

              What take-over "expert" you are quoting? That John Armstrong-Holmes guy? Is he even qualify to be called an expert in this field?... He is only a chairman of a League 2 bottom side... League 2 is like... After Premier League, League Champions, League 1, then we have League 2... They were lucky they didn't fall into the Conference League in the season just ended...
              
              Anyway, we can easily see he was speaking to promote his own club rather than as a financial expert... And what and how he said it... Its more like a figure of speech or just a metaphor of their debts... But not necessary that amount... 
              
              "Manchester United are probably about a billion pounds in debt, something like that I hear, they have to spend about 50 million pounds plus a year just to service that debt."
              
              "are probably" and "something like that I hear"... These are best pass off as his personal opinion... Hearsay... And definitely not in a capacity of an accountant or an auditor... 
              
              Man United's debt amount have been well published over the last 2 years already... Even the rest of the other big four are well known too... You have over emphasize on the sum liao...
