              Errr... Poolman, I only mention a thread and not those threads as you allege I made against you... Like I said earlier, I only pointed it out as you asked him for proof and not because of anything else... and as in my last posting, last line, I also said and nothing more too... If you didn't asked for proof and forced him to a corner, I probably wouldn't bother with what was going on between you two...
                      
              Ok, how I got confuse with 2005 with 2001 is, Look at your first reply to me on this page, you said... *"well , that was what some Mu said of us when we won the treble at 2005 .... too bad 2005's insult i can't retrieve from sgforums. I was here at 2005, some wasn't here to see those insults from those MU."*
                      
              Then your next post stated... *"Zocoss should know well what happened during 2001 when we won the Carling Cup. Sorry edited from 2005 to 2001."*
                      
              All I said was I wasn't here in 2001, so I don't know what happen... And as you kind of expecting me to know something in here in 2001, I assumed you know what it was and you were here then... 
                      
              Anyway, I have to tell you honestly, though my record show i joint in 2005 Sep, I only started coming in here more regularly from mid 2006... and since the earlier days, I held you in high regards as you were Poolman, head of the Pool forum and didn't create trouble unlike one of your then mod... But I also have to say since Mar or April, i am a little disappointed with some of your postings though as I regarded you as the Pool head and a lot of Pool supporters could follow your lead... But since you are more than ready to have a peaceful forum, I am glad to hear that too... 
                      
              On another point, I can see you have highlighted a few threads in your posts... All I can say is... its just part and parcel of a forum honestly, did United supporters had it any better? The answer is No. You have been in here long enough and you should know... Have you forgotten there are so many clone accounts like ronaldog, Jose23, divingunited, superlong&amp;strong and all his clones... were they any lesser than jffdevil? So why do you even let it bother you and go out to seek trouble for yourself? You are not a clone unlike them... Why do you want to reduce to that level?
                      
              Somehow I feel you are partly responsible for that clone (just my outside opinion)... You notice he keeps coming for you only most of the time? You keep taunting him then he return that favour and it escalate to all those nonsense between you and him...
                      
              As for 'my house', I think there is nothing wrong with it and the mods here all understand that we strive for a free and open forum... We try to refrain any need to edit others or blank them out... Everyone can have their say here unless you are a known clone to us... I will not change or remove anyones posts unnecessarily and you know that. That's why you are here rather frequently too... You can have your opinion air here without disturbance... But we have to remember that every action may create a reaction... So if you go out to create trouble, trouble will find its way back to your doorstep too... 
                       
              As for the term 'mickey mouse treble', I understand its unpleasant to any Pool fans... But I think we all know it started in England and not here... and unfortunately, its a fact thats what they are calling it these days... If you even bother to google the term, maybe you will be surprise who used this term first on Everton way before 2001 or 2005... Its just part of the game... i guess... And what youyayu does with his hair to me is really his personal opinion... why you even let it disturb you I don't know really...
                      
              As for your mini Respect campaign in YNWA, I hope it takes off. I honestly do... you have my support on it but as I had an earlier agreement with your ex-mod, I will not post in YNWA and he likewise in EPL, so I will keep my end of that agreement for now as much as I wish to post there.
                      
              Lastly, all being said, I actually only wanted to point out to you that you did started a thread attacking United thats all as you were asking for proof... *present me proof that i started a thread and attack MU*  and really, not these other things... If you had just accepted that you did indeed started a thread after I have proved it to you, all the rest was irrelevant don't you agree?

              <p>Zocoss, I understand about your agreement with YNWA. They are a forum for LFC supporters after all. EPL forum is supposed to be universal. Pro-MUFC sentiments need to be checked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will not forget some people shooting down the AMU coalition a couple of years back. They got away with it @ Cars forum because of some one-sided modding, and tried to do the same at Sports forum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even so, RonalDog, Jose23 and clones may not have been Chelsea fans, but merely trolls or troll-baiters for all I know.</p>

              <p>Haha,did the Minnie Mouse Treble jokes happen again between 2005-2008?</p>
              <p>No.</p>
              <p>Why the self righteous "I am always right,I am always being victimized" guy bring this up again after 4 years?</p>
              <p>"Respect"</p>
              <p>I always fell off my chair laughing...</p>
              <p>Then,some self righteous self professed Pool fan(is he a Pool fan in the first place coz the Pool fans I know are wonderful people) started calling Ancelotti  "Auntie lortti" out of nowhere...</p>
              <p>People call Benitez names,cannot!</p>
              <p>The self righteous self professed Pool fan call Ancelotti names, can!</p>
              <p>People call Liverpool names,cannot!</p>
              <p>The self righteous self professed Pool fan call MU Manure,can of course!</p>
              <p>Respect?</p>
              <p>Don't make me laugh man! LOL!!!</p>
              <p>Well,some people just don't get it...their skulls are too thick for anything sensible to penetrate... *Sigh*</p>
              <p>I think Pool is really sad to have such self righteous fans...</p>

              Ah iveco... I am surprised anyone still remember it... Not many know or even remember that but I guess since you being one of the older member here maybe you might have came across it in parts, But contrary to what you may think, it wasn't with the forum, it was more like with an ex-mod of that forum. Cos I doubt even Poolman knows it...lol
              
              As for your views on one-sided moderating, you are entitle to your opinion and I will respect it like I respect the rest of the others here. But I like to say, I think you are somehow greatly mistaken with a challenge to one's opinion and view to a direction a forum takes... You cannot deny we do have a mixture of views and opinions almost on a daily basis... Although I am not aware what went on in Cars forum as I have never been there, but I am well aware what happen at Sports forum... Thats the reason why this forum was born in the first place... 
              
              I came in here just to discuss about football, and not to be a mod or own a forum or start a fight... Flaming, names calling and foul words all I am not interested... Though it may help boost a forum's ratings, It not the way I want to take... Only news and views are more relevant. But I always enjoy a good challenge in a proper discussion... And since you are an old member here, I guess you can recall during that time at Sports, lots of discussion were base on names calling, insulting and even known clones started threads that were totally unrelated to football but were kept open and allowed to continue to flame the masses right? You won't see this happening as I don't let them take root in here... I have personally removed quite a large number of threads started by a clone whose pastime seems to be attacking Liverpool and Poolman... Even our mods have repeatedly lock their threads if they happen to be online and perceived it to be flaming intent... But we always strive to keep a balance and don't want to be over-policing as at the end of the day, we still wish to remain a free and open forum for all... 
              
              Thats the reason I have a mixture of different clubs supporter as mods in here, and I have even encourage them to post anything that is newsworthy... regardless its positive or negative, even if its on United or any club... But most importantly, it should be reported or published and newsworthy then people might find it interesting to discuss... it doesn't matter which club the story is base on... Our 2 more active mods have done so and I have never once stopped them or discourage them or anyone else for that matter either... Of course, doing so over a period of time, sometimes offend different sets of club supporters... But thats was never my main concern when I started this forum... Just the news is relevant to me... everything else I can accept even what is said of me... You are welcome to openly criticize me like everyone else who feels that way... I don't mind it one bit and am not offended at all... All I want is a chance to reply to it thats all like everyone else deserve... This place is what it is, an open and free for all to share their views. No one is restricted or get their post edited for no reason... even clones are not disturb if their post isn't too excessive... 
              
              Like I said, perhaps you should reconsider and take a minute to think about it again... and justify the comment you made. We even have a known clone to me creating and posting a thread recently... It currently only on page 2 or maybe 3 by the time I post this as news move very fast in here... Like I said, if its not totally flaming intent and have good latest news relevance, nothing will be done to stop or prevent it... and others could also join in to discuss...  
              
              Pro-MUFC sentiments need to be checked? I don't agree... This forum isn't pro man united just because I happen to be a united fan... Some may like to think its that way as an easy excuse or reason to target me... and some form this mis-conception. But they fail to see the other parts of it... Yourself being an old member here, knows that this isn't the first general football forum in here... Before this, there were a few others but they fail... and why was it so? Cos its for the very reason you mentioned... The only Pro about this forum is... Pro-open and free... And I reserved any stronger comments i have for the Man United forum and not in here... In here, I may sometimes get into discussion only with my personal views... But I don't deny you your right to reply do I? 
              
              When I add a mod to this forum, I only lay the groundwork to them if its reported or published and they find it interesting, by all means... go ahead and put it up... I don't tell them what to post or not to post... I accept they could be supporters of different clubs and we may even have a difference of opinion at times... Like i even have a different of opinion or views with some United fans in certain topics at times, but I only see it as another discussion in a topic, like i am having one right now with you and nothing more... 
              
              My fellow mod here have put up threads stories that I may not agree and I just post my own personal views in a reply and when its over, we just continue and never take it personal... I only try to discourage anyone going all out to flame others or create trouble thats all... Our mods could even be troublemakers in other non-related to football topics and it don't bother me... I honestly see it as not my business... Only concern is in football forums... And I am glad to say that our mods, past and present have never gone around to created trouble... So Pro-MUFC sentiments need to be checked? There is nothing there... You need to reconsider and justify it... Only clones with flaming intent need to be check. But you are entitle to that opinion but if you can re-evaluate it honestly, and still feel that way about it after what I have said then I will just respect it even if I don't agree with it... Cos thats what a free and open forum is all about at the end of the day right...
