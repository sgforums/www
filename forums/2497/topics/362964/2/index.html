              <p>What take-over “expert” you are quoting? That John
              Armstrong-Holmes guy? Is he even qualify to be called an expert in
              this field?... He is only a chairman of a League 2 bottom side…
              League 2 is like… After Premier League, League Champions, League 1,
              then we have League 2… They were lucky they didn’t fall into the
              Conference League in the season just ended…</p>
              <p>Anyway, we can easily see he was speaking to promote his own
              club rather than as a financial expert… And what and how he said
              it… Its more like a figure of speech or just a metaphor of their
              debts… But not necessary that amount…</p>
              <p>“Manchester United are probably about a billion pounds in debt,
              something like that I hear, they have to spend about 50 million
              pounds plus a year just to service that debt.”</p>
              <p>“are probably” and “something like that I hear”... These are
              best pass off as his personal opinion… Hearsay… And definitely not
              in a capacity of an accountant or an auditor…</p>
              <p>Man United’s debt amount have been well published over the last
              2 years already… Even the rest of the other big four are well known
              too… You have over emphasize on the sum liao…</p>

              <p><br>as for you limpper , u were here just 2008 , u certainly missed out alot on what happened during 2003 when i created YNWA , and from 2001 when we won The Carling Cup .</p>
              <p>At the meantime , i emphasis once again , i dun create thread for fun , just to attack on MU , i did it base on " provocations " and i dare said tat , they started the Mickey Mouse first .... i empahsis , a gentle return of favour .</p>
              <p>If MU cannot accept being criticised of winning the Carling , stop quoting Mickey Mouse when we won .</p>
              <p>I want MU fans to understand , it's a slap on their face when they criticised is for winning the carling cup , , and yet MU won it on March 2009 .</p>
              <p>Just too bad if MU fans denied this crtiticism towards us , i fully expected that , they are never responsible for what they said .</p>
              <p> Note : Year 2005 was edited to 2001 .</p>

              Wah Poolman, I waited for you to reply but it didn't come even though I saw you post in another thread on that same evening... But I though this thread was over as it has gone to the 2nd page already and I was ready to forget it and didn't want to chase or demand a reply like what you were doing with nOrmalbOi... But since it was brought back and you choose to reply after a while, I will just add to what I was referring to earlier again...
                  
              Actually your reply doesn't justify at all what the thread served... You brought back something that happen so long ago, 8 years to be precise as an excuse to justify the thread? You know, its a never ending excuse if you actually used that as your reason for posting it... Cos with the same token, Some United fans can just easily turn around and say something that happened during the 80s... Isn't it rather silly? And since you mentioned it happened to you in 2001... I think most of the people here today were not the ones who you referred to already I am correct? 
                  
              Actually, the term 'mickey mouse cup' came from a Press... To me I think it started with Wenger playing his youth players in it follow by Fergie and the Press soon gave it that name for the perceived importance of it...
                  
              I can't speak for those that you encountered in 2001 as I wasn't in here then. But I have came across some United fans bragging about the treble and some Pool fans in return mentioned their own achievement in 2001 as their own treble equivalent to United's 2 yrs earlier... And some United fans disputed it as equal and hence in returned call it the "mickey mouse treble' instead... I believed it was more used as a term 'mickey mouse treble' than just the mickey mouse cup alone in the earlier years... due to the difference of it. This is just my take, but like I said, its really not important... 
                  
              Basically, what I am saying is... You asked nOrmalbOi to present proof and claim he is accusing you... The guy is nice enough not to be confrontational... What I am saying here is, has he accused you of something you never done before? If you accept that he didn't, it would be better that you just own up and accept it...   
                  
              And like i have said, as a Man united fan, I wasn't amused with that thread... It was needless especially from someone like yourself... If it had came from a clone, it really didn't matter. But you are not a clone. Though disappointed, but I still chose to ignore it then... I am only mentioning it now since you asked for proof... and nothing more...
                  
              *To accuse me, u have to present me proof that i started a thread and attack MU , don't anyhow accuse. Show me any thread , go do your homework. Then i show u my homework.*
