              <p>Fiorentina striker Adrian Mutu is counting on all players joining his <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> battle over the £14.7 million compo ruling.</p>
              <p>“The first two days I was devastated. Then, thanks to my teammates,
              the club and especially to the fans, I concentrated on football and
              channelling my rage through my football,” he told the <em>Corriere dello Sport</em>.</p>
              <p>“I feel a great sense of injustice. My lawyers are taking care of it
              and I have absolute faith in them. Our battle will continue, it is not
              over.</p>
              <p>“We want it to become a Players’ Association issue, as this case affects all of us.”</p>

              <p>Your anology is not quite right I think. By speeding, you know all the consequences but in Mutu case, he didn't know as he did not involve in the transfer negotiation. Well, most footballers take drugs anyway. Mutu was unlucky to be spotted by the media.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea had all the right to sack him but the point is that the transfer fee is irrelevant to Mutu's contract and thus he shouldn't have to pay it. That was between the two clubs (Parma &amp; Chelsea), not between Mutu and Chelsea. It was Chelsea's choice to terminate his contract instead of selling it on to recoup their investment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, a good club with good management people would have supported him instead of giving him the boot. Everybody deserve second chance.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, that is how a manager should be, support the player when they are down, not kicking them on the teeth when they are down.</p>
              <p>Damn, what am I doing here praising SAF? LOL but gotta give credit where its due...at least he is much better than Rafa (in term of man management). :D :D</p>

              <p>I would say it's different in Mutu's case, because I doubt Mutu is as comitted a player as Ferdinand despite taking into account the rumour of Ferdinand going Chelsea a few seasons back.</p>
              <p>Even if Chelsea had stuck by him, I personally doubt Mutu would have reciprocated.</p>
