              <p><em>England football star Frank Lampard has turned his back on a 
                      multi-million-pound move abroad... to stay with new love ­Christine 
                      Bleakley.</em></p>
              <p>Chelsea ace Lampard has been linked to a switch to 
                      Spain’s Real Madrid, but he has told friends his ­rel­ation­ship with 
                      the 31-year-old One Show star is too ­important to risk.</p>
              <p>Former 
                      ­Chelsea ­manager José ­Mourinho has always been a fan of Lampard and he
                       was expected to make a £30million bid for him if he takes over at Real 
                      this summer.</p>
              <p>But Lampard believes Christine’s TV career is going 
                      so well she won’t be prepared to follow him to Spain.</p>
              <p>A friend of Lampard’s said: “It’s no secret that Frank finds the 
              prospect of a reunion with Mourinho at one of the world’s great clubs 
              attractive.</p>
              <p>“But he absolutely adores Christine and he is not 
              prepared to do anything that would rock the boat.</p>
              <p>“Her TV career 
              is going brilliantly and Frank knows she wouldn’t leave the country 
              right now so he’s decided to stay at Chelsea.”</p>
              <p>Friends say ­that 
              Lampard, also 31, is ­besotted with the Northern Irish beauty.</p>
              <p>They
               have only been dating for seven months but Lampard believes he has a 
              real future with her.</p>
              <p>He finds it incredibly sexy that she is so 
              ­ambitious and regards her as a real "breath of fresh air” after Elen 
              Rives, the mother of his two ­children, who was said to be happy “just 
              to be a WAG”.</p>
              <p>A friend said: “Frank has been ­telling everyone he 
              adores Christine. He is the most loved-up anyone has ever seen him.</p>
              <p>“She
               is completely different to Elen and most of the other women he meets 
              because she’s not ­interested in being a WAG.</p>
              <p>“She is her own 
              person, with her own views and he really respects that. Other than his 
              kids she is ­definitely his No 1 priority.</p>
              <p>“Part of that appeal is
               her dedication to her career at the BBC which is really flying.</p>
              <p>“Frank
               is not about to put her in the position where she has to choose between
               him and her job. He thinks she’s got the full package – brains, beauty 
              and sex ­appeal.</p>
              <p>“That’s why he’s keen to keep her happy.”</p>
              <p>Lampard
               has scored 25 goals for Chelsea this ­season and if they beat Wigan at 
              home today he will collect his third Premier League championship medal.</p>
