              <p class="fb"> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Roman Abramovich is considering a shock move that would see Avram Grant return to Chelsea. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Russian fears he has made a mistake bringing in Rafa Benitez and sees the re-appointment of Grant as an adviser to the Spaniard as a possible solution. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Benitez has been interim manager for only three games but is yet to win, and fans are fiercely against him. </span></p>
              <p><span>After Saturday's 3-1 defeat at West Ham, Abramovich spoke to senior Chelsea lieutenants about approaching the man he sacked after the 2008 Champions League final. Grant has been out of work since leaving Partizan Belgrade at the end of last season. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The Israeli is understood to have a good relationship with Benitez, which has encouraged Abramovich to think the pair could work in tandem. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The Chelsea owner has met fans and also been warned by his close circle of advisers that the appointment of Benitez could be turning into a disaster. Abramovich was appalled by his team's performance in Benitez's first game, a goalless draw against Manchester City, and made one of his personal visits to the training ground last Tuesday. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>It is understood he was also at the training ground to visit Andriy Shevchenko, who was there to study for his coaching qualifications. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>But Abramovich was keen to carry out his own investigation before last Wednesday's game against Fulham, another goalless draw that left the Russian livid.</span></p>
              <p><span>Abramovich refuses to entertain anything other than a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League as he continues his seduction of Pep Guardiola, and will stop at nothing to achieve it. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>He is determined to jolt Chelsea back to winning ways and is not opposed to firing Benitez if he believes it is the only course of action to save the season. With Grant installed in a consultancy role, he will have a safe pair of hands ready to take over team affairs if it comes to this. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Fears are also circulating within the camp that players have not reacted well to last month's sacking of Roberto Di Matteo and that there are communication problems with Benitez. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The interim manager insists on two team-talks, speaking English to the English speakers and Spanish to others, which caused confusion in the dressing room at West Ham. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>It has also emerged that Abramovich invited seven Chelsea fans into his office at Stamford Bridge before the Manchester City game to discuss Benitez's appointment. The meeting lasted around an hour. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The supporters told Abramovich that they appreciated his backing for the club but would continue to protest against the Spaniard. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Anti-Benitez banners were on display at Upton Park and fans sang: 'Roman Abramovich, is this what you want?' after Chelsea went behind. Benitez has told Abramovich the squad needs boosting in January. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>He said: 'The players know that if I am here it is because they were not at the level everyone was expecting.' <br></span></p>

              <h3 class="padding-bottom-7">RAFA BENITEZ launched a furious attack on his Chelsea players, claiming they have no leaders, no confidence and no character.</h3>
              <p>The Blues boss turned on his side after Saturday’s 3-1 defeat at West Ham — and is now ready to rush back the injured John Terry and Frank Lampard.</p>
              <p>Benitez, who was again booed by Blues fans, said: “Normally when you lose, you are not happy — but I was angry. We did not manage their physical game, the long balls, the second balls, the corners.</p>
              <p>“We gave them too many options to play their game and we could not be comfortable in possession.</p>
              <p>“That is when you have to show character and quality — and we did <strong>NOT</strong> do that.</p>
              <p>“Character and leadership is always necessary in a team.</p>
              <p>“Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea team had a lot of character but it is a different time now.”</p>
              <p>The European champions face two vital games this week — against Danish minnows Nordsjaelland in the Champions League and then struggling Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
              <p>They must beat the Danes — and hope Juventus lose — to make the last 16 of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Both knee injury victim Terry and Lamps, who has a calf problem, could return to face the Black Cats, with Benitez admitting he is desperate for their leadership qualities.</p>
              <p>He said: “Terry will train part of the session on Monday so, hopefully, will be close, although with the knee you never know. Frank will train on Monday as well. Sunderland? We will see.</p>
              <p>“I will talk with them and then the doctor afterwards.</p>
              <p>“Normally I wouldn’t play them if it was not necessary but a lot of players can play with problems. It depends on the risk.</p>
              <p>“But character and leadership are necessary in a team.”</p>
              <p>Rafa admitted that confidence is low throughout the team. He said: “We have young players in their first year in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>“They have talent and quality but you still have to show that on the pitch.</p>
              <p>“If you cannot cope with the physical demands of the game, you cannot show your quality so we have to give them confidence.</p>
              <p>“I’ve not had too much time in training every day but we will try to adjust things.</p>
              <p>“They are experienced players, they’ve won the Champions League and a lot of trophies but they have to show that character.</p>
              <p>“And they need confidence to do that.</p>
              <p>“Some players might show character but if one or two are not at that level, the whole team suffers.</p>
              <p>“That is what happened in the second half at West Ham.”</p>
              <p>Benitez insisted he had not bitten off more than he could chew at Stamford Bridge. He said: “I knew it was a challenge. If we had beaten Fulham, when we had control, and West Ham, everything would be different and I am confident things will change.</p>
              <p>“I just came to do my job and I am sure that the team is good enough to win things. We have to win games and then everyone will be happier.”</p>
              <p>Juan Mata, who scored the opener at Upton Park, said: “In the last few weeks we’ve been dropping down and losing points and we need to change that. It’s important that we improve.”</p>
