              <p><strong>Cash-strapped Portsmouth are preparing to sell England striker Jermain Defoe to Aston Villa in a £16million deal that will spark a January transfer window spree.<br></strong><br>Villa owner Randy Lerner has been in contact with Pompey counterpart Alexandre Gaydamak to discuss a bid for Defoe, 26, who only switched from Tottenham during last January's transfer window.<br><br>Villa's move for Defoe, intended to assist Martin O'Neill in his push for a Champions League qualifying top-four finish, has blown Defoe's former club Spurs out of the race for the Londoner.</p>
              <p>He started his career with current Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp at West Ham. Redknapp, who left Portsmouth to join Spurs earlier this season, yesterday admitted he had failed to land Defoe.<br><br>He said: 'I think they've had a massive offer from somebody for him, so good luck to them - I paid about £8m to take him to Fratton Park. He's a good player but we're not going to pay over the top for anyone.'<br><br>Defoe, who averages a goal every two games for Portsmouth, has scored seven League goals for them this season, plus two in the UEFA Cup and one for England in the 5-1 demolition of Kazakhstan at Wembley in October, his sixth goal for his country.<br><br>Defoe made only a cameo appearance for Portsmouth yesterday after he was left on the bench until the 88th minute of their 1-0 defeat at Arsenal.<br><br>Villa, however, could still face competition from Manchester City for Defoe if Eastlands boss Mark Hughes fails to land Wales striker Craig Bellamy, having had an initial bid turned down by West Ham.</p>

              <h1>Aston Villa Boss O'Neill Denies Defoe Link</h1>
              <h2>Martin O'Neill has dismissed the speculation that links him with England hopeful Jermain Defoe.</h2>
              <p>In the past ten days there has been much newspaper talk concerning
              the upcoming transfer window, and a potentially outbound Jermain Defoe.</p>
              <p>With
              Harry Redknapp working his charm in north London for Tottenham Hotspur,
              there has been much gossip regarding a sensational Spurs return for
              their pacy former forward. <em>The Guardian</em> (16-12-2008); <em>Daily Star</em> (19-12-2008); and the <em>News of the World</em> (28-12-2008), have all dedicated column inches to this speculation.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Destinantion Unknown</strong></em></p>
              <p>The <em>News of the World</em> though seem to be in two minds over a Defoe transfer as they linked the
              England international with a move to Aston Villa on the same day,
              together with Manchester City being a potential suitor.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> today also ran a story about O'Neill making a bid.</p>
              <p>The
              Villa boss has a track record of buying British talent, and Defoe could
              suit the Midlanders' style of dynamic, exciting, and attack-minded
              football.</p>
              <p>O'Neill though has dismissed these reports.</p>
              <p>"We have not enquired about any player so this idea we have bid zillions
              for some particular player is simply untrue," he is quoted by<em> The Independent</em> as saying.</p>
              <p>"We are
              looking to improve the squad. The team has done phenomenally well but they
              have been on the go competitively since the middle of July.</p>
              <div class="float-left related-attachements-container"></div>
              <p></p>
              <p>"If you are trying to make progress in the Premiership, the FA Cup or the
              UEFA Cup then we have got to have a look at players. But this idea that we
              are going to put bids in left, right and centre is nonsense.</p>
              <p>"The transfer window is just around the corner and is an opportunity. It
              is the chance to look at your squad and see what you need."</p>

              <h1>Let me join Spurs not Villa, pleads Pompey's Defoe as Real look to Jenas</h1>
              <h1><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/29/article-0-02E7AE92000005DC-602_468x286.jpg" alt="Plea: Defoe has begged Adams to leave Fratton Park to return to White Hart Lane" width="468" height="286"><br><em>Plea: Defoe has begged Adams to leave Fratton Park to return to White Hart Lane to be reunited with mentor Redknapp (below right)</em></h1>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1102814" rel="1102814_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1102814/Let-join-Spurs-Villa-pleads-Pompeys-Defoe-Real-look-Jenas.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Jermain Defoe has told </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/portsmouth.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Portsmouth</strong></span></a><strong> manager Tony Adams that he wants to rejoin </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham</strong></span></a><strong>. Portsmouth have received verbal offers of between £12-16million from </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span></a><strong> and Spurs for the England striker and the cash-stricken south coast side favoured Villa’s deal.</strong></p>
              <p>However, Defoe spoke to Adams yesterday and expressed his determination to link up once again with mentor Harry Redknapp rather than head for Villa Park.</p>
              <p>Defoe joined Portsmouth from Spurs last January for £9m and some of the deal is still to be paid.</p>
              <p>That would make Villa's straight cash offer more appealing to Portsmouth, who are desperate to alleviate their debts despite selling Lassana Diarra to Real Madrid for £20m.</p>
              <p>Villa manager Martin O’Neill yesterday denied making an offer for Defoe, but Redknapp has made no secret of his desire to sign the 26-year-old.</p>
              <p>Redknapp was rebuffed in an attempt to sign Craig Bellamy from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-ham-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">West Ham</span></a>, with<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"> Manchester City</span></a> leading that chase, and he fears facing the relegation dogfight without another top-quality striker.</p>
              <p>Redknapp’s financial armoury could be strengthened should Real Madrid follow up<br>interest in Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas.</p>
              <p>Contact has been made between Real and a third party to promote their interest and it is understood Jenas would consider the move.</p>
              <p>Redknapp is reluctant to sell but knows he may need to sacrifice players to bankroll his rebuilding plans.</p>
              <p>Tottenham have fielded interest in Jenas before, notably from Everton, and valued<br>him at around £10m but chairman Daniel Levy would probably be looking for closer to £14m from Real if Redknapp gave any deal the go-ahead.</p>
