              <h2><img src="http://goal.com/images/24196_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="236"></h2>
              <h2>Portuguese sports daily O JOGO reports that Chelsea have completed the signing of FC Porto right-back José Bosingwa.</h2>
              <p>Avram Grant was desperate to bring in a new right-sided defender as he
              was reportedly unhappy with the current options available at Stamford
              Bridge for this position.</p>
              <p>O JOGO says the two clubs concurred on a €20 million deal yesterday,
              suggesting that the deal will be formally announced on Monday.</p>
              <p>Although Bosingwa had been widely tipped for a move to Manchester
              United, Chelsea were reportedly discreet in their attempt to lure the
              25-year-old into their ranks, and quickly gathered the fee Porto were
              requesting to begin negotiations.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese international is expected to face stiff competition for
              a place in the starting XI from compatriot Paulo Ferreira and Brazilian
              Belletti, although one of them will reportedly leave the club in the
              summer.</p>
              <p>Bosingwa joined Porto from Boavista in 2003 and has cemented his
              position as Jesualdo Ferreira's first choice in the right side of the
              defence since Ferreira departed for the London-based club.</p>

              <p>Looks like Roman is upset and going on a wild buy again after losing the title... Cos this Bosingwa don't cost $16.1m... A foreign defender normally won't cost so much... especially a full-back player somemore... Evra only cost $6m, Vidic $7m... and this guy if its true, almost 3x that price... No epl experience some more...</p>
              <p>Then again, maybe they feel United's scouts could be more reliable considering those they have bought to play in that problem right-back slot...</p>

              <p><br>Its not a matter of how much he has but how he is seen to be a carrot head... Last season onwards he somehow decided he didn't want the world to view him as a carrot head whenever they go for a player... For a while It seem to be working until now, a little panic buying i guess in wanting to beat United in something... The next time they go for another player again... That club onwer is going to think he can chop carrot head again...</p>
