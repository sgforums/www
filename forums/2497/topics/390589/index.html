              <h3>SHAMED John Terry will be sensationally named in a £137,000 fraud court case this week, the News of the World can reveal. </h3>
              <p>A former friend of the sacked England captain, businessman Faisal Madani, faces 17 charges of fraud and false representation relating to unpaid credit card debts of around £137,000 spent on foreign holidays. </p>
              <p>Twelve of the charges are believed to relate to Terry and an unpaid £37,000 bill for a week's stay at Dubai's plush Royal Mirage hotel enjoyed by him and his family over Christmas 2007. </p>
              <p>A source close to the inquiry said: "This case will shed light on Terry's greedy nature. The fraud probe uncovered a number of footballers earning massive wages who appeared to be taking advantage of freebies.</p>
              <p>"It's jaw-dropping. Not only did Terry's party have first class travel but the whole family had their holiday paid for. </p>
              <p>" It's bizarre to most people that someone would accept a holiday and give nothing in return.</p>
              <p>"The City of London Police were keen to find out why Terry agreed to the trip and he told them he 'was not going to turn down a freebie.' </p>
              <p>"It's just innate greed and it's come back to haunt him. The case is bound to attract a media circus."</p>
              <p>The bombshell comes as Terry, 29, is still reeling from the lurid revelations about his affair with England team-mate's ex Vanessa Perroncel and being stripped of the England skipper's armband. Dubai-born Madani, 46, a well-known fixer for a host of celebrities and top footballers, will appear at Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday. </p>
              <p>Last night he told us: "This has caused me a lot of stress and I've suffered three heart attacks over the last two years. </p>
              <p>"I'll be pleading not guilty to the charges but I'll be naming names. "John Terry is involved in the case because I arranged a holiday for him and there were problems with the credit card which was used. It had nothing to do with me." </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>Terry, is still reeling from the lurid revelations about his affair</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Speaking from his home in Colchester, Essex, Madani added: "I'm not a fraudster or a conman. I haven't made a penny from these deals, in fact I'm out of pocket.</strong> </p>
              <p>"John and I used to be friends but not any more. I was a guest at his wedding and actually arranged and paid for his £33,000 honeymoon."</p>
