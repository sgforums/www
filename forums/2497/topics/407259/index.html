              <h1>Liverpool and West Ham target Loic Remy jets in for Stoke talks<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Stoke City
               are in the box seat to land Loic Remy as the France striker heads to 
              the Britannia Stadium for talks over a £12.5million from Nice.</p>
              <p>West Ham and Liverpool
               have both made bids but the highly-rated 23-year-old will fly into the 
              Midlands today as the Potters look to flex their financial muscles.</p>
              <p>Having safeguarded their Barclays Premier League position over the past two
              seasons, chairman Peter Coates now wants manager Tony Pulis to take the club
              further forward and is willing to put forward whatever cash it takes to make
              it happen.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300522-0A6FC667000005DC-956_468x328.jpg" alt="Jetting in: Nice striker Loic Remy will fly into England for talks over a possible move to Stoke City" width="468" height="328">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Jetting in: Nice striker Loic Remy will fly into England for talks over a possible move to Stoke City</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Pulis is desperate to add some firepower to his squad and having seen
               a £9m bid rejected for West Ham forward Carlton Cole, the Potters boss 
              has pounced for the summer-long Hammers target instead.</p>
              <p>The east 
              London club had been hoping to discuss terms with Remy who has also 
              found an admirer in Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson, who could yet re-enter 
              the running.</p>
              <p>However it is reported that Nice turned down West 
              Ham's offer because they wanted the full fee up front rather than 
              installments and the French outfit did not favour an approach from 
              Anfield which included an exchange for players they did not want.</p>
              <p>Lyon,
               who sold the star to Nice in 2008, have first refusal on Remy and 
              Rennes are determined to make a move to keep the promising player in 
              France.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300522-0AA49317000005DC-214_468x286.jpg" alt="Cole fire: Stoke are also keen on West Ham star Carlton Cole" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Cole fire: Stoke are also keen on West Ham star Carlton Cole</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But the player, capped once by his country, has stated he favours a switch to England.</p>
              <p>'I am prepared to resume the season with Nice, even if I had hoped to be at a new club by now,' said Remy.</p>
              <p>'I have made my preference clear and I still favour England.'</p>
              <p>With
               Remy potentially becoming the club's record signing, Stoke may return 
              to West Ham with another bid for England international Cole.</p>
              <p>But Hammers co-chairman David Gold warned that they will not entertain any offers.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/05/article-1300522-0918AA7C000005DC-330_468x286.jpg" alt="In the frame: Tottenham striker Roman Pavlyuchenko is another striker on Stoke boss Tony Pulis' wish-list" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>In the frame: Tottenham striker Roman Pavlyuchenko is another striker on Stoke boss Tony Pulis' wish-list</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>He said: 'I'm fed up as a Hammers fan seeing us selling player after
              player down the years. We are known as a selling club but this must
              change.</p>
              <p>'We will now do everything to keep our best players.'</p>
              <p>West Ham 
              could offer Nice an improved offer for Remy but it is understood they 
              must raise funds first - and that could mean selling Cole.</p>
              <p>Stoke 
              have also enquired about Tottenham's Roman Pavlyuchenko and Sunderland's
               Kenwyne Jones but received little encouragement from either party.</p>

              <h2>STOKE`S REMY HOPES TAKE A KNOCK</h2>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT"> <blockquote>
              <p>Nice have hinted Loic Remy will not be joining Stoke as the chase for his signature intensifies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A number of Premier League clubs have been keeping tabs on Remy's
               situation this summer, with the striker making it clear that he would 
              be keen on a move to England.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Stoke stepped up their pursuit earlier in the week, inviting Remy
               to the club for talks and showing him around their training ground.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 23-year-old was impressed by what he saw and heard at Stoke 
              but admitted he would take his time before making a decision on his 
              future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And it now seems Stoke are out of the running, with Remy's 
              immediate focus on Nice's opening Ligue 1 game of the season against 
              Valenciennes on Saturday night.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speaking about the player, Nice general manager Patrick Governatori told <em>L'Equipe</em>: "It will not be sorted out with Stoke.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I hope he will score on Saturday night. If he can play a good 
              match, he could get the opportunity to be in the French starting XI 
              (against Norway on Wednesday)."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Reports in France suggest scouts from Tottenham, West Ham and Sunderland will be present to watch Remy in action for Nice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is understood that Remy would only be willing to part with Remy for a fee of 14million euros (£11.7m).</p>
