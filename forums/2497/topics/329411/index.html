              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Alan Curbishley has become the first managerial casualty of the new
              Premier League season, leaving West Ham after just four games of the
              campaign.</strong></p>
              <p>Despite beating Wigan and Blackburn in the league, and defeating
              Macclesfield to progress in the Carling Cup, tensions over the club’s
              transfer policy have seemingly led to the manager’s departure.</p>
              <p>Curbishley was reportedly angered by the decision to sell Anton
              Ferdinand and then saw George McCartney also join Sunderland on
              transfer deadline day, without a replacement arriving.</p>
              <p>The former Charlton boss was further targeted by Hammers fans
              recently and has now opted to step down from his job at Upton Park.</p>
              <p>A club statement read: "We can confirm that we have accepted Alan
              Curbishley's resignation as we feel it is in the best interests of both
              parties.</p>
              <p>"We wish Alan all the success in the future. A shortlist of
              candidates is being drawn up and an announcement will be made in due
              course about the new West Ham United manager."</p>
              <p>Curbishley was appointed to the role in December 2006 and memorably
              led the East London side to safety when relegation looked a distinct
              possibility in his first season.</p>
              <p>The Hammers finished tenth last term despite suffering from a
              debilitating run of injuries but concerns over the club's style of play
              meant supporters never warmed to him.</p>
              <p>Croatia manager and former Hammers favourite Slaven Bilic is now
              likely to feature prominently on bookies' shortlists to take over at
              Upton Park.</p>

              <h3>Bilic installed as favourite for vacant Hammers role</h3>
              <p><strong>Bookmakers William Hill have installed Slaven Bilic as favourite to land the vacant West Ham manager's role. </strong></p>
              <p>Alan Curbishley sensationally quit his role as Irons chief earlier today.</p>
              <p>And the talk around who will be his replacement is already doing the rounds.</p>
              <p>Croatia boss Bilic - who played for the club between 1996-7 and was
              a crowd favourite - is 3/1 to succeed Curbishley, although he has
              apparently ruled himself out of the job.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp, who managed the club between 1994
              and 2001, is second favourite at 6/1, followed by Sam Allardyce at 8/1
              and current England under-21 boss Stuart Pearce at 10/1.</p>
              <p>Hammers legend Paolo Di Canio is also an outsider at 14/1, while another legend, Sir Trevor Brooking, seems a far bet at 40/1.</p>
              <p>West Ham have confirmed that they will be drawing up a shortlist of candidates for the role.</p>

              <h1>Hammers confirm four-name shortlist</h1>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">West Ham have confirmed four names are in the
              frame to be their new boss - Slaven Bilic, Gianfranco Zola, Roberto
              Donadoni and Michael Laudrup.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Hammers director Mike Lee said that both Zola
              and Donadoni had impressed hugely in their interviews, while Laudrup
              will meet club officials on Monday.</p>
              <p>Lee also made it clear that West Ham would not wait until
              January for Bilic, though he did not rule out him staying as Croatia
              coach on a part-time basis for the October matches.</p>
              <p>Lee told BBC Radio Five Live: "There's no favourite at the moment, we have set up a proper selection process.</p>
              <p>"We have been surprised and pleased by the number of
              applications we have had and we are moving towards a short shortlist
              and ideally have a manager in place in time for the West Brom match
              next week.</p>
              <p>"Slaven Bilic could potentially be on that shortlist but it
              depends very much upon his availability. If for whatever reason he was
              not available until January in terms of working with us I'm afraid that
              will rule him out.</p>
              <p>"We have a very strong shortlist and it's going to be a tough decision with some exciting candidates.</p>
              <p>"From the meetings that have taken place so far the two that have really shone have been Donadoni and Zola."</p>
              <p>West Ham are resigned to waiting until after Croatia's match
              against England on Wednesday before they can speak to Bilic, but would
              welcome the chance to talk beforehand and have been in discussions with
              his representatives.</p>
              <p>The fact Zola and Donadoni are Italians could increase their
              chances given that West Ham's director of football Gianluca Nani is a
              compatriot, and that they would be much happier with the
              continental-style working relationship than Alan Curbishley was.</p>
              <p>West Ham's selection process has already ruled out Gerard
              Houllier and the former Scotland midfielder John Collins, plus former
              Ajax boss Martin Olsen.</p>

              welcomed the opportunity of speaking with such a prominent Premiership
              club and of course, the opportunity of coming to the English
