              <h3>WHEN Garry Cook courted Kaka, he became the laughing stock of world football.</h3>
              <p>But the sniggering has stopped. And now the Manchester City chief executive 
              has turned his attention to Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard, nobody 
              should take him lightly.</p>
              <p>The chase for fourth place in the Premier League won't be decided at Eastlands 
              today.</p>
              <p>The clash between City and Liverpool is more a symbol of a seismic shift 
              between a waning power beset by internal and financial problems and a club 
              that knows no limits.</p>
              <p>Even a defeat for Roberto Mancini's side does not alter that landscape.</p>
              <p>There are those at Anfield only too aware of the threat from City, not least 
              to Liverpool's two biggest stars.</p>
              <p>After the false dawn of Thakskin Shinawatra, the pledges of owner Sheikh 
              Mansour are proving to be no mirage.</p>
              <p>That sends out a compelling message to both Torres and Gerrard - that they may 
              have to re-evaluate their futures in the summer.</p>
              <p>It's not even a secret within the City corridors of power that the hierarchy 
              are plotting a £140million double swoop for both Torres and Gerrard this 
              summer.</p>
              <p>City officials are already planning how they can pull off what would be one of 
              the most audacious transfer coups of all time.</p>
              <p>Fourth place and Champions League football would inevitably help sugar the 
              pill of an Anfield parting but even without the lure of football at the 
              highest level, City believe they hold more than a few aces.</p>
              <p>If the injured Torres chooses to watch the game from the Eastlands stands, he 
              will be taken by the modern facilities and the potential to increase the 
              capacity to 65,000 - while visions of a new state-of-the-art Anfield remain 
              a pipedream.</p>
              <p>Then he will look at Emmabuel Adebayor, a striker not remotely in his class, 
              who picks up £140,000 a week, substantially more than the £95,000 a week 
              Torres earns from a four-year deal signed last summer.</p>
              <p>Torres might then just to do some calculations not entirely based on money. He 
              will wonder where Liverpool are heading.</p>
              <p>That's exactly the question one of Torres's advisors put to the Liverpool 
              hierarchy recently.</p>
              <p>As it stands, it is difficult for the club to offer any conclusive answers.</p>
              <p>As diligently as chief executive Christian Purslow has been working to 
              stabilise what has become a very rocky ship under the tiller of joint 
              American owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, the future remains uncertain.</p>
              <p>What is certain is that Liverpool's owners must come up with £100million by 
              the end of March to settle loans taken when the Americans bought the club.</p>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett could wipe out the problem at one stroke by agreeing the 
              £100m sale of Torres to City during the close season.</p>
              <p>Selling Gerrard as well would then give the club an enhanced transfer kitty.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-280"><img title="MANCINI: Would love to have duo" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00093/manicni_280x420_93311a.jpg" alt="MANCINI: Would love to have duo">
              <div class="caption"><em>MANCINI: Would love to have duo</em></div>
              <div class="caption"><br></div>
              </div>
              <p>Last summer, Liverpool rejected an £80m approach by City for their Spanish 
              striker but this time around the club simply may not be in a position to 
              refuse such an offer.</p>
              <p>City have moved up another level from the Kaka farce and whatever the wisdom 
              of replacing Mark Hughes with Roberto Mancini there is far greater 
              credibility to the club's aspirations of becoming not only a superpower in 
              England but Europe too.</p>
              <p>There is no doubt that should City beat off the challenges of Tottenham and 
              Aston Villa and eject Liverpool from their Big Four status, then Torres 
              could have his head turned.</p>
              <p>Even if Torres could be lured, Gerrard would be much more reluctant to follow 
              him down the M62.</p>
              <p>Part of Gerrard may still regret not moving to Chelsea five years ago. And 
              while his red-blooded Mersey roots prohibit even the thought of defecting to 
              Manchester United, the prospect of becoming part of City's adventure would 
              not be out of bounds.</p>
              <p>The plain fact is, unless things change at Liverpool - and change quickly - 
              Gerrard, 30 in May, might have to resign himself to never winning a Premier 
              League winner's medal, while at City the potential is now palpable.</p>
              <p>Those who counsel Gerrard may suggest that if he did opt to leave Liverpool it 
              would only be to play abroad, with Real Madrid a distinct possibility.</p>
              <p>Yet why not City?</p>
              <p>After all, if the blue half of Manchester roll back the red tide of United's 
              dominance then, in a way it will be a mission well received on Merseyside, 
              for a while at least.</p>
              <p>And how much more loyalty does Gerrard owe Liverpool?</p>
              <p>To cash in one or either may smack of heresy to the Kop faithful but if it 
              helps finance a complete rebuilding of a tired team, then it may be a 
              sacrifice worth making.</p>
              <p>Whatever the outcome of today's game and the race for fourth place, City would 
              seem on the brink of breaking through the glass ceiling and, in the process, 
              ensuring Liverpool's fall from greatness continues.</p>
              <p>Perversely, maybe the only way for Liverpool to alter that inevitability is to 
              take the money for their two great talismen before it is too late.</p>

              <p><br>Not at the same level though... To me, he is already not the same Gerrard of last 2 yrs... and he will only get worse as the season goes by.</p>
              <p>Chelsea made a mistake when they sign an almost 30 yrs old Shevchenko for $30.8m. I think Roman have learn his lesson and will not make the same mistake again. City are a new rich club and they will learn it the hard way if they pay that much for Gerrard... Anything more than $15m won't be value for money.</p>
              <p>Scholes and Giggs can still play at this level is because they are not playing every week... Sometimes play one match then rest 2, 3 matches kind... If you expect Gerrard to continue to do the business as usual week in week out, then you could be in for a disappointment. Not every player can re-invent their game... some manage but a lot don't... And Gerrard unlike Giggs and Scholes is on a high salary at Pool. Probably the highest if you take away Johnson at $139k per week. So Pool not being the richest, may find it not as profitable to keep him if they are only to play him once or twice in a month when he gets older... So better to cash in on him and use the funds for new and younger players... and at the same time, probably pay lower salary too.</p>

              <p>Well, eventually they have to leave... Either be sold for squad improvement or retire in time to come...</p>
              <p>It was a sad day when Cantona retired, but in time people got over him and a new hero emerged... The same will be the case for Gerrard with Liverpool... The club will move on...</p>

              <p>maybe the ordinariness of the players around him killed off his passion. he is thinking, how to win a game with these type of ordinary players, not fit to even wear the liverpool jersey. but the culprit is rafa, it is he who signed all these players.</p>

              <p>money is always enough at man city. man city dont look beyond 2 years in their signing horizon.</p>

              <p>for gerrard man city is a better bet than man utd. man utd could be on the decline as their debt will weigh on them on the coming season.</p>

              <p>but i would rather he move to real madrid. but at 30 years old, i am not sure whether they would still pounce on him.</p>

              dun think torres will ever play for real...imagine gary neville playing for liverpool? Possible but very unlikely.
              First, get rid of rafa...then sell gerrard and those mediocre players, especially lucas and ngog...buy villa to partner with torres, keep mascherano, reina and agger...the rest can go or put as substitute...
