              <p><strong>CHELSEA BID TO BE EUROPE'S SPECIAL ONE</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m3/may2008/3/5/EBE2250A-D3EC-8F4C-95179D1AEE826179.jpg" alt=""> </p>
              <p><em>Grant, becoming the "Special One" ?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Avram Grant has spent the last eight months trying to distance himself from Jose Mourinho. The Israeli knows that Mourinho's inability to see a potential fight without wading in before asking questions was a key element in the souring of his relationship with Roman Abramovich.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Where Mourinho revelled in confrontation - conjuring up dragons to slay and locking horns with UEFA, the FA, Arsene Wenger and even his own employers to fit his conspiracy theory agenda - Grant has looked to avoid public slanging matches. But in his heart and soul there have always been the doubts and fears, fuelled by friends within the game.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">They warned him to beware what happens when teams try to take on Sir Alex Ferguson's iron grip on English football. And last night, three days after a series of dodgy decisions at Wigan saw Grant's title dreams evaporate at the final hurdle on Sunday, the Israeli adopted the classic Mourinho stance.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">It was not the Vesuvial epic eruption we came to expect from the Special One. Yet the manner of the accusations that Steve Bennett bent over backwards to ensure Manchester United were crowned champions were straight out of the Portuguese manager's armoury.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But it's finished now."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Mourinho was forced to back down from his accusations against Anders Frisk and withdrew his claims that former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein was personally in charge of the fixtures schedule.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But Grant will stand by his claims. Soon after Chelsea beat Arsenal at Stamford Bridge in March, to go second and emerge as United's biggest challengers, Grant was told by a senior figure in the game to beware 'the powers that be' would do anything to ensure the title went to Old Trafford. It might have seemed like paranoia, and Grant risked Fergie's wrath the moment he opened his mouth.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">As Mirror Sport revealed on Tuesday, Grant believes he will get the OK from Abramovich to build his own side for next season. It means a man poised to make history for the club is having to face questions over his future, in just the way that Mourinho admitted "nobody has told me" when asked if he could be certain of his own position this time last year.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Grant added: "Sometimes the coach doesn't like the team, sometimes the team doesn't like the coach. I didn't say anything to the club, they didn't say anything to me. I don't think they need to."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">It was hauntingly reminiscent of the last days of Mourinho. Yet Grant has the chance to bring Abramovich what he craves most. And that would really get up Fergie's nose.</p>

              <p>i think avram has a long way to go to be even near mourinho's class in getting media soundbites.</p>
              <p>i actually wanted chelsea to pip man u. when mourinho was around, it is the other way round.</p>
              <p>so, avram is no where near mourinho's lethel mouth.</p>
