              <p><strong>Former Everton, Sheffield United and Wigan defender David Unsworth has announced </strong><strong>his retirement from football at the age of 35.</strong></p>
              <p>Unsworth was most recently playing for Huddersfield Town, making
              five appearances for the League One club, but has opted to call time on
              his 17-year career.</p>
              <p>The defender earned his first professional contract at Everton and
              went on to make 350 appearances for The Toffees in two spells, scoring
              40 goals.</p>
              <p>Unsworth will now look to complete his coaching badges and has
              hinted that he would welcome the chance to work at Goodison once again.</p>
              <p>“I’ve had a great time but it’s the right time now for me to concentrate on something else,” he told Everton’s official website.</p>
              <p>“I am doing my coaching badges and my intention is to move into that
              side of the game. I’m thoroughly enjoying the coaching side and am keen
              to really get started, which is the main reason for hanging my boots up.</p>
              <p>“I played for some great teams alongside some great players but my
              best times were at Everton. I absolutely love the club and the fans and
              I would love to return again one day.”</p>
              <p>Unsworth first left Everton for West Ham in the summer of 1997 and
              spent one season in East London, making 32 appearances for The Hammers.</p>
              <p>He famously then joined Aston Villa for £3 million before almost
              immediately requesting a return to Everton after his wife reportedly
              put pressure on him to leave the Birmingham area, departing the
              Midlands without playing a game.</p>
              <p>Spells at Portsmouth, Ipswich and Sheffield United followed before
              he joined Wigan in January 2007 and promptly scored the penalty that
              relegated The Blades from The Premier League, although Carlos Tevez, of
              course, also played his part.</p>
              <p>Unsworth won the 1995 FA Cup with Everton and made one solitary
              appearance for England in a friendly tie against Japan in the same year.</p>
