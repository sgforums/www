              <p>Former Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock is seriously
              considering whether to pursue a personal compensation claim against
              West Ham United over the Carlos Tevez affair.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/DJ/20060327/warnock_bc.jpg" border="0" alt="Neil Warnock" width="275" height="200">

              <p class="photoDesc">Neil Warnock: Still seething over the Tevez affair</p>
              <p class="photoDesc"> </p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The
              Blades and West Ham settled the long-running affair out of court on
              Monday with the Hammers agreeing to pay their rivals an undisclosed fee
              believed to be as high £25m following the Sheffield club's relegation
              in 2007.</p>
              <p>West Ham were fined £5.5m by the Premier League for
              failing to fully disclose the terms of the deal that brought Tevez and
              Argentinian compatriot Javier Mascherano to England.</p>
              <p>Sheffield
              United claim Tevez's goals kept the Hammers in the top flight at their
              expense, with Warnock resigning three days after their relegation.</p>
              <p>Warnock
              has long contended that he and Sheffield United's relegated players
              could sue West Ham for loss of earnings resulting from their relegation
              to the Championship.</p>
              <p>The 60-year-old, now manager of Crystal Palace, told the <em>Daily Mail</em>: ''I'll be looking into this now. I just wanted to see the club's case out of the way first.</p>
              <p>''As far as I'm concerned, I should still be a Premier League manager. And I think the players have a case, too.''</p>
              <p>Warnock is not alone in considering taking matter further with reports in <em>The Times</em> suggesting that as many as 20 past and present Sheffield United's
              players are considering their own legal action against the Hammers for
              loss of wages and bonuses.</p>
              <p>Referring to the settlement, Warnock
              continued: ''It justifies what we've said all along. We've had a lot of
              people criticise us for taking it this far - but that's what justice is
              all about. But this still doesn't make it right for me or the United
              fans - or anyone else involved.''</p>
              <p>Warnock reiterated his view
              that Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore should have
              resigned over the affair and believes a bigger club would have been
              treated differently.</p>
              <p>''I think Scudamore is an absolute
              disgrace,'' added Warnock. ''I'd love to get him in a room on my own
              for an hour, no holds barred. If it was any other club, Scudamore would
              have made sure the facts came out. I find it amazing that he has kept
              his job.</p>
              <p>''If it had been a big club, the truth would have come out earlier and it would have been sorted.''</p>
              <p>A joint investigation by the Premier League and Football Association into the Tevez and Mascherano signings is ongoing.</p>
