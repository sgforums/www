              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But while the Liverpool manager is itching to take his case to the game's rulers, he says he will speak to the club's American owners before making a formal complaint.</span></p>

              <p>Agree! Stoke away is always a tough game. The penalty was right IMO but the other decision weren't. The hand ball was super clear and 50-50 chance always gone to Stoke's way. True that Carra is too old now and should be replaced very soon, and I think KK knows this? Liverpool has 4 CB now in Agger, Coates, Skrtel, Carra and I think Kelly will be deployed in CB in the near future as well. Frustrated  as well with Carra's ball hoofing all the time!! Speed was not his main asset all along but at least he read the game well but nowadays he seems to be all over the place. The goal at Bolton was the result of his mistake.</p>
              <p>But overall, happy to see the player's determination and their hunger to win the game. Have never seen such hungry Liverpool side for quite sometime. 70% possession and 24 shots on goal but 0 goal.

              <p>Agree! Stoke away is always a tough game. The penalty was right IMO but the other decision weren't. The hand ball was super clear and 50-50 chance always gone to Stoke's way. True that Carra is too old now and should be replaced very soon, and I think KK knows this? Liverpool has 4 CB now in Agger, Coates, Skrtel, Carra and I think Kelly will be deployed in CB in the near future as well. Frustrated  as well with Carra's ball hoofing all the time!! Speed was not his main asset all along but at least he read the game well but nowadays he seems to be all over the place. The goal at Bolton was the result of his mistake.</p>

              <p>Yup, the hand ball was indeed clear, the player was sliding in therefore there is no way the defender could gone in with his arms behind his back unless he wants to break them...</p>
              <p>Why I agree it wasn't a penalty is because the ball struck him on the chest first before the momentum from his slide cause the ball to hit his upper arm... Normally this kind isn't a full prove case... Not giving may not be correct to some but giving could be wrong to many as well... If it was given, then most may say Pool was lucky or it was a harsh decision against Stoke... I think if the defender had raised his arm or the ball struck his palm or lower arm... Then there isn't any doubt there... But in this case, there was nowhere else legally for the defender to put his arms when he was sliding in for a quick challenge...</p>
              <p>And yeah speed was never Carragher's strength but he is getting slower than before now...</p>
              <p>To be fair, Pool only have themselves to blame as they had enough good chances to score more than one goal... Henderson's was the worst... He had lots of time and space. He could have even chip it over the keeper or go round him instead of hitting a weak shot straight at the keeper...</p>
              <p>Actually I recalled many times Pool fight with determination and hunger to win... A few in the later Rafa years where it paid off with last minute goals from Benayoun, Kuyt, Gerrard and even Torres... The last one I recall is against Bolton in Jan this year under Hodgson where an injury time goal gave them the win...</p>
              <p>On the 50/50 chances... I guess normally the home side gets the call more often than not as the fans makes a difference. Didn't someone said it evens out at the end of the season?</p>

But the time may have come to issue the post with a health warning; a recognition that taking over at Anfield could make you as deeply paranoid as Gérard Houllier, as obsessively contentious as Rafael Benítez, as visibly bewildered as Roy Hodgson and now, it seems, as shockingly enraged as </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Kenny Dalglish" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/kenny-dalglish"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Kenny Dalglish</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>The Scot has been the personification of joviality since returning to Liverpool in January, but it felt as if a turning point had been reached on Saturday. Four games into the new season, and in the aftermath of the club's first defeat of a campaign in which they are aiming to challenge for a Champions League place, Dalglish has decided to ditch the niceâ€‘guy act.</p>
              <p>His ire is with the standard of refereeing in the Premier League, believing Liverpool have been victims of "contentious decisions" in every one of their fixtures so far. This was only enhanced at the weekend when Mark Clattenburg, the official in charge, awarded Stoke the penalty from which Jonathan Walters scored the game's only goal and denied Liverpool one of their own late on when Matthew Upson, stationed inside the host's area, appeared to block Luis Suárez's cross with his arm.</p>
              <p>"We would like to be respectful to the referees but more importantly is them having respect for my club," said the Liverpool manager, "and if I feel we're suffering in any way, then I may need to go the same route as some others and see if I can gain some benefit from that."</p>
              <p>Dalglish declined to expand on his plans, insisting he would "speak to [the club's] owners first" before making any moves, the most obvious of which appears to be an official complaint to the Premier League. Liverpool did not confirm on Sunday if that was indeed his intention.</p>
              <p>For its part, it is understood the Football Association is unlikely to discipline Dalglish for his comments given he did not criticise or question the integrity of any referee in particular.</p>
              <p>That may come as a relief to the 60-year-old but for his admirers there may remain concern over his loss of temper, the sense, even, that for the second time in two decades the task of managing Liverpool is proving too great a responsibilty for the club's greatest player.</p>
              <p>Dalglish would dispute that and it could be deemed that his frustrations on Saturday had more to do with team's failure to win a third league game in succession, despite their dominance of proceedings. Liverpool had almost 73% of the possession, created 16 shots on goal – compared to Stoke's two – and, as Dalglish pointed out, were denied what did appear to be an obvious penalty. In fairness to Clattenburg, the one he awarded Stoke appeared a fair one given how it resulted from Jamie Carragher's hauling down of Walters as the forward ran in on goal.</p>
              <p>The visitors' wastefulness was, in reality, their true downfall and seen most starkly just after the hour when, between them, Jordan Henderson and Charlie Adam had five shots on goal saved by Stoke's defence in a matter of seconds.</p>
              <p>"We played well, it was just one of those days when we couldn't hit the net," said Stewart Downing. "Hopefully we'll be able to do that at Tottenham next week. We've just got to keep doing the same things."</p>
              <p>That last sentiment is one that would be shared by Stoke, who are now unbeaten in eight games and face a first ever group-stage match in the Europa League when they travel to Dynamo Kyiv on Thursday.</p>
              <p>"We've started well but are still 32 points from safety," said the Stoke manager, Tony Pulis. "Any side can beat you on any given day, so we've to keep our feet on the ground and take nothing for granted." Pulis's delight extended to the debut display of Peter Crouch following his £10m move from Tottenham on deadline day. The striker was quiet but showed plenty of eagerness.</p>
              <p>The same could be said of Craig Bellamy, who marked his return to Liverpool as a snarling, second-half substitute. As it transpired, he was not the only one from the visitors' camp who was in a petulant mood in the Potteries.</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Reds crashed to a soft penalty at the Britannia Stadium and after they were denied a spot-kick of their own later on, Dalglish did not hold back in the post-match press conference.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Scot held a meeting with Riley - general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Ltd -  at Liverpool's Melwood training ground on Wednesday to discuss a few concerns and was satisfied with the way the talks went.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He said: 'It was good to see Mike and we had an extremely informative and amicable discussion, which has given us all a better understanding of how things operate.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>At Stoke Dalglish took issue with the penalty awarded against Jamie Carragher for a foul on Jon Walters and the fact his side had two good handball shouts for spot-kicks turned down by Mark Clattenburg. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He was frustrated after seeing the Reds dominate the game but fail to take their chances, although he also praised the Potters for their resilience. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Reds boss admitted it was probably the best 1-0 defeat he had been involved in and first-team coach Steve Clarke said they had to draw on the good points from the game and now dwell on the result with an important match at Tottenham coming up on Sunday. </span></p>

              <p><br>I think Kenny made a mistake, maybe he tried to make a they all vs us kind of feeling in the dressing room and want his player to react like Mourinho's Chelsea but instead they all get angry easily and start to kick opponents when not happy...</p>
              <p>Later Suarez get too work-up bite people again... lol...</p>

              <p>I think ah Ken can't complain liao after this match... Suarez could have got sent off and Pool would have ended up with 8 men... And Modric look like he is ready to get back to be a Spurs player again... What a great goal... And his through ball pass to Walker was amazing...</p>
              <p>This match could have ended 6 to 7 for Spurs had Ade and Defoe put in their easy chances... earlier first half and early second half...</p>
