              Richards.</h2>
              <p class="article">The incident came near the end of yesterday’s session. Hughes called the 
              players together and questioned the defender’s attitude.</p>
              <p class="article">Richards shouted at Hughes and then stormed off to the changing rooms while 
              the rest of the squad stayed put.</p>
              <p class="article">Training ended a couple of minutes later but furious Sparky ordered Richards 
              into his office and gave him a stern dressing down for his behaviour.</p>
              <p class="article">The player then left the club’s Carrington base looking clearly unhappy.</p>

              <h1>Hughes plays down Richards 'row'</h1>
              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester City manager Mark Hughes has played down reports of a training ground bust-up with Micah Richards.</strong></p>
              <p>Newspaper reports claimed the 20-year-old had a row with his
              boss on Friday but Hughes, speaking after the 2-1 win at Everton,
              insisted it was minor.</p>
              <p>"People seem to be making a big thing of the little exchange we
              had," said Hughes. "These things happen time and time again at training
              grounds.</p>
              <p>"If it had been a serious incident he wouldn't have played on Saturday."</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Richards put in an impressive performance as goals from
              Robinho and Stephen Ireland earned City only their second away win of
              the season at Goodison Park.</p>
              <p>And Hughes was keen to stress that it was a case of much ado about nothing.</p>
              <p>"Our training ground is a little bit open and every day we have long-range lenses pointed in our direction," said the Welshman.</p>
              <p>"I didn't pay much attention to the incident at the time. It was
              something and nothing and it didn't affect Micah's performance, I
              thought he was excellent.</p>
              <p>"The fact that I played him today shows you the strength of it."</p>
