              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lawyers for owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett will argue chairman Martin Broughton did not have the power to accept a £300million bid from New England Sports Ventures. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">If they lose, they will claim Broughton acted wrongly in agreeing to sell the club to the company controlled by Boston Red Sox owner John W Henry. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">And in a new twist, tycoon Peter Lim claimed he is ready with £300m of his own if the judge rules in favour of Hicks and Gillett. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lim thought he was close to winning control last week before Broughton chose </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">New England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> as the preferred bidder after being brought to the table by </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> commercial director Ian Ayre. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sources claim he was told his was the better offer, only to receive a text last Tuesdy to say he had missed out, with no explanation. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lim is prepared to write off £200m of club debts and inject £40m in cash, something he can do without borrowing a penny. </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Cigar Guy: Henry may not be the saviour that the fans think</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1318958" rel="1318958|3| nofollow" href="/sport/article-1318958/DES-KELLY-Is-John-W-Henry-smoker-Liverpool.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was all looking so good. Tom Hicks and George Gillett were being hustled to the exit, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong> fans were changing their 'Yanks Out' banners to 'Yanks In' after some nifty needlework. There was talk of money, of revival, of new hope. Then we saw the cigar.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">John W Henry, the supposedly shy, understated American 'saviour' of Anfield was pictured with what appeared to be a mahogany chair leg poking out of his mouth. The caption claimed this was actually a stogie of some sort, not a dismembered item of furniture, but I still have my doubts that anyone can wave this much tobacco around in public without contravening some Customs law relating to personal use. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Having had their fill of yee-haw blowhards, Anfield had wanted a sober billionaire. But from this image it seemed they had landed another Cigar Guy; a smug, Wall Street share-trader armed with precisely the kind of 'financial expertise' they did not want. An oversized cigar is always a giveaway. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'A fire at one end and a fool at the other,' is how these smokes are defined. And although Henry is unlikely to be classified as a fool in the immediate future (give it a season), there has barely been a cigar smoker worth a spit since Sir Winston Churchill. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In fact, if I may generalise for a moment here since it saves time, I find cigar smokers are inconsiderate, puffed-up jerks that light their clumps of saliva-soaked weed entirely oblivious to the fact that the noxious cloud they produce smells as if they have set their pubic hair on fire. Cough. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyway, back to Mr Henry. Is this cheroot chomper really the character who is going to pander to those </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> fans that cry their club is 'not a business, but a way of life' at every protest march and street demonstration? I suspect not. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Right now Henry's main selling point is that he is most definitely not Hicks or Gillett, which is a recommendation in itself. But it is not enough. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">'s chairman Martin Broughton has certainly been happy to kick the tyres of his new American ride and say 'we'll take it', without elaborating greatly on whether he has poked around under the bonnet.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But because of his endorsement and some novelty value, Henry has received a fairly adoring press so far, which is hardly surprising since most of us had never heard of the bloke until this week. And so snippets from Wikipedia (see paragraphs 12, 16 and 18) were woven into some friendly spin pushed by 'insiders' at </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This was accompanied by some risible PR guff. We heard how the 61-year-old wooed his rather pretty wife, 30 years his junior, with a succession of yacht and helicopter trips and romantic European getaways. Really? I'd say he probably had her at, 'Hello - I'm worth £600million'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">These soft-focus portraits were designed to show Henry as a 'caring entrepreneur', a besotted Anfield suitor ready to lavish just as much love and cash on his new club. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Yet Henry's history shows something entirely different. He is one of the world's great sporting magpies. And he will be just as determined to cash in on his cunning plan as Hicks and Gillett were on the day they rolled into Merseyside wearing red and white scarves. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry is not buying </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> because of a deep-rooted love of football. He doesn't deal in sentiment. In fact his commodity trading business boasts of making 'mechanical decisions' that 'lock out human emotions'. That doesn't sound like a teary rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone, does it? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He swooped on </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> because the club is desperately weak, both on and off the pitch. A series of potential suitors from </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dubai</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">China</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> have decided to turn their backs, so Anfield has essentially been there for the taking by anyone with the money to gamble on making a fast buck. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dave Checketts, the owner of American MLS champions </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Real</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Salt</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Lake</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, had it right. He said: 'Most American owners see the Premier League as a chance to multiply their wealth. They understand the passion that exists for football here but see it strictly as an opportunity to invest in - and then exit from.' Quite. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry previously tried to buy the Orlando Magic, Miami Heat and the New Jersey Nets basketball teams. He had a stake in the New York Yankees baseball franchise, fronted the investment for the Colorado Rockies, then bought the Florida Marlins and dropped them to buy the Boston Red Sox. He also bought a NASCAR motor racing team, possibly to ensure he is always ready to make a quick getaway from these deals with the loot. So we can see where his loyalties lie - his wallet. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry is not buying </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> with the same motives as Roman Abramovich at </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> or Sheik Mansour at </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Manchester</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">City</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. These billionaires have used their clubs as hugely expensive vanity projects. For Henry and Co, it is just another commodity deal. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The question is will this enable </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to compete? Although his business is money, he is not a billionaire himself. He trails in behind the big hitters of the Premier League. To put his £600m into perspective, Henry has about half the wealth of Aston Villa's American owner Randy Lerner. In fact, there are a dozen billionaires in the Premier League with more financial clout. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But Henry will finance the Anfield deal through fellow investors at his company, New England Sports Ventures. Nobody is yet sure if they have the capability or even the collective will to be the generous Sugar Daddies some </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> supporters are hoping for. But right now the majority of fans would settle for honesty, stability and signs of a gradual improvement. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">For his part, Henry says he will cover the debts, has made no decision on building a new stadium and is pledging 'an unspecified amount' on transfers, which Broughton describes as 'sensible'. None of it would inspire much more than a weary sigh on Merseyside were it not for the fact that Hicks and Gillett were being kicked out, barring late legal shenanigans. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But the amounts involved and financial logic point to Henry arranging some kind of leveraged buy-out of the club, a situation that may eventually prove to be somewhat similar to the one Liverpool are in right now if there is another economic slump. New owners, different bank loans, same story a couple of years down the line. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Of course it could all work wonderfully. As everyone knows, this has to be a better situation than being run by two feuding bunglers plagued with debt. Henry is also clearly astute and understands American sport. But is he the owner who can put </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> back at the top of the English game? Right now, I'd say it might be a case of close, but no cigar. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">The </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> takeover struggle has taken another dramatic twist as Peter Lim raised his offer for the crisis club to £320million on the day the High Court showdown kicked off.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The club's major creditors Royal Bank of Scotland are taking on current owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett in court today, where they have been accused of 'breathtaking arrogance' over their attempts to change the structure of the board.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But the drama in the court is now threatened to be overshadowed by Lim's improved offer, which is bigger than that of prospective owner John W Henry. His company New England Sports Ventures had a £300m offer accepted last week against the wishes of Hicks and Gillett.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Singapore</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> businessman Lim's cash-only offer - made to </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> chairman Martin Broughton - is £320m, with a further £40m promised for player transfers. Lim claims his deal will remove the £200m debts taken on by the existing owners.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In a statement, Lim said: 'I respect and admire Liverpool Football Club, which is steeped in tradition and history. I am committed to rebuild the club so that it can soon regain its position at the pinnacle of English and European football, where it truly belongs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'This is why I have stepped forward with this offer. I believe that if its massive debt burden can be removed, the club would be able to focus on improving its performance on the pitch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'My offer pays off the existing owners’ bank acquisition debt and also frees the club of its own bank debt. If the board accepts this offer, the monies are available immediately thereby removing the threat of administration.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'The club needs to strengthen its existing squad. As part of this offer, I will be injecting £40m in cash into the club for Roy Hodgson to bring in new players during the upcoming transfer window. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> needs to start winning again!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'My offer provides a firm financial platform from which the club can rebuild. Given the manner in which the sale process has been handled, I feel Martin and the board owe it to me, to the club, and to the supporters, to consider my offer.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">'s major creditors - the Royal Bank of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> - are seeking High Court confirmation that Hicks and Gillett are in breach of contract and not in a position to block a sale.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The bank secured an injunction on Friday to prevent the Americans sacking independent chairman Broughton, managing director Christian Purslow and commercial director Iain Ayre..</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">They returned to court today attempting to remove the final stumbling block to a £300m takeover by New England Sports Ventures (NESV) which will see them recoup their original £237m loan to Hicks and Gillett when they bought the club in March 2007.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">When the case got underway just before </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">11.30am</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, RBS accused Hicks and Gillett of trying to change the running of the club to 'frustrate' its sale this Friday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Richard Snowden QC, representing RBS, told Mr Justice Floyd that the American owners now admitted 'a calculated breach of contract' by seeking to change the constitution of the companies and the boards involved without the consent of the bank.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He said this was in order 'to frustrate the sale necessary to repay the bank £200m by this Friday'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The bank secured an injunction on Friday to prevent the Americans sacking independent chairman Martin Broughton or any other board members.</span></p>

              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Mr Snowden said Mr Hicks filed evidence that if RBS did not like what he was doing, then it could enforce its security rights.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'This would derail the carefully planned process designed to achieve a sale of the club in a timely manner.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He said that plan would not carry the risk of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> losing the nine points deducted by the Premier League when a team goes into administration.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The judge was asked to impose injunctions on the owners requiring them to restore the original constitutions of the companies and managing directors.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This would remove the final stumbling block to a £300 million takeover by New England Sports Ventures (NESV), which will see the RBS recoup its original £237 million loan to Mr Hicks and Mr Gillett when they bought the club in March 2007.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mr Snowden said evidence filed to the court showed 'breathtaking arrogance on the part of Mr Hicks and Mr Gillett'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Both admitted their actions were a breach of contact, and Mr Hicks apparently took it upon himself to think RBS 'would not be prejudiced because it would not make the position any worse'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Paul Girolami QC, representing the American owners, said his clients 'were not trying to throw a spanner in the works' of the proposed sale deal.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>He said there had been other offers for the club which potentially were better than the one from NESV.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Opposing an immediate injunction, he said all the issues involved needed more time to determine and 'should not be rushed into'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'What has happened is that the English directors have gone forward with the NESV bid without properly considering alternatives when those alternatives at least appear to give better prospects.'</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">John W Henry swept into </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">London</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> last night to seal his £300million deal to buy </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> — only to be pitched into a £1billion legal battle with co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry joined the English members of the club’s board at a meeting in the City to hurry through the takeover. It came after the High Court ruled that Hicks and Gillett had breached the terms of their financing with the Royal Bank of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> by seeking to change the board last week. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But in a peculiar twist just before </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">10pm</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, Gillett and Hicks released a statement claiming a Texas State District Court ‘has granted a temporary restraining order’ preventing the board from selling the club to Henry, with a hearing set for October 25.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">They also revealed their intention to sue the three Liverpool board members, chairman Martin Broughton, chief executive Christian Purslow and commercial director Ian Ayre, the bank controlling the club’s debt and Henry’s company, New England Sports Ventures, for a total of $1.6billion (£1bn) in damages. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The duo called the attempt to sell the club to NESV an ‘epic swindle’ and a ‘grand conspiracy’ and claimed the offer was ‘hundreds of millions of dollars below true market value’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Late last night, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> put out a statement saying they feel the restraining order has no jurisdiction following their victory in the High Court.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">However, it will take time to resolve the issue. The club’s lawyers will now have to go back through the High Court and the district court in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Texas</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to prove that the order is invalid. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The restraining order was served at 8.25pm last night, five minutes before the board meeting was due to start, and was then followed by the Americans making a conference call to confirm their actions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The behaviour mirrored that of last Tuesday, when Hicks and Gillett attempted to disolve the </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> board minutes before a crucial board meeting to discuss NESV’s proposed takeover. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the meeting came to a close at around </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">midnight</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, a </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> spokesman confirmed it was likely to reconvene this morning. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Earlier, it was a huge surprise when Henry, owner of NESV and the Boston Red Sox, arrived to join the gathering shortly before </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">8pm</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">As the American walked into the offices of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">’s solicitors, Slaughter and May, he was asked how he was feeling and, giving a thumbs-up, said he was ‘very confident’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry had not been in London for the conclusion of yesterday morning’s court case, contributing only a brief Twitter message to congratulate Broughton, Purslow and Ayre on winning the case, along with the club’s creditors RBS.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The day of drama started with High Court judge Mr Justice Floyd granting RBS an injunction to prevent Hicks and Gillett from throwing Broughton, Purslow and Ayre off the board. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The American co-owners had been expected to contribute via a conference call as the three English directors attempted to rubber-stamp an agreement reached with Henry’s NESV Group last week. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Asian businessman Peter Lim’s offer of £360m for the club now appears to be doomed.</span></p>

              <p><br><br><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>A statement from Tom Hicks’ advisors confirmed the injunction after it was revealed that John W. Henry was present at a Liverpool board meeting in London.<br></strong><br>“The owners of Liverpool Football Club today reported that a Texas State District Court has granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the Board of Liverpool Football Club (LFC) from executing a sale of the Club to New England Sports Ventures (NESV). The court set a hearing date of October 25, 2010.”<br><br>The statement also addressed the damages that Hicks and Gillett were seeking, whilst also accusing the defendants of the suit of attempting to ‘swindle’ them by drastically undervaluing the club.<br><br>“The lawsuit also seeks temporary and permanent injunctions, and damages totaling approximately $1.6 billion [over £1 billion]. <br><br>"The suit lays out the defendants' "epic swindle" in which they conspired to devise and execute a scheme to sell LFC to NESV at a price they know to be hundreds of millions of dollars below true market value…”<br><br>The statement also confirmed that Hicks and Gillett had received two other offers for the club, both of which are higher than that on offer from NESV, and one of which offered to provide funds for a new stadium.<br><br>"On or about October 4, 2010, Mr. Hicks received a letter of interest from a third potential purchaser… offering to purchase Liverpool FC for £375 to £400 million.<br><br>"The letter informed Mr. Hicks that the potential purchaser would not need financing, possessed the funds to close the transaction, and intended to build a new stadium for Liverpool FC." <br><br>"Additionally, the Plaintiffs learned just days ago about another potential investor that made a similar offer in the £350 to £400 million range that was communicated to Defendant Broughton and another unnamed co-conspirator in late August. <br><br>"According to this investor, Mr. Broughton never responded to the offer. Moreover, when the purported sale to NESV was announced, this investor again contacted Mr. Broughton and informed him that the offer, which significantly exceeded the NESV offer, was still on the table. Again, Mr. Broughton brushed this offer aside without further discussion."<br></p>

              amazing Judge Jim Jordan, whose breathtaking arrogance in approving an 
              injunction from a little known district court in Texas has thrown a 
              small bit of uncertainty to an otherwise done deal with NESV.<br> <br> In 2008 the good judge received beaucoup funding for his failed campaign
               to win a seat on the Texas Supreme Court (yes, in Texas SC justices are
               VOTED into office). One organization caught my eye - K&amp;L Gates LLP.
               Why? Because they provided Mr. Jordan with $10K in campaign 
              contributions. One of the head partners for K&amp;L Gates LLP is one 
              Vester Hughes. Mr. Hughes shares multiple board seatings at various 
              organizations with one Tom Hicks.<br> <br> Examples are:<br> <br> Dallas Civic Leaders Council<br> Cooper Institute<br> Dallas Museum of Art<br> <br> I'm sure there are more, but this is what I found over the past several minutes.<br> <br> To my mind, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that a couple of 
              favors are being called in to push this case in Judge Jordan's 
              direction, perhaps by way of Mr. Hughes on behalf of Mr</p>

              <p>To say the US judge is "dirty" is too far cos looking at the papers filed, there are very good valid points that deserve some merits of how this whole case was handled by the RBS, the 3 stooges and to a certain degree Henry...</p>
              <p>How the deal was concluded is also suspicious... Like how did Henry came to know Peter Lim's bid amount within a few hours after making a lower bid then increased his to match Lim's? And if the priced isn't important as is the 3 stooges defense now, then why did they need to inform Henry in the first place to match Lim's?  Had Peter Lim stayed quiet and accepted he lose the bid, then no one will know this matter right?</p>
              <p>Of course now we know Henry increased his bid and the board accepted it immediately without further consideration like if Lim of anyone else out there would increased their offer?</p>
              <p>Certainly there are a lot of disparity here... The 3 stooges did their all to block G&amp;H the real owners any chance of getting refinanced and in the process forced them to default on their repayment to RBS...</p>
              <p>And also the 3 stooges enriching themselves when this deal is concluded and approved giving themselves fat year end bonuses...</p>
              <p>For G&amp;H 28 pages restraining order, you can read it up here...</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool's board and RBS will move swiftly this morning to overturn a restraining order in a Texas court preventing them from selling the club.</strong></p>
              <p>The Mirror understands measures have already been taken by legal representatives of the parties involved in the sale, to overturn attempts by owner Tom Hicks to retain control of the club.</p>
              <p>And we have learnt that New England Sports Venture (NESV), who have a binding agreement to buy Liverpool for £300million, will not walk away from the deal, despite these desperate efforts to stop the sale by the Texan businessman.</p>
              <p>They have confirmed this morning they are prepared to wait as long as it takes to become the next owner of the Premier League football club, after the board agreed the sale in a meeting in London last nigh.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>Hicks and his partner George Gillett obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) in the Texas State District Court, preventing a sale until a full case – in which they allege a major fraud by RBS – can be heard on October 25.</p>
              <p>Hicks is claiming damages of  $1.6billion in his lawsuit, but Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton insisted this morning that the claims are scurrilous, and the club would act quickly to remove them.</p>
              <p>In a message to Liverpool fans, Broughton said: “They are trying every trick in the book, but keep the faith, we are trying to overturn this and we always remain confident.”</p>
              <p>The Mirror understands Liverpool have already appointed lawyers in Dallas this morning to file a counter claim in the Dallas court as soon as business begins there, moving to have the restraining order removed.</p>
              <p>Their case will revolve around jurisdiction. Legal experts are lining up to suggest that the case Hicks filed yesterday is flimsy, and the question of the jurisdiction of the Texas court over proceedings that have already been considered by the High Court in London is key to dismissing it.</p>
              <p>They will make a strong legal argument that the case should not be heard in Texas or anywhere else in the US.</p>
              <p>They will also present evidence that Hicks and Gillett have offered written undertakings in contracts signed with the RBS that ensures the ‘legal forum’ of any dispute will be held in the English courts. That effectively means they can not sue in the US.</p>
              <p>The judge who granted the TRO has already expressed his unease with jurisdiction over the case, and after reviewing documents, he made clear that the claims made by Hicks were not backed by any substantial evidence.</p>
              <p>This suggests Judge Jim Jordan, who will be the first to consider Liverpool’s move to strike the TRO, could well reverse his decision as soon as the case is heard. If not, then it will be moved to a higher United States State Court, which would be expected to respect the decision of the High Court.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Broughton and RBS won a ruling in the High Court allowing them to proceed with the sale, and Hicks was warned that it would be “inappropriate” to appeal.</p>
              <p>If, as seems likely, the TRO is lifted this afternoon when the Texas District Court sits, then Broughton will act quickly to see the sale through to New England Sports Ventures, the owners of the Boston Red Sox.</p>
              <p>The main shareholder of NESV, John W Henry, has confirmed this morning that he will not walk away from the deal, despite these desperate delaying tactics from Hicks.</p>
              <p>He is ready to wait for the TRO to be lifted, even if the process takes longer than expected, and the RBS have indicated they too are ready to wait, to ensure that the £300million sale goes through.</p>
              <p>Sources close to the club suggest that the sale should still be completed by this evening, but even if there are yet more delays by the increasingly desperate Hicks, the sale will go through.</p>
              <p>There is a fear though, that the Texan has something else up his sleeve. He has been in talks with Dwight Schar, the owner of Mill Financial who now have a stake in Liverpool after Gillett had defaulted on loans to them.</p>
              <p>The worry is that Hicks will borrow money from Mill Financial to repay the more than £200million loans to RBS that are due to be repaid on Friday. If the bank recalls those loans then Hicks, with help from Schar – the co-owner of Washington Redskins - can repay them and reclaim jurisdiction over the club.</p>
              <p>The Mirror understands though, that RBS will wait before calling in the loans, to give time for the TRO to be lifted in the Texan court, allowing the sale to NESV to be ushered through.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Just when John W Henry appeared to be finally on the brink of wresting control of </strong><span style="color: windowtext; "><strong>Liverpool </strong></span><strong>- Tom Hicks is reportedly trying to scupper the deal by offloading his shares to a </strong></span><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">US</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> hedge fund.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The High Court yesterday cleared Boston Red Sox owner Henry to proceed with his £300million takeover by telling Anfield owners Hicks and George Gillett to halt their own legal stalling tactics in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Texas</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">A deadline of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">4pm</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> today had been set for the proceedings in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dallas</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to be quashed before the American duo would be held in contempt of court.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hicks and Gillett have this morning lifted the restraining order they secured across the pond, meaning a planned new hearing there at </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">1pm</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> is unlikely to go ahead.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But the move does not automatically mean that </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">'s sale to Henry's New England Sports Ventures goes through.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In removing the restraining order, Hicks could now do a deal for his 50 per cent share of the club to go to Mill Finance, who already control Gillett's holding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In such a scenario, Mill would then pay off the £200m debt to the Royal Bank </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, appearing to scupper the deal with NESV. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry has blasted his adversaries as 'desperate'. NESV believe any such attempt by Hicks would have to be ratified by the </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> board and they would be prepared to return to the High Court to have their binding agreement upheld, though it is not clear cut.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Henry said on his Twitter account this morning: 'We have a binding contract. Will fight Mill Hicks Gillett attempt to keep club today. Their last desperate attempt to entrench their regime.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Time is running out for Hicks with a restraining order on the NESV takeover only in place until lunchtime today.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Today is also the nominal date for RBS to be repaid a sum of £240m in loans plus a further £40m in fees. After today RBS could, if they wanted, put Kop Holdings into administration leaving </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in danger of a nine-point penalty.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">NESV believe they have the law on their side - their lawyers won a second successive significant victory yesterday when Mr Justice Floyd granted anti-suit injunctions to nullify decisions taken in the court in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dallas</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> late on Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The judge said his mandatory orders were not aimed at the </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Texas</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> court but Hicks and Gillett to stop them taking further action there.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">'s independent chairman Martin Broughton, who brokered the NESV deal, was positive as he left the offices of their legal team Slaughter and May last night.</span></p>

              </div>
              </h2>
              <h2>Hicks and Gillet obey the High Court</h2>
              <p>Thursday's ruling instructed Tom Hicks and George Gillett to withdraw the injunction they were granted in a Texas court on Wednesday which threatened RBS, NES V and the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool </span></a>board with a £1bn court case if they bought the club.</p>
              <p>If Hicks and Gillett play ball, Liverpool will be sold to NES V. If they ignore the ruling, the High Court can do nothing as they are not in the UK. The deal would be in a stalemate situation as John W Henry could only proceed under the threat of being sued.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Frustration, administration, relegation?</h2>
              <p>The deadline for the debt to be repaid to RBS is Friday at 4pm. If Henry or Mill fail to make a deal, RBS can do one of two things:</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1)</span> Most likely extend the deadline until Henry or Mill decide if they are willing to risk buying the club.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2)</span> Put the club into administration and Liverpool will be docked nine points. The club will then be sold to the highest bidder but the price could tumble due to the genuine threat of relegation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Mill Financial buy the debt and the saga drags on</h2>
              <p>Mill are the hedge fund that took over Gillett’s shares when he failed to pay his debts to them. They made contact with RBS on Thursday about the possibility of buying the debt off the bank, implying two things:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/14/article-1320633-0B9E1806000005DC-561_306x450.jpg" alt="No way back: One thing is for sure, Hicks and Gillett can't return to Anfield" width="306" height="450"></p>
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">No way back: One thing is for sure, Hicks and Gillett can't return to Anfield</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1)</span> That they have — or are in the process of buying — Hicks’ shares too, therefore becoming owners of the club.</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2)</span> That they therefore hope to become owner and banker. That way, Liverpool’s debts would be to Mill Financial, not RBS and Friday's deadline to pay the money back and the threat of administration that comes with it could be erased.</p>
              <p>Mill could extend the deadline to whenever they want. The reason they have done this is because they can sniff a profit.</p>
              <p>They value the club at more than they will have to pay for it and now have as much time as they want to find a buyer who will pay them a higher price than the £300m on the table from NES V.</p>
              <p>The chances are that Hicks and Gillett — as well as receiving money from Mill for selling their shares — will receive a percentage of any deal that is done when Mill sell.</p>
              <p>From there, Henry and NES V could put in a higher offer, Singapore businessman Peter Lim will likely re-enter the bidding and Chinese tycoon Kenny Huang could also revive his interest.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But Hicks has warned he will continue in a £1billion claim against the club's board, the potential new owners and the Royal Bank of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is now no legal obstacle to Henry's New England Sports Ventures completing their £300million takeover today and ridding the Merseysiders of the regime despised by supporters.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is also claimed they tried in an 11th-hour bid to pay off debts to the Royal Bank of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and remain in charge, but that the bank rejected the offer.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">NESV were confident of their binding agreement to buy </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> after the board ratified the deal against Hicks and Gillett's wishes earlier this week.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The buyers had made it clear they would go straight back to the High Court if a deal with Mill Financial was attempted.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'Mill Financial would just be pawns of Tom Hicks and we believe this is all about Tom Hicks maintaining his control over </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">,' said an NESV source.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It has emerged that the Premier League rejected an attempt by Mill Financial to submit to their owners' and directors' test.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Premier League told the hedge fund on Thursday night that they could only take instruction from the board of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This morning, Henry blasted his adversaries as 'desperate', writing on Twitter: 'We have a binding contract. Will fight Mill Hicks Gillett attempt to keep club today. Their last desperate attempt to entrench their regime.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Today is also the nominal date for RBS to be repaid a sum of £240m in loans plus a further £40m in fees. After today RBS could, if they wanted, put Kop Holdings into administration leaving </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Liverpool</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in danger of a nine-point penalty.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">NESV always believed they have the law on their side - their lawyers won a second successive significant victory yesterday when Mr Justice Floyd granted anti-suit injunctions to nullify decisions taken in the court in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dallas</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> late on Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The judge said his mandatory orders were not aimed at the </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Texas</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> court but Hicks and Gillett to stop them taking further action there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He was scathing in his remarks about the American co-owners' conduct, which he described as 'unconscionable'.</span></p>

              <p><br>There is no point cos according to new reports, Mill Financial (Who is said to own the 50% of Gillett's half) tried to pay off Hicks debts but the Royal Bank of <span style="font-family: Arial;">Scotland</span> <span style="font-family: Arial;">rejected the offer as their intention seems to be wanting to take over the club only...</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Whatever happens, I think Hicks or any one related to him can't get a fair trial in England now cos the Press are all against him and whatever he does it seems is bad even if he is only defending what is his in the first place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">I guess in the words by their lawyer, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This attempt to sell the club to NESV an ‘epic swindle’ and a ‘grand conspiracy’.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It now seems Liverpool are down the long road of lawsuits that could trouble them for years to come unless something change...</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Just a thought, G&amp;H should really consider the European court of justice cos they can't get a fair trial with the bad press and the years of built-up discontent in England. And also the other parts of Europe seems to dislike the English... lol.</span></span></p>
