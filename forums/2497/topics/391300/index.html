              <h1>Pompey given green light to sell players now</h1>
              <p class="mn_header_details"><span><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o10/zocosss/Portsmouth.gif" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Crisis-club Portsmouth are have been cleared to sell their players right away - and moved closer to doing a deal with the Premier League to pay their tax bill.</strong></p>
              <p>But the bad news for Pompey is that the Premier plan to play 'hard ball' over an advance of a £11million parachute payment and will ask them to accept a nine-point penalty that will seal their relegation fate.</p>
              <p>In the latest traumatic and historic twists, the hard-up outfit learnt that they will be able to trade their men outside the transfer window due to a little-known 'club in crisis' rule.</p>
              <p>Mirror Sport revealed the extraordinary plan yesterday and now the desperate attempt to sell, sell, sell has started - with clubs being contacted to sound out interest.</p>
              <p>No Premier League team has ever exercised this hardship clause before and Pompey now have a matter of days to find buyers for their players to avoid a winding-up order on March 1.</p>
              <p>Nadir Belhadj, Kevin Prince Boateng and Mark Wilson are among those who could find buyers, although insiders revealed last night that there is 'not much interest' because so many clubs are tightening their belts.</p>
              <p>A further complication in the sales is that FIFA will have to rule whether those who are moved out can play for their new clubs immediately - or have to wait until next season.</p>
              <p>The Premier League are seeking a ruling from FIFA on this, with Pompey causing them untold headaches because of their financial disasters.</p>
              <p>Top sources reveal there is 'antagonism in high places' towards Portsmouth at the Premier League, but they do not want the club to go bust to cause greater grief.</p>
              <p>The plan to advance their parachute money - given to clubs who are relegated - was first revealed by Mirror Sport last week and now may be the other way of raising funds.</p>
              <p>However, the Premier League would want a guarantee that this money actually gets Pompey through the season and does not disappear into a financial black hole.</p>
              <p>And there would be a price to pay as Pompey would have to take a points penalty as part of the trade that would guarantee Avram Grant's men go down.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth have immediate bills to pay - with HMRC asking for their cash in full and wages to be paid for the rest of the season. So the parachute payment and the player sales may not even be enough to cover those costs.</p>
              <p>But as no outside investment looks likely - despite chief executive Peter Storries's claims of 'three or four interested parties' - player sales and the PL advance are the only possible ways of raising revenue in the next dramatic few days.</p>
              <p>Storrie said: "Of course we don't want to sell any more players, but we have no choice. Avram Grant still believes he can keep us up, so he doesn't want to sell any more players.</p>
              <p>"But if it's a question of survival or selling, there clearly is no choice. We have some immediate cash flow issues to resolve."</p>

              <h3>Bottom club told they won't be allow to offload any of their squad</h3>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="ss-text-bold">The Premier League have rejected Portsmouth's appeal to be allowed to sell players outside of the transfer window.</p>
              <p>Pompey had hoped to be able to offload some of their
                  squad to help ease their financial problems, with the club reportedly
                  £60million in debt.</p>
              <p>They are due to return to court on March 1 to
                  face a winding-up petition from Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs in
                  the High Court.</p>
              <p>Porstmouth had made the unique request to the
                  Premier League and Fifa had already suggested they would look
                  favourably on the idea.</p>
              <p>However, the Premier League board have
                  now confirmed they will not give the go-ahead to let them sell players
                  following the closure of the January window.</p>
              <p>A Premier League
                  statement read: "The Premier League board can confirm they have been
                  actively considering a request from Portsmouth to transfer players
                  outside of the Transfer Window.</p>
              <p>"We are grateful for positive
                  assistance from Fifa and the FA but, having given the matter further
                  consideration and taking into account all factors, the Premier League
                  board have decided that this would not be an appropriate course of
                  action at this time."</p>
              <p>Portsmouth currently sit bottom of The
                  Premier League, seven points adrift of nearest rivals Burnley. They
                  face Stoke City on Saturday at <span class=" lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Fratton Park.</span></p>
