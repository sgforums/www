            <div class='col-md body'>i back G14 on this.<br><br>when you see results like 8-0 and 7-0 happening within 1 week of each other in a competition like this, something is very wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think it's good for clubs from weaker nations to go into the group stages.<br><br>although 7-0, 8-0 results seems to happen recently, i believe it is still very rare to see that kind of results in the future..<br><br>and if u dun give those smaller clubs a chance, of course they're gonna stay weak...and dun forget besiktas did turn liverpool at home, it's not like they're the whipping boys, and rosenborg managed to do a double over valencia....<br><br>also look at clubs like shaktar donetsk, cska, rangers, fenerbahce, porto, these clubs had champions league experience over the years and they're certainly not embarrasing themselves at the big stage. so this is what experience can do for   you and you need to give those smaller clubs a chance.</div>
