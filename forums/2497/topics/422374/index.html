              <p><strong>Both parties are seeking a series of injunctions stemming from the bitter court-room battle last October that ended with the club being sold against Hicks’s wishes in what he dubbed “an epic swindle”. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>That process saw legal action filed in Texas as well as London, and the High Court will be asked to deal with unfinished business started in that frantic week of litigation.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>If Hicks is successful in court it could clear the way for a series of damages claims against the bank and the former club directors.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>RBS is understood to be seeking to permanently block Hicks and his former partner George Gillett from suing for damages following the £300m sale of Liverpool.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Justice Christopher Floyd issued an injunction ordering Hicks to drop the Texas action and RBS will seek to have that made permanent. The Americans meanwhile will apply to have the injunction varied or removed so they are free to pursue the bank for damages.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <div class="body">
              <p>The pair lost around £140m on the deal, and Hicks’s US lawyers have said they intend to seek hundreds of millions of pounds in damages by way of redress.</p>
              <p>Former Club chairman Martin Broughton is also seeking protection from any damages claim from Hicks. He will ask the court to grant “negative declaratory order” which effectively means he has no liability on any claim from the Americans.</p>
              <p>NESV is also seeking to be joined to the Broughton action so that it too is immune from future legal action in the US. Both will ask the judge to order that any action that is brought by the Americans will have to be heard in the UK courts rather than in Texas.</p>
              <p>The hearing is listed to last three days.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Christian Purslow, Liverpool’s former managing director, claimed selling the club to New England Sports Ventures was a 'bottom of the barrel' deal.</strong></p>
              <p>Purslow sent an email to members of the Liverpool board a month before NESV bought out Tom Hicks and George Gillett saying he did not believe NESV had the money for a new stadium and the only positive about their offer was that it 'existed'.</p>
              <p>The details of the email, which was sent on September 15 last year, were disclosed in the High Court by Hicks and Gillett’s legal team, as they attempt to have an anti-suit injunction - stopping them from suing for damages outside the UK and European Union -lifted.</p>
              <p>Purslow wrote: 'To get straight to it, I think we should avoid the natural temptation to jump straight in to the deal with NESV. Whilst they are charming, intelligent and credible, their bid is at the extreme bottom end of the right deal threshold we set ourselves.</p>
              <p>'They may say they have money if necessary but I do not take this very seriously. So what is positive? Answer, they exist.'</p>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett want to show that the £300million deal accepted for Liverpool undervalued the club but they will have to wait for two weeks to learn whether their case has been successful. Purslow left his position last October.</p>

              <p>American Hicks wanted Mr Justice Floyd to lift anti-suit orders which prevented him taking action in the Texas courts to halt the deal in which he claims he lost £140million.</p>
              <p>The judge dismissed that application but varied the anti-suit injunction to allow Mr Hicks to make applications in the US in support of any proceedings in this country if he gives seven days notice to the parties he is suing.</p>
              <p>Mr Hicks believes he was the victim of an 'epic swindle' when the club was sold against his wishes to New England Sports Ventures for £300m.</p>
              <p>Mr Justice Floyd also dismissed an application to strike out or stay claims by Sir Martin Broughton, former chairman of the club, seeking damages against Mr Hicks for his actions while owner.</p>
              <p>New England Sports Ventures' application to be allowed to join the Broughton action was granted by the judge.</p>
              <p>NESV bought the club after repaying a £237m loan Mr Hicks and his former partner George Gillett took out with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Wells Fargo and Co.</p>
              <p>Mr Justice Floyd, in his ruling today, said the sale of Liverpool came about because of Mr Hicks and Mr Gillett's indebtedness.</p>
              <p>As the repayment date for the loan approached, Broughton arranged a board meeting last October to consider two offers, both of which were opposed by the former owners.</p>
              <p>The US pair purported to remove some of the English directors of the club and replace them with their own men.</p>

              <p><strong>Broughton went ahead with a board meeting which included the original directors and accepted the offer from Sports Ventures.</strong></p>
              <p>The judge said the former owners then sought a temporary restraining order in Texas 'expressly aimed at stopping the sale'.</p>
              <p>It was then that he said he allowed an anti-suit injunction 'on the basis of what appeared to me to be the unconscionable conduct of the former owners in seeking to undermine the English proceedings'.</p>
              <p>Of his decision not to discharge the anti-suit injunction, he said: 'The reality of the situation is that the former owners have already started two sets of proceedings and openly asserted their intention to start more.</p>
              <p>'They will undoubtedly start more proceedings if allowed to do so. There is a real threat that those proceedings will be in the United States.'</p>
              <p>Of the application to vary the anti-suit order, he said the former owners should be free to be able to make applications in the US courts that would aid proceedings in the UK.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool have expressed their satisfaction with the court's decision.</strong></p>
              <p>In a statement they said: 'Last week a further hearing took place as part of the ongoing litigation following the successful sale of the club in October 2010 to NESV.</p>
              <p>'We are delighted that Mr Justice Floyd has granted the applications requested by Sir Martin Broughton, RBS and NESV and that the anti-suit injunction prohibiting the former owners from commencing legal actions against these parties outside the EU has been upheld and clarified.</p>
              <p>'Sir Martin, RBS and NESV continue to maintain that there is no basis to challenge the propriety or validity of any actions by them or any of those involved on their behalf in the sale of the club.</p>
              <p>'They will continue to take all steps necessary to defend vigorously any litigation threatened or commenced by the club's former owners.'</p>
