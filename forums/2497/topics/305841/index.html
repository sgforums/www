              <p><strong><span class="main-content">David Moyes feels that the Premier League should look at closing down during the Africa Cup of Nations.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>The Everton boss has lost key trio Steven
              Pienaar, Joseph Yobo and Yakubu Aiyegbeni to the competition at a
              critical stage of the season when strength in depth is vital to cope
              with mounting injury lists and suspensions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fifa are believed to be considering the possibility of
              rescheduling the tournament in the future to fit around European
              fixture lists but Moyes has offered an alternative solution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the increasing number of African players now playing in the
              top-flight, and the continued calls from managers to introduce a
              mid-season break, Moyes feels that a complete shut down of domestic
              games when the tournament is on would help to keep everyone happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Respect</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We were embroiled in trying to get Steven Pienaar out and everyone knows what happened there," Moyes said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"You cannot win. But maybe now we have to consider if we close the Premier League season down during the African Nations Cup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"That would be the correct respect for Africa and the players in it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"If we want to bring players in from that part of the world we
              should be rightly allowed to do so, which we are, but it is not a fair
              playing field if you cannot field your best team."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Ridiculous</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moyes is facing more international disruption after receiving
              the news that Tim Cahill has been included in Australia's squad for
              their friendly against Qatar in Melbourne next week, forcing him to
              miss important league games with Blackburn and Reading.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I think it's ridiculous that someone has to fly halfway around
              the world in between two league matches at this stage of the season,"
              said Moyes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But Tim has to make the decision on whether he goes to play for Australia or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He has got a hamstring injury just now so we will have to see if that hinders him in any way."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Disappointment</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everton are preparing to face Tottenham at Goodison Park at
              Wednesday and, having been knocked out of both domestic cup
              competitions in recent weeks, Moyes feels that his players will have
              benefited from having last weekend off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We would have preferred to play in the FA Cup at the weekend
              but don't worry, there are plenty of games around the corner for us and
              we have given the players a couple of days to recover this week, get
              over the disappointment of the cup and get ready for an important
              league game," Moyes said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Tottenham came to Goodison and were exceptional last season so we know we will be in for a hard time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I hoped it would be a warm-up for the (Carling) cup final but unfortunately that wasn't to be."</p>
