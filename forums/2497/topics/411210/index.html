              <h3>EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR has seen his relationship with Roberto Mancini hit rock-bottom after an amazing bust-up. </h3>
              <p>Adebayor had to be restrained by stunned players after Manchester City's manager accused the striker of faking an injury. </p>
              <p>Mancini claimed it was no more than a dead leg, but Adebayor went for a scan to prove the injury was genuine. </p>
              <p>City's £170,000-a-week forward responded by taking a scan of a torn muscle in his leg into Mancini's training ground office. </p>
              <p>Adebayor has not played for the club since coming on as a substitute in their 1-0 defeat at Sunderland last month. </p>
              <p>A City source said: "It all kicked off between them. There is nothing worse than a manager accusing a player of feigning an injury. </p>
              <p>"Adebayor might not be playing well, but he would never be so unprofessional. He was furious." </p>
              <p>Relations between the pair have been simmering ever since Adebayor was axed for the opening game of the season at Tottenham. </p>
              <p>The latest incident in Adebayor's chequered career at Eastlands happened prior to last weekend's draw at home to Blackburn. </p>
              <p>He has not featured for City since he came on as a 75th minute substitute for Joleon Lescott at the Stadium of Light. </p>
              <p>Adebayor has been nursing the injury every since and missed City's last two matches. He has had a string of clashes since Mancini replaced Mark Hughes at Eastlands last December. </p>
              <p>The City striker had to be stopped by friends from confronting Mancini at White Hart Lane after he was left on the bench. </p>
              <p>Adebayor demanded an explanation from the Italian boss at their warm-down session the following day. The City striker then publicly threatened to quit the club as the transfer deadline came to a close, but they refused to sell him. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-280"><img title="MANCINI: Has preferred Jo" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00155/mancini_row_20_280x_155924a.jpg" alt="MANCINI: Has preferred Jo">

              <p><strong>Adebayor is one of a number of players struggling to cope with Mancini's methods after the Italian has spent nearly a year in charge at Eastlands.</strong> </p>
              <p>He was furious after Mancini suggested Jo, who scored against Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League win on Thursday, was now ahead of him in the pecking order. </p>
              <p>A number of senior players are struggling to adapt to Mancini's methods, but there are no plans to change the manager. </p>
              <p>He spent nearly £200m on new recruits in the summer and some are settling in better than others. </p>
              <p>Despite Mario Balotelli's injury he stunned City's players last week by raising his hand in the air on one level and repeating "Eto'o", before raising his hand higher and chanting "Balotelli".</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Roberto Mancini" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/roberto-mancini"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Roberto Mancini</strong></span></a><strong>'s growing irritation about the frequency with which </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong> players have complained publicly about his managerial methods manifested itself todaywith a strongly worded warning that they need to change their mentality and put an end to the current pattern of voicing their displeasure through the media.</strong></p>
              <p>Mancini has already discarded Craig Bellamy and Stephen Ireland in part because of their attitude behind the scenes, but the problems have persisted in the opening part of this season, with Emmanuel Adebayor's behaviour increasingly becoming a matter of concern.</p>
              <p>Shay Given's disillusionment after losing his place to Joe Hart also led to a meeting with Mancini yesterday, but the Italian has made it clear that he will not tolerate any more outbursts from his players as he tries to establish a squad rotation policy. "I want a mentality like at Manchester United and Chelsea, where the players understand why the manager has to make changes, but the problem for us is that we can't just change it in five months," Mancini said.</p>
              <p>"I played football myself and I understand why the players who are not chosen are unhappy but at the same time it's really important that we start to change their mentality because if we want to win something, to become a top team, it's going to be impossible if every few days a player does an interview saying [putting on a sad voice]: 'Oh, I'm not playing.'</p>
              <p>"I understand that only 11 players are happy and the rest are unhappy but we must change because the other top teams have this mentality and now it's time the players here understand that the manager can choose only 11 players and if he leaves someone out it's not because he thinks Manu [Adebayor] or [Mario] Balotelli or Kolo [Touré] are not good players. They can knock on my door and I will always give them an explanation."</p>
              <p>Given will make his first appearance of the season in the Carling Cup at West Bromwich Albion tomorrow, with Mancini planning up to seven changes, but the Republic of Ireland international has become disenchanted with being Hart's understudy and, in an interview at the weekend, complained that "if I'm flying around like Clark Kent in goal, I still won't play on Saturday". Given went on to make it clear he would like to leave on loan in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>"The goalkeeper is a different position to the rest of the team," Mancini said. "We are lucky because we have two fantastic goalkeepers, but I can choose only one and I can't change every game. I hope Shay stays here, but if he doesn't want to stay I understand the situation."</p>
              <p>The problems with Adebayor are more of a concern for Mancini, not so much the striker's recent assertion that he would look to leave the club if he were not playing regularly, but a continuation of the disruptive attitude that helped to persuade Arsenal to sell him last year. Mancini's strategy is to deny there is a problem in public, much like he tried to play down his issues with Bellamy, Ireland and Carlos Tevez last season, but he is becoming exasperated by his inability to get through to the player. "I don't know if he wants to stay or not," he admitted at one point.</p>
              <p>Adebayor has made only two starts this season and missed the last three games because of a thigh problem, with Mancini reported at the weekend to be sceptical about the authenticity of the injury. "It's false to say we fought in the dressing room or on the training pitch," he said. "We discussed the situation with his injury but, for example yesterday, he worked with the team [in training]. If Manu is available for West Bromwich, we will see. If he's available for Chelsea [on Saturday], he can come on the bench."</p>
