              <p>The 29-year-old playmaker has joined the Premier League club from Barcelona on a season-long loan deal having spent last season with Bundesliga outfit Stuttgart.</p>
              <p>Hleb – formerly of Arsenal, where he made 130 appearances in all competitions – has spoken for the first time since joining Birmingham and said he had rejected the sides of Roy Hodgson and Harry Redknapp this summer.</p>
              <p>The Belarus international felt the Blues wanted to sign him more than anyone else and that made up his mind despite the lack of European football on offer with Alex McLeish’s side.</p>
              <p>The player says Portuguese champions Benfica had also been chasing him.</p>
              <p>"I had a few options - Liverpool, Tottenham and Benfica," Hleb revealed to <em>ITV Sport</em>. "It was necessary to explore each one.</p>
              <p>"I wasn't able to come to an agreement with one of them.</p>
              <p>"But Birmingham clearly wanted to do the deal more than the others, which is why I made my choice."</p>
              McLeish has said the signing of Hleb is like a ‘dream’ for his side, who have also signed defender Martin Jiranek on deadline day.<br>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">BIRMINGHAM have signed Alexander Hleb — with a little help from Alex Ferguson. Former Arsenal midfielder Hleb needed a work permit before he could move to St Andrew's, with boss Alex McLeish travelling to London yesterday to plead his case.</h2>
              <p>And in order to strengthen his hand, McLeish carried a testimonial from Manchester United chief Fergie — his old Aberdeen manager — stating Hleb would be a major asset to the Premier League side.</p>
              <p>That helped persuade officials to decide that Hleb, 29, deserved his permit. He joins on loan from Barcelona with a view to a permanent three-year deal at the end of the season. Hleb is Blues' seventh summer signing and the third on deadline day.</p>
              <p>They also completed deals for Czech defender Martin Jiranek from Spartak Moscow and Chile international Jean Beausejour.</p>
              <p>Belarus international Hleb, who made 89 appearances for the Gunners before moving to Barca two years ago, has struggled for first-team football in Spain.</p>
              <p>He admitted last night he hopes his move to Birmingham will rescue a career that went badly wrong the moment he left the Emirates for the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>Hleb said: "I had several options to chose from — Liverpool, Tottenham, Benfica. That is why my final decision came so late because I had to think all the options over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Birmingham looked like a club who wanted me more than the others — that's why I preferred them.</p>
              <p>"It was also important that I know the English Premier League very well. "But Birmingham is a perfect option for me now when most of all I need to play.</p>
              <p>"I realise it is not quite the same as Arsenal, playing in the Champions League, but first of all I need to get back to my old form.</p>
              <p>"To be honest, I got a lot of things wrong in the last 18 months so Birmingham is a new chance for me."</p>
              <p>Winger Beausejour, 26, has penned a three-year contract with Brum after moving for an undisclosed fee from Club America in Mexico.</p>
              <p>McLeish said: "He is an excellent left-sided midfielder who had a tremendous World Cup with Chile - he was their star player against Spain.</p>
              <p>"He has been on our list of targets for a long time because he is strong and quick with the ability to beat his man and get crosses in."</p>

              <p>well, in this case, he could spare the earlier comment and just</p>
              <p>"Birmingham looked like a club who wanted me more than the

              <p>in the past, if U say, going to pool, and he may not play week in/out may be justifable, but with Roy, i think the team selection may be a bit more stabilise. Similiarly, does it guarantee going to BC, equal to he will play week in/out?</p>
              <p>well, we shall see.. :)</p>
