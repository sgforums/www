              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PAUL MERSON has claimed he was often injected with an unknown substance during his Arsenal career.</h2>
              <p>The ex-England international says it took place while Arsene Wenger was manager at Highbury and makes the allegations in an interview with French football magazine So Foot.</p>
              <p>Merson, 43, who played under Wenger in 1996-97, said: "Sometimes, on the eve of big games, we would go to a Holiday Inn in Islington where a yellowy product was injected into our arm.</p>
              <p>"I never asked myself any questions. From the moment where you trust a manager, you take everything he asks you to."</p>
              <p>Merson admits he was not bothered as he was already a heavy drinker and drug user.</p>
              <p>He added: "In comparison to what I had put in my system, nothing would have scared me."</p>
              <p>Merson also revealed that every morning when the players arrived at training they were given 'an orange juice mixed with Creatine'.</p>
              <p>Creatine is a stamina enhancer.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PAUL MERSON admits he was buzzing - literally - when playing for Arsene Wenger.</h2>
              <p>The ex-Arsenal and England star, 43, once swallowed a high-powered caffeine tablet ahead of a Premier League away game.</p>
              <p>Yet Merson's real problems were always his inability to cope with life away from matchdays as his problems with drink, drugs and gambling continued, while he once butted a wall after he lost a bet.</p>
              <p>Mers, who played more than 400 games for the Gunners, had no idea what was in a yellow fluid injected into his body before games.</p>
              <p>But an Arsenal spokesman said: "This was a simple multi-vitamin injection."</p>
              <p>Merson, though, was fully aware of what the tablets were being handed out by boss Arsene Wenger.</p>
              <p>He said: "Just before kick-off for a game against Blackburn, Arsene gave us a dark tablet.</p>
              <p>"It was pure caffeine, the equivalent of 10 cups of Starbucks. My heart started racing, 30 minutes later that was still the case.</p>
              <p>"I had an addictive personality. Today, I've accepted it and I live with it. I try to reverse the problem.</p>
              <p>"For example, if I eat chocolate, I know I can become addicted so I get addicted to resisting chocolate.</p>
              <p>"It was very hard to get out of it. It's a spiral where everything is linked. I started by gambling and since I would lose, I would go into a depression.</p>
              <p>"So then I needed to drink. And to be able to drink a lot, often and for a long time, I'd take cocaine.</p>
              <p>"It seems unimaginable to me now. I have no idea where I got the energy from to lead such a life and to play football.</p>
              <p>"In life I never felt anything more powerful than the explosion of joy when you've just scored a goal.</p>
              <p>"You fly high, very high, then the match stops and you tell yourself you'll have to wait until next weekend to get the chance to relive such an emotion.</p>
              <p>"From Monday to Friday a footballer's life is very boring. I wasn't able to stand it."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="float-right padding-left-10 width-300 padding-bottom-10"><span id="adpl-2" class="adph-delay"></span></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After wasting his first £100 pay cheque on gambling, Merson revealed: "I was so ashamed, I was incapable of admitting the truth to my parents.</p>
              <p>"When I left the bookies, I headbutted a wall to damage my face, and when I got home I pretended that I had been mugged and robbed."</p>
              <p>After life at Arsenal, Merson headed to Middlesbrough in 1997 when he would have drinking games with Paul Gascoigne.</p>
              <p>In an interview with French magazine So Foot, Merson said: "Gazza taught me a game: You take an anxiolytic (tranquilliser), then a glass of red wine, until you drop."</p>
              <p>But as he has often admitted, it was his problems with cocaine which would leave Merson living in fear.</p>
              <p>He added: "Every time I heard the sound of a motor in my road, I thought a dealer was coming to do me.</p>
              <p>"I'd spend entire days on my couch. I'd dial a phone number to place a bet, I would have a line of cocaine, then another bet, then a line, like that, non-stop, every two minutes."</p>
              <p>Merson admits that he does still drink occasionally but avoids pubs.</p>
              <p>He revealed: "I can have a drink at home or in a restaurant but I don't go to the pub any more. That's finished, it's too risky."</p>
