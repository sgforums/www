              <div class="KonaBody">The 32-year-old Frenchman has walked away from Barcelona with 12 months remaining on his contract to join the New York Red Bulls and link up with his friend Beckham in America.</div>
              <div class="KonaBody">But despite being one of the world’s most marketable footballers over the last decade, Henry is not expected to have the same commercial pulling power as Beckham, who moved to LA Galaxy in 2007.</div>
              <div class="KonaBody">Like Beckham, it is understood that Henry will take a drop in basic salary to move from Spain to America but the Frenchman’s deal, believed to be worth around £2 million per season, will be augmented from other revenue sources, including a tie-up with club owner Red Bull, his own sponsors Adidas and Gillette and spin-offs such as shirt sales and merchandise.</div>
              <p class="KonaBody">New MLS guidelines allow clubs to have up to three designated players whose salaries are not included in the League’s £1.67m annual salary cap, so only a small portion of Henry’s wages will count against the club’s cap. The remainder will be paid by the owner Red Bull.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">“Thierry Henry will be used to attract the crowds and the TV money,” said Emmanuel Hembert, football business expert for management consultants AT Kearney.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">“They would really need to attract big crowds and sells lots of shirts to make it worthwhile. They will also need Henry to show big motivation and really perform.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">“Henry is going for the money, it is clear, as it is his last contract before retiring. The problem for MLS, from what I have heard, is that they are really struggling to attract crowds. People are watching the European leagues with the big stars. That’s why they are trying to attract the stars, even ones who are past their prime.”</p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody"> </p>

              <p class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"> </p>
              <p class="KonaBody"><strong>Alex Brownsell, of marketing magazine Brand Republic, does not believe Henry will be able to shift shirts like Beckham.</strong></p>
              <p class="KonaBody">“For the game in America it certainly makes sense to go down the tried and trusted route of getting a big European player, just as LA Galaxy did with Beckham,” explained Brownsell.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">“In this instance, he isn’t nearly as big a global star as David Beckham, who is hands down the most famous football player there has ever been, possibly along with Pele.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">“Henry is a world renowned footballer but he doesn’t have the same level of celebrity. He is almost certainly not going to sell as many shirts. I’m sure there will be a commercial return but, no disrespect to Thierry Henry the player, the level of awareness there will be for him in north America is nowhere near the same.</p>
              <p class="KonaBody">"I’m sure people would have heard of him but there won’t be the same populist knowledge there would be of Beckham.”</p>

              <h1>Thierry Henry</h1>
              <p>With every possible award in world soccer lining his counter 
              top, Thierry Henry is easily one of the greatest French player ever.</p>
              <div id="article_content" class="KonaBody"><span id="divAdnetKeyword">Born
               in Guadeloupe in 1977, the striker first exploded at Monaco in France, 
              where he started his career. Henry gained respect at the elite level in 
              1998, winning the World Cup in France. His tremendous pace made him a 
              permanent danger for defenders. <br><br><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://u.goal.com/103700/103736hp2.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="355"><br><br>At the start of his career at Monaco and later at 
              Juventus, 'Titi' played on the left, but Arsène Wenger at Arsenal 
              transformed him into a complete center forward. Darting in from the left
               flank, Henry's right-footed curling shots to the far post soon came to 
              haunt opposition sides. <br><br>Having spent eight years in London, 
              Arsenal is surely his club as Henry is the best goal scorer ever for the
               Gunners with 226 goals in 339 appearances. The Frenchman also freely 
              admits that he supports Arsenal. <br><br>Still considered the best 
              foreign player in Premier League history, Henry is also the best goal 
              scorer in the French national team (50 goals) and was recently the 
              captain of Raymond Domech's squad. <br><br><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://u.goal.com/93200/93281hp2.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="355"><br><br>A move to Barcelona ahead of the 2008 season allowed
               Henry to fill out his trophy cabinet by winning the Champions League, 
              La Liga, and Copa del Rey in 2009. <br><br>Controversy smeared his 
              career in 2009 when a handball against Ireland in the qualification 
              playoffs for the 2010 World Cup allowed Les Blues to progress. <br><br>Perhaps
               fittingly, Henry's career took a downturn following the handball. After
               a difficult year at Barcelona Henry lost his starting spot on the 
              national team and France imploded at the 2010 World Cup, crashing out in
               the group stages. <br><br>Now Henry enters the swansong of his career 
              in New York Red Bulls. <br><br><img style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://u.goal.com/103000/103042hp2.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="355"><br><br><strong>Strengths:</strong><br>- Speed<br>- Scoring <br>-
