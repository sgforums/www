              <p><span><strong>Arsene Wenger is facing a goalkeeping crisis at Arsenal with Wojciech Szczesny expected to be sidelined for longer than first feared. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Polish keeper dislocated his finger in the Champions League exit in Barcelona on Tuesday but it was initially hoped he wouldn't be out for long than two to three weeks. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, boss Wenger has revealed that Szczesny is unlikely to return before the end of next month.</span></p>
              <p><span>That will speed up his attempts to bring in a goalkeeper on an emergency loan move with Lukasz Fabianski and Vito Mannone, who was on loan at Hull City, also crocked. </span></p>
              <p><span>Wenger said: 'We need now an experienced goalkeeper as cover for Almunia because Mannone is out for six weeks so we cannot call on him. </span></p>
              <p><span>'Mannone is here at the training ground having treatment but he cannot play for the next six weeks. We can call him back but he is not available. </span></p>
              <p><span>'We have Wojciech out, in my opinion for six weeks. We have Fabianski out for the rest of the season. We need absolutely some cover in goal.' </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Wenger will now concentrate on signing an experienced back-up to Almunia. He is allowed to bring in someone on loan, or a free agent. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Almunia had looked set to leave Arsenal during the January transfer window, but the Spaniard now finds himself thrust back into the first-team picture ahead of Saturday's FA Cup quarter-final at Manchester United. </span></p>
              <p><span>Wenger has been impressed with Almunia's approach to the situation. 'He is very professional, [has a] very dignified attitude and overall he has done very well,' the Arsenal boss said.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>'Yes, he has done quite well when he came on [against Barcelona] and was quite busy in the final part of the game and he did very well.'</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Wenger does not expect any of his senior squad to be happy just warming the bench. 'When I took Jens Lehmann out, who [had] made only one mistake, and put Almunia in, Lehmann came in the next day and fought even harder,' said the Frenchman. 'That's what I believe our job is about.'</span></p>

              <p>But the former Germany No 1 is back at the club for six weeks to

              <p><span>The German legend, 41, retired at the end of last season but he is ready to return to the game to solve the Gunners' goalkeeping crisis.</span></p>
              <p><span>Lehmann is expected to sign a deal until the end of the season before Saturday's Barclays Premier League match against struggling West Bromwich Albion.</span></p>
              <p><span>Manuel Almunia is currently the north London club's only fit senior keeper after long-term injuries to Wojciech Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski. Vito Mannone, who is currently on loan at Hull, is also injured.</span></p>
              <p><span>Lehmann spent five years with the Gunners and recently returned to the club's London Colney training base for a six-week coaching stint.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Asked if he would solve Wenger's search for an emergency stop-gap keeper in light of his current crisis, Lehmann replied: 'I am in London and so far have heard nothing of such plans, but you never know.'</span></p>

              <div class="clear-left">.</div>
              <div id="bodyText">
              <p>The retired German, 41, who hates current Emirates keeper Manuel Almunia, is wanted to help solve the club's stopper crisis, with Polish duo Wojciech Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski both crocked.</p>
              <p>Yet boss Wenger's move to bring back Lehmann will stun the club's fans.</p>
              <p>Lehmann was at Arsenal for five years before leaving for Stuttgart in 2008 after continually clashing with Almunia. He then quit the sport last summer.</p>
              <p>The bizarre decision to re-sign Lehmann comes at the end of a nightmare two-week spell for Arsenal which has seen the club knocked out of the Carling Cup, Champions League and FA Cup.</p>
              <p>Lehmann is set to sign for the rest of the season and could be in the squad for Saturday's trip to West Brom.</p>
              <p>And he has promised he will not cause further problems with Spaniard Almunia.</p>
              <p>Lehmann said: "I will help Almunia or whoever is in goal. I know I will be the keeper on the bench.</p>
              <p>"There is no rivalry, that was three years ago. It's a different situation and it's great to be coming back."</p>
              <p>Lehmann's problems with Almunia increased once he was edged out of the team.</p>
              <p>In April 2008, shortly before Lehmann's exit, Almunia said: "To have someone here who hates me is amazing."</p>
              <p>Lehmann, a key member of Arsenal's Invincibles from the 2003-04 season, has a reputation within the club for being slightly manic.</p>
              <p>Almunia, likely to leave at the end of the season, is unlikely to be impressed.</p>
              <p>Gunners defender Johan Djourou will miss the rest of the season with a dislocated shoulder, while skipper Cesc Fabregas and Theo Walcott are unlikely to be fit for the trip to the Hawthorns.</p>
