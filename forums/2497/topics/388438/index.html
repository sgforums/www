              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> supporter groups may ask <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> to resign in protest against the Glazer family, the club's owners.</p>
              <p>The idea was put forward at a specially convened meeting of fans'
              groups to determine an action plan to drive out the Glazers. The <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> Supporters' Trust, which arranged the meeting before Saturday's 3-0 defeat of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Burnley</span></abbr>,
              are also exploring the possibility of asking Eric Cantona to act as
              their figurehead, and plans are being put in place for a protest march
              before the Champions League tie against Milan on 10 March.</p>
              <p>More than 300 fans attended the talks and Johnny Flacks, a founding member and former chairman of the Independent <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> Supporters' Association, proposed a letter should be written to Ferguson asking him to step down as manager as manager.</p>
              <p>"This is not intended as an Alex Ferguson rant," Flacks told the <em>Guardian</em>.
              "But he claims to be a socialist, a former shop steward and a man of
              the people, so he must be horrified by what is going on. It would work
              only if thousands of people sent a copy of this letter to Ferguson
              letting him know that our fear, if the Glazers stay in control, is that
              his legacy is going to be destroyed. We wouldn't want that and I don't
              think he would either."</p>
              <p>Flacks has known Ferguson for many years and was so close to
              him at one point the United manager would regularly attend IMUSA
              meetings and invite him to the old Cliff training ground.</p>
              <p>"Moving to Carrington was his baby and he must be horrified
              that the Glazers could now be thinking of selling Carrington and then
              arranging for it to be leased back," Flacks said. "That would make <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> no better than a non-league club not even owning a training ground."</p>

              <p>The  <em>Daily Star</em> says United quickly quelled a protest against their American owners during the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Burnley</span></abbr> match, Old Trafford stewards taking down a banner which read: “Love United, hate the Glazers.” Two fans were ejected.</p>
              <p>After the match, a group of fans staged a peaceful but noisy demo
              against the Glazers and chief executive David Gill outside the
              directors’ entrance. Feelings are running high after a week in which
              the club revealed plans to raise £500m with a bond issue in a bid to
              tackle it’s enormous debt-interest payments.</p>
