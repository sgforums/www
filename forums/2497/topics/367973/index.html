              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> star David Bentley has been the victim of a cowardly attack.</p>
              <p>The <em>Sunday Mirror</em> says Bentley was punched in the face as he sat in a restaurant with his heavily pregnant fiancée.</p>
              <p>The Spurs midfielder, 24, had been enjoying a meal with Kimberly Mills
              and another couple when a man walked up to their table after finishing
              his own dinner - and took a swing at him.</p>
              <p>Stunned Bentley was left reeling in his chair as the attacker ran out of the restaurant.</p>
              <p>The footballer's friend chased the thug - believed to be in his
              late 20s - but he was also attacked and left with a cut face and black
              eye.</p>
              <p>Bentley's agent Robert Segal said the attacker's table had paid
              their bill and had taxis waiting outside in readiness for their escape.</p>
              <p>Mr Segal said: "David is pretty shaken. He was in the
              restaurant with his best friend and their respective partners. A guy
              walked over and started talking gibberish to him, then he just took a
              swing and punched him. David's fiancée, who is seven months pregnant,
              had just been to the loo and saw the whole thing. Obviously, she was
              very upset about it.</p>
              <p>"David's mate jumped up and ran after the man and he got
              punched as well. It was obviously premeditated because the other people
              at the table got up and ran out of the restaurant. They had taxis
              waiting outside.</p>
              <p>"The police were called and we are just waiting to see what we
              can do. If we are advised to, then we will definitely press charges.</p>
              <p>"David was a total victim in this. He said to me, 'What gives
              someone the right to walk up and attack me when I'm enjoying a meal?'.</p>
              <p>He added: "I am just pleased that the guy did run away, because if David hit him back he would be sitting in a police cell now."</p>
