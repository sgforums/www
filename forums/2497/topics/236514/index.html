But if they wanted English, Allardyce would have been a better choice than McClaren.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, GRAHAM TAYLOR has told Steve McClaren to brace himself for a Â‘very difficult timeÂ’ if he fails to beat Israel in next monthÂ’s Euro 2008 qualifier.<br><br>Taylor knows all about the pressure Mac is under as he earned the derogatory nickname Â‘TurnipÂ’ when in charge of EnglandÂ’s poor Euro 1992 campaign.<br><br>He said: Â“My overall concern is when it comes to qualifying games. Sven Goran ErikssonÂ’s record was first class and Steve has got to get that right.<br><br>Â“Israel is going to be very tricky, and all he has to take into it is the Croatia defeat and this performance against Spain, which makes me feel uneasy.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maclaren is ok. He was chosen mainly becoz he was already involved with the England squad before.<br><br>I think he should play the squad to their strength and not play around with the formation too much if he wants to win games. Anyway, he has the reputation of winning very difficult games from his days in boro, even southgate is becoming something like any other maclaren. I think England will do ok, and qualify for Euro 2008.</div>
