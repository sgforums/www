              <p>Personally i feel quite sad for them, having such a good team but failing to gel as a team. Is it a case of too many changes? Disruption of balance in the team? Please give your views.</p>
              <p>I foresee that Ramos will get the axe if Tottenham fail to beat Hull in the next game which will take place at White hart lane.</p>

              <p>The state they are in right now is also partly the way Levy runs the club... It looks like the same thing is being played over when Martin Jol was there... Only this time its Ramos playing the supporting actors role instead of Jol...</p>

              its always the case with Tottenham - they have such promise in the team and players but somehow cannot deliver. I think the sale of Keane and Berbatov really rock the boat ~ and they really need time to recover.  
              
              They will do okay and should finish mid-table - compared to Newcastle, they are in better shape - at least they have a manger and the backroom isn't in a chaos.

              <p>I agree Ramos had no choice with Keane and Berba but the dealing part was down to Levy not Ramos. Levy shouldn't have drag the whole club through that process 2 times over in a space of 6 to 7 weeks... The smart money would be to let them go earlier and not create such a fuss that have come back to haunt the whole squad or the very least, not creating so much hostility in the papers almost everyday cos the Spurs players would also be reading them and may feel disappointed and demoralize when their 2 "star men" eventually leave.</p>
              <p>Another problem dragging their feet and delaying the transfers also created more problems for the club or Ramos mainly... Ramos couldn't get any one in cos the money wasn't in their bank yet, also it leave him lesser time to get a proper replacement... Getting proper replacements doesn't mean you go looking for it in the last week or 2 before the season starts... Cos other clubs also won't be interested to do business after having settled their squad for the coming season. This leave them not much choice but to settle for a high priced unproven Russian in the premiership as the time was closing in on them...</p>
              <p>I personally feel Ramos is still a good coach / manager, just that some executive things were out of his control. Levy for his part, got $2m more for Keane when Pool offered $18 and they got $20 and maybe another $3m for Berbatov when United offered $28 and they got $30.75... But I still feel the price the club pays seems too high...</p>
              <p>For that extra $4 to $5 million... Its not worth it if it effects a season that promised so much... This is not the first time this has happen at Spurs, the last time it was with Martin Jol who amazingly is now managing the league leader of the German Bundesliga <span style="color: #000000;">Hamburg SV... When Jol was still around, Levy created unnecessary problems that undermined the manager and players start to lose respect for him when they feel he is no longer in control and here is where the rot starts.  </span></p>

              <p>Daniel Levy should be sack!!</p>
              <p>he sold Berba and keane without signing Asharvin. that a mistake of Levy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ramos inherited too many Junk players at tottenham. he dont have enough time to get rid of them( some with lucrative contracts) and management not enough money to buy new players. Bargaining 1-2 million over asharvin but get 50 million over the sale from berba and keane.</p>

              <p>It is a test for the spurs players and the manager.</p>
              <p>So far, no complaints have been directed at the coach.</p>
              <p>Consideration have to be taken as this is his first season in charge.</p>
              <p>He have to work out and fine tune his tactics.</p>

              <p><br>Nooo... All I am saying is when Jose arrived, the backbone of the Chelsea squad were already there and playing together for sometime already otherwise they wouldn't have came in 2nd... Even Lampard, Duff and Crespo had their 1 year to gel with the squad during Ranieri's last year... When they came in 2nd which wasn't a bad result... They had that 1 year under their belts already to gel with the squad, the rest had even more...</p>
              <p>Why are we even talking about Grant? But if you want to look at his track record, he inheritted a squad that lost the title by 6 points and improve it to 2 last season and even took them to within the CL title... All this despite he didn't even had a pre-season or get his own signings...</p>
              <p>All I am saying is your first post seemed to suggest that all credit should have gone to Mourinho... But if you were to take a closer look, how many new players did Chelsea had in Jose's first team during his first year? Spurs on the other hand... From Jun only, On record show they had 9 new players, and 6 are in the first team... How about those that came in Jan, Woodgate, Hutton...</p>
              <p>Jose deserve credit for taking them to the title but not the kind of credit you are referring too...</p>
