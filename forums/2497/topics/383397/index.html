              <div id="small_article_image_container"><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/42343_news.jpg" alt="Hull City's new signing Jimmy Bullard is welcomed by Tigers boss Phil Brown (PA)"></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>It takes a special kind of character to pull off a pre-planned goal
              celebration - especially when the target is the team's own manager. But
              that is exactly what Jimmy Bullard and his Hull City team-mates achieved to great effect at Manchester City on Saturday.</p>
              <p>In last season's game at Eastlands, after 45 minutes Hull were
              already 4-0 down. Furious manager Phil Brown had dragged his team over
              towards the Hull City support, and proceeded to give his half-time team
              talk on the pitch, in the hope that the embarrassment would provoke a
              response.</p>
              <p>Eleven months later, Bullard converted a second-half penalty to seal a 1-1 draw at the same ground - indeed the same <em>end</em> of the same ground - and celebrated by sitting his team-mates down in the same spot and wagging his finger at each one.</p>
              <p>"We decided to do it last night," explained Bullard after the game. "He [Phil Brown] took it well.</p>
              <p>"It was a bit of banter to do it if we scored a goal, and we agreed
              that whoever scored an equaliser or winning goal had to be the one who
              did the pointing.</p>
              <p>"I think Paul McShane will be the one to take the flak for it."</p>
              <p>But how does Hull's effort stack up against the other great pre-planned celebrations of modern times? <strong>Goal.com UK</strong> takes a look at the best of the bunch: some are outrageous, some touching, and others downright cheeky.</p>
              <p><strong>Jurgen Klinsmann (Sheffield Wednesday v TOTTENHAM, 1992)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62252_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>When the German arrived at White Hart Lane, he brought with him a
              reputation for all too quickly going to ground. Football fans all over
              the world still remembered his part in Argentina's Pedro Monzon
              becoming the first player ever to be sent off in a World Cup
              final. Klinsmann first leaped over the challenge, then dived again
              after hitting the ground.</p>
              <p>On his arrival in London, many fans thought he was simply overrated,
              at Spurs for the money, and likely to spend more time on the floor than
              scoring goals.</p>
              <p>Instead what they got was a genuine superstar, a striker who covered
              every blade of grass and went on to become a Tottenham legend.</p>
              <p>On his debut away to Sheffield Wednesday, after announcing his
              arrival with a clinical finish, Klinsmann showed the Germans do have a
              sense of humour by diving across the pitch on his belly, followed by
              his team-mates, a celebration that was to become his trademark.</p>
              <p><strong>Craig Bellamy (Barcelona v LIVERPOOL, 2007)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62263_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>In the days when Rafa Benitez had Liverpool feared around Europe,
              they headed to the imposing Camp Nou ready for battle with Barcelona,
              only for the players to end up battling each other.</p>
              <p>The team were staying in a Portugese hotel as they limbered up for
              the clash, and as if to prove that karaoke is a dangerous past-time,
              Craig Bellamy and John Arne Riise were nearly doing a duet of 'Murder
              on the dancefloor.'</p>
              <p>As a heated argument ensued, apparently after Riise's refusal to
              take the microphone and croon to Bellamy on stage, the Welshman ended
              the evening by reportedly threatening Riise with a golf club.</p>
              <p>He earned an £80,000 fine for his foul play, but went a large way to
              making amends when he proceeded to score in a 2-1 win over Barcelona,
              and celebrated by showing everyone just how good his golf swing is.</p>
              <p><strong>Gordon Strachan (SCOTLAND v West Germany, World Cup 86)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62251_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>The rage during the 1986 World Cup tournament when goals had been scored was to hurdle the advertising boards.</p>
              <p>However, for someone as short as Gordon Strachan, that was always
              going to prove a slight problem. Nevertheless, he and Charlie Nicholas
              had sworn to each other that they would do it if either of them scored,
              with Strachan joking he half-expected to fall into a moat on the other
              side.</p>
              <p>Therefore, when the wee ginger terrier scored for Scotland against
              Germany in the heat of Mexico 86, he ran to the hoardings, which in
              truth looked bigger than him, before stopping and instead resting his
              right leg on top of it, looking at his team-mates as if to say “What
              did you expect?”</p>
              <p><strong>Ian Wright (WEST HAM v Southampton, September 1998)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62297_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>A week before, volatile Italian Paulo Di Canio had reacted to a red
              card by pushing referee Paul Alcock, whose theatrical fall to the
              ground would put the likes of Eduardo and David Ngog to shame.</p>
              <p>Never one to miss a trick, Ian Wright celebrated his goal by being
              pushed in the chest by Neil Ruddock, before falling comically to the
              floor.</p>
              <p><strong>Peter Crouch (ENGLAND v Jamaica, 2006)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62257_news.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>The gangly frame of Peter Crouch has always been a reason to poke
              fun at the towering forward, with the England striker himself answering
              the question “What would you be if you were not a footballer?” with the
              answer “A virgin.”</p>
              <p>In the lead-up to the 2006 World Cup, Crouch had entertained his
              fellow players at a pre-finals party hosted by David Beckham by showing
              off his dance moves.</p>
              <p>As Crouch hit the back of the net in England colours, he let the
              world in on his party piece, treating laughing fans to his own take of
              the robotic dance.</p>
              <p>The celebration was such a hit that he was urged to do it time and
              time again, until it even received the royal seal of approval – Prince
              William could not help but ask Crouch to re-enact the dance when he met
              up with the England squad.</p>
              <p><strong>Paul Gascoigne (ENGLAND v Scotland, Euro 96)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62261_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>Euro 96, football's coming home. The pressure was on England big
              time to produce at the very least a long run in the tournament, and
              with Holland and old foes Scotland in their group they were not going
              to get it easy.</p>
              <p>Manager Terry Venables took the squad to the Far East to escape the
              media, however only served to give the press headlines for the front
              page rather than the back.</p>
              <p>A dentist chair, tequila, and England internationals don't mix well,
              and it wasn't quite what England expected from their boys on their
              travels to Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>As the media circus rounded on England, critics weren't exactly
              answered in empathic style as they laboured to a 1-1 draw in the
              opening match against Switzerland. A first 45 minutes against Scotland
              hadn't gone to plan either, and despite Alan Shearer's early second
              half goal, the world fell in on England when Scotland were awarded a
              penalty.</p>
              <p>Anguish turned to wild celebration though as Gary
              McAllister's penalty was saved by David Seaman, and moments later Paul
              Gascoigne scored what was later voted the greatest goal ever at old
              Wembley, lobbing Colin Hendry and hammering the ball low past Andy
              Goram.</p>
              <p>Gazza, ever the joker, pointed at the water bottle lying nearby, and
              his team-mates knew what to do, spraying the contents onto a prone
              Geordie happily re-enacting the dentist chair.</p>
              <p><strong>Bebeto (BRAZIL v Holland, USA 94)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62266_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>At the ripe old age of 30, baby faced Bebeto had managed only eight
              minutes of World Cup football before the tournament started, against
              Costa Rica in Italia 90.</p>
              <p>USA 94 therefore was his chance to emerge from the shadows.</p>
              <p>The tournament was to be a happy one for Bebeto and his country,
              lifting the famous trophy for the first time in six attempts. To add to
              the joy, days before the quarter-final with the Netherlands, the ten
              stone Brazilian striker became a father for the third time.</p>
              <p>When he then scored against the Dutch, the pint-sized striker ran to
              the corner, swinging his arms as if cradling a baby, before his
              team-mates joined him. If anything, the cutest celebration there's ever
              been.</p>
              <p><strong>Facundo Sava (FULHAM v Charlton, 2002)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62267_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>A lot of footballers wish they could be someone else on the pitch. 
              Most wish they were Diego Maradona, others dream of scoring like Pele,
              and perhaps maybe one or two fancy themselves as Robbie Savage.</p>
              <p>However, not many strut around the pitch wishing to be Zorro.</p>
              <p>After Facundo Sava blasted the ball into the net against Charlton,
              the Fulham striker stunned everyone by rolling down his socks, pulling
              out a face mask, and running around the pitch with it planted on his
              face. Fans did not know whether to cheer or laugh.</p>
              <p>The Argentine later revealed the tradition had started in his
              homeland, where fans at Gimnasia would throw masks onto the pitch for
              players to wear every time they scored.</p>
              <p>“I have 250 masks,” he once said. “I could only bring one with me.”</p>
              <p><strong>Cesc Fabregas  (Everton v ARSENAL, 2009)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/53866_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>When Espanyol captain Daniel Jarque died suddenly from a heart
              attack at the age of 26 this pre-season, Spain was plunged into deep
              mourning.</p>
              <p>On the opening day of the season, as Arsenal demolished Everton 6-1,
              Cesc Fabregas celebrated his second goal of the game by holding up an
              Arsenal shirt with No.21 and Jarque printed on it. A touching tribute
              to his fellow Barcelona native and former Spain under-21 team-mate.</p>
              <p><strong>Papa Bouba Diop (France v SENEGAL, WC 2002)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62273_hp.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="baseline"></p>
              <p>Senegal were meant to be the lightweights of the 2002 World Cup, and
              as they lined up against the holders France in the opening match, not
              many predicted a shock result.</p>
              <p>Once a former French colony, Senegal were playing in their first
              ever World Cup match, and what a start they made, defeating the World
              champions through Papa Bouba Diop's strike.</p>
              <p>No normal celebration would do, and after Diop prodded the ball home
              from close range, he ran to the corner flag, laid his shirt down on the
              floor, and led his team-mates in a dance around the garment.</p>
