I know the number of times they play against 10 players and itÂ’s a bit surprising.<br><br>Â“Eidur played in English football all his life and three months later he gets that penalty.

In fact was it not a certain Didier Drogba who used to be the biggest culprit of all?<br><br>His dubious behaviour was highlighted on the back pages week in, week out, and Mourinho never stopped complaining about the criticism of the Ivory Coast striker.<br><br>Yet Drogba was such a diver even his own supporters booed him and he had to clean up his act.<br><br>Mourinho never took him to task, though, and he was happy to let him get away with it as long as he could.<br><br>An undeniable case of pots and kettles Â— but such double-standards have never bothered Jose. He just likes rubbing Barca up the wrong way. As he was leaving the pre-match Press conference, Mourinho was asked about his reference last season to MessiÂ’s play-acting when he said that Barcelona was famous for its theatres.<br><br>Â“Theatre?Â” said Mourinho.

In preparation for tonight's Champions League match at the Camp Nou he used the dive with which Eidur Gudjohnsen gained a penalty for Barcelona in La Liga on Saturday to portray his opponents as being steeped in deceitfulness. His opposite number Frank Rijkaard replied with a contemptuous review of Mourinho's thought processes: "It's a poor man's mind in general."<br><br>Mourinho actually had his wits about him, unappealing as the tactic was. He nurses grievances regarding Barcelona and must hope to make the referee Stefano Faria suspicious of events this evening. Gudjohnsen's behaviour led to the opener in a 3-0 win over Recreativo Huelva and Mourinho's insinuation is that the Icelander has only been instructed in these black arts since moving from Chelsea in the summer.<br><br>It was a harsh way to speak of an ex-employee and the subject grew preposterous when he purported to be extolling the Premiership.</div>
