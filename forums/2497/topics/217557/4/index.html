            <div class='col-md body'>Barca will be out of UCL. They have great players but their defending and midfield play was horrendous. Too much play acting also. Deco is such a great player but he play acts too much. Wish he were like Zidane.<br><br>Chelsea played well and with excellent spirit. They never say die but defence was rather suspect and let down by Barca's quick passing. I noticed how easily there were undone by Ronaldinho, Messi, Deco etc.<br><br>Some inferences:<br><br>1) Cannot beat Chelsea in the air. Sending crosses into their penalty box will get nowhere. But with quick passing, they would be unsettled.<br><br>2) Lampard scored a wonder goal. Amazed even his critics like me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> He's a key player for Chelsea and was, for England. If he rediscovers such form for England, I'll have no complaints.<br><br>3) It is part of Drogba's game (even Robben) to go down on the slightest of touches. Well, I won't overlook that Barca does it too, esp Deco. Sham.<br><br>4) Drogba is a very special player. He's got that x-factor on the field. He is seldom injured, very very fit and Chelsea's chances will depend on his form.<br><br>5) Chelsea to hit q-finals at the very least. Semis highly likely once again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BARCELONA, October 31 (Champions League) - Didier Drogba rescued a dramatic point for Chelsea with an equaliser in the third minute of stoppage time.<br><br>The Ivory Coast international striker pounced for his 10th of the season just when Jose Mourinho's team seemed to have been sunk by old boy Eidur Gudjohnsen.<br><br>Mourinho had poked fun at Gudjohnsen on the eve of the game - but the Icelander answered with a goal in the 58th minute.<br><br>It looked like being the winner until Drogba slid the ball under Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes in the final moments.<br><br>Deco had fired the European Cup holders into an early lead but Frank Lampard equalised with a fantastic chip from the tightest of angles.<br><br>Mourinho's team are now virtually assured of a place in the last 16 of the competition.<br><br>It was a stormy game with 10 yellow cards - six for Chelsea - while Barcelona thought Ashley Cole should have been sent off.<br><br>Italian referee Stefano Farina appeared to show the England left-back two yellow cards in the first half - but it later emerged the first had been for Lampard.<br><br>Chelsea fell behind in the third minute when Deco dashed down the left, twisted inside onto his right foot and netted.<br><br>Mourinho had called for Farina to be strong - but he was not. He was poor.<br><br>The crowd were quick to react when Drogba made a meal of a little nudge in the back, early in the game.<br><br>Then Drogba was in the thick of it again when he bumped into Motta as the Brazilian midfielder climbed to his feet.<br><br>Motta threw himself to the floor and Rafael Marquez grabbed the Chelsea striker.<br><br>This time Drogba crashed to the turf and players rushed to the scene to jostle each other.<br><br>Referee Farina failed to take control at this point and the tension crackled away.<br><br>Ronaldinho tried to get Michael Essien sent off, claiming he had used an elbow on Gudjohnsen when he had actually caught him in the face with his wrist.<br><br>Farina was reaching into his pocket for his yellow card, a few minutes later, to book two Chelsea players for dissent.<br><br>He flashed the first yellow in the direction of Cole after giving a foul against Drogba. Lampard was standing near Cole at the time and it later emerged that he had been the one cautioned.<br><br>The booking for Lampard was his third of the competition and he will be suspended from Chelsea's next game, away to Werder Bremen.<br><br>The seriousness of the confusion became clear, 10 minutes later, when Cole mistimed a tackle on Motta and was booked.<br><br>He showed the defender a yellow card but did not produce a red - and memories of Graham Poll in the World Cup were rekindled.<br><br>Barcelona players crowded the referee to convince him that the full-back was already in the book.<br><br>Farina went to the touchline to talk to Mourinho. He came back and booked Messi, presumably for something said - but still did not show Cole a red card.<br><br>Drogba needed lengthy treatment at the start of the second half after taking a blow to the face in an aerial clash with Carles Puyol.<br><br>Valdes made another excellent save to keep out a good header from Robben, destined for the bottom corner, then made further good stops to deny Robben and Essien.<br><br>Robben fired a glorious chance over when he should have scored but Lampard levelled in the 52nd minute with a delightful piece of skill.<br><br>The England midfielder initially miscontrolled a pass from Makelele and was driven wide of goal.<br><br>It looked an impossible angle, tight to the touchline, but Lampard somehow curled a chip over Valdes and inside the back post.<br><br>Chelsea were well on top and looking for the win when Rijkaard made a change, bringing on Edmilson for Motta.<br><br>Barca were soon back in front with Ronaldinho dancing past Boulahrouz before finding for Gudjohnsen, who had the simplest of tasks to slide the ball into an open goal.<br><br>Lampard wanted a penalty for a pull on his shirt by Xavi in the 65th minute but his appeals were ignored.<br><br>Gudjohnsen's night ended early when he was stretchered off with 13 minutes left after falling awkwardly following a challenge by Ricardo Carvalho.<br><br>And after Ballack had squandered a glorious chance to pull Chelsea level, on-song Drogba found the target, with captain John Terry assisting.</div>
