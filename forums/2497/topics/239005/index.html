            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"> Liverpool hero Craig Bellamy has admitted he is not worried about speculation regarding his future at the club.<br><br>Bellamy's long-term future at Anfield has been thrown into doubt following last week's reported bust-up with team-mate John Arne Riise on a training camp in Portugal.<br><br>The Welshman put all the rumours behind him to inspire Liverpool to a memorable 2-1 win over Barcelona in midweek and he insists he is used to speculation over his future.<br><br>"I am a player who has always been linked with other clubs each season," Bellamy told the Daily Star.<br><br>"At Blackburn last year it was 'he's moving on' all that sort of stuff.<br><br>"At Newcastle I was joining a different club in every transfer window. I live with speculation.<br><br>"When you are at a club like Liverpool and are my sort of player there are always going to be stories about getting rid or bringing someone else in.<br><br>"It doesn't bother me at all, it's part of football and life.<br><br>"I am going to enjoy the moment, which I repeat is the best of my career.<br><br>"This result after all that had been said about me is right up there."<br><br>Meanwhile, Bellamy has revealed his golf-swing celebration at Camp Nou was pre-planned among the Liverpool players.<br><br>Bellamy celebrated his equaliser against Barcelona by swinging an imaginary golf club in a gesture towards the media following his reported attack on Riise with a golf club.<br><br>Bellamy said: "If any of us scored, that was the deal, I was supposed to do it straightaway, but there was a delay, because it was one of those was it in or wasn't it moments?<br><br>"I don't know about any turmoil at the club. All I can say is we have had a decent week. We were all looking forward to this game and determined that nothing would be allowed to spoil it.<br><br>"It probably sounds mad and people can write what they like, but we have a quiet group of lads here. In terms of having a laugh, the last week has been the best we've had since I joined the club.<br><br>"It brought us all closer together and maybe because we knew Barcelona were coming up, we knew we had to work for each other. It has turned out perfectly." </span></div>
