              <p>Tottenham<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"> </a>will
              turn their attentions to signing Ajax striker Klass-Jan Huntelaar once
              they have secured the transfer of Spartak Moscow's Roman Pavlyuchenko.</p>
              <p>Spurs
              agreed a deal worth around £16million with the Russian club on Tuesday
              night and are determined to add at least one more forward - with the
              Holland international top of their list - before the transfer window
              closes on Monday.</p>
              <p>Pavlyuchenko has been on Tottenham's
              wanted list throughout the summer and the Russia star has pulled out of
              Spartak Moscow's Champions League qualifier with Dynamo Kiev to
              finalise the switch.</p>
              <p>It is understood Spurs officials are in Moscow to continue talks over
              personal terms, although it is believed the 26-year-old has already
              accepted a deal worth £30,000 a week after tax.</p>

              <p>Pavlyuchenko is more or less definite &amp; will sign after the medical on this Friday as the terms have being agreed upon.</p>
              <p>As for Huntelaar, inside info said is unlikely, but we will never know.</p>
              <p>Spurs is looking at a number of other options, Ashavin deal may just come true at the last minute, <span class="MsgBodyText">Zenit is holding up for more money but Levy has placed a last offer on the table and leave it at that, now only waiting for <span class="MsgBodyText">Zenit to accept or deny.</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText"><span class="MsgBodyText">Another striker on the card is South American Falcao, term has being agreed upon and likely to be easier than Ashavin deal.</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText"><span class="MsgBodyText">On the defensive side, Corluka deal is not dead yet,firstly with the player wanted to join Spurs and 2ndly Spurs may threaten to sue Man City about the last minute pulled up.Latest is Man City is going to sign another defender and may let Corluka go.</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText"><span class="MsgBodyText">Veloso is another target,not much info on this though.</span></span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText"><span class="MsgBodyText">As for Berbatov, he is certainly leaving Spurs, the deal is <em>15 million upfront and 13 over the next two years. There are add-ons, which will be spread across his four year contract. Deal is for around 90,000 a week, but Spurs won't allow a medical or his registration to be released until at least one striker signs. </em></span></span></p>

              <p>Well Spurs is one of richest club in UK and 12th biggest football club in the world according to Forbes, here the link:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/34/biz_soccer08_Soccer-Team-Valuations_Rank.html">http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/34/biz_soccer08_Soccer-Team-Valuations_Rank.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My own summary on Spurs on UK alone:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary for Spurs in UK:</span></strong><br><br><strong>In term of valuation fifth in whole of UK &amp; 12th in the world at USD414m.</strong><br>1) ManU------------- USD1.8b<br>2) Arsenal---------- USD1.2b<br>3) Pool------------- USD1.05b<br>4) Chelsea---------- USD764m<br>5) <strong>Spurs</strong>------------ USD414m<br><br><strong>In term of revenue, also fifth in UK and 10th in the world at USD207m.</strong><br>1) ManU------------- USD394m<br>2) Chelsea---------- USD382m<br>3) Arsenal--------- USD329m<br>4) Pool--------------USD269m<br>5) <strong>Spurs</strong>---------- USD207m<br><br><strong>Growth in value, 2nd in that list in UK</strong><br>1) Pool--------------131%<br>2) <strong>Spurs</strong>---------- 70%<br><br><strong>In term of operating #, 3rd in UK and 6th in the whole world at USD64m.(Even beat Pool,Chelski, Milan , Roma etc at that)</strong><br>1) ManU------------- USD111m<br>2) Arsenal--------- USD77m<br>3) <strong>Spurs</strong>----------- USD64m</span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">So Spurs w/o CL football and only UEFA cup competition is able achieve healthy revenue as compare to the big 4, but what more impressive is the operating profit which is 3rd in the whole UK after ManU and Arsenal!</span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">But becos both ManU and Arsenal are heavily in debt, they dun have  much to spend on the transfer mkt whereas Spurs has little debt, so in reality it could afford to spend much more than them.</span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">Anyway so far Spurs the net spending for Spurs before this week was actually very low, here a summary so far created by someone else afew weeks ago , (please note that some of the figure are based on news reports and guesstimate rather than official figures) :</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText"><span class="MsgBodyText"> IN<br>Heurelho Gomes - 7m<br>Cesar Sanchez - 200k<br>John Bostock - 2m<br>Luka Modric - 16.5m<br>David Bentley - 17m<br>Giovani dos Santos - 8.6m<br><br>TOTAL - £51.3m<br><br><br>OUT<br>Radek Cerny - contract expired<br>Paul Robinson - 3.5m<br>Anthony Gardner - 2.5m<br>Younes Kaboul - 6m<br>[Pascal Chimbonda |<br>Teemu Tainio |<br>Steed Malbranque] - 17m<br>Robbie Keane - 20.3m<br><br>TOTAL - £49.3m<br><br><br>NET SPEND - £2m</span></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">Anyway , having the money and getting the player you want is 2 different thing.</span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">Some want CL football which Spurs is not in it, some clubs demand highly inflated prices for their best player (Ashavin is one example), some players demand high wages which erode the profit( Eto'o) etc.</span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">Spurs started well in the transfer mkt by strengthen the midfield but getting the defence sorted face problems with Dunne and later Corluka, then came  Keane demand for transfer when Pool stepped in with £20m for the 28y.o. and later Berbatov do likewise.</span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">Well, we have to wait whether Spurs could get their targeted players which by then allow Spurs to sell Berbatov(for £28m?).</span></p>
              <p><span class="MsgBodyText">Here one which should be done by this week, <span class="MsgBodyText"> Roman Pavlyuchenko arrives at Spurs Lodge.</span></span></p>

              <p>What I heard has already posted up there, but today I heard another conflicting info,Spurs and ManU was not in good term, some members of the Spurs' board rather make a stand against ManU for the way they try to tap Berbatov that they rather sell him to a German club than to ManU, true or not I am not sure.</p>
              <p>Anyway most info I gathered was that Spurs and ManU actually agreed on the price as in my previous post, the problem at one stage ManU could only afford £15m atm and therefore agreed to pay off the rest in instalments, so price has been agreed.</p>
              <p>But Spurs was still holding out becos there was no new striker coming in then.</p>
              <p>Some other rumours was that Barbatov was also in Monaco to settle deal ManU rep there and at same time Spurs rep was also there for Ashavin deal etc.</p>

              <p>As I said yesterday evening that Corluka deal is done as many inside sources have said, make me a bit worried becos he did play for Man City last night but according to my sources , there is no medical becos it was done weeks ago b4 Hughes pull the plug at the last minute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well now is official:</p>
              <blockquote><strong>Corluka deal agreed</strong>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>We are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with Manchester City for the transfer of Vedran Corluka to the Club.</strong></p>
              <p>The defender, 22, is an international team-mate of Luka Modric and has been capped 24 times by Croatia, playing in every match of the recent European Championships.</p>
              <p>Corluka came through the ranks at Dynamo Zagreb and after a season on loan at NK Inter Zapresic, won successive titles with Dynamo in 2006 and 2007.</p>
              <p>He left for the Premier League and Manchester City in August 2007, where he featured at right-back, centre-back and in midfield, making 41 appearances in all competitions.</p>
              <p>Corluka said: "I am delighted to be here because I am coming to a big club with great players, great ambition and also my best friend [Luka Modric] is here so it is a very happy day for me."</p>

              <p><br>ManU doesn't needs to spend the way Spurs did, Spurs is in a rebuilding state whereas ManU is already at a state where enhancement is the key, getting more players in doesn't help much for teams like ManU and Chelsea, what they need is getting one or two players to making them have that extra cutting edge, like for ManU, their urgency is to bring in a out and out striker or a striker who can drift in and out of the 12 yard box, that striker must be able to either link up play with Ronney or Treves while putting the ball into the net with deadly accuracy as non of their present strikers are capable of.</p>
              <p>as for Chelsea, their main issue is getting the most outta any given 11, to you it might have been a dream to have so many players to choose from but in reality its a nightmare, with Ballack, Deco, Lampard, J Cole, Malouda, Essien, Mikel Obi, Kalou, competing for the 4 midfield places and a supporting striker/ attacking midfielder role, its going to be headache every week the team play.. </p>
              <p>if ManU is capable of putting out 2 sets of 1st 11 during their hey day, today's Chelsea would be capable of putting out 3 sets of  1st 11 and still capable to be competiting for the title...  </p>
