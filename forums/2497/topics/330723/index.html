              <p><strong>AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti is hanging to
              his job by a thread after lengthy crisis talks at the club on Monday afternoon.</strong></p>
              <p>Ancelotti and the board were locked in talks for two and a half hours following
              the Rossoneri's second successive defeat on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The former Juventus coach gave little away about the meeting amid speculation
              that he could be set for the axe as he left the club after the meeting.</p>
              <p>''We had a reunion to find the most fitting coaching solution,'' he said. ''Did
              we find it? Yes.''</p>
              <p>Among the people present at the meeting were vice-president Adriano Galliani,
              technical director Leonardo, general director Ariedo Braida, chief medic Jean
              Pierre Meersseman and athletic coach Daniele Tognaccini.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti has been in the hotseat at Milan for seven years, and has led them to
              a host of trophies including the Scudetto, the Coppa Italia and two Champions
              League titles - the last of which came as recently as 2007.</p>
              <p>Galliani had given Ancelotti a vote of confidence following the 2-0 defeat at
              Genoa, which left the Serie A giants rock-bottom of Serie A with no points from
              their opening two games.</p>
              <p>The Milan chief was adamant the club was not considering a change of coach.</p>
              <p>''Ancelotti will remain the coach of AC Milan,'' he said. ''I will not say it
              again and not because I will change my mind about this but rather because it
              becomes repetitive.</p>
              <p>''I dont want to hand any excuses but up to now we haven't had time to train
              together as a team due to many of our players having had to play for their
              respective national teams.</p>
              <p>''Now we have three weeks to ourselves and we must continue to work hard.''</p>
              <p>The Rossoneri will have little time to rest as they begin their UEFA Cup
              campaign on Thursday when they host FC Zurich, before welcoming early Serie A
              table-toppers Lazio to the San Siro three days later.</p>

              <h1>Milan Crisis Intensifies As Pirlo Suffers Injury Blow</h1>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/27994_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="184"></p>
              <h2>Milan have been dealt another major blow in midfield after Andrea
              Pirlo went down with a muscular injury during Tuesday morning’s
              training session.</h2>
              <p>The Rossoneri are already without Gennaro Gattuso and it is highly
              likely that Pirlo will be ruled out from Milan’s UEFA Cup clash with
              Zurich on Thursday night.</p>
              <p>The extent of the player’s injury is not yet known but the club have
              released a statement confirming he will under go further examinations
              on Friday morning.</p>
              <p>"Milan announces that Andrea Pirlo sustained an injury to his right
              leg this morning and he will be examined further on Friday," read a
              statement on the club’s official website.</p>
              <p>Although it is not known how long Pirlo will be out, reports in
              Italy suggest it will be several weeks. Carlo Ancelotti did not need
              this latest set-back given all the recent problems at the club.</p>
              <p>Emerson or Cardacio are likely to come in for the injured star.
              Milan will be hoping to progress against Zurich. Any slip up could
              signal the end of Ancelotti’s days in charge.</p>
              <p>The club cannot afford to lose or they will be eliminated from the competition.</p>

              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">AC Milan have been rocked by the news midfielder Andrea Pirlo's injury is more serious than first thought.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The Italy international could be out of action
              for up to two months after tests on Friday revealed a significant
              injury to his right thigh.</p>
              <p>Pirlo, 29, sustained the injury during Tuesday's training
              session and missed the Rossoneris midweek UEFA Cup clash against FC
              Zurich.</p>
              <p>A statement from the club read: "Andrea Pirlo underwent tests
              today in Milan and the results have shown a complex muscular injury in
              his right thigh.</p>
              <p>"The recovery period has been set at 45 to 60 days."</p>
              <p>The injury almost certainly rules him out of Italy's World Cup qualifiers against Bulgaria and Montenegro next month.</p>
