              <p>United host <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/clubs/liverpool">Liverpool</a></abbr> tomorrow at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Instead of building on their second-placed finish last term, <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/clubs/liverpool">Liverpool</a></abbr> have crumbled, not even certain to claim a Champions League spot.</p>
              <p>Not that Ferguson is entirely surprised.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes you peak with a particular team and it is difficult to do it 
              again," said Ferguson. "Everyone expected <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/clubs/liverpool">Liverpool</a></abbr> to do better. But they are not.</p>
              <p>"Their challenge, along with quite a few others, is to get that fourth 
              spot, which seems to be a league of its own." he said that with a laugh.</p>

              <p>seriously, if U view it as an unbiased football fan, then U would see some truth in it, rather than getting emotional.</p>
              <p>In this article, (if U want to talk about Gerrard, later), he mentioned Pool peaking last season when they got the best chance to win the title, with only 2 loses in the entire season.</p>
              <p>but instead of building on that, they sold Xabi, and now, fighting to even get 4th. What's wrong with that?</p>
              <p>And lastly, why you get all pissed up with the mind games, it is part and parcel of the game. The reporters interview him, take the most juicy part, magnified it, and those read it, without processing, jump. So what are you?</p>
              <p>Now, Gerrard. Yes, SAF did not get banned for going after Wiley. However, he got warnings.  Given his position as a Sir, and his achievements, he got off lightly. Now, abit unfair you may say, and I agree.</p>
              <p>For Gerrard, the two incidents the V Sign and the elbow, everyone saw it. But does it means whether the ref saw it or not, the English FA can choose whether to act or not?  In SAF's case, he is going after the English FA, the system, for inconsistentcy,and indirectly Gerrard. Rio got a 3 match ban (ignore the extra1), for hitting Fagan, fair, and square. why not Gerrard? Whether the ref saw or not, it is a hit. no?</p>
              <p>Well, I just giving you my opinion, and yes, I am a MU Fan. So i may be defending or just laying the cards on the table.</p>

              <p>just to let you know, i too agree that gerrard should be given a ban. he did did wrong things too. who doesn't right. about rio, yes he gotten a 3 match ban. but my point is, if rio didn't get the 3 match ban, would SAF now, criticise the FA?</p>
