              <p><span>Comolli's influence over the club has grown steadily since his arrival on Merseyside, shortly after being appointed by Liverpool owner John W Henry's Fenway Sports Group. </span></p>
              <p><span>His initial role was to oversee transfers, but has now been placed in charge of all football strategy at the club. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Comolli, who has previously scouted for Arsenal, had performed a similar role for Tottenham, before becoming the sporting director at Saint-Etienne.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>He became a target for fans at White Hart Lane as the club slid to the bottom of the Premier League before leaving along with coach Juande Ramos in October 2008. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, he has always defended his record and Spurs are now seeing the benefits of him signing the likes of Gareth Bale, Aaron Lennon and Tom Huddlestone.</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool owner Henry said of Comolli's appointment: 'In the short time that Damien has been at the club, he has impressed us greatly with his knowledge of the sport, his work ethic and his incisive intelligence. </span></p>
              <p><span>'He is a clear thinker and understands exactly what is needed to form a long-term, consistent approach with the philosophy we all share here.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He has a track record of identifying young talent and has already made significant contributions to the first team and academy.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>'Damien played a leading role in our January transfer window activity with the recruitment of Luis Suarez and Andy Carroll. These two additions will play a significant role in the future of the club.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'All of us at Liverpool Football Club who have been working on a day-to-day basis with Damien believe he will be a key contributor for many, many years here as we build a football operation second to none.</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool have confirmed also the appointment of Ian Ayre as managing director which means the only major appointment now outstanding is that of manager, with Kenny Dalglish only brought in by FSG as an interim measure until the end of the season in the wake of Roy Hodgson's departure.</span></p>
              <p><span>Such has been the success of the club icon not only in effecting results on the field but changing the atmosphere off it that it is inconceivable the 60-year-old Scot will not be offered a more permanent deal.</span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish will not need any persuading to remain in the role in which he believes he has unfinished business, having walked out 20 years ago last month.</span></p>
              <p><span>It seems likely Henry and Werner will try to tie up the loose ends of that deal before the end of the campaign in order to provide the stability required for rebuilding in the summer. </span></p>
