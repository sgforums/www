              <p><em>Jose: Back to work with Inter or AC.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho expects to be in employment by the end of the month, with Italy his most likely destination. The former Chelsea manager has been sitting on an offer from Internazionale for several weeks now and may also be considered for a position at AC Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>'In one more week or two all the leagues will be over,' Mourinho said. 'In one week or two the clubs will clarify their futures. In one week or two I will have a club and in one month or so I will be working. I don't know where, but I'm sure that I am going to work.'</p>
              <p>Inter are in danger of losing their Serie A title to Roma today, a fate that would end Roberto Mancini's reign as coach, while Milan are considering dispensing with Carlo Ancelotti should they fail to qualify for next season's Champions League.</p>
              <p>Mourinho had been keen to return to former employees Barcelona, discussing the position with club directors before president Joan Laporta elected to promote Pep Guardiola from within. There was also interest from Real Madrid when the Spanish champions were pondering replacing Bernd Schuster.</p>
              <p>While an initial approach from Manchester City was immediately rejected by Mourinho's advisors, a second agent working on the club's behalf has made another attempt to secure the Portuguese's signature. Paris Saint-Germain have also gone public with an ambitious plan to bring Mourinho to France regardless of their troubles as they just avoided relegation from Le Championnat. Mourinho is understood to be reluctant to work in either country at this point in his career.</p>

              <p>If he goes to AC Milan, the job would be easier... If he goes to Inter, I think a little harder... But either job won't be too difficult to get them into top 4 for the CL next season...</p>
              <p>Although at Inter, he must win the title as Mancini has won them the last 3 so anything less than that would be seen as a failure i guess...</p>

              <p>since mancini is persuaded to stay during the lost to liverpool in UCL. i dont think he will be sack at the end of season when they won the scudetto.</p>
              <p>i doint think real fans will appreciate the effective football thate he is famous for rather than the beautiful game that the real fans appreciate.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea angry as reports link Frank to Inter</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05/19/article-1020562-0134F7F700000578-266_233x479.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="479"></p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea's preparations for the Champions League Final were thrown into chaos on Monday night by claims that Frank Lampard has agreed a four-year deal with Inter Milan. Both Chelsea and Lampard's representatives denied the story was true, with one Stamford Bridge official dismissing it as "fantasy".</strong></p>
              <p>But newspapers in Italy insist they have received unofficial confirmation from Inter owner Massimo Moratti, the suggestion being that Lampard will arrive once former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been confirmed as their new coach.</p>
              <p>A well-placed insider claimed a deal has been agreed directly between Moratti and Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and that Lampard will join for £8million, with a salary of £6m a season.</p>
              <p>Inter have just secured the Serie A title for the third year in a row under Roberto Mancini but Mourinho seems to be in the background. Chelsea officials reacted with incredulity when they touched down in Russia on Monday night. Peter Kenyon, the Stamford Bridge chief executive, denied there was any truth in the reports, as did other directors.</p>
              <p>Lampard's agent Steve Kutner insisted his client's focus did not extend beyond Wednesday evening's Champions League Final against Manchester United. He also questioned how Lampard would have found the time to conduct such negotiations when he has had to deal with the loss of his mother, Pat.</p>
              <p>"There is no substance to these claims," Kutner told Sportsmail. "It's simply not true. I have an excellent relationship with Inter Milan, and indeed Massimo Moratti, after taking Paul Ince there. But I have had no conversations with them about this and I can't understand where this is coming from.</p>
              <p>"After Frank has played in the final and then returned from England duty, he will go away with his family. And after that we will have a discussion about football and I will then go and talk to Peter Kenyon about football."</p>
