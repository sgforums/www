            <div class='col-md body'>yes, the 1999 team can beat today's team 3-0, 4-0 any day.<br><br>Ryan Giggs at his peak could outsmart Cristiano. the partnership of Yorke and Cole was even more lethal than Tevez and Rooney. Jaap Stam was a far more solid rock than Rio Ferdinand, and not to mention Scholes at his peak, evergreen old bird Teddy Sheringham and the super-sub Solksjaer.<br><br>they were brilliant, and one of the reasons why a Treble 1999 DVD sits in my collection even though i'm not a Man United fan.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its not that the class of 99 is that fantastic compared to the players now of 2007/8. if u look at the others teams during 99, who could really challenge united? arsenal? maybe.. then? liverpool? chelsea? leeds? eat my shits..<br><br>the gap between man united and other big clubs are getting smaller. they are good now but at any other day, the likes of chelsea and liverpool can really give man utd a run of their money. and lets not forget the likes of villas, everton, pompey, spurs, man c who have all improved greatly the past couple of years. its a different story from then and now.<br><br>uh.. and 1 more thing.. so how many times did man utd beat traditional european powerhouse? how good is utd faring against the likes of barcelona, real madrid, ac milan etc? can't remember? that's bcos they are lucky to avoid them usually.. not that they have beaten them most of the times.<br><br>man united for treble? eat my shits again. dream on devils.</div>

And certainly more difficult than the last few EPL seasons i would say... as they only won the title on the final day beating Tottenham Hotspur 2 - 1. Tell me how many championships was won on the final day easy? The pressure, the tension and the mental strain from the last 2 months of the season certainly can't be easier than when they won it with 6 points last season right.<br><br>Arsenal's 2004 title was won with 11 points from the 2nd placed team, Chelsea even better, 12 points in 2005. These would more probably qualify as easy wouldn't you agree as they didn't have any pressure place on them week in week out towards the end of the season... We have seen what these pressure done to teams... Noticeably Chelsea, last season they were defending champions, they won their title by 8 pts in the previous season, then spend another $80m pounds on new players for last season but when place under pressure for the first time, players as well as their coach breakdown... Its not easy, sometime you can do it and sometimes you can't.<br><br>The 1999 Premier League season was a very tense one, one Alex Ferguson described as the hardest of the 3. They became the first and only English team to win The Treble - the Premiership, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in the same season. And if it was so easy, to date it has only been done once, they can't do it again the following yrs with the same team, even the great Liverpool team of the 70s and 80s couldn't manage it.<br><br>Their FA Cup win wasn't just about a Ryan Giggs wonder goal against Arsenal in the semi-finals. They even had to play 2 replays and I guess many are probably not aware that they went through their qualifying matches playing most of the premiership big teams in the form of Middlesbrough 3rd rd, Liverpool 4th rd, Fulham 5th rd, Chelsea 6th Rd Home, Chelsea 6th Rd (Replay) Away, Semi-final Arsenal, Semi-final Arsenal (Replay)... Only then do they meet Newcastle United in the Final. So you can see it certainly wasn't as easy as some would like to think...<br><br>Then the Champions League... I belief many just remember that they beat  Inter and Juventus along the way to the title but i guess many have forgotten or are not aware that they were in a qualifying group along with FC Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Brondby... and only the top 2 would progress. And they made it through from that "group of death" group.<br><br>The then Barce had players like Rivaldo and Luis Enrique...  Juve had World Cup winner Zinedine Zidane at the height of his game in their ranks and also others like Filippo Inzaghi... So you can tell it wasn't so simple coming through these matches.<br><br>Winning the Treble was never easy, Players don't get enough rest, suspensions, miss players for important finals... They played their CL final without their 2 central midfielders Scholes and Keane. But they had to overcome all these. They played their last EPL match on a Sunday, 6 days later they were playing in the FA Cup final... and 4 days later the Uefa Champions League Final... with not much rest in between for the players like Schmeichel, Beckham, Giggs, Johnsen, Yorke &amp; Cole.<br><br>Dreaming is part of sports... If you don't dream, then you probably have no ambition at all. Its not easy, it never is or was... and probably not many will achieve it in a lifetime But i guess Fergie didn't started out 1999 thinking he would be able to do it but as the season went on... He probably started dreaming and I guess we all can say his dreams did come true afterall in 1999.<br><br></div>

              <p>manutd are typically realists. If they know they are not going to win the league title, they give up fighting 100%. That's why whenever another team wins the league title, they usually have at least a 5 points cushion.</p>
              <p>Chelsea and arsenal like to fight till the end. They never give up. Probably they know manutd are the domineering team over the decades and they will do anything to stop them.</p>
              <p>liverpool always give up halfway thro the league campaign.</p>

              Sulley Muntari entered Portsmouth folklore by securing a famous 1-0
              victory at Old Trafford and a place in the FA Cup semi-finals at
              Wembley.
              <p>The
              Ghana midfielder ended Manchester United's dream of winning the treble
              for the first time in nine years with a penalty 13 minutes from time to
              end years of hurt at the ground for Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>The last time
              Pompey won at Old Trafford was in 1957 and they have endured seven
              successive defeats since - the last one as recently as January.</p>

              <p>United
              will wonder how they lost this match - which they finished with 10 men,
              after replacement goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak was sent off for bringing
              down substitute Milan Baros.</p>
              <p>They dominated possession and almost
              went ahead in the fifth minute when Paul Scholes got on the end of a
              free-kick from Nani, only to head wide at the near post.</p>
              <p>Cristiano
              Ronaldo thought he had won a penalty a minute later when he was bundled
              over by Sylvain Distin, but referee Martin Atkinson allowed play to
              continue.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth were keeping a close eye on Ronaldo and Papa Bouba Diop was booked for dragging his opponent back in the 10th minute.</p>
              <p>The visitors broke out of their slumber six minutes later, when Niko Kranjcar tested goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar from distance.</p>
              <p>United
              almost took the lead in the 19th minute when Carlos Tevez got clear,
              after Wayne Rooney latched onto a pass from Wes Brown, but the
              Argentinian striker saw his shot superbly headed off the line by Glen
              Johnson.</p>
              <p>United kept up the pressure and Scholes turned quickly
              in the 28th minute but saw his effort blocked by Portsmouth captain Sol
              Campbell.</p>
              <p>Tevez worked an opening for himself four minutes later and fired in a shot that David James did well to parry.</p>
              <p>Lassana Diarra was then booked for a challenge on Ronaldo as United maintained the momentum.</p>
              <p>Nani tried to pick out Rooney, but Distin was alert to the danger and made a timely interception in the 41st minute.</p>
              <p>Distin again stood tall in the 44th minute to head the ball to safety following a fine cross from Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson made a surprise switch at half-time, with Kuszczak replacing van der Sar.</p>
              <p>There
              was a scare for Portsmouth in the 49th minute when James flapped at a
              cross from Tevez, but he recovered in time to prevent Nani getting in a
              shot.</p>
              <p>Nani was coming more into the game and sent a powerful
              effort into the goalkeeper's body two minutes later, after being
              released by Rooney.</p>
              <p>Then Rooney was wasteful after Ronaldo had picked him out - sending a shot high into the crowd.</p>
              <p>With Kanu out of luck, Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp replaced him with Baros after 55 minutes.</p>
              <p>United almost went in front three minutes later when Nemanja Vidic powered in a header from Nani's corner.</p>
              <p>But Tevez made an accidental block and Ronaldo fired his effort wide after the ball had been only partially cleared.</p>
              <p>Play
              switched back down the other end and Baros got away from Owen
              Hargreaves in the 61st minute but was adjudged to have strayed offside.</p>
              <p>Substitute
              Michael Carrick should have put United ahead in the 69th minute when he
              eluded James - but just as he was about to tap in, Distin made a vital
              tackle on the line.</p>
              <p>United came within inches of taking the lead in the 73rd minute when Evra's shot came back off the post.</p>
              <p>A minute later Campbell headed away a cross from Nani as Portsmouth again found themselves on the back foot.</p>
              <p>But
              the game took a dramatic turn in the 77th minute when Portsmouth were
              awarded a penalty after Kuszczak tripped Baros, who had been released
              by Kranjcar.</p>
              <p>The Polish goalkeeper was sent off and Rio Ferdinand took his place between the posts.</p>
              <p>Although
              the defender correctly guessed the direction of Muntari's spot-kick, it
              was superbly placed in the right-hand corner and earned Portsmouth an
              unlikely victory.</p>

              <p>Its all about luck. Man Utd had lotsa of it during that season. And even last season when they won the EPL. But then again in sports, you always need luck, its only how much.</p>
