I have spoken with him a lot in these past years and there has always been great confidence on my part.<br><br>"As I said in yesterday's press conference, I'm convinced he will return to being the great champion he was. He has to do his bit, and we will also do more to help him. Together, we can do a lot."<br><br>Earlier in the week, Adriano refused to move to the likes of Parma or Lazio, or to England, on loan, and the general opinion is that this is Inter's response.<br><br>However, that the player will not be Cup-tied, and thus be a lucrative winter target for top clubs, might just have played a part too.</div>
