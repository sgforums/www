              <p class="article">The
              Fratton Park club has finally admitted defeat in its long-running fight
              for survival and met with Premier League chiefs yesterday to inform
              them of their decision.</p>
              <p class="article">Andrew Andronica from
              administrators Harper Young has already been lined up to move in
              tomorrow to try to settle debts of more than £70million, including £18m
              owed to the taxman.</p>
              <p class="article">Once Pompey's controversial
              move is confirmed, the Premier League will convene a board meeting and
              then deduct nine points from their paltry total of 16, leaving them
              with only seven and so doomed to the dreaded drop.</p>
              <p class="article">A
              fire-sale of players is likely to follow in the summer with the
              administrators considering appointing a top agent - possibly Kia
              Joorabchian or Pini Zahavi - to oversee the clearout.</p>
              <p class="article">Speculation
              that three parties were interested in riding to the rescue was
              exaggerated and all hopes of finding new owners to take over from
              Balram Chainrai have evaporated.</p>
              <p class="article">Other attempts
              to refinance the club's huge debts and to raise new capital, including
              negotiating a £10m loan from West Ham's new owner David Gold, also
              collapsed.</p>

              <h1>Portsmouth docked nine points as administration plunges cash-strapped Premier League towards relegation<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Portsmouth have been sucked down the Premier League plughole after they are docked nine points for going into administration.</p>
              <p>The
              cash-strapped club have been unable to find a new buyer and
              administration will see them plummet down to just SEVEN points - all
              but confirming their relegation to the Championship.</p>
              <p>A
              statement on the club's website revealed the club entered
              administration at 10.20am. The administrators will hold a press
              conference at 3pm.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Dark clouds: Fratton Park could soon be hosting Championship football</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Under-fire chief executive Peter Storrie has said he will tender his resignation when the administrators sell the club.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth
              will be left 17 points from safety with just 12 games remaining this
              season. Andrew Andronikou, of Hacker Young, will be installed as chief
              administrator, triggering a meeting of the Premier League board early
              next week to ratify the nine-point deduction.</p>
              <p>The winding-up process started by HM Revenue and Customs, due before the High Court next week, will be suspended automatically.</p>

              <p>Pompey must enter a Company Voluntary Agreement for unsecured
              creditors by the end of the season or start next season with another
              deduction of at least 15 points.</p>
              <p>The new reality will start when the players fly on budget airline Flybe for ï¿½47.99 each to the game at Burnley tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Yet, the 112-year-old club have a better chance of survival, with four potential buyers circling, waiting for administration.</p>
              <p>Owner Balram Chainrai, who was persuaded to invest £17million by
              predecessor Ali Al Faraj, has agreed to keep funding the club and pay
              for administration.</p>
              <p>'Having the club wound up is not an
              option as far as we're concerned,' said spokesman Phil Hall. 'The
              partners have put £17m into the club and have a responsibility to
              ensure Portsmouth FC survive.'</p>

              </div>
              <p>Some finance experts believe the administrator may have to terminate player contracts now to save cash.</p>
              <p>Simon
              Wilson, partner of restructuring experts, Zolfo Cooper, said: 'It seems
              certain that Portsmouth will be relegated and will need a complete
              restructure.</p>
              <p>'Depending on the level of committed funding
              available the administrator may need to terminate players' contracts to
              reduce outgoings because the possibility of selling players outside of
              the transfer window has already been denied by the Premier League.'</p>

              <p>Meanwhile, FIFA are set to discuss Portsmouth's plight at their next executive committee meeting on March 18.</p>
              <p>Today's news was expected after eight days which signalled the club's
              fate. Last Thursday they asked the Premier League for permission to
              sell players outside the transfer window, which was rejected two days
              later.</p>
              <p>On Sunday chief executive Peter Storrie revealed a South
              African consortium were pursuing a deal to Portsmouth - but nothing
              came of it.</p>
              <p>Current owner Balram Chainrai confirmed the club
              would go into administration if they did not find a buyer by today -
              and despite New Zealand-based businessman Victor Cattermole admitting
              his interest in buying the club, a deal was not done in time.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/26/article-1253961-0871B2B9000005DC-622_306x446.jpg" alt="Portsmouth" width="306" height="446">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>High times: Pompey won the FA Cup in 2002</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Chainrai's spokesman, Phil Hall, said: 'He hasn't made a penny out
              of the club. He was asked in October to put in £17m as a loan, for six
              weeks, and he agreed to do that.</p>
              <p>'At the end of six weeks he
              expected his money to be returned and that didn't happen. He gave them
              a bit of a grace period but the loan wasn't repaid so in January he
              took over the shares of the club. He put another £2m in this week to
              make sure the staff were paid.'</p>
              <p>Asked how Pompey ended up in
              administration, Hall continued: 'The club's debt is too great. He
              (Chainrai) was also given false promises when he came in. He was told
              the club had certain debts but didn't know that Premier League rules
              say football debts become a priority, that money owed on transfers must
              be paid first.</p>
              <p>'He asked the questions and was given answers and
              assurances that turned out not to be true. Having put £17million of his
              own money in unfortunately he found the club<br>facing a winding-up order on Monday.</p>
              <p>'He
              had a choice of allowing the club to go into administration, for
              someone to go in and try to bring it back into a stronger financial
              position. He feels he's a victim - the club have been overwhelmed by
              these debts and he is a reluctant owner.'</p>
              <p>However, Hall believes there could be a satisfactory outcome for Chainrai and the club.</p>
              <p>He
              added: 'He's been left holding the baby but he wants to do what's
              right...he feels this is the right solution. Buying a business with a
              huge debt around its neck is not an attractive proposition - but there
              are parties who say they are interested. Some of them may be interested
              if they are on a stronger financial footing.'</p>

              <p>They were sold to a wrong Sheik! Imagine if Man City's owner bought Portsmouth instead, they wouldnt be in this situation.</p>
              <p>I doubt Portsmouth will survive the drop. The players would now worry about not getting their pay and thus, affected in the play field.</p>

              <p>Get themselves 9 points deducted for entering adminstration, i.e. failure to keep control of the financial status of the club, thus letting it spiral out of control and hence the debt keep increasing. Since no one wants to invest in Portsmouth, bo bian have to hire adminstrators to help keep the debt under control, which is why it is called adminstration.</p>
              <p>First time happening to a Premier League club, although down at the Championship and League One/Two such occurences are common. Read Crystal Palace 09/10, Southampton 08/09, Leeds 07/08 for some of the examples of teams who have entered adminstration as well.</p>
