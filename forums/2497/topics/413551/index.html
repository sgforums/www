              <p class="imageCaption">Out of sorts: Striker Torres</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Roy Hodgson admitted yesterday he fears a Manchester United bid for Fernando Torres as Liverpool brace themselves for the repercussions of Wayne Rooney's imminent Old Trafford departure.</strong></p>
              <p>In a stance that will alarm Anfield fans, the Liverpool boss passed up the chance to fire an early warning to United counterpart Sir Alex Ferguson and effectively confirmed that Torres will be one of the main candidates to replace Rooney when the January transfer window opens.</p>
              <p>Asked about speculation that Liverpool's £21million record signing tops Ferguson's wanted list, Hodgson said: 'I think we will cross that bridge when we come to it. There will always be speculation.</p>
              <p>'When a great player like Wayne Rooney is looking to leave his club, then you know Manchester United will be in a position to target a lot of players around the world. I don't think Fernando will be the only striker they target - and I don't think we will be the only club worried that their striker is in their sights.</p>
              <p>'I am not naive enough to believe that there won't be any danger and we will never lose a player like Torres. I understand these things can happen. I don't believe we will lose him. </p>
              <p>'We will do our best to ensure he stays and I only hope I can do everything in my power to help him return to the very top level. I certainly hope he will get back to that sort of form very quickly.'</p>
              <p>The prospect of Kop idol Torres joining rivals United would cause huge ructions among Liverpool fans desperate for an upturn in fortunes.</p>
              <p>In the wake of Hodgson's shock admission, Ferguson may just be starting to think he could pull off one of the most audacious transfer coups of his Old Trafford reign.</p>
              <p>The Spain striker has fallen well short of his previously prolific output this season and has looked out of sorts in a Liverpool side struggling in 19th place in the Barclays Premier League with just six points from eight games.</p>
              <p>The quest to rediscover his lethal touch will not be concluded here in Naples tonight, following Hodgson's decision to leave the Spaniard behind, along with Steven Gerrard, Raul Meireles and Lucas.</p>
              <p>In a frank analysis that risks further alienating Liverpool fans, Hodgson virtually confessed to writing off his side's latest Europa League game in favour of ensuring a strong starting line-up against Blackburn at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
              <p>'Steven and Fernando were both ok with my decision,' he said. 'They would both want to play if I asked them, but we have to prioritise. Players like Gerrard and Torres are very important for us over a long season, and with a hugely important game on Sunday, I'm of the opinion that it is better to save them for that and give others responsibility.</p>
              <p>'My decision is straightforward. We have four points in the Europa League already and have four games to get the six more points I feel we need to quality. I totally agree we need a win, but we need a win on Sunday more. I don't want Gerrard and Torres to be tired from their exertions here so they cannot perform on Sunday.</p>
              <p>'If we lose tomorrow night and people say that's because I was sacrificing this game, then I will hold my hands up and say they are right.'</p>
              <p>Hodgson appears to be walking a tightrope just three months into his Anfield reign and the balancing act became all the more difficult yesterday following Christian Purslow's resignation from the board, the man who appointed Hodgson. The clamour for Dalglish to return is growing inside and outside the club and ready-made replacement Frank Rijkaard's departure from Turkish side Galatasaray. </p>

              <p>stupid thinking. at least field a strong team for this match if can win why not?</p>
              <p>worst is if they rest players now and still lose against Blackburn, which is a very real chance. then Hodgson really no face.</p>
              <p>Blackburn is not that easy a team to beat. </p>

              <p>Maybe Chelsea will buy him and partner with Rooney... lol.</p>
              <p>I read Roman is a big fan of his and tried to get him before the season started only for Roy to persuade him to stay back cos they are very serious in challenging with proved when Joe Cole arrived...</p>
