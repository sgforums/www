              <p><strong>Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini last night flew home from his club's pre-season tour of America to be at the bedside of his gravely ill father in Italy.</strong></p>
              <p>Mancini was preparing to take training in Baltimore on Friday afternoon ahead of Saturday's final friendly game against Inter Milan when he heard his father Aldo had been rushed in to intensive care. </p>
              <p>The exact nature of Aldo's condition is not known but the 74-year-old is clearly unwell enough for his son to head straight to the family home in Ancona. Coaches Brian Kidd and David Platt will now take charge of tonight's game against the European champions before the whole squad return to England in the early hours.</p>
              <p>It is not yet known whether Mancini will return to City in time for the club's game in Dortmund next week.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Adam Johnson has admitted he was starstruck when he was first called up to Fabio Capello' s England squad but now claims he is ready to be part of a new dawn for his country.</p>
              <p>The City winger (right), who says he wants to play like Holland star Arjen Robben, revealed that he was devastated not to go to South Africa but that he is now only looking forward.</p>
              <p>Johnson said: 'On the way to joining up with the England squad for the first time it was a nerve-wracking, with all the world-class players there.</p>
              <p>'After a couple of days, I settled in well and I knew a few of the lads from City, so it was nice to have them show me the ropes. Making my debut was the highlight of my career so far. I missed out on the World Cup. I was devastated but that has gone now so maybe it is a fresh start for everybody.'</p>
