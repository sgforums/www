              Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung is set to complete a Â£5 million switch to Queens Park Rangers reports suggest, although figures vary.
              
              Park, 31, played a reduced role for Manchester United last season, but has been an influential figure in the club's recent history, often being called upon on the biggest occasions.
              
              Formerly captain of South Korea, Park joined the Red Devils for Â£4 million in 2005 from PSV Eindhoven and has gone on to make 205 first-team appearances for the Old Trafford side.
              
              QPR have announced that a press conference for local and international media will take place on Monday, with chairman Tony Fernandes, vice-chairman Amit Bhatia and manager Mark Hughes all set to attend. The announcement will reportedly "put the QPR brand on a global scale".
              
              The press conference could be related to the club's ongoing look for a new stadium, although reports on Friday morning also suggested that the club were closing in on a South Korean signing.
              
              "The announcement will put the QPR brand on a global scale and is further demonstration of the board's continuing efforts to move the club forward and become established in the Premier League," the release to the media said.
              
              "QPR chairman Tony Fernandes, vice-chairman Amit Bhatia, manager Mark Hughes and CEO Philip Beard will all be in attendance. Please note, the club is in no position to make any further comment on the announcement of this press conference."
              
              Should he sign, Park would become the fifth player to arrive at Loftus Road this summer - following the captures of Robert Green, Andy Johnson, Ryan Nelsen and the permanent signing of midfielder Samba Diakite.
              
              Chairman Fernandes is also heavily involved in the club's search for a new stadium, updating the fans on progress via Twitter early on Friday.
              
              "Excellent stadium meeting," Fernandes said. "Looks great. Going to make big announcement. Hopefully see Amit [Bhatia] in a few hours to brief him. Wow.
              
              "Stadium will be in west London. Will not lose overall atmosphere. Lots to do and many pitfalls but great first step."

              <p>Actually I thought £2 million is already good money considering they only paid £4 million for him and now he is 31 and going on to 32 soon.</p>
              <p>He has served United well in the last 7 years, very hardworking but he is getting lesser games last season and maybe even lesser this if he stays. So it's a good time to let him go for the club as it takes away his $70k per week salary and also for him as he gets to play more over there.</p>
              <p>But i read he will leave for £2.5m with another £2.5m if QPR stays in the premier league in May next year. Which is also a very good deal for United.</p>

              <h1>Manchester United star Park Ji-Sung to undergo QPR medical ahead of £2.5m move</h1>
              <h2>The Old Trafford giants are ready to offload their long-serving South Korea star but will only receive an extra £2.5 million if Rangers avoid relegation from the Premier League</h2>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/06/article-2169900-12D9518E000005DC-781_468x286.jpg" alt="Pedigree: Midfielder Park has won four Premier League title at Old Trafford" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption">Pedigree: Midfielder Park has won four Premier League title at Old Trafford</p>
              <br><br></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Park Ji-Sung will undergo a medical at QPR on Monday ahead of his proposed move from Manchester United which will see the Premier League giants receive an initial fee of just £2.5 million for the South Korea international.</strong></p>
              <p>Reports on Saturday suggested United would recoup £5m for the 31-year-old, who joined Old Trafford seven years ago, but <strong>Goal.com</strong> understands the Red Devils will only receive an extra £2.5m should QPR avoid relegation from the Premier League for a second consecutive season.</p>
              <p>Park, who earns £70,000-a-week at United, is in line to become the top earner at Loftus Road in a deal which will represent a significant step in helping the club’s ambitious owner Tony Fernandes turn the west London outfit into a “global” brand.</p>
              <p>The former PSV Eindhoven star, who won four Premier League titles during his time in Manchester, must still pass a rigorous medical, however, before completing the move.</p>
              <p>Park missed large portions of last season with hamstring and ankle trouble and when he was recalled to the side for the pivotal Manchester derby, having missed the previous seven matches, was way off the pace and was withdrawn with more than 30 minutes remaining of a match that effectively cost his side the title.</p>
              <p>Fernandes has invested heavily in the club since he assumed control last August, recruiting the likes of Joey Barton, Bobby Zamora and Djibril Cisse. But Park’s imminent capture represents a significant upgrade on those transfers and will certainly boost the R’s profile in the Far East, where the Malaysian businessman owns the AirAsia airline.</p>
              <p>QPR are due to play in Indonesia on July 23 as part of their pre-season preparations and Park is likely to feature.</p>
              <p>"We are still waiting for a confirmation," Indonesian Premier League spokesperson Abi Hasantoso told Goal.com.</p>
              <p>"But if the deal goes through, we believe Park will come along. It was their [QPR's] commitment to bring their best squad here."</p>
              <p>QPR have already called a press conference for Monday where they are also rumoured to be unveiling plans for a new stadium.</p>
              <p>Earlier this week Fernandes wrote on Twitter: “Excellent stadium meeting. Wow. Looks great. Going to make big announcement. Hopefully see Amit [Bhatia, vice-chairman] in a few hours to brief him. Wow.”</p>
              <p>He later added: “Stadium will be in west London. Will not lose overall atmosphere. Lots to do and many pitfalls but great first step.”</p>
