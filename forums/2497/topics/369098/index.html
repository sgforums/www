              - Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has said his decision to let striker
              Samuel Eto'o go was motivated by a feeling that is was time for a
              change and was not made for sporting or personal reasons.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spanish and European
              champions said on Friday they had agreed in principle with Inter Milan
              to swap Eto'o plus cash for Inter striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the
              conclusion of the deal depended on the players agreeing personal terms.</p>
              <p>"It's simply a matter of
              feeling. I think we have to change things," Guardiola told reporters on
              Monday, adding that it was his decision alone not to include the
              Cameroon international in his plans.</p>
              <p>"It had nothing to do with
              football strategy or any personal issue or attitude," he added. "Maybe
              I am wrong but it's my responsibility. It's my decision."</p>
              <p>Guardiola thanked Eto'o for his
              service over the past five years and said he had been a key part of the
              Catalan club's unprecedented treble last season of domestic league and
              cup and European Champions League.</p>
              <p>Eto'o's agent is due in Milan
              for talks and Inter president Massimo Moratti expects a deal to be
              reached after accepting that Sweden's Ibrahimovic wants a new challenge.</p>
              <p>"Negotiations continue, nothing
              is definite but I am confident. We hope to be able to bring another
              champion to Inter and despite the words of Guardiola, we are convinced
              of his worth," Moratti told reporters.</p>
              <p>"Ibrahimovic is a great professional and I can not forget that thanks to his goals we won scudettos (Italian championships)."</p>
              <p>Barca are not just settling for Ibrahimovic, who has also yet to sign a deal with the Catalans.</p>
              <p>Guardiola said he had spoken to
              Valencia striker David Villa, who the club have also been chasing, but
              gave no details about their conversation.</p>
              <p>He added that defenders Carles
              Puyol and Rafael Marquez would be extending their contracts and Mexican
              international Marquez was recovering well from a knee injury.</p>
