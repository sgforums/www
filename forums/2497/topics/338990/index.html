              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2008/11/29/1227988821315/Luiz-Felipe-Scolari-001.jpg" alt="Luiz Felipe Scolari" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p class="caption"><em>Luiz Felipe Scolari has said that he will take possible financial restrictions in his stride.</em></p>
              <p class="caption"> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong>, famous for being the most extravagant spenders in football, are taking increasingly severe cost-cutting measures. The moves underline Manchester City's status as the Premier League's nouveau riche, with Chelsea refusing to engage in a transfer-window battle with the Abu Dhabi-controlled club, who beat the Londoners to the record signing of Robinho, the Brazil striker, three months ago.</strong></p>
              <p>As revealed by The Observer last month, Roman Abramovich has ordered a comprehensive financial audit of every department of his club at a time when he is nursing multi-billion-pound credit-crunch losses. The first notable cost saving to date was the dismissal of 15 international scouts as Frank Arnesen's recruitment network was dismantled ahead of the expected departure of the £2m-a-year chief scout and director of youth development.</p>
              <p>The increasing restriction on cash flow at the club is such that the audit, which remains ongoing, has since halted three major capital investment projects in their tracks. These are:</p>
              <p><em></em> </p>
              <p><em>• The refurbishment of the Chelsea Health Club at Stamford Bridge.</em></p>
              <p><em>• The conversion of the stadium's 'Purple' nightclub into a music venue.</em></p>
              <p><em>• The construction of a luxurious new-build house at the club's stockbroker-belt training ground.</em></p>
              <p><em>• In their recent champions league match against Bordeaux, Chelsea players took an economy class flight to France rather than their usual business class.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em></em> </p>
              <p>Further economies under consideration include charging players for meals at the training ground. A Chelsea spokesman said: 'As all businesses concerned about the economic downturn will be doing, we are looking across the business to see where savings can be made. Costs at Stamford Bridge and the training ground are part of this ongoing review.'</p>
              <p>Diminishing income is also an issue for a club burdened by £736m of debt according to their last published accounts. Chief executive Peter Kenyon has expressed concerns over future sales of high-revenue earning hospitality boxes. Two of Stamford Bridge's 59 boxes remain unsold this season, though Chelsea say the pair have been kept free to allow 'added flexibility' in their provision. The club are having to work on ticket sales, too, and are advertising on commercial radio ahead of the decisive Champions League group game against CFR Cluj.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's belt tightening has affected player recruitment. Club officials do not expect any significant activity in the January transfer window and, if any new players are brought in, the purchases will be financed by sales. Though this was not the package <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luiz-felipe-scolari"><span style="color: #005689;">Luiz Felipe Scolari</span></a> was seduced by when he took over as manager last summer, the pragmatic Brazilian is trying to use the club's 'new reality' to unify his squad.</p>
              <p>On Friday, he warned players contemplating a move away from Chelsea, such as Didier Drogba, that other clubs might not be able to sustain their current salaries. 'I am not surprised with this new reality in the world,' he said. 'Chelsea knows this reality. Not only Chelsea, many clubs. We need to remember many clubs are down in the red line because they spend money they don't have to spend. Now is the time to think about the new philosophy for football. I know it's difficult for the players to understand this, but if they are intelligent they know.</p>
              <p>'In January, if I have something to buy one player or another, OK. If I don't have, it's not a problem for me because I have a good squad, I like this squad. Maybe some clubs want one of my players and the time is for change. I give you this and you give me that.'</p>
