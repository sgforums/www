              <h1>SEMI-EXCLUSIVE: Chelsea's Premier League title hopes in tatters as 
              Manchester United and Liverpool agree points coalition<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Chelsea's hopes of winning the Premier League have 
              been hit by rumours that Manchester United will form a points coalition with
               deadly rivals Liverpool ahead of Sunday's final matches.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
               need to beat Wigan at Stamford Bridge to clinch the crown but if 
              they fail to take three points, a Manchester United defeat of Stoke will secure a fourth successive Old Trafford 
              title.</p>
              <p>However, United and Liverpool chiefs are believed to have 
              spent last night negotiating a deal by which Rafa Benitez's side - who 
              can finish no lower than seventh - will donate two of their points to 
              United to give Sir Alex Ferguson a one-point lead and in the box seat.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/07/article-0-015236D300001005-124_468x355.jpg" alt="ferguson and benitez" width="468" height="355">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Any points going spare? Rafa and Sir Alex are at
               the centre of an alleged storm</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool's act is fraught with risk, however, as it would leave them
               just two ahead of eighth-placed Everton and needing to gain at least a 
              draw at relegated Hull to secure a Europa League place.</p>
              <p>It could 
              also rob them of credibility - however, since not winning a league title
               themselves since Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, that boat had 
              long since sailed...</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/07/article-1274287-094D2C5C000005DC-495_306x561.jpg" alt="Carlo Ancelotti" width="306" height="561">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>How could this happen? How Carlo Ancelotti might
               look if the ManLiv pact rumour had a grain of truth in it</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>An unconfirmed Anfield legend said: 'It seems incredible that we 
              would help United to a 19th title and overtake our title but they have 
              promised us a Champions League placeas well as first refusal on Dimitar 
              Berbatov, Michael Owen, David Beckham, Nicky Butt and Ben Foster so this
               represents a good deal for LIverpool FC, its supporters, players and 
              official mascots'</p>
              <p>When it was pointed out that Beckham and Butt 
              are not even United players, the legend insisted: 'That needn't matter -
               they've promised -  and it ensures the balance of footballing power 
              stays in the North-West.</p>
              <p>'And we'll still finish ahead of Everton 
              despite the fact everyone says we're rubbish'  </p>
              <p>Stamford Bridge 
              chiefs are said to be furious at the ManLiv pact and a club spokesman 
              said: 'It's incredible that a team who plays in blue and gets the most 
              points will not come out on top. Where on earth did they come up with an
               idea like that? Whatever happened to first past the post?</p>
              <p>'It
               makes a mockery of the whole system and beyond belief that a team in 
              red could win because of behind-the-scenes dealing - we will be taking 
              this matter up with our local MP.'</p>
              <p>Long-time Chelsea fan and 
              ex-local MP David Mellor was unavailable for comment because he was 
              negotiating a deal to become QPR's most high-profile celebrity supporter
               following his defection from Fulham some years ago when they were 
              rubbish.</p>
              <p>Premier League rules about teams forming points 
              coalitions are vague and Peter Scudamore - a jockey and horse trainer  
              who shares the same surname as Premier League chief executive Richard 
              Scudamore - could shed no further light on the subject - even though 
              neither man was actually asked about it.</p>

              <p>There was more prospective misery for Chelsea this morning when the 
              local borough council imposed a time limit on fans getting into Stamford
               Bridge this weekend.</p>
              <p>An unnamed source smarmed: 'The match kicks 
              off at 4pm and fans not in their seats by then will not be permitted 
              access to the ground until the next home match.'</p>
              <p>Chelsea have 
              requested an extension to allow fans caught in traffic or public 
              transport to be able to gain access to the Bridge, but local council 
              chiefs were adamant.</p>
              <p>'We cannot extend the alloted time for 
              supporters who nonetheless have valid tickets to exchange them for a 
              view of the relevant football match in question even if they are in the 
              queue by 4pm - that's the law,' he said.</p>
