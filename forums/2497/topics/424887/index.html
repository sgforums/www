              <p><span>Torres is convinced he made the right decision to leave Liverpool after the endless talk of new dawns at the club. </span><span><br></span></p>

              <p><span>He added: 'I knew I was an idol for the fans but it wasn't the same any more. The institution was in chaos with the sale. </span></p>
              <p><span>'There was all this talk of possible projects. In many ways it reminded me of Atletico Madrid - a great history, many ideas but without money, it needed time. I don't have that.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres has attempted to build bridges with the </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">fans he left behind by claiming his decision to shun the two Manchester clubs in favour of </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">proves his loyalty to the Anfield club. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The Spaniard made a British record £50million transfer deadline day switch from Merseyside in January, and made his Blues debut the following weekend against his old club.</p>
              <p>The Liverpool faithful reacted angrily to the switch, with some burning the shirt of the former terrace idol outside the club's training complex in Melwood.</p>
              <p>However Torres believes he was justified in jumping ship and actually did his best to make it as smooth a transition as possible by not joining one of Liverpool's great rivals.</p>
              <p>'I did not want to go to <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span><span style="color: #000000;"> or </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> I could never do that, out of loyalty to Liverpool,' said Torres, who was targeted by both City and United during last summer.</p>
              <p>The striker has made several attempts to explain the motives behind his move away from Liverpool after just three-and-a-half years with the club. Central to his complaints was the failure of the club to push on and win any silverware, a nagging issue for the 26-year-old who is yet to get his hands on a major trophy at club level.</p>
              <p>He continued: 'But the Liverpool I left was not the same club as the one I joined. I did not understand the path the club was following.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'It’s not as if I was the first to leave the club in the last few years. Look at [Xabi] Alonso, [Javier] Mascherano, [Alvaro] Arbeloa, [Albert] Riera, [and manager Rafael] Benitez. Some 20 or 30 left, all to improve themselves.</strong></p>
              <p>'I did not imagine leaving Liverpool but then the Chelsea train passed by and I had to catch it because of the dream I have of winning. I want to win the Premier League and I felt I had to go.'</p>
              <p>The irony, of course, came in Torres' debut when he subdued performance was bought to an end early as Liverpool nicked a 1-0 win at Stamford Bridge.</p>

              <p><strong>The nature of his performance that day has been mirrored throughout a tricky first six weeks in London, yet the World Cup winner is confident he can find his form and ultimately fire Chelsea back on the trophy hunt. </strong></p>
              <p>'The first few weeks were not easy for me,' he admitted. 'I do not know London, have spent time looking for somewhere to live and it’s all been a bit of a mess.</p>
              <p>'It's a much bigger city then Liverpool and that takes getting used to, not knowing if it will take 40 minutes to get to training or a lot longer if the traffic is bad.</p>
              <p>'But I know my best years in the Premier League are still to come. I’m sure of that. What I want to do now is settle down, be quiet, stop thinking about other things and enjoy my life.</p>
              <p>'We have the chance to win the title and the Champions League. Four weeks ago I didn’t have that and now I feel close to what I want.</p>
              <p>'All my life I have sought to win - win titles. I was lucky enough to win the World Cup but as a footballer you want to win with your club, with the players you train alongside every day.</p>
              <p>'I am away from home but Chelsea gives me the chance to achieve those goals year after year. Over the next 50 years they will be fighting United and Arsenal for trophies.'</p>

              <p><br>Not sure what happen to them, they were very good during Mourinho era though. Maybe because their team does not have the strength in depth anymore (especially in midfield) compare the old Chelsea.</p>

              <p>Let's be realistic, the competition then and today is a lot different... The emergence of City and Spurs are already a big telling point... The increased TV money enjoyed by the lower clubs especially this past few years has also made them able to purchase better quality players from Europe and Africa...</p>
              <p>Mourinho may be a great manager but I belief he will find the premier league a lot different from the one when he was winning easily at Chelsea... Back then in the transfer market, when Chelsea want a player, Chelsea get the player... But it's no longer the case today... They have to fight just as hard to get them from other clubs...</p>
              <p>One thing we may be able to credit Mourinho is, since he came, clubs like United and Arsenal have to increased their standard in order to keep up with Chelsea... And they have.</p>
              <p>As to the club Chelsea, The earlier they can be self sustainable without the use of Roman's money, that's the day they will be a big club with a future... Cos right now, they are a bit artificial cos they are not a profitable club yet so it depend a lot on Roman. They need to be a club that can generate about $40m net profit annually like Pool in order to be self reliance... And till that day come, they are still dependent on Roman. The only good thing here is, they seem to know this and are seriously working towards it and also Roman is still quite young in his early 40s... So they may still have 20 to 30 yrs who knows to get it right if Roman stay healthy and interested in football...</p>
              <p>As to Torres... I guess the guy just want to win something regularly at club level... He is 27 or coming to and yet he has got nothing to show for... His career could be over in another 3 to 5 yrs and he has to take his chance if he didn't see it happening at Liverpool...</p>

              <p><br>Chelsea was the only club interested in him during the january window?? No??</p>
              <p>ManCity may have had interest in the past but if he had a chance to choose who knows which team he will pick? Most probably Chelsea because he is hoping to win the CL, ASAP. He already said that his move from Liverpool is purely because of his professional ambition i.e. to win CL. Fair enough...</p>
              <p>I don't recall ManU interested in him post his PL move??</p>

              <p>Apprantly it was said that Chelsea and Liverpool already had negotiations very early in the transfer window for Torres to move.</p>
              <p>But it was Liverpool who clamed down the rumors to prevent Ajax to jack up the price of Luis Suarez deal.</p>

              <p>He seems to talk alot about Liverpool since he left, trying to

              <p>Could be that he is really trying to convince himself he made the right move.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He has already left and Liverpool has already moved on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So no idea why he wants to keep bringing up this topic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Well, I think it could be b'cos Liverpool have a lot of fans around the world and he don't want to come up against one in the future when he is on holiday, someone he don't even know suddenly scold him like he cheated on his sister like that... lol.</p>
              <p>It's not nice getting scold for no reason...  <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Imagine if he come to Sg on holiday during close season and stay in a hotel. I am sure there will be some Pool fans working or staying in the same hotel... lol.</p>

              <p>firstly, can you establish if he ever said this to the press or as usual, made out by the tabloid thrash.</p>
              <p>second, even if he said this, he is justifying his move to chelsea from liverpool. he should just keep his mouth shut and concentrate on his new life at chelsea.</p>
