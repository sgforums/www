              <div><br></div>
              <div>Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva believes that playing alongside Javier Mascherano has helped him improve as a player.</div>
              <p><br>Despite
              that though, he feels that however much he improves a certain section
              of his critics will never give him credit for his work on the pitch.<br><br>"I'm
              trying to improve all the time but I'm feeling good on the pitch. I
              think I've improved a lot since last season and hopefully I'll keep
              going," he told the Reds' official website.<br> <br>"I think things
              might always be more difficult for me at Liverpool, to be honest, but
              I'm trying to prove I can do well for myself and my team-mates. The
              real supporters of Liverpool know this and support me a lot.<br> <br>"When I came to Liverpool I came with a challenge of winning titles and making history for the club. Hopefully I can do that.<br> <br>"I'm
              playing almost every game now. I have a good link with Javier
              Mascherano. I understand the way he plays and he helps me a lot. I
              think it's good for the team that we can keep the balance."<br><br>And
              the Brazilian insists that Liverpool's players and fans must move on
              from their Champions League exit and focus on winning the Europa League.<br><br>"We
              have to move on. We didn't do enough to get to the next stage and so
              now we have to concentrate on the Europa League and getting into a
              better position domestically," he added.<br> <br>"We'll try to win the
              Europa League because it's still an important competition. Some good
              teams play in it and we'll try to get a title for ourselves."</p>

              <p>I think Rafa is the problem. He is too stubborn and if you noticed is not too keen on having too flair players in midfield. He prefers his midfielders to do donkey work. This restricts a lot of his players; kuyt, benayoun, babel, lucas etc.</p>
              <p>I bet these players would thrive and improve better in a club that appreciates and cultivates their natural abilities.</p>
              <p>In short, Rafa has made a lot of player under him stagnant.</p>
              <p>The exception being Torres but he is an out and out striker so Rafa allows him more freedom. And i for one, do not think Rafa made Torres into a better footballer. In fact, its because of Torres own talent that he is becoming a better striker.</p>

              <p>Ah Ben cannot handle players with flair as they will never play to his instructions.</p>
              <p>He is a very controlled minded manager so creativity will be zero under him.</p>
              <p>Benny nearly died in his hands as he was planted in the reserves all the time.</p>
              <p>But, he have used his skill to prove his worth and saved Ah Ben ass all the time.</p>
              <p>That is why Ah Ben displayed a uudden show of emotions of hugging Benny when he was substituted during the man city match.</p>
