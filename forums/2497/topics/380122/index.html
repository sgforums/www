              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Wednesday, 28 October 2009</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Time: <span style="color: #000000;">3:45 am (Thur Morning)</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Carling Cup</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>In one corner of Anfield’s Kop, they have had a banner waiting for Alberto Aquilani for some time. ‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Il Principino</span> — A Hero has Arrived’, it reads.</strong></p>
              <p>Whether Aquilani will go on to fit such weighty billing remains to be seen. But tonight in the Carling Cup at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> it seems likely that the ‘Little Prince’ — as he was dubbed in Italy — will finally arrive in a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a> first-team shirt.</p>
              <p>Signed from Roma in the summer for £20million as a replacement for the much-missed midfielder Xabi Alonso, Aquilani has slowly been recovering from an ankle injury and is expected to be only on the bench at the Emirates Stadium tonight.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, he cannot assert himself on Rafa Benitez’s team soon enough. For all the excitement of Sunday’s victory against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a>, this is a Liverpool team screaming for more genuine artistry.</p>
              <p>‘We can see in every training session that he has quality, game intelligence and good movements,’ said Benitez last night. ‘He is a different kind of player for us. We talk about using Steven Gerrard deeper sometimes, but maybe in Aquilani we have a player who can play there and pass the ball really well in the final third.’</p>
              <p>In Italy, they will tell you that Aquilani has star quality to burn. One of three home-grown players in last season’s Roma team, the 25-year-old was never as vocal or flamboyantly Roman as the other two, Francesco Totti and Daniele de Rossi.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, his importance to that team, when fit, was all-consuming. In Rome they stress he is not a like-for-like replacement for Alonso, rather a more forward-moving player in the mould of Arsenal’s Cesc Fabregas.</p>
              <p>Arsenal and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> both tried to sign him when he was 16. So did Roma’s neighbours Lazio. Juventus, meanwhile, have tried to snare him twice.</p>
              <p>Former Liverpool defender John Arne Riise, who played with Aquilani at Roma last season, said: ‘He is the perfect replacement for Alonso. He is a fantastic passer of the ball and very technical.</p>
              <p>‘He is definitely different to Xabi but he is the type of player who can break teams down. He will find space everywhere and will score goals. I expect him to do well in England.’</p>
              <p>Born and raised in the upper-middle class suburb of Monte Sacro, Aquilani had spent his entire career at Roma until he was sold in the summer to ease the club’s financial problems.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Known as a good passer and prodigious worker, he has nevertheless suffered regularly with injuries. His father Claudio was in charge of the ambulance fleet at the Olympic Stadium on matchdays and has certainly given his boy a lift home on more than one occasion.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Aquilani has blamed misdiagnosis by the Roma medical team for the ankle problem that has sidelined him this season but previously there have been problems with hamstrings and his hip.</p>
              <p>Coincidentally, his last appearance for Roma came at Arsenal in the Champions League back in March. Once again, he picked up an injury.</p>
              <p>‘It has been difficult,’ Aquilani said yesterday. ‘Now I just want to build up my confidence again and bring the best out of my game. ‘I will be very happy when I make my debut. That is what I am here to do. I really want to play but I know I have to be patient.’</p>
              <p>Aquilani was present at Anfield on Sunday as his team-mates rolled over their great rivals. He sat close to captain Gerrard and his wife Alex in the directors’ box, and the Italian has a glamorous girlfriend of his own.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Glamour girl: Aquilani's girlfriend Michela Quattrociocche</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Michela Quattrociocche is a 20-year-old Italian actress and her relationship with Aquilani came on the back of his previous dalliances with Miss World contestant Pamella Camassa and former Miss Italy Francesca Chillemi. Known in Italy as a ladies’ man with a quick wit, he has not always steered clear of controversy.</strong></p>
              <p>At the Roma training ground two years ago, he was heard to suggest to team-mate Christian Panucci that he should get himself a tattoo ‘that shows you sitting on the bench’. He took a punch on the jaw for his troubles.</p>
              <p>Equally peculiar is the rumour that he kept a marble sculpture of Italy’s former Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini at his home in Rome.</p>
              <p>Asked about it in an interview in Italian sports daily <span style="font-style: italic;">Gazzetta dello Sport</span> last year, he replied: ‘My uncle is very keen on him and he gave me something to do with Mussolini. But, as for me, I don’t know anything about politics.’</p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Living now in a city that has only ever tolerated right-wingers on the football field, Aquilani may do well to steer clear of such complicated issues as class and politics over the coming weeks. But if he can succeed on the field then nobody will care much.</strong></p>
              <p>In Rome they already lament his departure. Though they were never close friends, his fellow Roman De Rossi said recently: ‘We needed the money so nobody seems to mind. But in the months to come I can promise you we will all be sorry for this sale.’</p>
              <p>It is known that Aquilani has already started English lessons and is progressing quickly, though one respected judge believes it is not the language that will prove critical.</p>
              <p>England coach Fabio Capello gave Aquilani his Roma debut in 2003 and he said: ‘He is a very interesting player and this will prove a good moment for him to move. He will have to understand English football, though.'</p>

              <h2>Duo set to start for Gunners</h2>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Midfielder Samir Nasri and goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski could make their first appearances of the season following injury in Arsenal's Carling Cup fourth-round tie against Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>Manager Arsene Wenger is expected to again send out a mixture of experience and youth, with Philippe Senderos and veteran Mikael Silvestre likely to start in defence.</p>
              <p>Mexican forward Carlos Vela, Sanchez Watt, who scored in the last round against West Brom, Fran Merida, Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey, along with England Under-21 duo Kieran Gibbs and Jack Wilshere could all feature.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Wenger believes Ramsey can rise to the challenge and stake his claim for a regular first-team place by leading the young Gunners to victory.</p>
              <p>Ramsey will turn 19 on Boxing Day, and Wenger believes the former Cardiff trainee has come a long way since his £5million move during the summer of 2008, scoring in the 4-1 Barclays Premier League win over Portsmouth as well as playing in Europe.</p>
              <p>"If you consider he is only 18, Ramsey has developed exceptionally well,'' said the Arsenal manager.</p>
              <p>"He has made a big improvement compared to last year, when he still looked a little bit like a youth player, but now he looks like a [first-team] player.</p>
              <p>"He is really pushing hard - and the other midfielders have a lot of work to keep him out of the side because he is getting very close.</p>
              <p>"The target I set him at the start of the season was to get between 15 and 20 games this year, and I think he will get that.''</p>
              <p>Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard is out of the fourth-round tie, but should have recovered from his groin problem to play in Saturday's Barclays Premier League game at Fulham.</p>
              <p>The Reds will be without suspended midfielder Javier Mascherano, while £20million Italy international Alberto Aquilani is named in a first-team squad for the first time since his summer move, having now recovered fully from an ankle operation.</p>
              <p>Martin Kelly (ankle) and Albert Riera (hamstring) are out, while defenders Andrea Dossena and Sotirios Kyrgiakos could both figure having recovered from injuries, the latter defying an initial prognosis he could face six months out with a knee injury.</p>
              <p>Boss Rafael Benitez has made it clear Aquilani - the man he bought to replace Xabi Alonso - will begin his senior career with the Anfield club at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "He will be with us. He is improving his fitness, so he's in the squad.</p>
              <p>"He cannot start at this moment but he will be there and maybe we can give him some minutes. If it's possible, we will try to use him.''</p>
              <p>Benitez believes the Italy international will add a new dimension to his midfield.</p>
              <p>He said: "We can see in every training session that he has quality, game intelligence and good movements. He is a different kind of player for us.</p>
              <p>"We talk about using Steven Gerrard deeper sometimes, but maybe in Aquilani we have a player who can play there and pass the ball really well in the final third.''</p>

              since arriving in the summer because of ankle injury but he is finally

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">RAFA BENITEZ has challenged his Liverpool side to prove the statistics wrong at Arsenal tonight. The two teams last met in the Carling Cup at the quarter-final stage in January 2007.</h2>
              <p class="article">Julio Baptista netted four times as the Gunners claimed a 6-3 victory in front of a stunned Kop.</p>
              <p class="article">The Brazilian striker, now at Roma, became the first visiting player in 40 years to score four times in a game at Anfield — and also had a penalty saved by Jerzy Dudek.</p>
              <p class="article">Andrey Arshavin repeated the feat the last time the two met in Merseyside in the Premier League in April's 4-4 draw.</p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal were also victorious the last time the sides did battle in the League Cup in North London as they claimed a 1-0 win in October 1989.</p>
              <p class="article">In fact, Liverpool have not won in their last 11 visits to the Gunners since recording a 1-0 win at Highbury in February 2000, when Titi Camara scored the only goal of the game.</p>
              <p class="article">But Reds boss Benitez said: "This is a special competition in which you try to give opportunities to young players or players who are not playing. These things together make it difficult.</p>
              <p class="article">"The Carling Cup for the young players of Arsenal is always an extra motivation. To play away for us will be even more difficult but we have to be ready to do a job.</p>
              <p class="article">"We have to change the statistic and we will be really pleased if we win there for the first time."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER has revealed he kept tabs on Alberto Aquilani for a couple of years.</h2>
              <p class="article">Liverpool stepped in when the Gunners boss lost interest and the 25-year-old midfielder is set make his long-awaited debut for Rafa Benitez's side at the Emirates tonight.</p>
              <p class="article">Aquilani, who moved to Anfield for £20million in the summer, has been sidelined until now because of injury and, ironically, that was the reason the trail went cold for Wenger.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Yes, I know him well.</p>
              <p class="article">"He played against us in the Champions League last year and came off the bench in Rome. He is a talented player but has been troubled a lot by injuries.</p>
              <p class="article">"We followed him for one or two years but he did not play a lot last year. He got a little bit out of sight for us and we lost our interest in him."</p>

It has really been a long wait for his debut to come. Looking forward to see him perform well. My only worry is that he would be injury prone, i believe he is a good signing though.</p></div>

              <p>A young <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> side have overcome <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> 2-1 in the Carling Cup fourth round to progress to the quarter-finals.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> continued with fielding a young side for the competition despite
              Liverpool’s Rafael Benitez going with a fairly strong eleven for the
              beginning of the contest.</p>
              <p>The first goal went to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> coming from Spanish U20 Fran Merida who blasted a left-footed shot past
              Cavalieri Diego to send the 60,000-strong Emirates Stadium crowd into
              raptures.</p>
              <p>But seven minutes later, the Reds were back on even terms
              thanks to a piece of brilliance from first team regular Emiliano Insua
              who looped a 25-yard shot over Gunners goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to
              open his account in English football.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> were displaying a better style of game, knocking around passes at will but <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> were managing to stem the flow and even create some chances themselves.</p>
              <p>In the 50th minute, Gunners striker Nicklas Bendtner produced a powerful finish to again put <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> ahead and that’s the way the match ended.</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s Alberto Aquilani finally made his debut for his new
              club, coming on in the 76th minute but could not inspire his team to
              overcome Wenger’s young Gunners.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss Rafael Benitez was happy with the debut of summer signing Alberto Aquilani in Wednesday night’s 2-1 Carling Cup loss to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The former AS <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roma</span></abbr> midfielder came on in the 76th minute of the contest after missing the
              beginning of the season with an ankle injury and Benitez was pleased
              with his efforts.</p>
              <p>“There were a lot of players showing passion, character and
              quality on the pitch, and Aquilani was one of these player," said
              Benitez.</p>
              <p>"He has the quality, but he needs to improve his match-fitness.</p>
              <p>"You can see he can pass the ball in the final third, he can make a big difference.</p>
              <p>"He gets closer every day, but still has to improve his match-fitness. It's a question of time.”</p>
              <p>Benitez added that he expects 25-year old Aquilani to become a key player for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"I think that he will be an important player for us,” he added.</p>
              <p>"We want to push him, but we cannot push too hard as we know that will be a risk.</p>
              <p>"So we will keep going, keep working and add more minutes every game."</p>
