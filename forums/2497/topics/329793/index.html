              <h3>SURLY striker Dimitar Berbatov may say that wearing the Man Utd jersey is his dream come true . . . but this is the kind of football strip that REALLY puts a smile on his face. </h3>
              <p>The brooding Bulgarian, nicknamed the Incredible Sulk, blew the huff-time whistle to get himself in a fun mood and play out of his skin in this saucy table footie match. And the rare grinning streak continued later when he SCORED with his stunning opponent Silvia Stoichova.</p>
              <h4>Fun</h4>
              <p>Make-up artist Silvia told the News of the World how Berbatov bedded her after winning the sexy strip table football contest. She said: “It’s understandable. We were young, half naked — it is normal. Also, both of us were single. So nothing wrong happened. He beat me 10-nil, so I stayed naked.”</p>

              <p><strong>Sylvia confessed that they became lovers after the shoot for the Bulgarian ‘For Me’ magazine. And we can reveal that, far from being a joyless loner, Berbatov—who quit Spurs to sign with Man United for a record £30 million on Monday—has had a string of EIGHT gorgeous lovers in the last few years.</strong></p>
              <p>Silvia said: “Our affair lasted for a few months. Then after that we continued to have fun, but only as good friends. “We are still friends. We have shared each other a lot of things. We are both born leaders so we felt that it wouldn’t work out between us. But we have remained close friends for a long time.”</p>
              <p>Berbatov, 27, did some close marking on Silvia during the sexy photo shoot. When she scored, it meant he got stripped to the waist. But as he netted goal after goal, Silvia had to go much further, peeling off her blue crop top and torn jeans, getting down to a tiny G-string. Then it was a clear case of handling as bare-chested Berbatov grabbed her bra and pulled her on top of the table before he fondling her boobs as she arched her back.</p>
              <p>Berbatov is not know as a fun-loving kind of guy—he was fined £40,000 by Spurs manager Juande Ramos because of his poor attitude. But this week, Silvia sprang to the defence of Man Utd boss Alex Ferguson’s new signing, insisting he’s nowhere near as miserable as he has been portrayed.</p>
              <p>She said: “He’s a pretty straightforward, sociable and diverting person. He was smiling all the time. “But when he’s playing on the pitch he seems like a completely different person —he turns into a furious, determined, and vigorous man. “It may be that’s why the public consider him as a melancholic outside the stadium. He just needs some rest outside the football world.</p>
              <p>“He is the kind of person who keeps back their emotions. He’s just preserving them for the game on the pitch. “He could never behave differently just to be in the spotlight all the time. “Only people who have nothing to offer the world could behave like that. He’s not one of them. His temper is much more complicated.”</p>
              <p>Berbatov says during his two seasons with Spurs he spent much of his spare time alone in his north London flat, feeding squirrels. But in the past he has dated one gorgeous woman after another.</p>
              <p>Blonde weathergirl <strong>DESSY BANOVA</strong> was with him for around four months in 2002 before dumping him. She said: “He was not mature enough, and also did not respect our relationship fully. He also had some inferiority complexes. He thought all of the women who were dating him were doing this because of his wealth. “That’s why when I met a Greek businessman, I split up with Dimitar.”</p>
              <p>Berbatov then dated <strong>STANISLAVA KJUCHOKOVA</strong>, who was said to be the love of his life. But it didn’t last and he was soon seeing model <strong>SNEJINA VALKOVA</strong>, before having a very brief fling with Miss Bulgaria <strong>MAGI VALCHANOVA</strong> during Euro 2004. Sexy <strong>TEDI VELINOVA</strong> has been linked to the star on more than one occasion, although she has always refused to talk about their relationship. But model <strong>DANIELA ARNAUT</strong> has revealed she had a year-long affair with Berbatov.</p>
              <p>Berbatov now looks like he will settle down with fiancée <strong>ELENA SHTILIANOVA</strong>. He said earlier this year: “I know pretty well who loves me, and who will give birth to my children.”</p>
