            <div class='col-md body'>Updated: June 8, 2007<br>Pearce anger over Bentley's Euro U-21 withdrawl<br><br>Stuart Pearce feels he has been let down by David Bentley after the midfielder's surprise withdrawal from England squad for the European Under-21 Championships.<br>The Blackburn starlet has left manager Pearce a man short for the tournament in Holland after pulling out due to 'fatigue'.<br>"I don't agree with it. I told him last night I don't agree with it in any way, shape or form,' Pearce said on Sky Sports News.<br>'I feel as though I've been supportive to him. He wasn't in the under-21 side for whatever reason when I took over the job.<br>'I put him in, I thought he was arguably one of our best players in the two matches we had him.<br>'With that in mind, I rang Steve [McClaren] and said `what I've got to report is I think this kid's doing quite well. Keep an eye on him'.'<br>Bentley was fit enough to be named in Pearce's 23-man squad last week while he was away with the seniors, although he did not feature against Brazil or Estonia.<br>The 22-year-old midfielder, who is not eligible for the next under-21 qualifying campaign, played more than 50 games for Blackburn this season before featuring in a `B' international against Albania.<br>Pearce said: 'I had an inkling on Wednesday when [Blackburn boss] Mark Hughes talked to me and mentioned that he'd like to pull the boy out. I said no.<br>'I spoke with David last night. He said to me on the back of a long season, and possible burn-out next season, that he'd like to pull himself out of the tournament.'<br>In his playing days, Pearce earned a reputation for being one of England's most fiercely loyal servants, earning 78 caps in 12-year international career.<br>He believes wearing the Three Lions does not matter as much to players nowadays.<br>'It means everything to play to play for England - when it suits,' he said.<br>'For me, representing your country is not about what suits you, it's about what suits your country, whether it be on the sporting field, whether it be in the armed forces.<br>'When your country comes calling, you put them first and yourself second.'<br>He added: 'I come from a couple of generations away from David's age.<br>'I did try to explain the situation: `Where does that leave you next summer if you get in the full squad and have a full season? Do you say I'm going to be fatigued for the next season?'<br>Players can only be replaced as a result of injury, so Pearce has been left with a squad of 22 for the finals, with England starting their campaign against Czech Republic on Monday.<br>'I tried to point out to him I can't pull another player into the squad so England as a national side have got to go a player light,' Pearce said.<br>'I also mentioned I've got [Nigel] Reo-Coker and [James] Milner, you name it, they're all in the same position on the back of a long season but want to be here and want to be representing their country.<br>'From my point of view, to say I'm disappointed is a massive understatement.<br>'The fact of the matter is these tournaments come around not within the season, they come around in the summer.<br>'From my experience having represented the country, you might spend maybe seven, eight, nine seasons in a row [on international duty] - the [Frank] Lampards, the [John] Terrys - they all do that.<br>'That's what players are aspiring to do. If you play every summer in some way, shape or form, it means you're representing your country either at big tournaments or qualifiers.<br>'I tried to point out all the plusses - the fact he's never played in a big tournament before.<br>'He's never represented the country at full level either. For me, it would be a great grounding.'<br>Pearce is already without Arsenal striker Theo Walcott due to a shoulder injury, and Gabriel Agbonlahor could not be contacted to confirm his selection in the squad.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Bentley: I did it for my career</span></strong><br><br>David Bentley has explained that he chose to pull out of the England squad for the European Under 21 Championship in order to give himself a better chance of making Steve McClaren's selection for the senior tournament next summer.<br><br>Bentley angered Under 21 boss Stuart Pearce and provoked a heated club versus country debate on Friday when he withdrew from England's travelling party for the tournament in Holland.<br><br>Pearce has questioned Bentley's desire to play for his country, but the Blackburn winger insists it was with his international career in mind that he took the controversial decision to leave the Under 21 squad a man light.<br><br>Bentley played 51 games for his club last season and the former Arsenal man feared he would suffer from burnout next season if he made the trip to Holland - potentially hindering his chances of making the senior squad for Euro 2008.<br><br>"I love playing for England, I love my country every time I step out on the pitch I give my all for anyone I play for," Bentley told talkSPORT<br><br>"I had three decisions; the club could have pulled me out, I could have pulled myself out or I could have faked an injury. I am an honest lad, I'm not a robot and I wanted to give my decision and my opinion on it.<br><br>"I've never come off a 60-game season and then gone straight into another one, I was alien to it.<br><br>"It wasn't a rash decision, I asked senior players at England `what do you feel like come October or November' and they said `you hit a brick wall'. `If you want to be firing and you want to make a push for the European Championships next year then I really think you have got to think long and hard'.<br><br>"All I can say is the decision was a two-week decision.<br><br>"When I first found out I was going to be included in the squad, Blackburn and myself took the appropriate measures and ways and discussed it with the management. It came to a point where I had to pull myself out of the squad.<br><br>"I think it is for the betterment of my career. I owe a lot to the Blackburn fans and they're paying the money to watch me week-in and week-out."<br><br>Bentley has been criticised for his decision, not least by Pearce, but the winger has sought to head off claims that indifference was behind his decision to snub the Under 21 call-up.<br><br>"He was disappointed as a manager should be and I fully accept that it was a controversial decision," Bentley added.<br><br>"Sometimes I get labelled with this arrogant (tag), that I just sort of toss it off now and again.<br><br>"I give my all every time I step out onto the football pitch. It's disappointing when people can judge it like that."<br><br>Bentley's senior international career has also been called into question as a result of the row, and the Blackburn star admits he did choose to ignore McClaren's advice to join the Under 21 squad.<br><br>"I look up to him [McClaren] and I have great respect for him but I have to listen to what my body is telling me."</div>
