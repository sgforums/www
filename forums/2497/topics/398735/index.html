              <p>So its time, we face the final curtain. Chelsea inched closer to the 
              Premier League title over the weekend with a win against Liverpool, and 
              know that a win against Wigan next Weekend will see them crowned 
              Champions (albeit with the lowest title winning score in years).</p>
              <p>So it seems a good time to look back on the season and hand out some 
              entirely fictional, and at times arbitrary awards to the good bad and 
              ugly of a Premier League season that has seen the big four get 
              competitive, a top tier side go into administration and an English side 
              in a European Final.</p>
              <p><strong>Best Player:</strong> Wayne Rooney<br> Other candidates: Didier Drogba, Carlos Tevez, Cesc Fabregas<br> <br> Rooney has been a class above all season. At the start of the year we 
              wondered how much of a void Ronaldo would leave as he finally flew over 
              to Madrid, but Rooney has made sure the void has been minimilised by 
              stepping up his goal count and influence on the team. When Ronaldo was 
              playing he sometimes drifted out wide and backwards in search of the 
              ball, but this season he has been sublime as United’s premier 
              goal-getter, which has been vital as Berbatov has refused to step up and
               Owen has been a shadow of his previous self.</p>
              <p><strong>Team of the Year</strong>: Fulham<br> Other candidates: Birmingham, Chelsea, Man United</p>
              <p>At the start of the season it would have been a struggle to imagine 
              that Fulham would have been the Premier League’s representative in a 
              European Final, and its kudos to the continues rejuvination of Fulham 
              that they are. They’ve had some absolutely fantastic moments on the way 
              and fully deserve their big day in the sun.</p>
              <p><strong>Manager of the Year</strong>: Roy Hodgson<br> Other Candidates: Carlo Ancelotti, Alex McLeish, Alex Ferguson</p>
              <p>Go back a couple of years. Fulham were going to be relegated. They 
              bought in Hodgson in an emergency move to try and save the club. Somehow
               they survived. 12 Months Later they finished in a Europa League spot. 
              12 months later they are in the final of the Europa League. He’s 
              amazing.</p>
              <p><strong>Biggest Dissapointment of the Season:</strong> Liverpool<br> Other Candidates: No relegation battle, Arsenal’s title run, Portsmouth</p>
              <p>Liverpool, you confuse me. Before last season I thought you might 
              fall out of the top four, and what did you do? Finish 2nd, losing out on
               a title that you should have won. This season I predicted that’d 
              inspire you on to a good title run. And you’re just about in the Europa 
              League.</p>
              <p><strong>The Newcastle United Carcrash Award:</strong> Portsmouth</p>
              <p>Portsmouth. I predicted that despite a tough start to the season, 
              they’d be saved in January by some monied madman and bring to club just 
              out of the relegation zone. But they were far too mismanaged for that 
              and slumped instead into administration.</p>
              <p>And yet they still made it to the FA Cup final. God I love football.</p>
              <p><strong>The Henrik Larsson award for brilliant cameo:</strong> Landon
               Donovan</p>
              <p>Could he cut it, we asked, when he signed for Everton in a 
              David-Beckham-esque mid-season move. Yes he could came the resounding 
              answer. So much so that Everton were desperate to keep hold of him 
              beyond the agreed loan. He made America a much scarier opposition at the
               World Cup if nothing else.</p>
              <p><strong>The Shevchenko Award for Big Signing Who Never Plays:</strong> Alberto Aquilani</p>
              <p>I’m sure he plays football, I seem remember him at Roma. Maybe i’m 
              imagining things though.</p>
              <p><strong>The Most Bizarre Story of the Season</strong>: Sol Campbell</p>
              <p>He started the season signing for Notts County (then under the wing 
              of Sven), before leaving promptly and playing half a season at Arsenal 
              instead. None of these things seemed very likely at all a year ago.</p>
