              <p><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/109/manchester-city-news"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manchester City</span></a> manager Mark Hughes has lauded his latest recruit, Roque Santa Cruz, and has revealed that the striker will spearhead his attacks this coming season.<br><br>The Welshman is overseeing an active transfer policy that has brought with it a degree of success in that Gareth Barry has been signed to provide some midfield stability, while high-profile targets such as Samuel Eto'o and Carlos Tevez remain on the radar.<br><br>Santa Cruz, Hughes claims, will capitalise on the creativity and service of his free flowing midfield, and the Citizens boss is delighted to have purchased the player, whom he first signed at Blackburn Rovers.<br><br>He told the club's official website, "We knew from the first day at Blackburn that we had an outstanding striker on our books and he never disappointed from that day on. He is a natural goal scorer, and if the ball is in the right area then ‘Rocky’ will score goals. When people see Rocky in a Manchester City shirt they will understand very quickly why I wanted to bring him here.<br><br>"Sometimes the quality of our attacking play was exceptional last season, but what we didn't have was a focal point. We were creative, yes, but on certain occasions we needed something else - a figurehead, if you like.<br><br>"He has the ability to carry that role. They say you stand or fall by your strikers, and at times when things are not going particularly well you need somebody with the ability to get goals on their own."<br><br>Hughes also reserved praise for the player's attitude. "He's got a great work ethic, he wants to be fit and raring to go so I wasn't surprised he started <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://goal.com/en/news/9/england/2009/07/03/1361168/manchester-city-boss-mark-hughes-roque-santa-cruz-will-spearhead-#"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; color: #0464d1! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; position: relative;">training</span></span></a> early on his own, and he's tasted success at Bayern,” Hughes said. “Seven years at a club like that had an effect.<br><br>"But he's also got a great demeanour. There's always a smile, and he enjoys being part of a group that works hard. That transmits to everybody around him. So the dressing-room is stronger simply for having him around."<br><br>The 27-year-old cost an estimated £17.5 million, a large increase on the £3.5m Rovers successfully tabled in 2007.</p>
