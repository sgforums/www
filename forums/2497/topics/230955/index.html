            <div class='col-md body'>Mourinho at odds with Blues board<br><br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho's has accused the Stamford Bridge board of refusing to back him in the January transfer window.<br><br>Reports have already suggested Mourinho could leave in the summer after a fall-out with owner Roman Abramovich.<br><br>And Mourinho said: "I've identified the players that I want but they will not come. It's club reasons and I don't have to tell you why.<br><br>"I have asked for players and it's not my choice that no-one is coming."<br><br>Mourinho was thought to be keen to bring in a defender and a forward during the transfer window.<br><br>But the outspoken boss says if he is unable to bring in any new faces then he will not allow any of his squad to depart.<br><br>He added: "The information I have is that nobody is coming and if that's the case then nobody is leaving.<br><br>The only thing I know for sure is that John (Terry) will not play against Wigan on Saturday<br><br>"I expect my squad to be the same at the end of the market as it was at the start."<br><br>Mourinho refused to discuss his Stamford Bridge future, only saying: "My position is not important. Chelsea is what is important, not me."<br><br>Meanwhile, the Blues have suffered a blow with the news captain John Terry's return to action has been delayed by a sore calf.<br><br>The defender was expected to make his return from back surgery against Wigan at the weekend but Mourinho confirmed he will not feature.<br><br>The boss said: "John had surgery, he is recovering from that, but he is not ready yet.<br><br>"We have a lot of problems, because Ashley Cole and Claude Makelele face suspensions, and I do not see Terry back.<br><br>"There is no timescale on John. The only thing I know for sure is that he will not play against Wigan on Saturday.<br><br>"I am not a doctor. John is not fit to train with the group. He is not in my collective sessions yet, so he is out for the weekend."<br><br></div>
