              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> face a massive battle to hold onto Rio Ferdinand.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says the England defender is a target for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Barcelona</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> - and knows a move to Spain will boost his growing business career.</p>
              <p>Ferdinand is under contract until 2013 but United could be tempted to
              cash in on a player who is 30 and who has suffered from recent injury
              problems.</p>
              <p>A source revealed: "Rio can see the sense of it.</p>
              <p>"Not only would it be a fresh challenge as he nears the end of his career, it would also fit all his projects off the pitch.</p>
              <p>"Rio has big business plans, which are already taking shape, and
              would really take off if he moved to one of the big Spanish clubs."</p>
              <p>Ferdinand's growing portfolio includes running a record label
              and a football agency. He is also about to launch a lifestyle
              management company.</p>
              <p>Another off-the-field project is #5 Magazine, which uses the latest digital technology.</p>
              <p>Elsewhere, the Rio Ferdinand Live The Dream foundation was
              established last year to give young people from disadvantaged
              backgrounds the chance to take part in sports, arts and cultural
              activities.</p>
              <p>A launch party in December, costing £495 per head, will feature Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a guest speaker.</p>

              <p>Depending on how much you can get... And not all top class defenders can last till their last 30s... Many loss their speed when the reach 30 and everything else is different too... Sol Cambell was a very good defender, s good as Rio but at 30, he already lost his place at Arsenal... Today he is only 34.</p>

              <p>I think Wenger drop Sol more because he could not keep up with the fast playing style of Arsenal... and he was also getting injury prone due to age... like what Rio is also becoming sadly...</p>
              <p>Sol Campbell is no longer doing well at Portsmouth... Portsmouth didn't offer him a new deal  when his contract expired... He did show flashes of good at Portsmouth during his time there, but wasn't consistent... He will need to be more consistent to be consider good for the top 4... He is now playing for a League two side...</p>
              <p>Good defenders lacking speed may make up with experienced which could be true, but it could also means someone in the defence has to compensate for his shortcomings...</p>
              <p>Cafu best days have long past him, He may still be playing at AC Milan but what has AC Milan become today? And he don't even start the match, more like an extra sub...</p>
              <p>On Stam, he is only 37 today but his best days ended when he left AC Milan at 34...</p>
              <p>Fabio Cannavaro, he is only 35 today, Real Madrid has been letting in goals quite easily these last 2 yrs... I guess after the 2006 WC he started go down as well...</p>
              <p>But not surprisingly, all these defenders played in Italy's much slower Serie A... Which probably is more of an advantage than playing in the Premiership...</p>
              <p>Rio is still a very good defender but he has to still be good in order for Barce and Real to want him... But he probably has 2 more yrs at this level, so it isn't a bad thing to cash in on him at the end of this season or they won't get anything back in 2 yrs time...</p>
