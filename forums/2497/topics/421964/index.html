              <p>Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano has criticised former club Liverpool for the way they handled his departure last summer and striker Fernando Torres' exit on Monday.</p>
              <p>The Argentina international described as 'sad' the manner in which players had to leave a club they had served well.</p>
              <p>Following Torres' £50million transfer to Chelsea on deadline day the Spaniard has been castigated for his comments suggesting he is much better off at Stamford Bridge than he was at Anfield.</p>
              <p>'I was not surprised about what happened with Fernando,' Mascherano is quoted on espn.co.uk as telling a press conference today.</p>
              <p>'When I left Liverpool, it looked as if I killed someone. It is sad that the people who did something important with the club have to leave by the back door.</p>
              <p>'It is sad that the press and the club try to convince people that it is all the player's fault when the reality is that Liverpool didn't show the interest in keeping us in the club.</p>
              <p>'The most important players didn't leave the club well. 'I spoke with Fernando and I said to him that he doesn't have to be worried because he did his best for the club.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>'Even though he didn't win any trophies, he was a very important player and helped this club all the time.'</strong></p>
              <p>Mascherano's views are, however, slightly ironic considering he was offered a new contract by then Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez last April but stalled on signing it.</p>
              <p>Four months later, after it became apparent he did not want to remain on Merseyside, he eventually secured a £22million move to Barcelona.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Kenny Dalglish</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> says the timing of </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">' transfer request from Liverpool has left a bitter taste in the mouth but believes the club will live to forget the player. </span></strong></p>
              <div class="mod-inline image image-right">Torres formally issued a transfer request on Friday, giving Liverpool just three days to find a suitable replacement before he left to join Chelsea in a £50 million switch. The Reds eventually signed Andy Carroll for a British record transfer, a move Dalglish defended on Thursday following criticism of the £35 million price tag in the media.</div>
              <p>Dalglish hinted that Torres' conduct left a lot to be desired but, ahead of Sunday's clash with Chelsea, he said the striker he was no longer important to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"Everybody was disappointed that he left the club," Dalglish said. "Most disappointing was the timing, but we move on. The football club will always be here, and no person is bigger than this football club.</p>
              <p>"The club and the owners did everything we possibly could but it was not to be, so he moved on. He's playing for someone else now. The most important people are the people at this football club."</p>
              <p>Asked how he will prepare to shackle Torres, Dalglish replied: "We'll just play against any player they put on the pitch. We're more important than any player they've got."</p>

              <p>Andy Carroll ended up filling the void left by Torres' £50million move to Chelsea, but only after Liverpool failed with a bold bid for Llorente, according to the 6ft 5in Spain frontrunner.</p>
