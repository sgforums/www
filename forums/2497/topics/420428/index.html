              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">KENNY DALGLISH reckons his return to Anfield can give Liverpool a mighty shove towards derby glory.</h2>
              <p>Dalglish tomorrow manages his first game on the Reds' home turf since his shock exit 20 years ago.</p>
              <p>Ahead of the clash with Everton he said: "It can only help if the punters think it's a positive I'm back. That will reflect well for the players.</p>
              <p>"It should be a great advantage if we start with the fans fully behind us. "The players know what they have to do, how they have to play and we would love to win the game."</p>
              <p>Liverpool fans have been on a high since King Kenny replaced Roy Hodgson last weekend. And not even defeats at Manchester United and Blackpool have burst their balloon. But defeat to their Merseyside neighbours is unthinkable to the Anfield faithful.</p>
              <p>Dalglish's return will have them in full voice though. And the man rated as Liverpool's greatest ever player, admitted emerging from the tunnel will be a hugely emotional moment for him.</p>
              <p>He said: "If the supporters are pleased to see me sitting there, they will not be as pleased as I am. "It will be emotive walking up those steps. "But it's all very well being romantic the truth of the matter is we have got to start winning games.</p>
              <p>"It would cap off a fantastic day if we got a positive result - and I hope it's got a happier ending than last Sunday!"</p>

              <p>The 215th Merseyside derby comes with a Glasgow twist and its importance transcends local pride for both Kenny Dalglish and David Moyes. Amid the emotion of a first home game as <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span> manager for almost 20 years, the seriousness of his club's plight is not lost on Dalglish. Lose, and the feelgood factor of his return will be replaced by a deepened sense of crisis. But Liverpool are not the only team languishing four points above the relegation zone and, without Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher to contend with, there is pressure on Moyes to go for the jugular. <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p>

              <p>Steven Gerrard? He isn't but I reckon Pool will win tonight cos it's Anfield and the players will be really charged up for this as many of the former players will be at Anfield in support of Kenny D...</p>
              <p>Also the directors and even owner that John Henry guy will be attending too so you can understand the players will raise to the occasion like they did for Roy against Bolton where many former players were seen at the match...</p>
              <p>And to top it all up, Everton without their top scorer, would find it very tough going at Anfield on an emotional afternoon...</p>

              <p>With such incentive, a fully charged up stadium full of fans specially for kenny's first home match, former players in the stand to support... and of course the owner watching... They couldn't come up with a winning performance like that one against Bolton...</p>
              <p>I think Everton would be the more happier side with the end result... I honestly didn't expect them to get anything today cos of the special occasion at Anfield will help motivate the players... It seems worrying as with so many extra motivational reasons, they still can't make it...</p>
              <p>I wonder when all these extra motivation isn't there anymore, how will they become?

              <p><span><strong>Kenny Dalglish pointed the finger at referee Phil Dowd after his Anfield homecoming ended in disappointment yesterday. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish’s first home game of his return as Liverpool manager brought a draw with Everton to leave him still looking for his first win after three games back in charge. </span></p>
              <p><span>The home side were a goal up at half-time but ultimately needed a Dirk Kuyt penalty to salvage a draw after two Everton goals in the first six minutes of the second period. </span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish claimed the visitors should not have been awarded the corner that led to Sylvain Distin’s equaliser and that Liverpool defender Martin Kelly was fouled in the build-up to the Jermaine Beckford goal that put David Moyes’ team ahead. </span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish said: ‘The first goal should have been a goal kick and not a corner. Even if I had not got lenses in I could have seen that.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘For the second one, Martin Kelly got battered and then we got turned on the edge of the box when he was about to clear it.

              <p>Pool played very well in the first half like I had expected them
              to... but strangely, they got lost in the 2nd...</p>
              <p>With such incentive, a fully charged up stadium full of
              fans specially for kenny's first home match, former players in
              the stand to support... and of course the owner watching... They
              couldn't come up with a winning performance like that one against
              Bolton...</p>
              <p>I think Everton would be the more happier side with the end
              result... I honestly didn't expect them to get anything today cos
              of the special occasion at Anfield will help motivate the
              players... It seems worrying as with so many extra motivational
              reasons, they still can't make it...</p>
              <p>I wonder when all these extra motivation isn't there
              anymore, how will they become? But time is running out for
              Kenny D cos his honeymoon period will soon be over and everyone
              will expect more and better results to go along with his reputation
              and the build-up to his appointment...</p>

              <p>one thing, Everton is not weak and even on a good day, Pool may find it difficult to sweep them aside.. even without a Tim Cahill.</p>
              <p>I believe with their own greats, pool fans will be extra tolerant of KK's performance.</p>
              <p>for me, I still feel if the owners are committed as per they say, they will put up the funds for a new stadium. then, pool will be able to get the gates-money and from there, get the funds to get good players.</p>
              <p>maybe, they can adopt gunners method of biting the bullet a few years while their stadium is being built. but to be fair, gunners' "youth" then, was strong and enable them to be top4, gather good funds as they play.</p>

              <p>Even if dalglish wins only once or twice in the next ten games.......kop fans will never treat him the way benitez and hodgson suffered. Wanna bet :) Well, that's also because he has been a brilliant legendary figure for them, he has already justified himself long before.</p>
              <p>Anyway, sorry no offence to pool fans but whenever I see them singing you'll never walk alone, I wonder what people like hodgson and benitez think. It's pretty ironic. And so many players who failed to make the grade have been booted out over the years. They must have felt really lonely when they hear that song.</p>

              <p><br>Pool won't get relegated... Cos with the players they have, they are by far much better than the Sunderland, the Bolton, the Stoke or the Newcastle sides... It's just a matter of the coaching that will see whether they get the results or they don't...</p>
              <p>For me, they should be getting at least 6 to 7 spot this season. And I am very serious, not kidding at all... Cos of the squad they have and the season is still a long way to go... Compare to those 4 up there, who do they have is of real quality? Or how many in their squad? That's why I said compare to Pool, they are much more inferior and yet Sunderland is about to sell their top scorer somemore...</p>
              <p>Also, most of Pool's players who played in that season they finished 2nd in the league are still there too... So when I see or hear some Pool fans saying they are 4 points from the relegation zone sounds quite silly cos they fail to say they are in 13th place and 5 points from the 7th spot and with a game still in hand too over the 7th place club... Meaning had they won in midweek, they could be like only 2 points behind with still a game in hand from 7th spot...</p>
              <p>So a 6, 7 finish shouldn't be too difficult if we really think about it... Relegation is definitely not on the cards for me...</p>
