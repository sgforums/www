              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Lyon could be tempted to sell Karim Benzema if Manchester United put in a big-money bid, according to director Bernard Lacombe.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Benzema is one of the
              world's hottest properties and speculation is rife that United are
              ready to use some of the money from the impending sale of Cristiano
              Ronaldo to Real Madrid to bring the young striker to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Lacombe claimed recently Benzema would remain at the Stade
              Gerland, but has now revealed the 21-year-old could be sold if the
              price is right.</p>
              <p>"He is with us, but no-one knows what will happen," Lacombe
              told regional daily Le Progres. "At the time we didn't think that
              Michael Essien would leave, but when Chelsea came with their cheque...</p>
              <p>"If Manchester United, who we all know have come into a lot of money, present an offer for Benzema, what can you do?"</p>
              <p>Ronaldo is set to become Madrid's second signing of the summer, following the purchase of Kaka from AC Milan.</p>
              <p>The pair will cost the club around 160million euros in transfer
              fees and Lacombe has lashed out at the Spaniards for distorting the
              market.</p>
              <p>He added: "The market is false because certain European clubs
              don't have official league bodies controlling how they are managed and
              can do what they want.</p>
              <p>"I'm not bitter but how can Real Madrid, who are in debt, sign
              two players whose price is almost the same as Lyon's entire budget?</p>
              <p>"It shocks we who are in the same environment, so I understand that people outside the football world are shocked.</p>
              <p>"It's baffling, clumsy and disrespectful. Economically Spain is at a standstill. We can't support this."</p>
              <p>United are likely to step up their interest in signing a new striker following Carlos Tevez's decision to leave today.</p>
              <p>Benzema came through the ranks at the French giants and burst
              onto the scene in the 2007-08 season with 31 goals in 51 games, a
              streak that saw him named Ligue 1 player of the year as well as top the
              league's scoring charts.</p>
              <p>This campaign was less impressive for both club and player, as
              Lyon ended the season without the Ligue 1 title for the first time in
              eight years, but the France forward nevertheless scored 23 goals in all
              competitions - an average of a goal every other game.</p>

              <h1>UNITED CHASE £25M KARIM BENZEMA</h1>
              <h2>Lyon striker will be straight replacement for Carlos Tevez</h2>

              <h3>SIR ALEX FERGUSON is ready to splash £25million on Lyon's Karim Benzema after finally admitting defeat over keeping Carlos Tevez. </h3>
              <p>Manchester United officially ended negotiations with Tevez's representative Kia Joorabchian - and have targeted France striker Benzema. Lyon have admitted that a £25m offer would be enough to tempt them. </p>
              <p>Tevez rejected the chance to stay at Old Trafford after United made him an offer on June 3. Tevez and Joorabchian asked for more time to consider the deal but United's chief executive, David Gill, withdrew the offer on Friday night.</p>
              <p>That leaves Manchester City clear favourites to land the Argentina striker - although Chelsea have also expressed an interest.</p>
              <p>With Tevez no longer part of their plans, United will turn to striker Benzema. Lyon have fought a long battle to keep their star player but are now ready to bow to United's financial muscle. </p>
              <p>Benzema has been linked with Arsenal, Real Madrid and European champions Barcelona, but United are now in pole position to sign him. </p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Bernard Lacombe, the personal advisor to Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas, has revealed they are anticipating a bid from Fergie.</strong></p>
              <p>Lacombe said: "Benzema is with us, but nobody knows what will happen. We didn't think Michael Essien would leave at the time, but when Chelsea arrived with the cheque . . .</p>
              <p>"If Manchester United, who as we know have plenty of cash available, want to buy Benzema, then what can you do?"</p>
              <p>Sport of the World broke the news of City's interest in Tevez in September last year and also told you first that Ferguson had singled out Benzema as his replacement.</p>
              <p>Benzema scored 17 times for Lyon last season making him the third in the French League goal charts. He has 24 international caps and six goals and played for his country at Euro 2008.</p>

              <h1>Karim Benzema in no hurry to quit Lyon for Manchester United</h1>
              <h2>Sir Alex Ferguson has been warned to expect a 12-month wait to sign Lyon forward Karim Benzema, despite the French club admitting that they could be forced to sell the £25 million-rated player because of Manchester United's financial power</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="slideshow">
              <div class="ssImg" style="display: block;"><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01428/karim-benzema_1428209c.jpg" alt="Benzema in no hurry to quit Lyon for United" width="460" height="287">
              <div class="imageExtras"><span class="caption"><em>Staying put: French international striker Karim Benzema has indicated to his agent that he would like to spend at least another season with Lyon.</em></span></div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>United manager Ferguson is ready to increase his efforts to sign the 21 year-old following Carlos Tevez's decision to reject the offer of a five-year contract to stay at Old Trafford, with sources on Sunday indicating that Manchester City were still thought to be leading the race for the Argentine's signature.</strong></p>
              <p>Tevez's departure, coupled with the impending £80 million sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid, has left United needing to replace two forwards who contributed 41 goals between them last season.</p>
              <p>Benzema, a France international with a proven pedigree in the Champions League, has been identified by Ferguson as a key target.</p>
              <p>Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has admitted that a "tsunami of money" could force the French club's hand and sporting director Bernard Lacombe claimed over the weekend that United have the financial muscle to prise Benzema from Stade Gerland.</p>
              <p>But the player's agent, Karim Djaziri, has warned Ferguson that he faces a battle to persuade the Frenchman to move to Old Trafford this summer after admitting that Benzema is reluctant to leave Lyon before next year's World Cup.</p>
              <p>"Karim is on holiday at the moment and he is not thinking of moving," he said. "He wants to stay in France for another year so that he can prepare for the World Cup and I think that Sir Alex knows this. Perhaps he wants to make an offer to Lyon. If that happens, then Karim will think about it, but as things stand, Karim wants to stay with Lyon for another year."</p>
              <p>When Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis disappeared through the Old Trafford exit door during the summer of 1995, a <em>Manchester Evening News</em> phone poll asking "Should Fergie be sacked?" resulted in 56 per cent of respondents answering "yes".</p>
              <p>Not only had Ferguson lost three hugely influential and popular players, his critics among the club's supporters suggested he had also "lost the plot" with his plan to replace them with untried youngsters by the name of Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham.</p>
              <p>It was a traumatic summer for Ferguson, but he had a plan and it worked spectacularly with United's golden generation ending the 1995-96 season as Double winners.</p>
              <p>Fourteen years on, with Tevez choosing to follow Ronaldo out of the club, Ferguson now faces a comparable challenge. He has lost two A-list performers and he has to fill the void. Finding a like-for-like replacement for Ronaldo will be impossible. Real Madrid have agreed to spend a world record £80 million to secure his services because he is a one-off.</p>
              <p>Antonio Valencia has been identified by Ferguson as the next best thing, though, and a £17 million deal for Wigan's Ecuadorean winger is likely to be completed once Ronaldo rubber-stamps his move to Spain.</p>
              <p>For all of Benzema's potential, reputation and Champions League experience, however, he lacks the fear factor that Tevez and Ronaldo, in particular, held over opponents at the highest level.</p>
              <p>Danny Welbeck and Federico Macheda are bright prospects, but neither is ready to emulate the feats of Beckham, Butt and Scholes 14 years ago.</p>
              <p>Kaka has gone to Madrid, signing Fernando Torres is pure fantasy and Samuel Eto'o's likely involvement with Cameroon in January's African Cup of Nations rules him out.</p>
              <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic is available at Inter Milan, but his reputation on the continent has rarely been backed up against English opposition.</p>
