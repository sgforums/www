              for Chelsea
                                      clash</h1>
              <div>
              <p>Owen Hargreaves could be sensationally 
              amongst the
                                      <abbr><span>Manchester United</span></abbr> substitutes
                                      for tomorrow's clash with <abbr><span>Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Although it appears John O'Shea is further 
              forward on the
                                      comeback trail, the fact Hargreaves is not part 
              of United's
                                      European squad and therefore unavailable for 
              Wednesday's

              Bayern Munich, lends
                                      weight to the belief manager <abbr><span>Sir Alex
                                      Ferguson</span></abbr> will have the 29-year-old
               on the bench
                                      against <abbr><span>Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"John O'Shea and Owen Hargreaves have trained
               very well with the
                                      first team," said Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"They are not far away and I may use one of 
              them as substitute
                                      tomorrow and the other on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"John O'Shea in particular has done a lot of 
              work. The boy has
                                      come on terrifically well in the last two or 
              three weeks.</p>
              <p>"If I include one tomorrow and one on 
              Wednesday it will give
                                      them the confidence that they are back.</p>
              <p>"That is what they need."</p>

              <p>oh why pick Mike Dean to referee Manchester United v Chelsea?</p>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2010/4/2/1270223664765/Mike-Dean-has-given-more--002.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p class="caption"><em>Mike Dean has given more penalties than any other referee this season. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images</em></p>
              <p>When Brian Laws described a high-profile <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> appointment as "mad" earlier this week, he was not referring to his own. The Burnley manager was aghast at the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd's decision to put Mike Dean in charge of Saturday's potential title-decider between Manchester United and Chelsea after the referee blundered, awarding Blackburn the penalty that settled last Sunday's East Lancashire derby, having been conned by an opportunistic Martin Olsson dive.</p>
              <p>The Blackburn midfielder has since admitted that he decided to showcase his triple-axle, three and a half reverse somersault with pike because he was aware of Dean's reputation for being whistle-happy for infringements in the box. The Cheshire official has pointed to the spot on 16 occasions in 35 games this season, an astonishingly high tally when you consider his nearest "rivals" in the penalty-awarding stakes, Mark Clattenburg and Alan Wiley, have awarded only seven each.</p>
              <p>The bare statistics prove nothing as it could be argued, albeit by a very good lawyer, that the other 15 of Dean's penalties were correctly awarded and that other <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Referees" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/referees"><span style="color: #005689;">referees</span></a> are too cowardly to risk making such calls. What is certain, however, is that Dean has no shortage of vocal detractors within the Premier League, loudest among them this season being Tony Pulis, Arsène Wenger and Gianfranco Zola. "I've seen the penalty decision again and it was not correct," declared Zola after Dean erroneously awarded Chelsea a spot-kick against West Ham last December, then enhanced his reputation as an over-zealous jobsworth by making Frank Lampard take it three times.</p>
              <p>Even the most arriviste Chelsea fans will be painfully aware that Dean has form in the field of making controversial decisions in matches involving their side and Manchester United. In September 2007, they cried "conspiracy" when he dismissed both Mikel John Obi for a foul on Patrice Evra and appeals for a penalty for an Evra trip on Ashley Cole. His name disappeared from the Christmas card lists of all but the most philosophical Chelsea fans when he awarded United a late penalty for a Tal Ben Haim challenge on Louis Saha.</p>
              <p>It is to be hoped the attention drawn to Dean ahead of Saturday's game will encourage him to maintain a low profile and leave the limelight to the players, but viewers can at least rest safe in the knowledge that he won't be short of good advice. In the Chelsea captain John Terry and the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, the unfortunate match official will be "supported" by two of the most experienced and vocal referee's assistants around.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> are the top scorers in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> with 82 goals, 52 of them scored at 
              home, and have smashed 12 in their last two games.</p>
              <p>But despite hitting seven twice in home league games this season, 
              Ancelotti is reluctant to take on the mantle of being a coach who puts 
              forward play first.</p>
              <p>"I don't consider myself an attacking coach," added the Italian. "I am 
              Italian and the fortune of Italian football is defensively. I like 
              balance. I am a balanced coach.</p>
              <p>"This is our aim, to attack and play football, but the first thing is to
               maintain balance because I don't like to concede a goal. The easy way 
              to score is a counter-attack. In Italy the team that won <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Serie

              </div>
              </div>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> has complete faith in Dimitar 
              Berbatov going into today's showdown with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>It is obvious the loss of Wayne Rooney causes him a problem ahead of 
              Saturday's top of the table clash with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Yet, in making a single striker his preferred formation, in which 
              Berbatov has no role, Ferguson has given himself an instant replacement.</p>
              <p>The Bulgarian cannot be expected to match Rooney's work-rate - few in 
              the United squad could - but the Red Devils spent a club record 
              £30.75million on him for a reason and Ferguson does not expect the 
              former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> striker to let him down in his hour of need.</p>
              <p>"I haven't liked leaving Dimitar out - and now he is in," said the 
              United boss, who is aware public perception of Berbatov is not totally 
              favourable.</p>
              <p>"The split must be 80-20 in his favour.</p>
              <p>"If we sign a big player and he is not scoring 50 goals a season, 
              including 16 overhead kicks, you are always going to get a discerning 
              voice.</p>
              <p>"Everyone has their own favourites and supporters have diverse views.</p>
              <p>"I used to get a letter from a supporter saying I was off my head 
              because I wasn't playing Steve Bruce at centre forward, although in 
              fairness it was probably Brucie writing it himself or his granny."</p>
              <p>Berbatov has produced a couple of battling performances in Rooney's 
              absence lately, which have guided United to crucial victories at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wolves</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Bolton</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>He is more likely to attack with a sword than a sledgehammer, but 
              Ferguson is confident <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> will still feel the same thrust.</p>
              <p>"The one thing you cannot dismiss is Dimitar's ability and talent," he 
              said.</p>
              <p>"He is a fantastic player.</p>
              <p>"He can play on his own up front. What you need is to give him good 
              support."</p>

              Ferguson fuming, with replays showing the striker was clearly offside.</p>
              <p>The United boss told <em>Sky Sports 1</em>: "What I can't understand is 
              the linesman's directly in front of it. He has no-one near him and he 
              gets it wrong.</p>
              <p>"A game of that magnitude, you really need quality officials and we 
              didn't get them today. It was a poor, poor performance."</p>
              <p>Referee Mike Dean was under pressure from last week when he awarded 
              Blackburn a penalty against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Burnley</span></abbr> after the Rovers player later admitted he dived.</p>
              <p>United had two penalty appeals turned down today while <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> also looked to have a good shout when Gary Neville barged <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Nicolas Anelka</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Asked whether Dean had been affected by the comments, Ferguson added: "I
               don't know about that but when I saw Mike Dean I did worry, I must 
              admit."</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> now lead United by two points with five games to go, and Ferguson put 
              the pressure on his rivals by making them firm favourites.</p>
              <p>"Five games left, they're two points ahead and four goals better than us
               - they're in the driving seat," he continued.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> are favourites now, there's no question. I'm certain we'll respond but 
              we could win the next five games and not win it."</p>
              <p>United looked to be suffering a hangover from the midweek Champions 
              League quarter-final defeat against Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "The first half we looked leggy, it took us too long to 
              get going and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> were by far the better team.</p>
              <p>"The second half we did well, we were unfortunate not to get something 
              from the game. We dominated it in the second period but we just didn't 
              get there.".</p>

              <h1>Manchester United 1 Chelsea 2: Didier Drogba's controversial winner 
              gives Blues a title tonic</h1>
              <p>Didier Drogba's controversial winner allowed Chelsea to shrug 
              Manchester United aside and put themselves back in pole position in the 
              Premier League title race.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson and his team 
              will feel hard done by as Drogba was clearly offside as he collected 
              Salomon Kalou's pass and drove home 12 minutes from time.</p>
              <p>The significance of the error only became clear once Federico Macheda 
              had pulled a goal back for the hosts to set up a pulsating finish.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/03/article-1263263-08FCB581000005DC-376_468x316.jpg" alt="Didier Drogba of Chelsea" width="468" height="316">

              </div>
              <p>But Ferguson would be aware that the first hour had been completely 
              one-sided in Chelsea's favour and that the visitors should have had a 
              greater advantage than the one goal Joe Cole provided in the first 
              half.</p>
              <p>Without Wayne Rooney, there was no real bite in 
              United's attack. And although the 34-goal striker is only out for a 
              fortnight, by the time he returns his side's dreams of glory might be 
              over, considering Chelsea now have a two-point advantage and a superior 
              goal difference.</p>

              <p>Since his recovery from a long-term knee injury, Cole has struggled 
              to get back into the swing of things. Fabio Capello claimed he was not 
              the same player when he left the midfielder out of his England squad to 
              face Egypt last month, raising extreme doubt over Cole's chances of 
              making the World Cup.</p>
              <p>Cole's admission that contract talks 
              had broken down was a statement in itself, given it is hard to imagine 
              Carlo Ancelotti allowing a pivotal player to find himself in such a 
              position so close to him being allowed to leave on a free transfer.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/03/article-1263263-08FC93D6000005DC-786_468x309.jpg" alt="Joe Cole of Chelsea " width="468" height="309">

              </div>
              <p>Old Trafford has been mentioned as a potential destination should 
              Cole leave Stamford Bridge this summer, so it was an opportunity to 
              impress Sir Alex Ferguson, not that the United chief would have found 
              the 18th-minute opener even vaguely admirable.</p>
              <p>Having put 
              his side's obvious failings in possession down to a one-off in Munich 
              last week, Ferguson must have been worried to see the same fault 
              reappearing quite so often, quite so soon.</p>
              <p>There is no 
              doubt the ankle injury Rooney suffered in Germany had a negative effect 
              on United. But the fault lay much deeper, their play too ponderous to 
              have any impact. All across the midfield, United were wasteful in 
              possession. And with Florent Malouda giving Gary Neville a right old 
              runaround, Chelsea took complete command.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/03/article-1263263-08FCC738000005DC-154_468x286.jpg" alt="Federico Macheda (right) bundles the ball home" width="468" height="286">

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The disappointment for Ancelotti must have been that his team
               did
              not make the most of their possession. Edwin van der Sar denied Cole on
              one occasion and Nicolas Anelka had a couple of shots blocked but
              clear-cut chances were rare.</p>
              <p>Even Chelsea's opening goal
              was not a golden opportunity in that sense. Malouda was invited to run
              into the home box and although Darren Fletcher eventually reacted, the
              Chelsea midfielder had the strength to hold him off and cut the ball
              back to the near post, where Cole got in front of Patrice Evra and
              found the net with a neat back flick.  </p>

              </div>
              <p>It
               took United a long time to respond. And when the rally eventually came,
               it took the form of a couple of debatable penalty appeals and referee 
              Mike Dean was not impressed either when Yury Zhirkov chopped down Park 
              Ji-sung and Dimitar Berbatov fell under Frank Lampard's challenge.</p>
              <p>Had
               Paulo Ferreira shown more conviction when he raced to meet Cole's 
              excellent through-ball at the start of the second half, the contest 
              would have been over. Instead, the full-back failed to find either the 
              far corner, or Anelka, and United, who at least speeded up a little bit,
               remained alive.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The escape certainly seemed to galvanise the hosts, who for the first
               time made Chelsea's defence creak. Berbatov, the man of whom so much 
              was expected in Rooney's absence, was just off target with a couple of 
              headers and, off balance, Park was unable to keep his shot on target 
              after a forceful Fletcher run had carved Chelsea open.</p>
              <p>The 
              introduction of Drogba midway through the second half emphasised the 
              Blues' strength in depth compared to their hosts, who were forced to 
              rely on the talents of teenager Macheda when Ferguson needed to 
              reinvigorate his side.</p>
              <p>Predictably, Drogba had an immediate 
              impact, even if he was offside as he collected Kalou's pass before 
              drilling his shot past Van der Sar.</p>
              <p>Down, and almost out, 
              United responded instantly as Cech pushed Nani's cross onto the 
              on-rushing Macheda. The ball bounced slowly into the Chelsea goal to set
               up a dramatic ending. But the Blues were worthy winners at the end.</p>
              <p>Behind
               glass, in the executive box where he watched from, Rooney could only 
              wonder what might have been.</p>
