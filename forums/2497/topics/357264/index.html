              <p><strong>Gabriel Agbonlahor admits he was ‘upset’ to be the target of abuse
              from Aston Villa fans but is now resolved to ignore feedback from the
              terraces, whether good or bad.</strong></p>
              <p>Agbonlahor has enjoyed an impressive season in Villa’s colours
              having scored 11 goals in 32 Premier League appearances and made his
              international debut with England.</p>
              <p>But that did not stop some sections of the club’s support from
              booing him when he was substituted during a defeat to Tottenham Hotspur
              on March 15.</p>
              <p>For a born-and-bred Brummie, Agbonlahor has conceded that the abuse
              was difficult to hear, even if he believes it did stem from the fans’
              frustration with a poor run of form from Martin O’Neill’s side.</p>
              <p>"Yes, that was a bit upsetting", the Agbonlahor told the Daily Telegraph. "You don't expect that from your own fans.</p>
              <p>“Ever since I started here I've always had the crowd on my side,
              cheering my name and stuff. So to have that happen didn't feel right.</p>
              <p>"I don't really know why they did it. They were probably upset
              because they'd been used to seeing us win games and in the top four for
              a long time. Maybe they wanted to take it out on someone.</p>
              <p>"But that's fans for you. It's not just at Villa, it's the same at
              most clubs. Eboue got it at Arsenal, didn't he? If they're used to
              winning games they turn quite quickly and look for people to blame when
              things go wrong.</p>
              <p>“I think to myself, if they want to do that then I'll block it out
              and just play my own game. Pretend I can't hear them, even when I start
              playing well again."</p>
