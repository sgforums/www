              <p><strong>TOKYO (AFP) - Former Asian Player of the Year Shinji Ono left Japan
                      Monday to join German first division side VfL Bochum, with a hope to
                      start playing in a February 3 match against Werder Bremen.</strong><br> <br> Former Feyenoord midfielder Ono, 28, is to go through a medical on Tuesday before officially signing a contract.<br> <br> Ono had joined Bochum's practice sessions earlier this month, but returned home after injuring left ankle.<br> <br> "I think my condition has improved a lot. I can practice with no
                      strange feeling," he said at Narita airport near Tokyo as he embarked
                      on his second stint in Europe.<br> <br> "I want to work there so that I can start playing from the game on February 3," he said.<br> <br> Ono, a veteran of three World Cups, first joined Urawa in 1998 and
                      returned to the J-League side on a three-year contract in January 2006
                      after five seasons with Dutch giants Feyenoord.<br> <br> Acclaimed for his vision and pinpoint passing, Ono helped
                      Feyenoord win the UEFA Cup in 2002 when he was named Asian Player of
                      the Year.<br> <br> But recurring injuries sidelined him for much of the last J-League season, which ended in November.<br> <br> Ono trained with Bochum earlier this month but the Bundesliga side
