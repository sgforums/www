              <p><span><strong>Forget about London Fashion Week and ignore what's happening on the catwalks of New York and Milan.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The smartest gear for next season will soon hit the shops and you can get a first look right here as the Premier League teams unveil their home, away and third kits for the new campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span>Some supporters will be desperate to pull on their their new strip while some will be thinking 'it's just not me' but will wear it anyway. </span></p>
              <p><span>How many bigger-built fans have their fingers crossed their club doesn't go down the skinny-fit route Spurs went down a few seasons ago? </span></p>
              <p><span>And before the official release there's bound to be some dodgy fakes doing the rounds on the internet.</span></p>
              <p><span>So with a whole host of new strips hitting the stores in the coming weeks - Sportsmail brings you the best - and worst - of what's on offer throughout the summer.</span></p>

              <h2 style="background-color: #ff0000; color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">ARSENAL</span></h2>
              <p><span>A fading title challenge aside, Arsenal don't have much to cheer these days (just take a look at the Emirates trophy cabinet) so to make up for it, the kit next season is set to celebrate their 125th anniversary. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>This is the unofficial version doing the rounds on the worldwide web and </span><span>it looks a little lost without a white collar.</span></p>
              <p><span>The away number looks to be a mock-up but carries the same detail around the badge as seen on the home kit. Possibly worse than the wine effort from 2005-06. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Fans will hope the official kit is a bit more exciting. <strong>Sportsmail verdict 6/10 </strong></span><span>

              <p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span>They may be slightly off the pace with a handful of games to go in the Premier League but Chelsea have stolen a march on their rivals by bursting out of the traps in the fashion race.</span></p>
              <p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span>The new home kit takes inspiration from Chelsea strips of the early 1980s with the shadow striped design on the front while the white shoulder pad has been added to make adidas' iconic three stripes stand out.</span></p>

              <p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span>Judging by the presence of the Premier League badge on the sleeve, the home kit was designed before Sunderland started their alarming slide down the table.</span></p>
              <p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span>But ignoring the fact that relegation is still a possibility, this is a smart effort from Umbro, who have kept a simple design with the stripes but included a black trim around the collar and sleeves that looks neat and tidy.</span></p>

              <p>The Gunners are set to officially unveil their new strip on Monday — but SunSport has obtained a leaked image ahead of the launch.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's new outfit commemorates the club's 125th anniversary and is modelled by England midfielder Jack Wilshere.</p>
              <p>The shirt is a simpler designer than the current jersey, with no trim on the collar of the shirt or sleeves this time around.</p>
              <p>The club crest is emblazoned on the front of the top as usual but this time features a white wreath surrounding it.</p>
              <p>It is a nod to the first badge the team used when they were formed in 1886 as Dial Square FC which included three cannons on a shield and a wreath around the edges.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>For football supporters one of the worst nightmares is finding out your club has released a strip with colours from bitter rivals.</strong></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580; font-size: x-small;">Liverpool</span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;"> fans probably thought they would never see the day but after the Merseyside club unveiled a new third kit, they will see their team play in the blue of local rivals </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580; font-size: x-small;">Everton</span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;"> next season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The strip for the 2011/12 campaign is mainly white but shows enough blue trim to probably cause enough Reds followers to face an identity crisis on away days from Anfield next term.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fear not though Liverpool fans as the ‘cyan’ colour choice from Adidas is in fact a nod towards the club's first home kit from almost 120 years ago which incorporated white and blue halves. It wasn’t until Bill Shankly became manager that the home kit became completely red, in 1964.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The new design takes its inspiration from the classic tracksuit tops of the 1980s, incorporating the diagonal stripe across the front of the shirt.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It’s Liverpool’s second new strip revealed this summer after releasing a black away kit last month, but it will still cost fans a wallet-hitting £50 for an adult replica which can be pre-ordered before it goes on sale on July 14.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Either way it’s the closest you will get to seeing any blue in the Kop end next season.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A fading title challenge aside, Arsenal don't have much to cheer these days (just take a look at the Emirates trophy cabinet) so to make up for it, the kit next season is set to celebrate their 125th anniversary. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This is the official version of the new kit, sported by defender Gael Clichy, and it looks a little lost without a white collar.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Following the arrival of £24million Darren Bent in January, Aston Villa fans probably had something else in mind when they heard they would be seeing more cheques in the summer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sadly for them it may turn out the ‘checks’ are for their new home strip – with this latest rumoured kit from Nike not stretching too far into innovation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In fact take away the claret checks and you just have Villa’s home shirt from the 2008/09 season with a slight change to the collar.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In truth it doesn’t look that bad but you just think Nike are scraping the barrel for trying to think of ways to design a Villa kit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">With the existing home strip being sold at a reduced price on the club website, a new home kit looks to be on the horizon – but best leave the checks to the Croatians.<strong> </strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rumours that Bolton’s new home strip was designed by a five-year-old dizzy on lemonade are yet to be founded, either way this is enough to give you a migraine.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The only credit to Reebok is that they have been ambitious with their latest attempt and no fan can complain that it looks remotely similar to any other strip in seasons gone by.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But judging by the look on Kevin Davies’ face, he doesn’t seem overjoyed with the latest design and it's hard to imagine where you can wear this anywhere outside the Reebok Stadium without being laughed at...and that's before you get to the netting/see-through material on the front of the shirt.</span></p>
              <p><span>Bolton may have got away with this in the fashion-challenged early 90s, but it’s hard to see this being looked back on as being innovative or classic a few years down the line. <strong>Sportsmail Verdict 3/10</strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Good news Liverpool fans. Your team‘s new third strip (right) for the 2011/12 season will be one of the classiest looking in the Premier League.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Bad news is it will share the colours of local rivals Everton!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Adidas have tried to side-step the issue by calling it cyan, but the colour choice is in fact a nod to the club’s first home kit worn almost 120 years ago which incorporated blue and white halves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">There is more positives though as this kit is soaked in technology including Techfit and Climacool, which somehow increase speed, endurance and awareness….no we don’t know how a football kit can do this either but it is still going to cost you £50</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">On design alone it looks excellent, but points are deducted for putting blue on a Liverpool kit which is sure to split fans.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">If the Liverpool players aren't careful they'll fade into the background during their midweek matches in the winter next season with this new strip.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But then again, maybe that's what the club want, in case they have another disastrous start to the season and find themselves in the bottom half of the table once again.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Joking aside, the Anfield club have chosen a smart number for their new campaign, a top that could even look classy on the right person.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The future is bright for Manchester City but they are certainly not leading the way in kit designs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Umbro's idea of a new home strip seems to be just change to a v-neck collar and switch the sponsor colour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This is only a rumoured effort but fans will be hoping for something a little more adventurous ahead of their first season in the Champions League. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sportsmail verdict 6/10</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A red and black striped away shirt is certainly not new to fans with the inspiration taken from the most famous shirt in the club’s history – the black and red shirt worn in 1969 and 1970 during which time City won the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners Cup.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Indeed it is a smart design with its simplistic stripes and we think the gold marking on the sponsor and logos are pulled off well.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">For this reason, there is no seam on the underarm as traditionally stitching can distort the shape and flow of a stripe.' according to designers Umbro.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">After an experiment with the black rugby league-style 'v' last season and a tacky retro number for this campaign, Nike have lost all creativity and plumped for a plain red shirt with a weird black and white collar. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It looks like it was designed in no more than five minutes and for an extra £10 on top of the already pricey £44.99, fans can choose to customise their kit with the lettering 'champions' and No.19 in gold on the reverse. <br></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And now for something completely different. Full marks to Puma for trying to give Newcastle's black and white stripes a new twist.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">An interesting addition is the 'go faster' stripes down the front - which neatly incorporates the sponsor's logo - but there is still no hard evidence these work on cars... or footballers. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Newcastle's loyal fans won't be too bothered what it looks like as long as they can easily whip it off to reveal a bare chest on a freezing cold evening at a ground near you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The most original Toon kit in a long time, a lot better than the cream-cracker effort from two seasons back. <strong>Sportsmail verdict 8/10</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And speaking of change strips, the Toon have released a new third kit too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">We are a bit puzzled by this one. Yes it looks very stylish with its different shade diagonal lines and white stripes going across the front of the chest. And even the gold Puma logo and badge look decent.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But the point of a change strip is so that there is no clash of colours, and here we have a home strip that is black and white and a third strip that is...well...black and white.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">We await an away kit that is white with black trim, but as a stand alone strip this is a solid effort by Puma, even if those shady lines are just recycled from Tottenham's 2009/10 yellow kit.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Norwich are the first of the Premier League's promoted sides to release a new kit but this effort is hardly going to get Canary supporters chirping with excitement.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fabrizio Taddei, Errea Sales Director however was more optimistic, he said: 'Once the fans see the new 'Creato in Italia' range we are sure they will be delighted not only with the styling and quality, but also with the fact that the clothing is produced in the EU and carries the unique Oeko-Tex non-toxic textiles guarantee.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Stoke fans have already been through an identity crisis this season when the traditional stripes were removed from the back of the club's home strip.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But they will be pleased to hear that although they will have to shell out another £45 on a new home shirt, the stripes look set return to the back of the strip.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The club website is taking pre-orders on the kit but has not yet released an official picture.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Adidas have taken things to a new level for the away kit, unveiling a kit that the club believes makes them resemble Inter Milan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">With the club in Europe next term, even captain Ryan Shawcross couldn’t help but notice the obvious link with the Italian giants.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘Let’s hope we can play like Inter Milan too,' he said. 'It looks very impressive and I am sure it will be a winner with our fans.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It’s a neat enough effort from Adidas, even with that slightly annoying collar. But despite the optimism of Shawcross, don’t expect the Potters to be challenging for a Champions League place just yet. <br></span></p>

              <p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Judging by the presence of the Premier League badge on the sleeve, the home kit was designed before Sunderland started their alarming slide down the table.</span></p>
              <p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">But ignoring the fact that relegation was still a possibility late in the season, this is a smart effort from Umbro, who have kept a simple design with the stripes but included a black trim around the collar and sleeves that looks neat and tidy.</span></p>

              <p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Much of the heavy black trim has gone from the previous design replaced with faint black lines which look fine until you notice the front of the shirt.</span><span><br></span></p>
              <p style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The line going across the chest looks like somebody has made a mistake with a ballpoint pen on the design template and is going to take some getting used to.</span><span><br></span></p>
