              <p>That's cutting their own throats. Hodgson going to get fired soon.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti got a very bad habit; likes to use all his 3 subs too early. Then when one of his players gets injured in the 80+ min he has no choice but to play with 10 men.</p>

              <p><br> I think you are mistaken... That was a looooooong time ago already.
              And the Inter of those days isn't like what they are in last year
              Mourinho days... Anyway, Roy didn't won them anything either during
              his time there i belief... And how long was he there? And was he
              successful?</p>
              <p>He than went on to Blackburn, who were champions just 2 yrs ago
              hoping to get back into the big time after 2 poor seasons. But
              unfortunately, though he was sacked in mid season, it was still too
              late. Roy was more or less partly responsible for them getting
              relegated too...</p>
              <p>He then went on to manage smaller clubs like...</p>

              <p>Looking at the list, you can understand why I
              said Liverpool of course was the biggest of them all for
              him... And he has only won stuff in Swedish and Danish leagues, not
              exactly something to shout about correct?</p>
              <p>And the term "inexperienced", is at managing a bigger
              club with lots of good players while balancing his youth squad
              at the same time in the Premier League... Therefore applies to
              Harry too... Cos if you look at Spurs now and last year, there is a
              difference... Harry have a bigger squad and also more better
              players than he ever had at his disposal... This is the first time
              he have to juggle with the Champions League in his managerial
              career too i belief... Last season he played players like
              Defoe, Bale, Gomes, Lennon etc... in the Carling cup, this year
              even against Arsenal, the closest to a first team player was
              <span style="color: #000000;">Benoit Assou-Ekotto that took to the
              pitch... See the difference?</span></p>
              <p>Therefore, the "inexperienced" is meant as mixing everything in
              and juggling them successfully... In other words, he
              have to prioritise them even more this season unlike the last
              few...</p>

              <p><br>Err... not necessary so. </p>
              <p>Yeah, Inter's struggled for a very long period of time we have to say... Their last season Champions League final win was like their first in almost 50 yrs. Whereas Pool's was like only 5 yrs ago... We have to be realistic here. Big in the sense of club reputation and history alone or big in the sense of wealth and squad size?</p>
              <p>The inter of those days can't really be consider big among the Italian clubs. Pool on the other hand, though they are no longer the power they used to be, but they still have a decently huge squad to select from.</p>
              <p>And again I would say the term "inexperienced", is at managing a bigger club (compare to his list of former ones) with lots of good players while at the same time balancing his youth / reserved squad in the Premier League...</p>
              <p>Football has changed in some way, 7 yrs ago Chelsea wasn't consider a big club but they had selection problems only most big clubs would have... Today, Spurs and City are also still not consider "very big clubs" but they also have to prioritise their matches.  </p>
              <p>Therefore, the "inexperienced" is meant at not having done this before in his Premier League career or entire managing career... The word is juggling, And doing it successfully too at the same time... </p>
