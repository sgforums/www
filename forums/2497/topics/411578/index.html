              <p>Liverpool were beaten 4-2 on penalties by League Two strugglers Northampton.</p>
              <p>And after defeat by the Cobblers, boss Hodgson declared: "I can only apologise to the fans who expected to see us win.</p>
              <p>"The fact is the players have to accept responsibility. I accept the responsibility for changing a lot of players in the team but I thought they were good enough to win the game but they weren't.</p>

              <p><strong>"When you play a team from three leagues below, you expect to win. When you don't win you have to take criticism from the top down.</strong></p>
              <p>"We must all take our responsibility. It's a major setback for the club as a whole, of course it is."</p>
              <p>The match finished 2-2 thanks to David Ngog's late leveller. But Ngog and Nathan Eccleston missed from the spot, allowing Abdul Osman to net the winner.</p>
              <p>Cobblers boss Ian Sampson said: "I'm delighted - we'll have a few beers on the bus.</p>
              <p>"You're all more than welcome. We will make it a party bus."</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580; font-size: small;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>'s </strong></span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>flops have apologised to their fans for the 'catastrophe' of losing at home to minnows Northampton in the Carling Cup.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The Reds were dumped out on penalties by the League Two side at Anfield after being held to a 2-2 after extra-time. It piles the pressure on manager Roy Hodgson, who has already come out to say sorry for the performance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">And now the players have admitted they need to drastically improve their form as their season threatens to collapse early on. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Striker Milan Jovanovic, who scored his debut goal to open the scoring last night, said: 'It was a catastrophe. I am so disappointed. What can I say?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'It was a very difficult night for me, for all the players and the team. Of course we feel sorry for the fans. We know this is not Liverpool. It is very bad.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I am so surprised by the performance. I have not got enough experience of English football but I didn't expect this.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'We had a lot of young players and sometimes you need experience. We tried to run a lot but we lost our condition and it ended up being difficult to do something special in attack.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'But this is football. I am so disappointed. We all are. We are sorry for the result but we have to move on now.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Liverpool, who started the season with a renewed sense of optimism under Rafa Benitez's successor Hodgson, already find themselves well off the pace in the Barclays Premier League after a slow start to the campaign. </span></p>

              <p>It seems rather ironic that all 4 inexperienced managers got it wrong for the Carling Cup... All of them have not done it before. Lotti, Roy, Harry and Mancini all tried to put out a youth or reserved side and believed they could still win easily but they all fall flat... Lotti and Harry have been playing first team players last year for the Carling cup but this time around, change to follow Arsenal and United's style but ended up losing their way...</p>
              <p>Of the 4 in here, I have to say the one that would feel the pain most in my opinion would be Liverpool. Cos, at least Spurs, Chelsea and City could say they came up against premiership opponent's first team sides and for City, it was an away match too. Liverpool on the other hand, what can we say... A League 2 side, a club in the old 4th Division, a home game... a home crowd to back them all the way... This is what one would have expected a stroll in the park for them... And also, the Carling cup would represent a genuine chance of a trophy for them this season... So losing yesterday was a very big setback to them.</p>
              <p>Just think of the amount of gate collection they will lose out... If the money meant anything to these clubs, Liverpool probably would need it more than the other 3... What was Roy thinking i am not sure putting out a team that couldn't win a League 2 side... In this instance, Roy clearly showed his inexperience with managing a bigger club while balancing his youth squad at the side time... I guess it must be new territory for him.</p>

              <p>It seems rather ironic that all 4 inexperienced managers
              got it wrong for the Carling Cup... All of them have not done it
              before. Lotti, Roy, Harry and Mancini all tried to put out a
              youth or reserved side and believed they could still win easily
              but they all fall flat... Lotti and Harry have been
              playing first team players last year for the Carling cup but this
              time around, change to follow Arsenal and United's style but
              ended up losing their way...</p>

              <p><br>I think you are mistaken... That was a looooooong time ago already. And the Inter of those days isn't like what they are in last year Mourinho days... Anyway, Roy didn't won them anything either during his time there i belief... And how long was he there? And was he successful?</p>
              <p>He than went on to Blackburn, who were champions just 2 yrs ago hoping to get back into the big time after 2 poor seasons. But unfortunately, though he was sacked in mid season, it was still too late. Roy was more or less partly responsible for them getting relegated too...</p>
              <p>He then went on to manage smaller clubs like...</p>

              <p>Looking at the list, you can understand why I said Liverpool of course was the biggest of them all for him... And he has only won stuff in Swedish and Danish leagues, not exactly something to shout about correct?</p>
              <p>And the term "inexperienced", is at managing a bigger club with lots of good players while balancing his youth squad at the same time in the Premier League... Therefore applies to Harry too... Cos if you look at Spurs now and last year, there is a difference... Harry have a bigger squad and also more better players than he ever had at his disposal... This is the first time he have to juggle with the Champions League in his managerial career too i belief... Last season he played players like Defoe, Bale, Gomes, Lennon etc... in the Carling cup, this year even against Arsenal, the closest to a first team player was <span style="color: #000000;">Benoit Assou-Ekotto that took to the pitch... See the difference?</span></p>
              <p>Therefore, the "inexperienced" is meant as mixing everything in and juggling them successfully... In other words, he have to prioritise them even more this season unlike the last few...</p>

              <p>that's the beauty of the cup games, it is a one off match that the smaller clubs give their all. and if the bigger clubs are caught, then it is just too bad. all big teams got caught b4, not surprising given their priorities.</p>
              <p>as for the MUFC clone, stop lamblasting Pool.  They are still the team with the most EPL and European Cups. Until someone else come along and knock them off, they are still tops.</p>
