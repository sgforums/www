              <p><strong>James Milner is close to finally completing his £24million move to Manchester City after having a medical at Eastlands.</strong></p>
              <p>The protracted deal between City and Aston Villa has eventually been agreed - with Stephen Ireland moving to Villa Park as a makeweight. Villa will receive £16m plus the £8m-rated midfielder Ireland.</p>

              <p>City boss Roberto Mancini said: 'I hope we can close it between today and tomorrow. I think that Milner is a good player, an English player which is important. I think that Milner can play in different positions.'</p>
              <p>Milner has been a top target for big-spending City all summer, although the deal has been held up by Villa's asking price and Ireland's demands for a pay-off.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JAMES MILNER finally walked into Manchester City and vowed: I'm here to win the title.</h2>
              <p>Stephen Ireland - rated at £8m - has moved to Villa Park in the opposite direction as part of the deal.</p>
              <p>Milner has been handed the No 7 shirt and could face Liverpool in his first match on Monday night. He was not registered in time for Thursday's Europa League clash with Timisoara.</p>
              <p>Mancini said: 'I am very happy to have James with us, everybody knows we have admired him for some time.</p>
              <p>'He is an excellent midfielder, who can play in a number of positions. This is important for the team, and I am looking forward to seeing him play for us. We have a very strong squad, and this signing is a very important one for us.</p>
              <p>'James he is already a very good player, who has proved he can play at the very top level. 'But he is also young and a good character, I think he can also improve and be a great player for Manchester City for a long time.'</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>On Ireland's departure, Mancini added: 'I hope things go well for Stevie at Villa. He is also a very good player, and he has played a big part in City’s history.</strong></p>
              <p>'I think he will enjoy the change of being at another club, and I hope he does well for Aston Villa.'</p>
              <p>Milner's future had been the subject of ongoing speculation since Villa rejected a bid of around £20million from City in May.</p>
              <p>Then Villa boss Martin O'Neill revealed last month that the midfielder had asked for a move away from Villa Park and had refused to sign a new contract.</p>
              <p>Villa's decision to sell Milner and how much of the fee O'Neill would be able to reinvest in the transfer market were rumoured to be key factors in the Northern Irishman's shock resignation last week.</p>
              <p>Under O'Neill, Milner developed into one of England's top midfielders last season, proving a revelation after moving from the wing into the centre.</p>
              <p>The two clubs finally agreed a fee but the deal was held up still further by the involvement of Ireland, who reportedly demanded a £2million pay-off from City.</p>
              <p>Milner played in Villa's opening Barclays Premier League game of the season against West Ham last Saturday and scored in a 3-0 win, earning a standing ovation as he bade his farewell.</p>
              <p>But the transfer has now finally gone through, bringing an end to two years at Villa Park for Milner and eight years with City for Ireland.</p>
              <p>Ireland, now 23, looked set for a great future at Eastlands after breaking into the first team as a teenager and then picking up the club's player of the year award for the 2008/09 season.</p>
              <p>But his opportunities dried up once Mancini replaced Mark Hughes last autumn and the Italian made it clear Ireland's future lay elsewhere</p>
              <p>Milner becomes City's eighth signing of the transfer window and follows in the footsteps of former Villa team-mate Gareth Barry, who moved to Eastlands last summer.</p>
              <p>He said: "It didn't take too much selling by the boss when you see the players who are already here.</p>
              <p>"The last thing he said to me was 'be ready to win the Premier League'.</p>
              <p>"That's my ultimate aim - that's why I'm here."</p>
