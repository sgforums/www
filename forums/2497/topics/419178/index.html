              <p><strong>Ronaldinho is being offered around England for £7million in the hope of sparking interest from the likes of <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea </span><span style="color: #000000;">and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The AC Milan star is wanted by clutch of Brazilian clubs - including Flamengo, Palmeiras and hometown side Gremio - but none has shown willingness to meet the asking price.</p>
              <p>Ronaldinho is out of contract at the end of the season and Milan do not want him to walk out for nothing just three years after arriving from Barcelona for almost £15m.</p>
              <p>The LA Galaxy would love to team the 30-year-old up with David Beckham in an MLS line-up that would evoke memories of the star-studded New York Cosmos, but clubs in England, Italy and Spain have all be invited to enter the bidding when the January transfer window opens.</p>
              <p>Ronaldinho’s brother and agent Roberto de Assis has indicated there is concrete interest from Barclays Premier League clubs and said: ‘There are many Brazilian clubs interested in Ronaldinho, but I won’t rule out a European move. It seems clear his time with the Rossoneri is at an end.’</p>
              <p>Despite showing signs of a return to form early in the season, Milan coach Massimo Allegri has not given him a Serie A start since mid-October and can justify the snub by their position at the top of the table.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool were linked with a move for the two-time FIFA World Player of the Year earlier this month, though Anfield boss Roy Hodgson insisted he had ‘never even thought’ about making a move.</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester City made a move for him back in 2008 when they were looking for a commercially attractive impact signing, but are likely to now turn their nose up at a player who has been marginalised at the San Siro because of the rise of Robinho - a player who flopped so spectacularly at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Milan may also struggle to tempt Chelsea. Roman Abramovich has previously been prepared to fund a move for a player he so admired at the peak of his Barcelona days, but is unlikely to see little value in a player demanding £100,000 a week.</p>
              <p>Also, Stamford Bridge boss Carlo Ancelotti was not a fan of Ronaldinho when the coach led AC Milan before moving to England. Keeping the playmaker out of the Rossoneri starting XI led to friction with money man Silvio Berlusconi, but the Milan president has finally sanctioned the sale of his showpiece signing.</p>
              <p>Manchester United tried to sign him in 2003 but a move now would be a retrograde step for the table-toppers.</p>
              <p>Despite claims of interest, few others could afford Ronaldinho’s wages, and, in any case, whether he would be prepared to play for anyone but a Champions League side is questionable.</p>
