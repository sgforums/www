              <h2>UEFA APPROVE FINANCIAL FAIR PLAY RULES</h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>UEFA have approved plans to force clubs in European competition to 
              only spend what they earn with the body's president Michel Platini 
              insisting they want to "protect clubs and not punish them".</p>
              <p>The financial fair play rules will require clubs to break even 
              over a rolling three-year period if they want to play in the Champions 
              League or Europa League.</p>
              <p>Clubs will also be assessed on a risk basis, taking into account 
              "debts and salary levels", UEFA say.</p>
              <p>Platini, speaking after UEFA's executive committee had approved 
              the rules at a meeting in Nyon, Switzerland, said: "We have worked on 
              the financial fair play concept hand-in-hand with the clubs, as our 
              intention is not to punish them, but to protect them.</p>
              <p>"We have an agreement with the clubs. The philosophy is that you 
              cannot spend more money than you generate.</p>
              <p>"This approval today is the start of an important journey for 
              European football's club finances as we begin to put stability and 
              economic common sense back into football. I thank all the stakeholders 
              who have supported this along the way."</p>
              <p>There will be some leeway granted for the six years after 2012 
              but some Premier League clubs, notably Manchester City, Chelsea and 
              Aston Villa could still fall foul of the rule unless they change their 
              spending habits.</p>
              <p>Manchester United have carried out a 'dummy test' and believe 
              they would pass the rules despite the handicap of paying out £45million 
              to service their debts every year.</p>
              <p>Arsenal and Tottenham would pass the test comfortably, while 
              Liverpool, Celtic and Rangers would probably do so too.</p>
              <p>A United spokesman said: "We support the financial fair play 
              measures. We are confident that we pass them and that we will continue 
              to do so."</p>
              <p>The chairman of the European Club Association (ECA), Karl-Heinz 
              Rummenigge, said the new rules were "a huge achievement" that would 
              shape the future of European club football into a more responsible and 
              sustainable business."</p>
              <p>The new UEFA scheme will come into effect in 2012 although some 
              leeway is given for an introductory period.</p>
              <p>It is understood that initially clubs must not return losses of 
              more then 45million euros (£38million) for the 2012-15 period. After 
              2015, clubs are given a leeway of 30million (£26million) for three-year 
              losses after which the figure will be reduced still further.</p>
              <p>If clubs breach the rules then they will not be granted a UEFA 
              club licence to take part in European competitions.</p>
              <p>The rules will also limit the amount of cash 'sugar 
              daddies' will be able to pour into the clubs to fund transfers and high 
              wages, though they will be allowed to finance capital projects such as 
              stadiums and academies.</p>
              <p>Attempts to bypass the rules by owners handing out huge 
              sponsorship contracts to their clubs from other companies they own will 
              also be checked by an independent watchdog panel appointed by UEFA to 
              ensure they are not paying above the market rate.</p>
              <p>The FA and Premier League - who will be the bodies that jointly 
              provide the UEFA licences to English clubs - have given the new rules a 
              cautious welcome.</p>
              <p>A joint statement from the organisations read: "The FA and the 
              Premier League are fully supportive of the principle of sustainability 
              and of football clubs living within their means.</p>
              <p>"The vast majority of what has been agreed by UEFA is in line 
              with current domestic regulations and English football will respect any 
              rules put in place for clubs competing in Europe.</p>
              <p>"We recognise the difficult task undertaken by UEFA in this 
              process and we have asked that certain issues be monitored so as to 
              ensure these rules do not create unintended consequences such as 
              preventing smaller clubs from having the opportunity to invest the 
              resources required to compete at a higher level."</p>
              <p></p>
