              <h1>Bergkamp Warns Lampard About Inter</h1>
              <h2>With Frank Lampard possibly on his way to Inter Milan, former Arsenal star Dennis Bergkamp has told the Sunday Mirror of his nightmare spell at the San Siro.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/2294_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Dutch forward spent two years at Inter before moving to Arsenal in 1995. Despite being signed from Ajax for £12 million, Bergkamp couldn’t find his best form in Italy and managed only 11 goals in 50 appearances for the club.</strong></p>
              <p>Speaking in the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>, Bergkamp confessed he had been much happier in England than in Italy. He said: “Once you play in the Premier League you realise there is nothing better. It is difficult to see the beauty of the Italian League.”</p>
              <p>The former Gunner also went on to explain why he had struggled to adapt to life in Serie A. Bergkamp admitted: “Knowing you can hardly ever play real attacking football makes you desperate when you have been brought up with a different work ethic.”</p>
              <p>Although Bergkamp possesses a UEFA Cup winners’ medal from his time at Inter it is clear that he does not look back on his time there fondly. He said: “The problem for an attack-minded player in Italy is that you can never play your own game.”</p>
              <p>Bergkamp’s words are likely to interest Lampard who is the subject of much speculation over a proposed move to Inter. The Milanese club have reportedly already made a bid for the Chelsea star who looks set to leave Stamford Bridge this summer.</p>
              <p>However, Bergkamp also went on to discuss Italian football further, and spoke of how he felt it was all about the result rather than the style of play.</p>
              <p>“Their fans are happy with a draw. Some times they consider a draw like a win. It is all about the result,” said Bergkamp before adding, “I care about the results, too. But great players also care about the style of play.”</p>
              <p>Bergkamp also revealed the media interest in Milan was heavy which Lampard may want to bear in mind should he decide to swap London for Milan. Bergkamp concluded: “There were also intrusions into my private life I did not like.”</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=international_feed/08/07/13/SOCCER_Ita-Internazionale.html"><img src="http://cdn.wn.com/o25/ph//2008/07/13/04b8520a5a6b47e2c8b8ab9c74176354-grande.jpg" border="0" alt=" Patrick Vieira from France" width="468" height="366"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Inter Milan's Patrick Vieira believes Frank Lampard is more than capable of making his mark on Italian football if he completes his move to the San Siro. </strong></p>
              <p>Vieira is well aware of Lampard's talent, having squared up to him in midfield several times while playing for Arsenal, and the World Cup winner is convinced that Lampard is up to the challenge of Italian football.</p>
              <p>"It will be a big challenge for him but at the same time it will be a fantastic one," Vieira told the Sunday Mirror. "He has won everything there is to win at Chelsea, he is one of the key men in the team there. "Would he be welcome at Inter? He is a fantastic player and you want to play with players of that class. It will be one more good player."</p>
              <p>Vieira's former team-mate at Arsenal, Dennis Bergkamp, found it hard to adapt to the defensive style of play and was one of the many high-profile flops in Serie A. But the France midfielder is confident Lampard would not be among that number. "I know that the change in lifestyle would not be a problem," continued Vieira. "Frank would adjust to that.</p>
              <p>"On the field there is less space than there is in England. It is more congested and that is why you don't get many 3-3 or 4-4 draws. "It is not as open as it is in England. But he can adapt, don't worry.</p>
              <p>Vieira believes Lampard could help finally end Inter's Champions League hoodoo. The Serie A giants have won the Scudetto for three years on the trot but last won Europe's premier club competition in 1965.</p>
              <p>"He can enjoy himself at Inter, I really believe that," said Vieira. "Inter is a club that is going up as a football club. Now we want the Champions League. The club have the motivation and the ambition to do that. "If Frank comes here then we will be stronger. The better players you have then the better chance you have."</p>
              <p>Vieira also feels that Lampard will easily fit into the Inter dressing room. "I spoke with the players I know at Chelsea about him and all those players love him," he continued. "There must be a reason for that.</p>
              <p>"Now the aim is to win the league title in Italy, which we have done for the last (three) years, and the Champions League is a big target for us."</p>
