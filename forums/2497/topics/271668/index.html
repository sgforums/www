            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_03/083derbyforest_468x350.jpg"><br><br>As a man of the people, the late Brian Clough would have approved of the six-figure sum raised for east Midlands' charities last night.<br><br>As the former manager who led Derby and Nottingham Forest to one league title apiece, he would have been far from happy at the way the two clubs have fared since.<br><br>Pride Park played host to a crowd of over 25,000 as two of his former clubs played a friendly for a trophy in honour of the legendary manager who shoved the two cities into the consciousness of English football.<br><br>First-half goals from Jay McEveley and Craig Fagan emphasised the gulf between the sides as Premiership Derby romped home.<br><br>In life, Clough walked tall in both cities. After his death three years ago, the A52 dual carriageway linking the two cities was renamed Brian Clough Way in a bid to smooth a path. There was no commotion among the two sets of supporters when the idea was mooted days after his passing. Tribal differences were also largely shoved to one side yesterday evening, despite the presence of 4,200 Forest fans.<br><br>And why not? Football fans recognise greatness when they see it. In 1972, Clough masterminded unfashionable Derby's rise to the First Division summit. A year later, they contested a European Cup semi-final.<br><br>At Forest, he went one better - or rather two better. Not once, but twice, the continent's finest were swept aside as an unfashionable team from the provinces won the trophy.<br><br>Yet the years since Clough have not been the kindest to either club, who have gone nowhere near reaching those lofty heights.<br><br>Frank Clark's star shone briefly over the City Ground in the mid 90s, but Forest's demise is the stuff of fans' worst nightmares as they became the first European Champions to fall into the third tier.<br><br>After yo-yoing between the top flights, seeds of decline were sown after the 2002-03 play-off semi-final defeat. The core of a young side was ripped out. Two years later, they were in League One.<br><br>Given the astounding backing of owner Nigel Doughty - estimates put his 'investment' at Â£42million in six years - Forest's fall is close to being unique. Yet a decade of decline under various managers must have led this generous patriarch to wonder whether devotion to any club is worth the effort or cost.<br><br>Derby may be back in the Premiership but were it not for the spectacular coup by a collection of well-heeled businessmen 12 months ago, when they negotiated a deal to wrestle the club from a Â£50m-plus black hole, they could also have been contemplating life in the lower reaches. Relegation hits hard and Derby were among the first to discover that. Maladministration sent them into a decline that appeared inexorable 13 months ago.<br><br>They have see-sawed between divisions since Clough walked out.<br><br>Manager Billy Davies was congratulated by Clough's widow, Barbara, after steering his side to play- off victory in May. If nothing else, the Scot respects the history of the club.<br><br>He said of Clough: "He was an outstanding, wonderful manager. What Brian Clough achieved is motivation for us."<br><br>Clough's son Nigel said: "He would have been happy to know that this fixture was taking place. But it wouldn't have caused him a problem. He would have managed Derby in the first half and Forest in the second."</div>
