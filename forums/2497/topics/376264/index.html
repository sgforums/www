              <p><strong>Mark Hughes jumped to the defence of Manchester City's two-goal striker Craig Bellamy after the fiery Welsh star clashed with a fan at Old Trafford this afternoon.</strong></p>
              <p>It was claimed Bellamy struck a spectator who had come onto the pitch as Manchester United recorded an amazing 4-3 victory.</p>
              <p>If the allegation is proved, the Blues striker - who has endured plenty of disciplinary trouble in the past - could find himself in trouble, even though it is against the law for supporters to go onto the field of play.</p>
              <p>Hughes feels that aspect of the confrontation needs to be taken into account, although he fears it will not be.</p>
              <p>"I did not see it but the guy should not have been on the pitch. That is not acceptable," said the City chief.</p>
              <p>"I seem to recall Brian Clough clipping someone around the ear and he was lauded as a national hero. Maybe it will be the same case with Craig but I doubt it.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure people will make a nuisance about it."</p>

              <p><strong>Blackburn forward El-Hadji Diouf has been interviewed by police following allegations made by a ball-boy at Sunday's Barclays Premier League match with Everton at Goodison Park.</strong></p>
              <p>Diouf was seemingly involved in an altercation with a ball-boy during the first half of Everton's 3-0 victory.</p>
              <p>The Senegalese international is believed to have complained that the ball was not thrown back into play quickly enough.</p>
              <p>Diouf then suffered abuse from home fans, and again when he went to take two corners in the area of the original incident.</p>
              <p>After the match police interviewed Diouf at the stadium before the Blackburn team left.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: "We are looking into an allegation that a 28-year-old man used racist language at the Everton match today."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> captain Gary Neville is facing sanction over his "lunatic" celebrations after their derby win on Sunday.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says Neville, an unused sub, ran on to the pitch and then charged down the touchline towards the City fans.</p>
              <p>But realising he had gone over the top, Neville then tried to pretend
              he was simply warming up - despite boss Alex Ferguson having already
              made three substitutions.</p>
              <p>City boss Mark Hughes said: "Neville was running around like a lunatic."</p>
              <p>It is not the first time Neville has been accused of goading opposition supporters.</p>
              <p>He was fined £5,000 after celebrating a late winner against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> at Old Trafford in 2006 in front of the away fans.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man Utd fan regrets clash with Man City's Bellamy</h1>
              <p>The <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> fan who clashed with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> striker Craig Bellamy on Sunday admits he regrets invading the Old Trafford pitch.</p>
              <p>Jake Clarke, who was watching the Manchester derby with his father
              and two brothers, was tackled to the ground before being led away by
              police at Old Trafford after Welsh international Bellamy - who faces a
              three-match ban - appeared to push him in the face as he was being held
              back by security staff.</p>
              <p>Clarke told the <em>Telegraph</em>: “I was flung towards the
              barrier when Michael Owen scored - the place went mad, everyone was
              hugging each other and I can't explain why it happened.</p>
              <p>“I was just loving the moment I guess after all the excitement
              throughout the match. The next thing I was on the pitch just wanting to
              celebrate with the United players.</p>
              <p>“It's not in my blood to want to hurt anyone, I just wanted to cheer them up close.</p>
              <p>“I remember being tackled on the pitch and then I saw Bellamy
              coming over to me. He shouted at me, “Get off the ------- pitch you
              ------- ----head.”</p>
              <p>"He said it a few times then just shoved me in the face.</p>
              <p>“I said to him, “4-3 mate,” and I think he said something else to me before I was taken away."</p>

              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Mark Hughes</strong></span><strong> has defended Craig Bellamy following the Welsh forward's alleged striking of a pitch invader at Old Trafford during the Manchester derby on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>Bellamy appeared to strike the intruder while he was being restrained by stewards, after the fan had encroached on to the playing surface following Michael Owen's late winner for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> in the 4-3 victory over City. But the City manager said the striker was acting in self-defence, describing the incident as "something and nothing".</p>
              <p>"Craig obviously wasn't privy to how much time was left so he wanted the guy to get off as quick as possible and told him so," said the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a> manager. "Obviously the guy has made an aggressive movement towards him, and Craig put up a defensive hand to push the guy away, which he was right to do."</p>
              <p>Hughes confirmed that City are yet to be contacted by the Football Association, but said that this explanation would be the one given to the FA if they did seek to speak to the club.</p>
