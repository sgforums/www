Henry left the north London club this summer in a Â£16.1million switch to Barcelona after eight highly-successful years which saw him become the Gunners' all-time top scorer. </strong><br><br>The 30-year-old never won a European trophy with the club although he was part of the side that reached the 2006 Champions League final before losing 2-1 to Barca. This year, the Gunners have made a flying start to their European campaign and top Group H after victories over Sevilla and Steaua Bucharest. They also lead the Barclays Premier League having dropped just two points all season to confound critics who predicted a tough season following Henry's departure.<br><br>Now the Frenchman has predicted double success for Arsene Wenger's young team, telling the Evening Standard: 'I have been watching Arsenal and see that they are playing entertaining football and winning every game home and away. 'I know the young players there very well and they can definitely win the Premier League and Champions League this season. I watched how they beat Sevilla in the Champions League and I think they sent out a big message to the rest of Europe. Sevilla is not an easy team to play, but Arsenal played a great game.'<br><br>The Gunners experienced a period of unrest in the summer with the shock exit of former vice-chairman David Dein and Henry's departure followed by uncertainty over Wenger's future until the manager agreed a new contract at the Emirates. Henry revealed he has maintained his relationship with his fellow Frenchman, with whom he started his career at Monaco more than 10 years ago.<br><br>'Me and Arsene have been in contact a few times since I left. I always talk to him because even with the difference of age, the bond and respect is there,' Henry said. 'It is tremendous that he has signed a new contract. He has great eyes and just has a talent for spotting young talent. He is a great human being as well and that's what makes the difference. He makes players feel comfortable and always gets the best out of them.'<br><br>Henry wishes to say a final farewell to the Gunners fans, many of whom were distraught at his exit. 'I think I will try and do it in December because we have a winter break in Spain and I will have the time,' Henry added. 'I would rather go back in a non-playing situation and be able to enjoy it. I don't want to get drawn against Arsenal in the Champions League this season. That would not be a proper way to say goodbye to the fans. 'When I go, I will probably just sit in the stands. I won't walk out on the pitch or anything like that.<br><br>'The focus should be on the team and I don't want to draw any attention away from them and what they're doing. They will be playing a game and I want to respect that.' The former Juventus player has experienced a frustrating start to his career at Barca after being ruled out through injury but he now feels he has overcome his problems.<br><br>He said: 'I played eight seasons without missing anything. It was a shock to the system to not play for six months and coming back has not been easy, but I am starting to feel better. 'The pain is going away and I felt sharper for the first time against Real Zaragoza a couple of weeks ago. It's been a long time since I felt like that.<br><br>'The atmosphere is good at Barcelona. It is like a family and reminds me of Arsenal.' Henry, though, is less than optimistic about France's chances for Euro 2008, with Les Bleus third behind Scotland and Italy in Group B. He said: 'We are not even talking about whether we can win Euro 2008 because we are fighting to qualify right now - I don't know if we will. There is a possibility that we will be at home watching it.'</div>
