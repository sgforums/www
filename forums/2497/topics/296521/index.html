And the Italian will be told he can have the job if he shows he is the right man to manage England. With Jose Mourinho officially ruling himself out last night, the job is CapelloÂ’s to lose. </strong><br><br>He is now the overwhelming favourite to replace the axed Steve McClaren. Capello and son Pierfilippo, who is his advisor, will meet FA chief executive Brian Barwick tomorrow or Thursday. If the former Real Madrid chief impresses in the interview he can expect to be unveiled as the new manager Â— possibly as early as Friday.<br><br>Capello wants the job and is flattered by FAÂ’s interest. He has no intention of laying down any diva-like demands and will play it Soho SquareÂ’s way. Capello is keen to have ex-Chelsea star Gianfranco Zola as an assistant. But Capello says he will happily agree to FA demands to have some English involvement on his coaching staff.<br><br>Under-21 boss Stuart Pearce and strike legend Alan Shearer are in the running for a top role.<br><br>Capello has also indicated his personal terms will not be excessive. The stumbling block is that he does not speak English but he is willing to learn and the FA do not believe it is an insurmountable problem. If the meeting with Capello does not go as planned, which is unlikely, the FA will look towards another Italian, Marcello Lippi, the 2006 World Cup winner.<br><br>Lippi has declared an interest and is willing to talk to the FA on their terms. Both Martin OÂ’Neill and Jurgen Klinsmann remain on the FA radar but the German could be heading for Liverpool if Rafa Benitez is sacked.<br><br>The FAÂ’s plan to bring in an English assistant is seen as important for two main reasons. Firstly, it would be crucial for communicating with the players, fans and media as Capello learns English. It would also give the FA a long-term English successor to take over the reins when the next manager stands down.<br><br>Shearer and Pearce are the favourites but Ports-mouth assistant Tony Adams is in the frame. Capello has won seven Serie A titles, two La Liga championships with Real Madrid and the Champions League with AC Milan. But Madrid chief Predrag Mijatovic has warned England that Capello will struggle to adapt from club football.<br><br>Mijatovic, who hired and fired Capello for Real last season, said: Â“For me, Capello is not an international boss. Â“His ideal habitat is at a club and if itÂ’s a big club, so much the better. He needs a battle every day.Â”<br></div>
