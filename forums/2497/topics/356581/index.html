              <p><strong>Robinho has pledged his long-term future to Manchester City as well
              as denying suggestions that he does not enjoy a productive relationship
              with manager Mark Hughes.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazil star was an immediate success following his British
              record transfer from Real Madrid in August but has not scored in The
              Premier League in 2009.</p>
              <p>Rumours continue to persist that Robinho may not be a long-term
              fixture at Eastlands and he was strongly linked with a possible move to
              Chelsea during the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>But the talented forward has defended his recent performances and
              claims he is focused on winning trophies at Eastlands in the coming
              years.</p>
              <p>"People say perhaps I will be sold but I have a long contract and no
              director has said anything to me," he said in the Sunday People.</p>
              <p>"I want to stay and arrive at the moment when I am the star of a team that wins titles.</p>
              <p>"I am not content with how things have gone this season but I ask
              that people judge me at the end of the campaign and take into
              consideration all that has happened to me since I joined.</p>
              <p>"I was the last one to arrive and that always creates problems of adaptation to the new country and the new system of playing.</p>
              <p>"They are not excuses. I am not playing as I should and there is no
              denying it. The Robinho I hope for has still not been seen in England.
              But like a good professional I keep fighting every day.‚Äù</p>
              <p>Robinho was reprimanded by City after going AWOL in January but
              insists his relationship with Hughes remains intact, despite problems
              that the manager has encountered with his international team-mate and
              friend, Elano.</p>
              <p>"I have no problem with Hughes," he added.</p>
              <p>"He asks me for more on the pitch and I try to deliver. In a lot of games things have not worked as we hoped and that shows.</p>
              <p>"It is not true that there is a distance between me and him. We talk about everything necessary."</p>
