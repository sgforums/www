              <h1>Robinho Could Face Sanction</h1>
              <h2>Robinho’s refusal to play against Valencia on Sunday in the Supercopa might pressure the capital giants to finally let him go, but it is also a dangerous double-edged sword for the player.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/34273_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">The Robinho transfer saga continues to escalate without a resolution in sight. Reports from </span><span lang="EN-GB">Spain</span><span lang="EN-GB"> yesterday alleged that the Brazilian refused to travel with the squad to </span><span lang="EN-GB">Valencia</span><span lang="EN-GB"> to face the Copa del Rey champions in the Spanish Supercup, in an attempt to force Real Madrid’s hand to allow him to join </span><span lang="EN-GB">Chelsea</span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">In an effort to cool down the controversy, the reigning La Liga champions immediately offered the player a new, improved contract believed to be worth around €5 million per season for five years, more than double what he currently earns.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">But according to Catalan-based daily, <em>Sport,</em> the 24 year old has rejected the latest offer and he remains adamant not to play in for the Whites in Sunday’s game. And things are expected to turn very ugly if both parties fail to reach a common ground come kick-off.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Should </span><span lang="EN-GB">Madrid</span><span lang="EN-GB"> coach Bernd Schuster summon Robinho to take to the Mestalla pitch and he blatantly refuses to do so, the capital club could report him to FIFA for a breach of contract. And should he be sanctioned by the governing body, he could be banned from playing for up to two years. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">But there could be an escape route for the former </span><span lang="EN-GB">Santos</span><span lang="EN-GB"> wunderkind. Such has been the stress on the player that <em>Marca</em> reports that he has now gone three nights without sleep. If he is deemed psychologically unfit to play, then the club will have no choice but to exclude him.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The only glimmering light for Los Merengues is that they could use Robinho as a pawn to sign Didier Drogba. The </span><span lang="EN-GB">Ivory Coast</span><span lang="EN-GB"> striker has verbally pledged his future to the Blues but contractually, there hasn’t been any new agreement between player and club to extend his stay.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Real </span><span lang="EN-GB">Madrid</span><span lang="EN-GB"> are currently in the hunt for a proven, world-class goalscorer and Drogba has been a player that they have previously shown interest in. </span></p>

              <p><br>that would also hurt his chances of getting a good deal... i would think he should just submit a transfer request and wait for some other club to make their move while in the mean time play as and when he is call upon.. that would make him more attractive in the transfer market...</p>

              <h1>Robinho Makes Up With Mijatovic - Report</h1>
              <h2>According to Madrid-based daily <em>Marca</em>, Robinho has apparently cleared the air with the Real Madrid hierarchy, opening the door for his taking part in the first leg of the Spanish Supercopa this evening...</h2>

              <p><strong>Earlier this week the mercurial winger was said to be on the verge of sitting out of his side's meeting with Valencia in the Super Cup first leg.</strong><br><br>However coach Bernd Schuster stated yesterday that the Brazilian was feeling fine and training normally, with further reports from today backing this up.<br><br>Yesterday Robinho allegedly met up with sporting director Pedja Mijatovic in the dressing room at Madrid's 'Sport City' in Valdebebas.<br><br>Here Mijatovic reassured the player that he was not in any way surplus to requirements at the Bernabéu and was in fact integral to the manager's plans.<br><br>He further requested of Robinho that he give the Supercopa his maximum concentration, contrary to earlier reports.<br><br>Robinho, for his part, apparently stated that he would take part in tonight's match with all due professionalism, pledging a two-goal haul if he is able to play.<br><br>With no direct quotes Marca's words cannot instantly be taken as fact, but with all voices at Madrid seemingly confirming that Robinho will play tonight it does seem likely that his problems - for now, at least - are over.<br></p>

              <h1>Calderón: No More Signings</h1>
              <h2>There’s still two weeks to go before the transfer market shuts, but Real Madrid president Ramón Calderón has confirmed that the club’s own transfer activities are over.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/22040_news.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Speaking to <em>Marca</em> just moments before his side’s kick-off against </span><span lang="EN-GB">Valencia</span><span lang="EN-GB"> in the Supercopa at the Mestalla, Los Blancos chief, Ramón Calderón stressed that the club will not engage in any more transfer activities this season and further reiterated that Robinho will be staying at the Spanish capital.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">“I have said before that our project to strengthen the squad is complete and I am sure this season will be one where we consolidate our position,” he explained. </span><span lang="EN-GB">“We have a very complete and balanced squad and today (against </span><span lang="EN-GB">Valencia</span><span lang="EN-GB">), we will see if this is the case.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">The president might have to rethink his decision after watching the defending La Liga champions surrender a one-goal lead to lose 3-2 at the Mestalla on Sunday evening in the first leg of the Supercopa.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">One encouraging sign, however, is that Robinho did start and play a majority of the game and Calderón again repeated that the Brazilian will be playing in the white shirt this campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">“I’m absolutely sure he will stay with Real Madrid. I have seen him looking happy and animated in the hotel,” he revealed. </span><span lang="EN-GB">Even the coach has said to me that he is training well and the fact that he will be a key player in the team today proves that,” concluded Calderón emphatically. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">
              </span></span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">In terms of actually completing a signing, Real Madrid have been surprisingly quiet this season in the transfer market by their standards, bringing in only Rafael van der Vaart, former players Rubén de la Red and Javi García and Ezequiel Garay, who looks set to remain on loan with Racing Santander for a season. </span></p>
