              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> are ready to pay whatever fines are incurred by manager Sir Alex Ferguson in his row with the BBC.</strong></p>
              <p>The Premier League board will meet next month to draw up the list of sanctions they plan to impose on United as a result of Ferguson's refusal to give post-match interviews to the broadcaster.</p>
              <p>United are likely to be hit with a series of fines, with the club potentially liable for a £25,000 penalty every time he declines a post-match interview with the BBC.</p>
              <p>That could, in theory, see the fines total £950,000 over the season, but the Premier League are not expected to impose such a massive punishment.</p>
              <p>The League have confirmed that Ferguson will face disciplinary action under new rules introduced this season, which compel clubs to ensure their employees provide interviews for Premier League broadcasters.</p>
              <p>'The new rules were introduced to ensure that the manager and players co-operate with our broadcast partners, so anyone who doesn't is in breach of the rules and subject to the disciplinary procedure,' said a Premier League spokesman.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has refused to comply with the new regulations since the season began and will breach them again today as United take on Liverpool in the most important match of the Premier League season so far.</p>
              <p>He has not spoken to the BBC since they broadcast a documentary in 2004 concerning his son Jason and his links to United.</p>
              <p>Ferguson insists that the BBC should apologise for the documentary if they want him to end his boycott and he is adamant that he will not change his stance.</p>
              <p>The issue has come to a head because of the new rules but, even though United signed up to the new TV contract, a club spokesman said: 'We support Sir Alex Ferguson's position on this.'</p>
              <p>Chief executive David Gill agreed to the rules, along with the other 19 clubs, although sources at United point out that the issue of managers talking to broadcast outlets was not voted on at the time.</p>
              <p>United, though, do accept that, having the signed the contract which included the new rules, the club are in breach of the regulations.</p>
              <p>With the Premier League board of chief executive Richard Scudamore, chairman Sir Dave Richards and secretary Mike Foster meeting next month to discuss how to deal with Ferguson's continued defiance, United will be preparing simply to write off the fines and pay them for Ferguson to ensure their manager's position is not compromised.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is likely to be fined a maximum of a few thousand pounds each time he fails to talk to the BBC.</p>
              <p>If there were no punishment, the Premier League would lose all credibility.</p>
              <p>Ferguson labelled the BBC 'arrogant beyond belief' and claimed the organisation had shown an 'inability to apologise' after the documentary highlighted the close links his son allegedly enjoyed with the club while acting as a football agent, a career he has subsequently quit.</p>
              <p>Although BSkyB, which pays the vast majority of the money for the £1.95billion Premier League television contract, is unaffected by Ferguson's ban, the BBC remain important partners for the Premier League, paying £170m for the Match of the Day highlights package.</p>
              <p>While Ferguson is required to speak to BBC outlets, including Radio Five Live, at all Premier League matches, his most high-profile snubs are at weekend fixtures, such as today's against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a>, when he is again expected to refuse to co-operate with Match of the Day.</p>
