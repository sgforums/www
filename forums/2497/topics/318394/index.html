              <p> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chelsea's Champions League defeat is expected to signal a mass exodus from the club. With the fall-out from Moscow still to come, Mirror.co.uk takes an early look at which members of last night's team will be off in the summer.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Petr Cech</strong><br>The goalkeeper has two years left on his current deal, but has recently been linked with Arsenal - presumably because the Gunners need a keeper, rather than any likelihood of a move - and an unnamed “very big European club”. The mystery team are said to be willing to pay £32m for his services – a story released by his agent, as coincidence would have it, when contract negotiations were mooted. Cech himself, however, recently stated that he as “no plans to leave the club”.<br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> No. Chelsea need to lose their keeper like he needs another kick in the head</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Michael Essien<br></strong>The Ghanaian star has been a victim of his own versatility this term, all too often plugging gaps in Grant’s back four rather then being offered the chance to boss games from his favoured midfield berth. Real Madrid are rumoured to be lining up a £25m bid, which could test Essien’s commitment to being Chelsea’s all-rounder.<br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> Chelsea would be stupid to sell, but they’ll need to convince the player his days as human Polyfilla are over.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ricardo Carvalho<br></strong>Another player allegedly targeted by Madrid, Carvalho would also be a prime target for old boss Jose Mourinho if – or, rather, when - he returns to management. Furthermore, any new Chelsea manager looking to rebuild for next season might well regard Ricardo as an expendable asset.<br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> Almost certainly should the Special One get his feet under a new desk before the new season stars</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>John Terry<br></strong>It remains to be seen just how badly his Champions League final penalty miss will affect Chelsea’s previously unshakeable captain, but ‘Mr Chelsea’ himself would have to suffer a full-on psychological prolapse to countenance leaving his beloved Blues. <br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> No. More likely to go to the looney bin than another team</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ashley Cole<br></strong>Has more pressing matters to attend to this summer – like rescuing his marriage to Cheryl and sticking pins in a voodoo doll of Claude Makelele – than looking for a new club. That said, if another club were to offer Ashley an extra £5k a week, he’d likely be off quicker than you could say, "oops – the wife’s home earlier than expected. Get out the back window!"<br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> Nobody’s mad enough to swell Cole’s coffers further, surely?</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Michael Ballack<br></strong>The £120k per week midfielder famously complained that London was too expensive to live in (house prices in Penge are pretty reasonable, we hear), but having belatedly established himself as a genuine force in Chelsea’s midfield in the latter half of last season, it’s unlikely he’ll move on now. Especially if Frank and Didier do one first. <br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> The thought of having free-kicks all to himself next season should be enough to convince to him to stay</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Claude Makelele<br></strong>Rumoured to have incurred the wrath of Roman for speaking out against him, the sparingly-used Claude is lucky he hasn’t already been transferred to a Siberian salt mine. Currently the most popular player in the Premier League following his training session assault on Ashley Cole, there would be no shortage of takers should he be deemed surplus to requirements next season.<br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> Unlikely. Few other clubs could afford those wages for what basically amounts to ten Champions League appearances a season.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Frank Lampard<br></strong>With those pesky contract negotiations still not underway (how long does it take to add a few noughts to the end of a payslip anyway?), rumours of a big-money move to the continent refuse to go away. He might be minded to have one last crack at Europe with Chelsea next season, but don’t be surprised to be find Spanish or Italian phrase books tucked away in his holiday luggage this summer.<br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> Yes. Pizzeria proprietors of Milan, rejoice!</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Joe Cole<br></strong>It would take a lot to wrench the lad who spent his boyhood Saturdays stood on the Stamford Bridge terraces (presumably inbetween training with West Ham and hanging out with his Arsenal-mad dad) away – and given his poor performances in recent months, particularly in Moscow, where he spent more time taking on the officials than he did Wes Brown, there won’t be many that will be bother.<br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> No. But he’ll need to rediscover his form sharpish next season.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Didier Drogba<br></strong>The Ivorian’s newly-found Champions League scapegoat status will be the perfect springboard for a headlong plunge out of the summer transfer window; a cynic might even suggest that, given Didier’s recent allusions to tactical bookings, that he got sent off on purpose… We’re no cynics, but we do recognise a man packing his bags when we see one.<br><strong>Off in the summer?</strong> He’s probably already gone now!</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Florent Malouda<br></strong>After a disappointing season in which the quality of the Frenchman’s wingeing frequently outshone that of his football, there’s plenty of Chelsea fans who would not only be happy if the £12m-move-to-Liverpool rumours turned out to be true, but who would also gladly give him a lift up to Melwood in the morning. A new manager brandishing a clean slate could convince Florent to try harder next term, though.<br><strong>Off in the summer? </strong>Not unless Rafa Benitez actually does have more money than sense.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Avram Grant<br></strong>Having forlornly fallen at the last hurdle in three major competitions during his first season in charge at Chelsea, the juries still out on whether the Israeli is a good manager with rotten luck, or a rotten manager lucky to have a job at all. Sadly for Avram, presiding Judge Abramovich prefers old-fashioned black caps to Western niceties like juries…<br><strong>Off in the summer? </strong>Yes. Eilat’s very nice at that time of year, we hear</p>

              <p>The reason why Chelsea became a powerhouse that it is now is all thanks to Roman's money..Back when Roman was an unknown, who knows about Chelsea's history and players like Tony Cascarino, Paul Furlong, Kerry Dixon, Grame Le Saux, Dan Petrescu..The days when Gullit/Vialli managed Chelsea were the days when i made Chelsea my 2nd favourite club after Man Utd...then comes Roman and his funds where players like Winston Bogarde gets millions from warming the bench...</p>
              <p>Everything should change from scratch..get youngsters from their academy better...</p>
