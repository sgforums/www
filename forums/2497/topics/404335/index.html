              <p class="introcopy">FABIO Capello would have willingly walked away from his £6million a year England job if there had been any dissent among the FA’s big hitters.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The Italian – who could have expected a £12m windfall for the remaining two years of his contract – told the Club England board, who had the final say on his future, that compensation would not have been an issue.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">If they had wanted to get rid of him, then he would have gone without a fight – accepting that the country had lost faith in him.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">A <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/search/fabio%20capello/"><span style="color: #2a166d;">Capello</span></a> confidant revealed: “Fabio needed to have the full backing of his employers. If that wasn’t the case, then he was prepared to leave. It wouldn’t have been a case of</p>
              <p class="storycopy">of negotiating a huge settlement. “He even told them to pay him what they thought was right and if there was no money available now they could pay him over five years.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The Club England chairman Sir Dave Richards, managing director Adrian Bevington, the FA’s general secretary Alex Horne and Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA’s director of football development, were unanimous that 64-year-old Capello was still the right man for the job.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Soundings amongst members of the full FA board also indicated their support for Capello.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">It’s believed that Brooking was one of the prime movers in the decision to keep Capello on, pointing out that the well of English talent has dried up.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Capello is keen to bring England out of the dark ages, admitting that he also has his own reputation to repair.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">He said: “When you lose, your reputation is always damaged. I feel that about myself right now. But we have to recover. I am driven by the challenge.”</p>
