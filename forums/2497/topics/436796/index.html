              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>The transfer market is no country for old men, that much is clear from this year’s trading. Not totally ancient and decrepit, even, but old in an over 26 kind of way.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>More than ever in the Barclays  Premier League, this has been the  summer of youth. Potential is highly prized as the new breed of owners apply their big-business logic to football’s peculiar transfer rules.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>During this window, only three  players over the age of 26 have been signed by Premier League clubs for fees of more than £4.5milion. They are Ashley Young (26), Stewart Downing (27) and Roger Johnson (28).</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>At the same time, tens of millions have been lavished on teenagers as clubs try to rake in the best talent from around the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Older players are in demand, too, but when they move they move on the cheap, like Brad Friedel, Matthew Upson and Jonathan Woodgate on free transfers. Chelsea’s first four signings of the summer were teenagers Lucas Piazon, Thibaut Courtois, Oriol Romeu and Romelu Lukaku for a total of around £40m.</span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Manchester United may have Ryan Giggs skipping towards his forties but they have not looked fresher since his generation stormed the first team. That is down to Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and David de Gea, together with the promotion of Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Even for money-no-object Manchester City, age is everything. City have bought four players, the oldest of whom is Gael Clichy at 25 and the most expensive of whom is Sergio Aguero, aged 23. Next could be Samir Nasri, aged 24.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>With this trend developing, it is hardly surprising Arsenal’s squad is under attack from other clubs. Youth is  the first requirement but, thanks to Arsene Wenger’s philosophy, youngsters at the Emirates are road-tested at the top level.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>What price a senior international like Jack Wilshere when his contemporaries like Jones and Connor Wickham can command such enormous fees? </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The flipside is that a glut of established players of undisputed quality are up for sale but stuck on the shelf with the transfer deadline just a week away.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Collateral damage is most striking at City, where an urgent team building programme has produced a bloated squad of overpaid players, many no longer needed by Roberto Mancini.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Managers still value experience. Plenty would like Emmanuel Adebayor, Shaun Wright-Phillips or Craig Bellamy but financial sense is winning the  argument and fewer clubs are ready  to stump up the asking price for  players the wrong side of 26 with  minimal resale value. Fewer still can afford their wages.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Scott Parker is 30, paid £80,000 a week and valued by West Ham at £7m. These figures have no appeal in today’s  market — even for a club of Chelsea’s financial clout — so a first-choice  England midfielder plays in the Championship.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsenal are flush with cash and want Phil Jagielka from Everton, a club who could use the money, but Wenger  steadfastly refuses to pay over the odds for a 29-year-old defender.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Within the riddle there are young players like Nedum Onuoha and Nicklas Bendtner who have been told they can leave their clubs but who earn wages which are obstructing any transfer.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>As the deadline of Wednesday, 31 August, 11pm looms, teams will clamour to cut deals, dropping the asking price or negotiating loans for those they would prefer to shift.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Spurs swallowed a massive loss to move Robbie Keane to Los Angeles Galaxy earlier this month because they wanted elbow room on the payroll and within the squad limits.</span></p>
