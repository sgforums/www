And this has alerted Real Madrid to his potential availability next summer.<br><br>SunSport understands that, during a meeting last month, Mourinho was given instructions on how money would be released. Abramovich and his advisors agreed substantial sums could be spent on young stars Â— like Micah Richards Â— who would retain their value.<br><br>However, in an unprecedented development, Mourinho was also told others he targeted as potential stop-gaps would have to be funded by the sale of fringe players. It appears the Blues bossÂ’ willingness to part with Shaun Wright-Phillips is a consequence of the new thrift policy.<br><br>As SunSport revealed last week, West Ham have agreed a fee of Â£9.8million for Wright-Phillips. But the England winger does not want to join the Hammers. The clampdown is a first for the Chelsea boss who has spent around Â£200m at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Mourinho, though, has always been sensitive to allegations that he has bought success for Chelsea. He has also conformed to the new policy by repeating he will not be held to ransom by clubs demanding unreasonable fees for players.<br><br>Chelsea chief Peter Kenyon admits their current league position is not ideal Â— they trail Manchester United by six points Â— but believes the current squad is good enough to turn it around. Kenyon said: Â“Would you rather be six points clear? Of course. But this is not the end of the season and weÂ’re in a very good position with a very strong squad.Â”<br><br></div>

The other is a woman, clutching a baby and begging on the grim streets of Moscow. And when she approached Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, last week, she came away with a 1,000 rouble note.<br><br>But the money did not come from Mr Abramovich's own pocket - reports say that he, like the Queen, is actually too rich to carry cash. Instead, he had to be bailed out by an official of the Russian Football Federation who spared Mr Abramovich's blushes by pulling out the 1,000 rouble note and handing it over.<br><br>Then Mr Abramovich walked on, shaking his head and smiling to himself at his generosity as he got into his waiting limousine. Not that his gift will have dented his fortune - it equates to Â£20, or just 0.0000001852 per cent of his worth.<br><br>Mr Abramovich had looked nonplussed as the woman, whose identity is not known, got past his security people to approach him after he left a five-star hotel.<br><br>He had been in a meeting with Russian team manager Gus Hiddink, the man whose salary Mr Abramovich pays and who had been tipped as a future Chelsea manager if Jose Mourinho fails to deliver.<br><br></div>

Mourinho confirmed his ultimate lack of control over transfer policy, a common scenario in football.<br><br>How long he will be the manager remains to be seen. Mourinho was asked to clarify his position after suggestions he would leave Chelsea next summer because of an alleged falling-out with the owner, Roman Abramovich, and the chief executive, Peter Kenyon.<br><br>Most observers would still expect Chelsea to win but Mourinho responded to that by saying: "It's their problem.<br></div>
