              <p>Seriously the 4-1 is too respectable for juventus.</p>
              <p>Should have been 6-1, 7-1.</p>
              <p>Credits to fulham players as well as the manager.</p>
              <p>Its really tough to rally a team of players to believe in themselves after a 3-1 agg.</p>
              <p>well done fulham. i hope they go far. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/fulham.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Fulham</strong></span></a><strong> pulled off a sensational comeback to stun Juventus and reach a European quarter-final for the first time after an extraordinary evening at Craven Cottage.</strong></p>
              <p>Trailing 3-1 from the first leg, Roy Hodgson's side achieved the seemingly impossible to win 4-1 and clinch a 5-4 aggregate Europa League success.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">David Trezeguet looked to have ended Fulham's chances with an early goal before Bobby Zamora quickly level led, Zoltan Gera struck twice and Clint Dempsey's superb chip sealed victory. The Italian giants finished with nine men after Fabio Cannavaro and Jonathan Zebina were sent off.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'I'm on top of the world,' beamed 62-year-old Hodgson. 'I don't know if it is the biggest night in the club's history but it must come close.' </p>
              <p>Hodgson saluted the character of his players after coming back to steal the unlikely win. 'I was very impressed with how they came back,' said the former Inter Milan boss. </p>
              <p>'We couldn't have had a worse start. 'We went behind to a simple goal which made an uphill task even steeper but even from that point the team started to play well and the crowd got behind us and even at half time I thought we were looking good to win the game.  'It was never going to be impossible to turn it around and luckily that has happened.' </p>
              <p>In truth Fulham could have beaten Juve's veteran goalkeeper Antonio Chimenti six or seven times with Dickson Etuhu and Simon Davies hitting the woodwork in the second half.  But it was Clint Dempsey who will go down in Fulham folklore as the man who put the Cottagers through.  </p>
              <p>The substitute sealed the victory with a spectacular chip that eluded Chimenti in the 83rd minute to send the capacity crowd at Craven Cottage wild.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/18/article-0-08C68439000005DC-534_468x348.jpg" alt="Fulham fan Hugh Grant" width="468" height="348">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Dempsey told ESPN: 'I just thought, what the heck and tried to put it in the far post and it went in.  'Nine times out of 10 you won't make it but sometimes you've got to take a risk. It's great, we showed a lot of heart and character to fight back but we are in the next round.'</strong></p>
              <p>Hodgson will find out who his team will face next in the competition when the draw for the quarter finals is made in Nyon at 2pm tomorrow.  </p>
              <p>Until then Hodgson can sit back and take stock of what has been a remarkable European campaign which began with a 3-0 qualifying win over Lithuanian minnows Vetra in July.  </p>
              <p>'To get to the quarter final of this competition is extremely good because we played our first match at the end of July and we will still be playing in this competition next month.</p>
              <p>'When I reached the final (as manager of Inter Milan) our European campaign was nowhere near as long as this one has been, I think it encompassed 12 games including a two-legged final.  </p>

              <p>Juventus manager Alberto Zaccheroni, meanwhile, said Cannavaro's red card, which was issued for pulling back Gera, turned the game . </p>
              <p>'We are disappointed with the result,' he said.  'We feared Fulham and they played well but as soon as we went down to 10 men we struggled.  </p>
              <p>'I have seen the replay of the incident and I think the referee was too strict.'</p>

              <p>The French defender was sent-off for kicking out at Damien Duff and made
               a crude gesture towards some of the supporters as he walked off.</p>
              <p>“It was aimed at around 30 hooligans and racists who came all the way to
               London, travelling thousands of kilometres just to insult us,” said the
               defender.</p>
              <p>“Right from the warm-up they were already insulting me and Felipe Melo. I
               am sick of this situation.</p>
              <p>“I know I haven’t played much over the last few years, but that was not

              <p>“These people have got to stop. At the final whistle we received more

              <p>“I apologise for that gesture when I left the field and it certainly was

              <p>“Having said that, I really did not understand why I was sent off. After
               Fabio Cannavaro’s red card, the game was all an uphill struggle.”</p>

              <p>They caused mayhem last night. If the Italian newspapers proclaimed 
              the death of Italian football when Milan were crushed 4-0 at Old 
              Trafford, what will they think this morning? </p>
              <p>Just 15 years ago 
              Fulham were struggling to survive in the bottom tier of English football
               but last night they comprehensively outplayed the two-time European 
              champions to achieve the most famous win in their 131-year history.</p>
              <p>Elated manager Roy Hodgson said: 'I think it must come close to being 
              the biggest win in our history. I think it's a remarkable achievement 
              for the boys. We should do a Rocky Marciano and retire while the going's
               good because it's not going to get any better.'</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/18/article-1258979-08C6770E000005DC-239_468x324.jpg" alt="Zoltan Gera of Fulham" width="468" height="324">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Sky high: Zoltan Gera jumps for joy after 
              levelling the tie on aggregate from the spot</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The moment that
               best defined 
              their supremacy arrived in the 
              closing stages, deep into stoppage 
              time. Bobby Zamora, killing time, 
              played the ball off the legs of 
              bewildered legendary Italian striker 
              Alessandro del Piero to win a 
              corner. That's when you know it's 
              your night.</p>
              <p>It hadn't started like that. 
              Juventus had moved even further 
              clear in the tie with a goal that 
              might have killed the evening. 
              David Trezeguet's initial overhead 
              kick from a Hasan Salihamidzic 
              cross fell to Diego, who won a 
              tussle with Aaron Hughes and 
              Brede Hangeland and stabbed the 
              ball back to Trezeguet. The striker 
              made no mistake the second time, 
              recovering his balance to slot a 
              classy finish into the corner.</p>

              </div>
              <p>At Stamford Bridge 24 hours earlier, 
              Roy Hodgson had been mobbed 
              by the Italians of Inter Milan. Soon 
              we were reminded why. The former 
              Inter coach is revered in Italy and 
              the way his Fulham team responded 
              with pace and urgency further 
              revealed his qualities.</p>
              <p>Before kick off, Zamora - watched 
              again by Fabio Capello - had 
              boasted about his plans to give 
              36-year-old World Cup winner Fabio 
              Cannavaro the run-around. Then 
              he did exactly that.</p>
              <p>The striker sent Cannavaro 
              tumbling to the ground after seven 
              minutes and drove a right-foot shot 
              from a Paul Konchesky cross into 
              the back of the net.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/18/article-1258979-08C68439000005DC-402_468x341.jpg" alt="Fulham fan Hugh Grant" width="468" height="341">

              </div>
              <p>Bristling
               with attitude, Zamora 
              was at the heart of an encouraging first 20 minutes from Fulham. With 
              Damien Duff, who was rested for the first half of his side's 3-0 defeat 
              by Manchester United at the weekend, providing plenty of service from 
              the right wing, the striker looked every inch the powerful centre 
              forward.</p>
              <p>In contrast Cannavaro, Italy's World Cup-winning 
              captain, was fortunate to escape censure for a deliberate push on Brede 
              Hangeland in the penalty box after 18 minutes.</p>
              <p>The 6ft 5in Norway
               defender looked set to head a Simon Davies corner past Antonio Chimenti
               until Cannavaro gave him a knowing shove in the back.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/18/article-1258979-08C65ED8000005DC-814_468x286.jpg" alt="Fabio Cannavaro" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Flattened: Zoltan Gera (left) was hauled down by

              efforts </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But the defender's luck ran out 
              after 27 minutes. Dutch referee 
              Bjorn Kuipers showed a straight red 
              card after Cannavaro found himself 
              the wrong side of Zoltan Gera and 
              tried to shove his way back into 
              position with the striker through on 
              goal after a pass from Zamora.</p>
              <p>Juventus threw on experienced 
              Czech Republic defender Zdenek 
              Grygera to try and stem the flow of 
              Fulham attacks, but their defensive 
              midfielders were leaving the back four far too exposed. A Zamora 
              free-kick was heading for the top left-hand corner until Chimenti clawed
               it away and Davies hit the crossbar from another set piece two minutes 
              later. Zamora had the opportunity to stab home the rebound from close 
              range but could not quite react quickly enough.</p>
              <p>Fulham hit the 
              bar again courtesy of a Dickson Etuhu header, but went deservedly ahead 
              after 39 minutes when Gera beat his man to meet a Davies pass after an 
              intelligent flick-on from Zamora. It got even better at the start of the
               second half. A cute back heel from Gera found Duff, whose cross hit 
              Diego's right hand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/18/article-1258979-08C64F88000005DC-919_468x306.jpg" alt="Bobby Zamora" width="468" height="306">

              </div>
              <p>Kuipers pointed to the spot and 
              Gera's cool right-foot conversion 
              found the target to put Fulham level 
              on aggregate after 49 minutes. 
              Gera, who excelled once again in 
              the second striker role behind 
              Zamora, appealed for another 
              penalty after 61 minutes when 
              Paolo De Ceglie and Jonathan 
              Zebina clashed in the area to 
              squeeze out the 30-year-old.</p>
              <p>With Fulham in the ascendancy, 
              Hodgson went for broke, sending Clint Dempsey on in place of right back 
              Stephen Kelly with 20 minutes to go.</p>
              <p>The brave move nearly paid 
              off immediately, as the irrepressible Duff slid a ball across the 
              six-yard box only for Gera and Zamora to miss it by inches.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/18/article-1258979-08C65A61000005DC-155_468x265.jpg" alt="David Trezeguet scores 1-0 to Juventus" width="468" height="265">

              </div>
              <p>And then the breakthrough came. 
              Time seemed to stand still at 
              Craven Cottage as three Juventus 
              defenders stood off Dempsey and 
              watched as he scooped a right foot 
              shot over Chimenti and into the 
              back of the net in front of an 
              ecstatic Hammersmith End.</p>
              <p>Dempsey said: 'Nine times out of 
              10 a shot like that would not have 
              made it but sometimes you've got 
              to go for it. Luckily it worked 
              tonight.'</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>Juventus' only response was a 
              petulant kick at Duff by Zebina, for 
              which the defender earned a 
              straight red card in stoppage time.</p>
              <p>This was Fulham's night - the 
              best in their 131-year history. From 
              the brink of relegation to the 
              quarter finals of the Europa League 
              in less than two years. Whoever 
              would have thought it?</p>

              <p>Best had a brief resurgence in form with Fulham
               in 1976-77, showing that, although he had lost some of his pace, he 
              retained his skills. His time with the Cottagers is particularly 
              remembered for an FA Cup game against second division outfit Hereford United in which he tackled his former 
              teammate, and old drinking mate, Rodney Marsh. Best stated later in
               life that he enjoyed his time most while at Fulham, despite not winning
               any honours.</p>
