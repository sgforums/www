When arsenal lose barcelona we got so much quality on the pitch We got henry, lunjberg, pires ashley cole. And now we have bendtner , eduardo , walcott and denlison. This is very sad for the fans. Even arsenal buy 4-5 players we still cant compete with the best. Time to have a change. Wenger have been great for arsenal time for him to move on.

              <p>Let's not get carried away with it... Barcelona is having a 'golden period' that's all. But a few years ago, they were already considered a wash up side. It was not until a new president came in Joan Laporta and the arrival of Rijkaard and Ronaldinho that changed their fortunes and playing style...</p>
              <p>Barce are enjoying the fruit of the labour Rijkaard started... It shouldn't be too surprising that they are one of the best sides in the world, after all they are the 3rd highest paid team in the world after the New York Yankees and Real Madrid. </p>
              <p>Personally, I am very sure Real will topple them very soon. Maybe even sooner (This season's league title) Cos even at present, despite Real having a rather new team and new players just getting use to the Laliga, they are already shoulder to shoulder with a Barce side that have played together for a few good years... In my personal opinion, Real will get better year on year for the next 3 to 5 year. Whereas, Barce will be lucky if they manage to stay up there once a current president goes...</p>
              <p>As for Messi, he have everything to play for at the World cup... Let's hope he brings it to SA.</p>

              <p>Been a few years and no success? What's the 2006/07 and 2007/8 league titles then?</p>
              <p>This is the first year only with the arrival of Ronaldo, Kaka, Benzema, Alonso... all have been playing in different leagues... But they will only get better after their first season... And also we are looking at the raise of Gonzalo Higuain...</p>
              <p>They are currently leading the Spanish league table aren't they? So I would say not bad for a rather newly form team playing together in their first year...</p>

              <p>From
               the scoreboard here at the Nou Camp came the words that will live long 
              in the memory of Arsene Wenger and his Arsenal players. ‘GOOOOOOOL DE MESSI,’ it screamed, 
              after 21, 37 and 42 minutes of a mesmerising first half and 42 minutes 
              of a second that wasn’t too shabby either.</p>
              <p>If this Barcelona team 
              are the best Wenger has ever seen, Lionel Messi must rank high among the
               finest players Arsenal’s manager has cast his expert eye over. A player
               now standing proudly in the pantheon of great number 10s.</p>
              <p>A 
              player whose extraordinary gifts position him alongside Pele, Maradona 
              and Zidane, Platini and Gullit. ‘He has made the impossible possible,’ 
              gushed Wenger before comparing him to a computer-generated figure on 
              PlayStation.</p>

              <p>He was astonishing here at the Nou Camp last
               night. An explosion of pace, skill and artistry to which Arsenal had no

              significantly weakened by the absence of William Gallas and Alex Song, 
              could seriously expect to respond.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Mesmerised: Theo Walcott</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The diminutive Argentinian they had to feed growth hormone has become
               a giant of the global game. The world’s highest paid player and rightly
               so judging by this one-man demolition of an Arsenal side that dared to 
              dream when Nicklas<br>Bendtner secured the most unlikely of leads in the
               18th minute.</p>
              <p>‘We have come back from the dead,’ declared 
              Wenger after seeing his side score two late goals in that similarly 
              stunning first leg and he probably thought so again when his towering 
              Danish striker struck. But Messi quickly saw to it that they did not 
              live on for long.</p>
              <p>For the 17 minutes prior to Bendtner’s goal, 
              Barcelona had given them another masterclass in passing football. The 
              kind of football that has set a new benchmark. The kind of football 
              Wenger has long aspired to but has so far only seen these classy 
              Catalans deliver.</p>
              <p>He has got close with players like Thierry 
              Henry, Patrick Vieira, Dennis Bergkamp and Robert Pires, but never quite
               to the standard now being set by Pep Guardiola’s European champions.</p>
              <p>Messi
               shone brightest here, using both feet to score four goals for the first
               time in his career and taking his tally for the season to 39. But the 
              gene pool of genius, largely developed in this club’s academy, spreads 
              beyond Messi and into players like Xavi Hernandez, Sergio Busquets and 
              Andres Iniesta.</p>
              <p>They did exactly what Guardiola said they 
              would when he was asked, on the eve of this encounter, how to combat the
               pace of a player like Theo Walcott. By keeping the ball and therefore 
              limiting Arsenal’s opportunities to unleash their English thoroughbred. 
              Just like they did in north London, they enjoyed 70 per cent of the 
              possession in a distinctly one-sided first half.</p>
              <p>There could be no
               complaints from a chastened Arsenal. They only got back into this tie 
              because of the way Barcelona eased off after two goals from Zlatan 
              Ibrahimovic at the Emirates and this time they made sure there was no 
              repeat.</p>
              <p>Only a team with a more physical approach can hope to 
              compete with Barcelona. A team like Chelsea, as we saw in last season’s 
              competition, or possibly the Inter Milan side Jose Mourinho will now 
              prepare for what promises to be a fascinating semi-final.</p>
              <p>A 
              real clash of cultures as well as two of the most interesting managers<br>in
               the game.</p>

              <p>Arsenal cannot become such a side, and the challenge now facing them 
              is how they react to this quarter-final defeat. Wenger praised his 
              players for their strength of character and they will have to be strong 
              to deal with so demoralising an experience.</p>
              <p>They may feel like 
              that Tony Hancock character who has to deal with the crushing 
              realisation, when in Paris, that his art is actually juvenile garbage.</p>
              <p>This
               Arsenal team are better than that, of course. But there could be a 
              painful period of introspection when they reflect on just how 
              ineffective they were against Barcelona’s<br>superior beings. Not even 
              the fact that they were also missing Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie 
              is likely to remove that feeling of inferiority.</p>
              <p>From the very 
              start they were made to look like the statues in the Nou Camp museum, 
              frozen seemingly by the fluency of Barcelona’s passing and the fluidity 
              of their movement.</p>

              <p>Wenger had told them not to be intimidated but he did so in vain.</p>
              <p>That
               Arsenal actually led this tie for three minutes is hard to believe.</p>
              <p>But
               when Abou Diaby suddenly won the ball off Gabriel Milito with a 
              crunching challenge, he then sent Walcott clear with the best pass 
              Arsenal produced all night. Walcott sprinted clear, played the ball into
               Bendtner when he probably should have shot, and then watched in relief 
              when his colleague shrugged off the challenge of Daniel Alves and 
              reacted to the sight of Victor Valdes saving his first effort by scoring
               with his second.</p>
              <p>While Barcelona protested furiously because of 
              what they considered to be Diaby’s foul challenge, their anger subsided 
              the moment Messi struck his first of the night.</p>
              <p>A goal that 
              owed much to Mikael Silvestre’s failure to clear the ball and instead 
              play it back into Messi’s path, but was still the result of a quite 
              stunning left-footed finish.</p>
              <p>Relatively quiet in the first leg, 
              Messi was really starting to come to life in this game.</p>
              <p>He 
              skipped past five Arsenal players before Denilson stopped him with a 
              challenge<br>that earned him a booking and then he terrorised Silvestre 
              again before driving a right-footed shot into the side-netting.</p>
              <p>A 
              second was nevertheless inevitable and it arrived in the 37th minute, 
              yet more desperate defending allowing Pedro Rodriguez to seize on Thomas
               Vermaelen’s failure to deal with a cross from Eric Abidal and play the 
              ball back to his team-mate.</p>
              <p>Having started the move, Messi 
              finished, this time with his right foot.</p>
              <p>Four minutes after 
              that and he had struck his third, this time with a demonstration of his 
              speed as well as his skill.</p>
              <p>Seydou Keita put him clear with a 
              perfectly executed header before Messi lifted the ball over the 
              advancing Manuel Almunia and sent it bouncing into the net.</p>
              <p>After 
              the break and Barcelona continued to dominate, albeit with a touch more 
              caution.</p>
              <p>Until, that is, Messi beat three Arsenal defenders 
              and responded to a decent save from Almunia by driving the ball through 
              the Arsenal goalkeeper’s legs.</p>
              <p>Through the agony, Wenger had no 
              choice but to express his admiration.</p>

              <p>Credit to Barca for the win. Was kind of expecting this already. Not the Messi hat-trick though. Anyway, don't look down on Inter &amp; Mourinho. I think he is already planning on how to stifle Barca in the semis.</p>

              <p>yes. to play an open game against barcelona is suicidal. you need to man mark messi and stop xavi and co from dictating play from midfield. when is the CL semis btw? next week?</p>
