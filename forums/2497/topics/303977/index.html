The tie is poised at 1-1 going into the second leg at White Hart Lane, and Poyet said: "Everyone knows we haven't beaten Arsenal for a very long time.</strong><br><br>"We are convinced we can win and reach the final, it doesn't matter how." But Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger warned: "They played well in the first leg, we want to pay them back and qualify."<br><br>He added: "The draw continued our long unbeaten run against Tottenham and I don't know why it should be that they haven't beaten us for more than eight years.<br><br>"They have always had good teams in that period, but we have been fighting for the title a lot in that time so we always have a high focus. Maybe after a while it becomes psychological as well.<br><br>"We will go there positively, looking for the win, and they will be too, so it is set up nicely."<br><br>Arsenal line-up that will include established first-teamers William Gallas, Alexander Hleb and Bacary Sagna, as well as out-of-favour World Cup winner Gilberto.<br><br>Wenger has also opted to have Cesc Fabregas, Emmanuel Adebayor, Mathieu Flamini and Eduardo on the bench as an insurance policy.<br><br>Although the Frenchman will stick with the likes of Theo Walcott, Nicklas Bendtner, Denilson, Abou Diaby, Lukasz Fabianski, Armand Traore and Justin Hoyte, who have been key figures in the club's Carling Cup run, his decision to bring in the big guns reflects his desire to end Arsenal's three-year trophy drought.<br><br></div>

That makes it all the more satisfying.<br><br>"Arsenal are one of the biggest teams in England, they are our direct rival from the same city and it is a long time since Tottenham have beaten Arsenal. To beat them in such a comprehensive fashion is something special.<br><br>"I want to win everything, whether that is the Premier League, the UEFA Cup or the Carling Cup. Sometimes you get it right and sometimes you don't, but it doesn't stop me wanting to win anything."<br><br>Ramos will be immortalised after becoming the first Tottenham manager to lead them to a final since Glenn Hoddle steered them to the Worthington Cup in 2001 against Blackburn.<br><br>Man of the match Jenas said: "We deserve it after all the double sessions and all the running, we have won it. This is job done. A lot of people talked about us setting the record straight and we gave done that. The game plan was simple - we wanted to win it inside 90 minutes and we have done that."<br><br>Ramos added: "It makes me happy that the fans are pleased with my work, but the footballers got us there. They run, they make the effort, but it is nice that the supporters are recognising the work we are doing.<br><br>"Without doubt, to beat Arsenal you have to play well and they did play well.

If we do bring in players then they will have to have good character," he said.<br><br>Meanwhile, Chelsea hero Joe Cole remained modest about his exploits on Merseyside.<br><br>"We stick together from back to front - everyone defends and everyone attacks," said the former West Ham player.<br><br>He added: "We now have a great chance to win a trophy.
