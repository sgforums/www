              <p><strong>AC Milan playmaker Ronaldinho has described his final months at Barcelona as the 'worst period of his life'.</strong></p>
              <p>The 28-year-old made the switch to the Serie A in mid-July, after
              injury woes and a lack of form saw Ronaldinho lose his starting spot at
              Barca and confined him to only 11 appearances.</p>
              <p>While he now
              admits to being happy to have left the Catalan giants, Ronaldinho
              revealed he had regularly been 'depressed' during his final few months
              in Spain.</p>
              <p>'It has been the worst period of my life,' he told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
              <p>'I
              was unlucky, I couldn't be in the side, I couldn't play. The only thing
              I could do was watch TV. And watching the games sat in armchair made me
              even more depressed.</p>
              <p>'I never expected to be out for so long, I didn't know what to do to make things better.'</p>
              <p>The
              former FIFA World Player of the Year was rarely been out of the
              spotlight last season, as the media heavily criticised his weight, his
              fitness, his form and his private life.</p>
              <p>The Brazil international,
              who is currently in Beijing for the Olympic Games, admitted he could
              not understand how quickly people seemed to turn against him.</p>
              <p>'What
              I don't understand is how up until a given day I was an example to
              others and then, all of a sudden, I'd become like (Diego) Maradona when
              he was at the centre of controversy.</p>
              <p>'When I'm holiday I do what I want. During the season I behave like a serious professional, I never have any slip-ups.</p>
              <p>'I do the maximum to be a good athlete, but when the season's over I enjoy life.'</p>
              <p>He
              added that his family, and in particular his brother and agent Roberto
              de Assis, had also been affected by the negative attention he had
              received.</p>
              <p>He said: 'My family have protected me and given me
              strength. And they've suffered too because the abuse has not only been
              aimed at me but also at my brother Roberto, who is also my agent.</p>
              <p>'They've
              accused him of creating instability, of staying close to me only for
              the money, and other things whose sole aim is to hurt me.'</p>
              <p>Now,
              Ronaldinho has promised to put the problems of the past few months
              behind him and focus solely on helping the five-time World Cup winners
              to claim their first Olympic gold medal in the football tournament.</p>
              <p>'Now I'm with Brazil and here to play the Olympics,' he said.</p>
              <p>'I'm here to lend a hand to my friends, to try and do something historic for the Brazilians, who have never won Olympic gold.</p>
              <p>'And to do that I need to be happy.'</p>
