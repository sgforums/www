              <p class="first"><strong>Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti has again said he expects captain John Terry to reject a move to Manchester City.</strong></p>
              <p>England skipper Terry, currently on tour with his club in the United States, has yet to reaffirm his loyalty to the Stamford Bridge outfit.</p>
              <p>But Ancelotti said: "I am sure he will remain at Chelsea. I am sure, 100%. He has a contract for three years more and this is the situation now."</p>
              <p>Man City have reportedly offered the defender, 28, a £200,000-a-week deal.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The ambitious club have already spent £50m to recruit Carlos Tevez, Gareth Barry and Roque Santa Cruz this summer and are willing to spend as much as £40m to land Terry, who has spent his entire career at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>City have had two offers rejected, but boss Mark Hughes said recently that the player could be looking for a new challenge.</p>
              <p>However, Terry's team-mates insisted the issue is not a distraction, for them or their skipper.</p>
              <p>Speaking ahead of Chelsea's match against the Seattle Sounders, striker Salomon Kalou claimed: "He doesn't pay attention to that.</p>
              <p>"Maybe if he was paying attention to that it might disturb a little bit of the team, but you can tell he is not disturbed by this situation."</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper Petr Cech said: "He's the same captain he was three months ago, five months ago, one year ago, five years ago, so I don't see any difference."</p>
              <p>Asked if Terry needed to address the situation with his team-mates, Cech added: "I don't have to ask him because I can see with my eyes that he is committed."</p>
              <p>Keeping Terry is key for Ancelotti as he enters his first season in charge at Chelsea after leaving AC Milan.</p>
              <p>He is expected to have the Blues challenging for the Premier League and Champions League titles, but shrugged off the high expectations.</p>
              <p>"In this work the pressure is normal. I am happy to be at Chelsea," said the Italian.</p>
              <p>"I like the work of the players, they've started the season very well and they work with very good mental attitude.</p>
              <p>"Saturday is the first game of the season, we want to start well, so it is an important game. We want to win and play well."</p>
