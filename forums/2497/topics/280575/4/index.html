It has yet to be announced whether Grant will be a permanent appointment, but with his first game in charge against Manchester United at Old Trafford, if the next few games are being treated as a trial, the suggestion is the story is set to run.[/b]</blockquote>So Steve Clarke turned against Mourinho to keep his fat pay job? So will Drogba leave since he have said if Jose was sack he would consider leaving? Or have he also decided to follow Clarke's footstep now that Jose is history and won't be selecting the team anymore?<br><br></div>

Roman probably looked at the larger picture... Here he wants to make them the biggest club in the world and here jose is always creating bad publicity for the club usually with his odd behaviour...<br><br>In a way the fans didn't show up could sum it down to Mourinho's boring football... As it is, they don't have many fans already and when you continue to dish out boring stuff week in week out... The fair weather fans would probably not turn up...<br><br>Mourinho isn't a scapegoat...

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/07/09/Others/146357.jpg"><br><br><strong>WHEN the moment came to say goodbye, Jose Mourinho picked up the phone and called his most trusted ally Frank Lampard. The Chelsea boss made an emotional call to Lamps at around 9.30 last night to tell him that, after today, he would no longer be his manager. Hardly surprising that the coach should choose to tell the news to the one man on whom he relied during the glory of the last three seasons.</strong><br><br>Later, the Portuguese coach texted other senior players to let them know that his time in charge had come to an end. Those who attended a premiere of the film about his tenure at the club the same evening already knew that something was very wrong.<br><br>Mourinho arrived for the showing of Â‘Blue RevolutionÂ’ Â— a documentary charting the life and times of Chelsea under Roman Abramovich. Red Rom did not show. He was involved in a board meeting at which the fate of Mourinho was decided. After two weeks when the team had failed to win in three attempts, Red Rom had had enough.<br><br>The embarrassing 1-1 stalemate against little Rosenborg on Tuesday was enough to spark a crisis meeting immediately after the match. Abramovich cancelled a planned trip abroad to continue the debate and word got out there was trouble afoot at the Bridge. Those talks continued yesterday and culminated in a full afternoon board meeting.<br><br>A spat with skipper Terry was taken as a sign that Mourinho had lost the confidence of the dressing room. He had questioned the performance of his captain with medical staff and was then confronted by Terry about his actions. Mourinho believed he had squared the situation but word got back to Abramovich that something was awry.<br><br>A source close to Abramovich told SunSport last night: Â“Roman was already furious with the way things had been going. Â“It seemed everything he asked for from the team in the way they played turned out the opposite. Â“Roman is tired of saying one thing and seeing another. This is where it cracked.Â”<br><br>With the Special One seemingly deciding he has had enough, a unique era in the history of Chelsea has come to an end. Whether Abramovich will stick around at the Bridge remains to be seen.<br></div>

But yesterday morning it was the 6ft-plus powerhouse who broke down in tears after Jose Mourinho hugged him like a son.</strong><br><br>The changing room at ChelseaÂ’s Cobham training HQ is usually a hub of noise and banter on any given morning. Drogba will often try to hog the stereo system to play his rap music while the players get changed and warm up for their daily session. This time, though, the only sound was silence. Mourinho had told two of his team he would drop by just after 10 oÂ’clock and collect his belongings before going to say goodbye to Â‘his family.Â’<br><br>Nobody was late and barely a word was said as they waited for him. Some of the younger lads got changed as usual but quickly realised this would be no ordinary day at the club. A couple of the senior players remembered the day Claudio Ranieri made the same journey to the old training ground. They recalled the sickness in their stomach at the knowledge they were losing someone they loved and respected.<br><br>When he stepped into the dressing room almost every player was by his usual change station. Two or three tried to greet him but his body language said that he would do the talking. Without any fuss or ceremony, the former Chelsea manager moved towards one side of the room to speak to the players.<br><br>Brazil star Juliano Belletti was one of the first. In Portuguese, Mourinho spoke warmly of his performances since he signed for Chelsea and wished the defender luck. Alex, his countryman, was next and was given similar treatment. One by one, Mourinho moved around the rectangular room Â— speaking to each of the players and thanking them for their work while he was boss.<br><br>With some Â— like Petr Cech and Ricardo Carvalho Â— he put his hands on their face and reminded them of shared glory ... the first title, last seasonÂ’s FA Cup ... Mourinho told them how proud he was of what they had achieved and asked that they pass on his best wishes to their wives and children.<br><br>Others were not treated with such kindness. Andriy Shevchenko was offered a handshake which, according to one member of staff, could have Â“frozen a mug of tea.Â” And then came Didi. The big Ivory Coast striker smiled at his boss but there was nothing in his look to suggest this was a time for happiness.<br><br>Mourinho put his hands on the playerÂ’s arms and spoke a little louder, as if he wanted some people to hear his words. Â“You are one of the best strikers in the world and you have made yourself into one of the best players,Â” Mourinho told him. Â“I am very proud of you, Didi Â— and you should be proud of yourself. Â“You have worked hard and you are a winner. Always remember you are a winner.Â”<br><br>Mourinho then put his arms around the hitman and hugged him like a departing father. As he moved on, Drogba failed to keep himself together and broke down in tears. Mourinho continued his circuit but only repeated the kind of praise he had for the striker when he embraced Frank Lampard.<br><br>And so he left the room and picked up a few personal belongings he had collected from his office Â— including a photo of his two children with their pet dog. Once again, there was silence save for Florent Malouda Â— who had put his arm around Drogba to comfort him.<br><br>Chief executive Peter Kenyon had the unenviable task of following Mourinho in to address the players. Kenyon informed them that Avram Grant would become general manager and Steve Clarke first-team coach.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though I'm a United fan, I respect Mourinho and what he's done.<br><br>Rainieri was proof that money doesn't necessarily buy success. Mourinho showed us how to turn money into success.<br><br>I believe for Mourinho, the players he favoured most were very clear, Cech, Terry, Lampard and Drogba, the spine of his team. He built his success around them, and if he ever lost one of them, his success will start to falter.<br><br>Something tells me that this is the wrong decision because managers will have bad patches at times. Fergie wasn't brialliant when he started, but management chose to stick with him. Look where we are now. Wenger has his bad patches too, but Arsenal has stuck with him. Benitez hasn't really shown much success in the EPL, but Liverpool have backed him up.<br><br>Mourinho has always known that he might leave one day in this way. I think it became really clear last season with the entrance of Ballack and Shevchenko. Neither fit into his system, but both were signed because of their reputation of European success. He always knew that Abramovich would be willing to pay out his contract and hire someone else.<br><br>Grant seems to be here for the long haul, probably because he is favoured by Abramovich for now. Whether or not Chelsea will replace him is left to be seen. But I believe Mourinho might come back, probably even as the gaffer of Spurs, what with Jols position under threat.</div>

Although enjoying a close relationship with Roman Abramovich, the owner, the Israeli has not developed a rapport with the players since arriving as director of football in the summer and many are disillusioned by his appointment.<br><br>As the 52-year-old has not held a club job for five years and never managed a team outside Israel, such doubts over his suitability are understandable. However, having been on Â£1 million a year, he will enjoy a healthy salary increase in his new role, though he will have to go into his first match, against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, without Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard, who were ruled out yesterday. </strong><br><br>Grant is bound to suffer in comparison with the youthful and energetic Mourinho, who was given an emotional send-off after his final visit to the training ground early yesterday. Lampard and Drogba were moved to tears when it came to saying goodbye.<br><br>Not all of ChelseaÂ’s squad will be sad to see him go, however, with Andriy Shevchenko understood to be positively delighted and Joe Cole experiencing an element of relief. Interestingly, John Terry was not as upset as many had expected. The England captain had clashed with Mourinho over his fitness before the managerÂ’s final game in charge, against Rosenborg on Tuesday.<br><br>Chelsea did their best to portray MourinhoÂ’s departure as having been mutually agreed, but their statement could not disguise the acrimonious nature of the split. Â“What is clear is we had all reached a point where the relationship between the club and JosÃ© had broken down,Â” a statement read. Â“This was despite genuine attempts over several months by all parties to resolve certain differences.Â” The breakdown had Â“started to impact on performancesÂ”, Chelsea added.<br><br></div>
