            <div class='col-md body'>Why would anyone who follows EPL be surprised at Mourinho's departure? There is nothing to MOURn about.  Whether sacked or not, the parting is a matter of time.  The writings were all over the dressing room walls.  The last 4 games of poor performance clearly showed that things have taken for the worst before the start of the season.  I don't think the last few games led to his sacking or otherwise.  RA had already planned for all this when he got the Israeli coach in.  How could a soccer coach who earns 5 million pounds a year beat the man who bought the club for 350 million pounds?  It would take Mourinho 70 years to beat him!<br>Let's face it.  When you are damn good as a coach who could bring Chelsea the trophies it has never kissed for 100 years - you don't want people to interfere with you, not even the BOSS.  But if the boss wants to be a player and who also wants his favourite godson Chev to play too despite being unable to kick a ball, you know you are up against a situation that is tougher than a 10-man defensive wall.  So, it is a no winner for 'the special one'.  This is the morale of the story.  Nothing new - you hear and see this in everyday real life - at the workplace, in every organisation, in every society.<br>What is a loss to Chelsea will be a gain for another club.  Place your bet!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>football is always unpredictable, who knows some time after this, RA might actually convince a top coach to manage Chelsea? It will take some time for Chelsea players to settle down, since Mourinho is the one that made the club into one of the best in the business, players like cech, drogba, essien, lamps and so on all respect him and recgonise the success he has brought to the club. However leaving the club just because of the coach is not neccasary so, maybe for a few players that might be true.for example cavarlho?cech? players that mourinho brought in. who knows? maybe when he gets a new job, he will buy those players to his new club too! but definitely, this few months will be a rough patch for chelsea, somehow similar to that of real madrid when they sacked several coaches in a row. they will be struggling to find their form until they get a winning coach.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MOURINHO:I WISH I'D GONE EARLIER</strong><br><br>Axed Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho last night admitted: "I wish I had quit the club last season."<br><br>And the Special One revealed: "I had offers from other clubs at the end of last season, I wish I had left Chelsea then."<br><br>Mourinho received a staggering Â£12million pay-off from Roman Abramovich, a deal that included a gagging order restricting him from revealing what really happened behind the scenes at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>But that did not stop him aiming a bitter swipe at the Chelsea chiefs who axed him - by taunting: "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">You had no history until I arrived.</span>"<br><br>He is seething at the lack of gratitude shown by Abramovich and the Chelsea board for bringing the club back-to-back titles.<br><br>Mourinho touched a raw nerve by claiming Chelsea were a club with a "small history" - having won their only previous league title back in 1955.And the Special One claimed he does not care what happens to Chelsea in the future, despite his close bond with the Blues players.<br><br>Mourinho said: "My feelings are simple. Chelsea was a club with a small history, with frustration, without Premier League titles, until we arrived here and we won two titles.<br><br>"In my first year, we brought tears of joy because no one had seen Chelsea as English champions before and that formed a big part of the history of the club. The future of Chelsea doesn't interest me now. Win, lose, play well, buy, sell - it doesn't mean absolutely anything to me.<br><br>"The whole club was not a real club. We had fractures. Everyone has responsibilities. I am a man of war in competition. But in life I am a man of peace."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think what he said is true of that RA never come out to the press/media to show his gratitude to Mourinho's effort that resulted in Chelsea winning trophies. Such unappreciative attitude and willingness to turn his back on a reliable manager sucks. Honestly i dont see Avram Grant as capable of maintaining Chelsea's winning tradition, at least until he proves it.</div>
