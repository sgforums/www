            <div class='col-md body'>Wow! I thought Kenyon just said they won't sack him just last week... This is shocking!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><strong>Manager Mourinho leaves Chelsea<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44127000/jpg/_44127039_jose.jpg"><br><span class="small">Mourinho's position was the subject of continual scrutiny last season</span><br><br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has sensationally left Stamford Bridge by mutual consent, the club has confirmed. The news comes just 24 hours after the disappointing Champions League draw against Rosenborg. </strong><br><br>BBC Radio 5live football correspondent Jonathan Legard understands Mourinho texted senior players, including skipper John Terry, with the news. Mourinho joined Chelsea in the summer of 2004 and led them to the Premiership title in each of his first two seasons.<br><br>Last season they finished runners-up to Manchester United but won both the FA Cup and Carling Cup, a trophy they had also collected in 2005. His achievements also saw him voted as Premiership manager of the year in 2005 and 2006.<br><br>However the Champions League trophy eluded the club and this season's campaign started with Tuesday's shock 1-1 result against the Norwegians in front of a crowd of just 24,973. It was their third successive game without a win following a 2-0 defeat at Aston Villa and a goalless draw with Blackburn in the Premier League.<br><br>Those results have left Chelsea fifth in the table - two points behind leaders Arsenal and with a visit to Manchester United to come on Sunday. He did have one unique record during his reign in never losing a home league game at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho signed a five-year contract in 2005 and quashed speculation in January that he would leave Stamford Bridge in the summer by saying he was happy to see out his deal if he received "real support" from the club.<br></div>

Kenyon says Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich's long-term plans for the Blues include Mourinho at the helm.<br><br>He said: "There's loads of speculation that if we don't win Jose gets fired, but that's not the way we think. "It's about winning in style and building that dynasty, and that's what Roman wants to be part of; Chelsea becoming part of Europe's dynasty." </strong><br><br>Former Manchester United chief executive Kenyon revealed Chelsea's desire to become a worldwide brand in the same manner as his former employers. Kenyon said: "Over a 10-year period, you need two European Cups to be a world club, and you have to dominate your domestic league. "We have an infrastructure to deal with that and people to deal with it. "We will win the Champions League, the question is when," Kenyon says in the Chelsea documentary Blue Revolution.<br><br>"We've got a squad, a structure, a belief and we've got quality; I believe the Champions League is not far away." Kenyon also claims Mourinho is the most similar manager to Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson he has yet seen. After joining Chelsea in 2003, Kenyon was instrumental in bringing former Porto boss Mourinho to Stamford Bridge to succeed Claudio Ranieri.<br><br>The Chelsea chief executive said: "After the first week I didn't feel Ranieri was up to the job. Having been around a winner like Sir Alex, Ranieri certainly didn't come into that class, so we embarked on looking for a new manager. "We came up with Mourinho who was young and different.<br><br>"We'd seen some of the best names but he was hungry and thought differently and I saw he had some of the same qualities as Alex Ferguson. "He's a winner and we were lucky enough to get him, and I think we've had some success since then."<br><br>Kenyon also revealed that Abramovich has concerns about Chelsea's on-field image, and that the Russian billionaire is keen to couple success with style. "He's passionate about Chelsea; he's passionate about how we are perceived, how we do things. If we win, we want to win stylishly, everyone buys into that. "He's the best possible thing that could have happened to Chelsea," added Kenyon. "He's thoughtful, he's strong and he's been a very successful businessman. But he's very different to how anybody would portray him because nobody knows him."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/JoseMourinho.jpg"><br><br><strong>JOSE MOURINHOÂ’S future as Chelsea manager was doomed after a dramatic bust-up with his trusted skipper John Terry. The Sun can reveal that Mourinho had become increasingly frustrated by TerryÂ’s recent performances. And he had even raised the issue with the clubÂ’s medical department to see if they had an explanation.</strong><br><br>But when centre-back Terry heard what Mourinho had done he reacted furiously. And the England star had heated exchanges with the Blues boss before and after TuesdayÂ’s dire 1-1 Champions League draw at home to minnows Rosenborg. A club source revealed: Â“News of their row reached the clubÂ’s directors, who were concerned it was proof that Jose was losing the dressing room.Â”<br><br>Incredibly, Chelsea insisted they knew nothing about the shock development and claimed they had no plans to sack him - until suddenly confirming his exit in a statement at 1.45am today. Yesterday's high drama started when billionaire owner Roman Abramovich cancelled a business trip to hold an emergency summit with Director of Football Avram Grant and trusted director Eugene Tenenbaum.<br><br>That was followed by a lengthy meeting between ChelseaÂ’s three main powerbrokers Â— Tenenbaum, chairman Bruce Buck and chief executive Peter Kenyon. All three should have gone to last nightÂ’s official launch of ChelseaÂ’s new DVD Â— which, ironically, only Mourinho attended.<br><br>The catalyst was undoubtedly Abramovich, still furious after the dismal Euro draw with Rosenborg.<br><br>I understand he was demanding to know:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Why is MourinhoÂ’s side playing drab football?<br>Why are they failing to score goals?<br>Why did only 24,000 fans bother to watch the match?</span><br><br>A Blues source confirmed: Â“Roman is seriously p****d off. HeÂ’s beginning to think the club is becoming a laughing stock, which is the exact opposite of everything he wants to achieve.Â” RomÂ’s frustration with Mourinho is at an all-time high because he believes that whenever he demands something of the boss and his players, he is let down.<br><br>Tellingly, on the eve of the Rosenborg match Kenyon revealed the Russian had a 10-year plan for Chelsea which included them being crowned champions of Europe TWICE. He added: Â“ItÂ’s about winning it in a style, in a manner befitting one of the best clubs in Europe.Â” There was precious little style on show against Rosenborg.<br><br>YesterdayÂ’s talks came two weeks after another meeting, called after the 2-0 defeat at Villa Park. Mourinho was told performances must improve or he would be held responsible. Before TuesdayÂ’s game he bemoaned the quality of players available to him Â— comparing his squad to cut-price eggs.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The relationship he once enjoyed with Roman Abramovich disintegrated as a result of the coaches who were brought in against Mourinho's wishes. First it was Frank Arnesen, who was appointed as director of football development.<br><br>Then it was Avram Grant, who arrived towards the end of last season as director of football. Mourinho complained directly to Abramovich and what was described by insiders as "an almighty clash of egos" marked the beginning of the end for the finest young manager in European football. </strong><br><br>When Abramovich suddenly stopped attending Chelsea matches, everyone knew there was a major problem. Chief executive Peter Kenyon accused the media of chasing "ghosts", but behind the scenes he was desperately trying to repair the damage.<br><br>Attempts were made to put on a public show of unity. In February Mourinho said: "Normally there are three ways for a manager to leave a club Â— he walks away, he is sacked, or he finishes his contract.<br><br>"For me, to walk away Â— no chance, no chance. Zero. I won't go to another club by my decision to walk away. Zero per cent. I would never do this to Chelsea, I would never do this to my players, I would never do this to the Chelsea supporters. No chance. So when one of the three possibilities is out, there only remain two possibilities. We go to 2010 and I finish my contract or the club is not happy with my work and decide to sack me."<br><br>It was less than convincing and when Kenyon was then caught trying to secure the services of a replacement for Mourinho, yet more damage was done. Jurgen Klinsmann rejected Chelsea's advances but news of a meeting in Los Angeles emerged and the self-styled "Special One" was left in little doubt of his club's intentions.<br><br>Chelsea refused to confirm as much but privately they argued that the meeting was a reaction to hearing their manager was looking for his next job. As it turned out, the doors of Real Madrid and AC Milan never opened for Mourinho and Abramovich never found a replacement.<br><br>Guus Hiddink was also considered, until Vladimir Putin told his fellow Russian to stay well away from the country's national team manager. When the new season arrived, it was nothing more than a marriage of convenience, and a badly-fractured marriage at that. A poor start followed, and matters finally came to a head.<br><br>Chelsea have performed well below their usual high standards and Abramovich has made no secret of his frustration. He marched out of the Villa Park directors' box the moment Aston Villa scored their second goal and, for all the club's efforts to paper over the cracks, the rift between manager and owner was more obvious than ever.<br><br>When a disappointing draw against Blackburn was followed by another stuttering display against Rosenborg on Tuesday night, Abramovich decided he had had enough. A meeting was called yesterday during which Abramovich told senior directors that things had to change.<br><br>What happened in the few hours that followed yesterday remained unclear last night. Was Mourinho told as much and decided to quit as a result, or was he told it was time to go? Judging by the reaction of Chelsea officials last night, the news seemed to catch them by surprise.<br><br>The text messages may have been sent but those who attended the first screening of the club's Blue Revolution film on Fulham Broadway appeared oblivious to the extraordinary developments.<br><br>The documentary's audience must be even more amazed after what they saw last night. "He's a bit like Ferguson," said Kenyon in the film. "Having been around a winner like Ferguson, Claudio Ranieri didn't come into that class. He wasn't up to the job. So we looked for a new manager and we came up with Jose Mourinho. He had the same qualities as Alex Ferguson. He's a winner and we were lucky enough to get him."<br><br>They were lucky to get him and now they have lost him, as the players will discover for real when he says his farewells at training today.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, at least the new Real manager is doing pretty well right now... They are winning and they are playing the kind of football the bosses wanted... If the next chelsea manager does well... many chelsea fans will soon forget jose. To be fair, his brand of football was rather boring and worse, he never seem not to get the club into bad news... That was the reason i think why Roman thought he wasn't suitable...</div>
