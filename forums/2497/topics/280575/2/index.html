            <div class='col-md body'>To be honest, it was shocking to read this morning... But then again, i expected this to happen since last season already cos i once said that jose's style of management will cost other club fans as well as ordinary football fans to dislike chelsea as a football club... He may have won them some titles but he has not won them much fans... And to be the "Biggest Club" in the world, they need new fans... but its not easy when you have a manager that goes around creating trouble with almost everyone (from Uefa officials to fellow managers to Scotland Yard.) making your club unlikeable...<br><br>Mourinho is a PR disaster from the very first day when the said he is the <span style="color: blue;">"Special One".</span> That arrogance made him a target for ridicule.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its over stated lah... No need too worry. When Capello was sack by Real people thought they would suffer but looking at them right now, i think the bosses may have actually got it right.<br><br>Mourinho is a good football manager but he seem to have a personality problem... And like they said, No matter how good you are, but if you have a flaw character... You are still bad.<br><br>His problem with his own players like Gallas is well known... Accusing him of planning to score own goals were rather silly. Why he still consider Hilario over Cudicini when Cech is out i still find it strange. And he ended up with SWP at such a price and let Robben go is also weird... Lying to the Scotland Yard over a dog and putting a risk to the general public shows that he doesn't seem to respect authorities.<br><br>At the end, i believe it will prove to be a right decision by Roman... Cos Mourinho was only taking chelsea down in the popularity level... For a club that spent so much money, have so many quality players only manage to attract 24,000 fans to the stadium on their opening European night is quite shocking... maybe even 1/3 are away fans... Like i said earlier, He may have won them some titles but he has not won them much fans...<br><br>If in their home country they can only have so few fans... What about the world across? I guess not many would take to the blues for a number of reasons... But mainly cos of its manager.<br><br>The big question is, Where are the real Chelsea fans? After 3, 4 yrs of success and the numbers isn't growing... There must seriously be some worry by the managements. Are the fans there just for the successful ride and have no root to the club? Or could it be due to the bad publicity that the club usually receive cos of their manager's behaviour? There is more to this than just football concerns i belief, the club's overall well being and long term image may have played a part. Imagine that they are planning to expand their stadium to 60,000 like Arsenal or maybe even 70,000... But where are the fans?<br><br>Mourinho's time at chelsea can simply be put in this way... Result wise, Good. Overall Club Performance: Poor.<br><br>I once said that i would be worried should they sack mourinho one day and replace him with someone more likeable and play better attacking football prehaps like frank rijkard... Cos with Roman's money it could really make them a team people would like to watch play and also support not only because it is winning but going to matches cos they expect to see exciting stuff on display match after match.<br></div>

The Israeli, who was the club's director of football, will take charge alongside assistant Steve Clarke.</strong><br><br>Grant will be confirmed as Stamford Bridge boss later today, BBC Sport's Garry Richardson has revealed. The 51-year-old is a close friend of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and his summer arrival at the club came after opposition from Mourinho.<br><br>Mourinho told Grant not to interfere with team affairs but the Israeli's position was strengthened with a seat on the board. Grant previously held the position of technical director at Portsmouth before moving to Chelsea. He guided Israel to the brink of World Cup qualification in 2006, having also coached Israeli sides Maccabi Tel-Aviv and Maccabi Haifa.<br><br></div>
