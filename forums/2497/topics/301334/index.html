You must be joking! Otherwise we will be like you!<br><br>Â“You just have to accept it. There are people in life who have got a Rolls Royce while some people have a Mini.<br><br>Â“We are Mini drivers.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually before the take-over, Pool was reported to be in debts already to the tune of $80 million pounds... What the takeover did was only increase their debts to almost $300m.<br><br>So actually, no difference. They didn't have the money to buy players above $15m before the takeover but at least they could still spend $20m on a striker this season...<br><br>The difference i see between them and United is they were not well manage in the last 15 yrs. They had an owner who was running the club, who was just sitting back and enjoying it while United listed on the stock market, got a qualified CEO to run its club and made it into a business.</div>
