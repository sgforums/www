              <h1>David Beckham is teaching England winger Theo Walcott how to cross<br></h1>

              </div>
              <p>Theo Walcott has revealed how David Beckham can turn him into a world
               beater in South Africa.</p>
              <p>The winger is delighted Beckham will be 
              part of the England set-up at the World Cup to pass on technical advice.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/27/article-0-09BCD65C000005DC-342_468x385.jpg" alt="Walcott has pace to burn and now Beckham is going to help him with
               his delivery" width="468" height="385">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Fast learner: Walcott has pace to burn and now 
              Beckham is going to help him with his delivery</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Walcott said yesterday: 'He has always told me to deliver the ball 
              into the space and if there is noone there, it is not your problem.</p>
              <p>'You just need to put the ball in the space and someone should get on 
              the end of it. That's what he's done. He's a fantastic crosser and 
              having him there can only help. You look at someone who has won so many 
              things and it makes you want to get the best out of yourself.'</p>
              <p>Walcott, who idolised Beckham as a young player and was thrilled to pull
               on the England No 7 shirt against Mexico on Monday, added: 'It's a 
              shame his injuries mean he won't have a chance to play in a last World 
              Cup and he is a big miss but just having him around can only help us.'</p>
              <p>Walcott has a feeling the England wide boys can shock the world in 
              South Africa. While other areas, notably central midfield, may concern 
              Fabio Capello ahead of Sunday's friendly against Japan, he is blessed 
              with great variety out wide.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/27/article-0-09BCAF0D000005DC-862_468x361.jpg" alt="David Beckham talks to Theo Walcott" width="468" height="361">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Inspiration: David Beckham talks to Theo Walcott</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>There is the electric pace of Walcott and Aaron Lennon, the trickery
               of Adam Johnson and Shaun Wright-Phillips, the industry of James Milner
               and the adapted talents of Joe Cole and Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p>Capello 
              boasts another weapon in Beckham, arguably the world's finest crosser of
               a football during the last 15 years. Beckham will fly out with the 
              squad on Wednesday and stay in the team hotel near Rustenburg.</p>
              <p>He
               will be considered a permanent member of England's backroom staff and 
              will help those striving to swing crosses on to the heads of Wayne 
              Rooney and Peter Crouch.</p>
              <p>The best results of the Italian's tenure
               have come home and away against Croatia in the qualifying campaign when
               the inspiration came from the right wing.</p>
              <p>There was Walcott's 
              brilliant hat-trick in Zagreb and Lennon's exhilarating first half-hour 
              which terrorised the Croats and set up a 5-1 win at Wembley.</p>
              <p>They
               have both been criticised for inconsistency but Capello has options. If
               Walcott's pace cannot penetrate, he can throw on the dancing feet of 
              Lennon or Adam Johnson.</p>
              <p>The England boss is expected to start
               with a 4-4-2 formation against Japan, although he is yet to finalise 
              his personnel.</p>
              <p>Gerrard's injury scare offers Capello the chance 
              to see Joe Cole in an England shirt for the first time since his knee 
              injury. Cole, Milner and Adam Johnson were all tried on the left in 
              training yesterday, Wright-Phillips, Lennon and Walcott on the right.</p>
              <h2 style="color: #e01c44;">PS</h2>
              <p>You can win without wingers.
               Sir Alf Ramsey didn't pick any from the quarter-final onwards in 1966, 
              playing a 4-4-2 formation without traditional wide men. Selecting Martin
               Peters and Alan Ball to play left and right midfield respect ively, the
               'wingless wonders' marched on to conquer the world - and Ball was man 
              of the match in the final.</p>
