              <p><strong>The 29-year-old was detained after the alleged rape of a young woman was reported to police in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</strong></p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Bramble, a former England Under 21 international, was being quizzed by detectives investigating the alleged attack at a Newcastle city centre hotel.</p>
              </div>
              <p>A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Police received a report of a rape of a woman at a city centre hotel in Newcastle in the early hours.</p>
              <p>'Two men, aged 29 and 30, have been arrested on suspicion of rape.'</p>
              <p>It is believed the alleged rape happened at the plush, four-star Vermont Hotel, which has an entrance close to bars and nightclubs on Newcastle's quayside.</p>
              <p>A hotel spokesman refused to comment.</p>
              <p>Sunderland have so far not commented. </p>
              <p>Bramble's solicitor Mark Haslam was unavailable for comment.</p>
              <p>The second man arrested was Bramble's brother, Tesfaye Bramble, police confirmed.</p>
              <p>The 30-year-old striker, who has played international football for Montserrat, a British island in the Caribbean, plays for Eastern Counties League Premier Division club Leiston, in Suffolk. </p>
              <p>He spent time in the Football League with Southend.</p>
              <p>In October 2003, Bramble, together with West Ham striker Carlton Cole, was one of four men arrested for an alleged rape on a 17-year-old girl in a London hotel.</p>
              <p>But after questioning by police Bramble and Cole were released without charge.</p>

              <p><strong>Titus Bramble has been bailed in connection with the alleged rape of a teenager at a hotel.</strong></p>
              <p>Bramble, 29, who plays for Sunderland, was questioned by detectives after the alleged assault on the 19-year-old girl.</p>
              <p>The former England under-21 defender was arrested by officers at 6am at the four-star Vermont Hotel in Newcastle city centre.</p>
              <p>He was held along with his brother, Tesfaye Bramble, 30, who plays football for Eastern Counties League Premier Division club Leiston, in Suffolk</p>
              <p>Both men were interviewed by detectives at a Newcastle police station. Officers are believed to want to question a third man.</p>
              <p>A police spokesman said yesterday: 'Police received a report of a rape of a woman at a city centre hotel in Newcastle in the early hours. Two men, aged 29 and 30, have been arrested on suspicion of rape.' </p>
              <p>Both Brambles were later released on bail by police. A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Both men have been bailed pending further inquiries.'</p>
              <p>The alleged victim has told police she was drinking with a friend in Newcastle's Quayside on Tuesday night, just hours after Sunderland's 2-1 defeat to West Ham.</p>
              <p>Bramble, who did not play in the match, was drinking with friends at the Baby Lynch bar which was hosting a student night. His group are believed to have been introduced to the two girls.</p>
              <p>He later allegedly got into an argument with a supporter of his previous club Wigan FC, who was thrown out by the bouncers.</p>
              <p>One witness said Bramble, who was with his brother and two other men in the VIP section, was drinking heavily.</p>
              <p>A witness said: 'Bramble's group were led to the VIP section and given a table of their own. Bramble was sober when he came in but he started drinking vodka.</p>
              <p>'He was chatting to loads of girls. I don't know which girls he left with but he was with students – really young pretty girls.'</p>
              <p>The alleged rape victim is not believed to have gone back to the hotel with the group. Instead she got a taxi back to her friend's home. But in the early hours of yesterday she apparently drove to the Vermont Hotel. </p>
              <p>The teenager booked herself into a room. The girl claims she woke at 4.35am and says she was naked and being raped. She left the hotel and then alerted police.</p>
              <p>Bramble, a former Newcastle player, and his brother have both denied raping the girl.</p>
              <p>Officers from Northumbria Police's specialist rape investigation team interviewed the girl and her friend and have carried out a medical examination.</p>
              <p>The latest allegations come at a time of increasingly lurid headlines about football stars.</p>
              <p>Last night Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn said: 'Titus strenuously denies any wrong-doing and will be doing everything within his power to clear his name. I, as chairman and the club as a whole, totally support Titus in his efforts.'</p>
