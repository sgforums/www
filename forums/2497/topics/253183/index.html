            <div class='col-md body'>With Charlton having lost and confirmed for relagation, the fight is now between Wigan, West Ham and Sheffield Utd.<br><br>It so happens that Sheffield Utd will be hosting Wigan for their last Premiership match. West Ham is away to Man U. Both matches will be played concurrently, adding to the drama of it all.<br><br><img src="http://aycu36.webshots.com/image/14075/2001795343510226831_rs.jpg"><br><br>West Ham need at least a point at Old Trafford to be assured of safety.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secnario 1</span><br>However, should West Ham lose the match against Man U, they will be relegated if Wigan beats Sheffield United. Wigan already have a superior goal difference to West Ham and with a West Ham Loss and a Wigan win will further increase Wigan's goal difference advantage. Unless Wigan beat Sheffield by a 3 goal  margin then Sheffield will go down instead.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenario 2</span><br>Should West Ham get the min point against the new EPL champions, Sheffield United will be safe and Wigan will be relagated if Wigan does not win the match.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scenario 3</span><br>A West Ham win and a Wigan away win will however result in Sheff Utd being relegated. Wigan will be level on points with Sheff Utd and in fact beat Sheff Utd on goal difference. A victory for Wigan would mean it's goal difference of '-23' would become '-22' at least and Sheff Utd's '-22' would become a '-23' instsead.<br><br>The onus is on West Ham and Wigan to get something out of their matches with Wigan needing nothing less than a win. Wigan however still need to rely on Man U to beat West Ham. Sheff Utd might still be safe if they lose as long as West Ham lose.<br><br>The other end of the table is very interesting indeed.</div>

Overall what you say is pretty logical, but I seriously think we can just forget about past league results and guess. Reason being that Sheffield and West Ham will be going at it as if they were cup finals. The way the game will be played will be very different. And should Sheffield concede early goal at Wigan, it will make for a very open match as they will chase to at least get a draw.<br><br>But I kind of agree with you, it's most likely going to be a draw at Old Trafford so it would really be down to Sheffield and Wigan. Wigan is at a disadvantage but I think it's going to be like a Cup Final, you're never going to know what to expect.</div>

West Ham has assured us that it has terminated the contract. It has also indicated that under no circumstances will it regard the contract as binding on West Ham and that it will defend any proceedings brought against West Ham seeking its enforcement.'</div>

West Ham travel to Old Trafford on Sunday fighting for their Premiership lives and Sir Alex Ferguson has promised to put out a full-strength side so that the supporters can salute the champions. </strong><br><br>Although Lawrie SanchezÂ’s side had to wait until Monday evening, when Charlton were beaten at home to Tottenham, to preserve their Premiership status, Curbishley believes Fulham should still be in the dogfight. Fulham beat Liverpool 1-0 and it means West Ham, Wigan Athletic or Sheffield United will join Charlton and Watford in the Championship next season.<br><br>Curbishley said: "Sir Alex Ferguson has already come out and said he wonÂ’t disrespect the league and he will be putting out a full-strength team. "We have been keeping our counsel, but when you look at the Liverpool team that day I think Paul Jewell at Wigan was the only one to come out and be vocal about it. "There wonÂ’t be many unfamiliar names in Manchester UnitedÂ’s team. I spoke to Sir Alex on Monday to congratulate him on winning the Premiership title, but we didnÂ’t speak for long."<br><br>Ferguson and Curbishley are close friends, but events could conspire against the Hammers if they are beaten at Old Trafford on Sunday. Victory for United would leave West Ham vulnerable and if Wigan can pull off a surprise by beating Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, CurbishleyÂ’s side will be relegated.<br><br>The Hammers looked doomed when they were beaten 4-3 by Tottenham on March 3, but they have staged a remarkable recovery. Inspired by Carlos Tevez, they have since won six of their last eight games and are on the verge of securing Premiership status for a third consecutive season.<br><br>The future of their Argentina striker remains unclear Â— their Icelandic chairman Eggert Magnusson will sit down with the playerÂ’s representative Kia Joorabchian to discuss the future next week Â— but the stage is set for him to make a dramatic impact at Old Trafford.<br><br><strong>THE Â£60M DROP </strong><br><br>1.
