              <p>Goals from Leroy Lita and substitute Tuncay earned Gareth Southgate's side a
              2-0 win over Doncaster and put Middlesbrough on top of the 
              Championship.</p>
              <table style="height: 110px;" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="27" align="right">

              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td> </td>

              <p>Tuncay fired them in front in the 17th minute and Lita made sure of the points
              in the second half. It was Boro's third successive win and they have yet to
              concede a goal.</p>
              <p>Newcastle finished the day in second place behind Middlesbrough after a
              convincing 2-0 away win over Crystal Palace - their first in the league since
              February.</p>
              <p>Kevin Nolan's first goal for the club put Newcastle in front after just two
              minutes to make light of their off the field problems.</p>
              <p>United went further ahead in the 21st minute thanks to a stunning drive into
              the top corner by Ryan Taylor and Palace could not find a way back into the
              game.</p>
              <p>Preston moved into fourth place and left visitors Peterborough two off the
              bottom with a 2-0 win at Deepdale. Preston went ahead through former Liverpool
              striker Neil Mellor and Billy Jones added a second on the half-hour to give
              North End a comfortable victory.</p>
              <p>Coventry slumped to ninth in the table after losing to struggling Swansea 1-0
              at the Ricoh Stadium. Sammy Clingan missed a 12th minute spot-kick for the Sky
              Blues and they paid the penalty when Wales international defender Ashley
              Williams scored the decider for the Swans in the 69th minute to record their
              first win of the season.</p>
              <p>Sheffield United climbed to fifth in the table with a fine 3-1 away win at
              troubled Reading. The home side scored their first league goal of the season
              through Matthew Mills in the 13th minute to give them a first-half advantage.
              But they could not sustain the lead and Stephen Quinn levelled before the break.
              Second-half strikes from Jamie Ward and a last-minute effort from David
              Cotterill sealed the win.</p>
              <p>A 53rd minute goal from prolific scorer Matty Fryatt earned Leicester a 1-0 win
              over bottom club Barnsley and pushed City into sixth place.</p>
              <p>QPR shared a 1-1 draw with struggling Nottingham Forest at Loftus Road. Mikele
              Leigertwood put the home side ahead in the 25th minute but David McGoldrick
              equalised in the 56th minute.</p>
              <p>A last-minute goal from Miles Addison completed a fine Derby fightback as they
              earned all three points with a 2-1 win over Plymouth at Pride Park.</p>
              <p>Plymouth stunned Derby by taking the lead in the 17th minute after Jake Buxton
              was adjudged to have fouled Alan Judge. Judge then composed himself to put the
              visitors in front from the penalty spot. But Derby fought back to level before
              the break when Buxton redeemed himself by scoring the equaliser and Addison
              pounced in the final minute.</p>
              <p>Sheffield Wednesday moved into 11th place thanks to a 4-0 demolition of
              Scunthorpe. Wednesday made light work of United with two goals inside the first
              12 minutes. Richard Wood headed the Owls in front in the sixth minute before
              Michael Johnson added a second six minutes later. The home side then went three
              in front through Marcus Tudgay in the 34th minute. The scoring was completed by
              Darren Potter in the 58th minute.</p>
              <p>Watford twice squandered the lead against Blackpool in a contest that
              eventually ended 2-2. Tommy Smith gave the home side the lead in the 23rd minute
              after collecting a pass from Danny Graham to finish in style. But Alex Baptiste
              levelled in the 55th minute only for Watford to re-establish their advantage
              through Tom Cleverly seven minutes later. But the home side were denied victory
              when Gary Taylor-Fletcher struck a second equaliser in the 71st minute.</p>
              <p>In the late kick-off, Richard Wright produced an inspired display in goal for Ipswich but could not
              prevent them continuing their poor start to the season with a 2-0 defeat at West
              Brom.</p>
              <p>Roy Keane's side are still without a league win this season and had Wright to
              thank for keeping the score down as the former Arsenal man made a string of fine
              saves before saving Luke Moore's second-half penalty.</p>
              <p>The Baggies were at their entertaining best and Youssouf Mulumbu's first goal
              for the club put them in front after only 10 minutes before Robert Koren doubled
              their lead seven minutes before half-time.</p>
