              <p>very entertaining match. alot of nice shots and close calls by both teams.</p>
              <p>man city is dragged down by the fact their defenders are toothless in the attack. zabaletta especially is the weakest link, next to bridge. barry also is overrated. the holding midfielders are also poor in attack.</p>
              <p>left with only tevez, adebayor (off form), bellamy, johnson; they ran out of ideas.</p>
              <p>anyway mancini is just talk only. reminds me of benitez. never secure 4th place already keep bragging. now he can learn to eat his words. arrogant asshole.</p>

              <p>spurs totally deserved the win.</p>
              <p>city were good only in the first 15 mins.  their overdependence on tevez were obvious.  when mancini made the substitutions i couldnt help laughing.</p>
              <p>vieria?  why does a rich club like city need an old man like him?</p>
              <p>swp for johnson?  i couldnt and didnt see what he could have done or did do to turn the match around.</p>
              <p>santa cruz?  he hardly had a touch of the ball.</p>
              <p>adebayor did not have a single chance if i remember correctly.</p>
              <p>its obvious city doesnt have anyone better in the reserves.  they need to correct this next season.</p>

              <p>Arsenal are quite lucky cos Fulham have a Europa final on Wed, 3 days after their  not so important to win match against the gunners on Sunday...  I think had it been another week or more, Fulham would go to Arsenal and play their hearts out and possibly even beat them with the gunners squad currently quite weak... But with a Europa final so close, Fulham might just send out their reserve  so as not to risk injuries or fatigue just before they meet <span style="color: #000000;">Atletico Madrid on Wed.</span></p>

              <p>4th spot only means that they will enter the Champions League playoffs.</p>
              <p>But that said, they actually have a pretty reasonable chance of getting the automatic third spot. They need to win their final match, while Arsenal needs to lose their final match.</p>
              <p>And mind you, Arsenal must face Fulham. Remember that Fulham is a bunch of giantkillers who have already scalped the likes of Man U and Juve this year.</p>

              <p>That's the problem when you have an owner with huge bags of money. He will see himself as having the right to play Football Manager with the cheat code on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Everyone has been pointing out the same thing - Man City's strikeforce is awesome, but their defensive cover is woeful.</p>
              <p>All Man City has to do is to get a couple of good defenders costing maybe 20 million pounds total, and recall Joe Hart as the backup goalie for Shay Given.</p>
              <p>Problem is, all that money is obscuring what should be plainly obvious. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
