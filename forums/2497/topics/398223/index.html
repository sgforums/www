              <p>Forget Liverpool, forget Aston Villa... The battle for 4th has come down to these two clubs only... And this match could decide who gets that all important 4th place in the Premier League.</p>

              <p>Personally, I am hoping for a City win and they get that 4th spot...</p>

              <p>well that is true, but if city gets to finish 4th and qualify for the champions league, the premier league title race will get even more interesting with a new player, and with the money they have available, they can attract better players, thus overall bringing up the reputation of the premier league again..</p>
              <p>not to mention that with the money they're throwing around, they can help some clubs resolve their financial problems..</p>
              <p>it depends on how you look at it..either way, city will be in the champions league either this season or the next, its only a matter of time, they will still spend huge load of money this summer..</p>
              <p>and if city does get 4th and qualify for the ucl, plus their incoming spending spree, you can rest assure it will draw a reaction from the other top 3 teams.. fun times are coming, and this is from a chelsea fan.</p>
              <p>without any disrespect to spurs, i don't really think that the top 3 are as worried about them as compared to what man city could potentially do for next season.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man City v Spurs: Battle of the wingers
               - and they’re all British!</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> ace Adam Johnson is convinced 
              tomorrow's clash with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> will be decided by the wingers.</p>
              <p>Johnson is determined that along with Craig Bellamy and Shaun 
              Wright-Phillips he will get the better of Aaron Lennon, Gareth Bale and 
              David Bentley in Wednesday night’s titanic, sold out clash with fellow 
              Champions League hopefuls Spurs.</p>
              <p>He told City's website: “It is great that the manager has such faith in 
              wide players.</p>
              <p>“I won the penalty and thankfully set up the second and Craig and Shaun 
               combined for the third. Wingers are an important weapon in most top 
              side’s attacks.</p>
              <p>“Look at the impact Shaun had when he came on against tired legs against
               Villa. He was too much for them to handle. His arrival put the game out
               of reach.</p>
              <p>“I know there is a tradition of wingers here at City stretching back 
              many, many years. I think the fans like watching players running at each
               other with the ball.”</p>

              <p>I go for Man City, cos i find Mancini tho old, but very manly and handsome.  Spurs manager is so ungly, but his players are quite good looking, like corluka and that croatian kro...forget how to spell his name  </p>
              <p>But i love to see what kind of hairstyle Adebeyor will put out this time, the last time, with two pony buns, so funny...hahaha..   he looks like my young time hairtsyle in nursery.</p>

              <p>If Man City goes top 4, I think Robinho will be willing to go back to Man City to play alongside with Adebayor and Tevez as he will have chance to play for UCL once again.</p>
              <p>For Man City squad, some of them had played UCL before whereas most Spurs players do not. (But Gomes, Crouch, thai Russian stroker played before)</p>
              <p>So, hope Man City win by getting avenge from 3-0 loss last time.</p>

              <p><strong>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp says he can understand why Sir Alex Ferguson allowed Carlos Tevez to leave Manchester United for local rivals City.</strong></p>
              <p>Tevez has proved one of the deadliest strikers in the Premier League this season following his switch to Eastlands, and Spurs face a huge task in trying to contain him on Wednesday night to ensure they remain in fourth place going into the final day on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Many believe United made a mistake in allowing Tevez to leave as they go into the weekend a point behind leaders Chelsea, but Redknapp feels Ferguson is completely justified in his decision.</p>
              <p>In a five-part exclusive interview with <em>Soccernet</em> in the build-up to the big game, Redknapp said: "There is only one point in it in for the race for the title, and that's the fine dividing lines these days and, let's face it, he has achieved that without <span style="color: #000000;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span> or Tevez.</p>
              <p>"To be fair to Sir Alex, he probably thought that £45 million - or whatever the true cost for Tevez was - was a bit much, plus his wages of £180,000 a week, when he wasn't even a regular in the United team last season, spending most of his time coming off the bench.</p>
              <p>"Sir Alex has spent £30 million on Berbatov and he had Rooney and, at the start of the season, he would have thought that was enough, and so would most people."</p>
              <p>Redknapp, though, admits Tevez is likely to be a threat this week and has concerns about the strength of his fellow attackers at City.</p>
              <p>"He just never stops. He works hard," he said. "He needs looking after - he is a handful. When you look at City's options in attack, it's mind-blowing. They have a phenomenal amount of talent and so many options.</p>
              <p>"They have <span style="color: #000000;">Emmanuel Adebayor</span> up front with Carlos Tevez, <span style="color: #000000;">Craig Bellamy</span>, [Adam] Johnson, and players like <span style="color: #000000;">Shaun Wright-Phillips</span>, plus <span style="color: #000000;">Roque Santa Cruz</span>, who cannot even get into the team at all, and yet last season he was just magnificent with Blackburn.</p>
              <p>"That is a fantastic array of attacking talent, and you would have to argue one of the best in the business - certainly in the Premier League and even in Europe."</p>
              <p>Despite his admiration for the City squad, Redknapp insists he is happier with his own team.</p>
              <p>"We have <span style="color: #000000;">Aaron Lennon</span> coming back, and what a player he is, with his pace," he said. "Even behind him, there is Bale, who has come on in such leaps and bounds and has become an attacking force.</p>
              <p>"I wouldn't swap our players for any of theirs. We have a terrific group of players, and that's a nice position to be in."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROBERTO MANCINI claims Manchester City are on the brink of making history. And the Eastlands boss does not just mean reaching the Champions League for the first time.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Italian insists that will be the first step towards winning the title next season. City face Tottenham tonight in what has been described as the £50million match for fourth spot and entry into world football's elite club competition.</p>
              <p class="article">Mancini said: "I think we can finish fourth this season and, yes, it can happen that we can then win the title. I do feel as though we can change our history so we must be positive.</p>
              <p class="article">"This game against Tottenham will probably decide where we finish this season. If we win we have probably a 70-80 per cent chance of getting fourth.</p>
              <p class="article">"Of course, after that, we must also play a different game in London against West Ham." City will probably have to win both matches with Spurs a point ahead of them and facing already relegated Burnley on the final day. But, after a turbulent season, Mancini believes it could well be City's destiny.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "It would be an amazing experience to get this club to finish fourth. "It's like the last game I had with Inter against Parma when we won the Scudetto. This is important just like that.</p>
              <p class="article">"If we finish fourth, I will be happy for all the City supporters because they deserve something this special.</p>
              <p class="article">"I will be happy for the owners, the players, everyone associated with the club." The prospect of Champions League football will also be a carrot to dangle in front of the big stars Mancini wants to buy in the summer.</p>
              <p class="article">The City boss added: "If we finish fourth we will have a good chance of getting two or three really good players for next season. "Even if we don't, I think that will be a big mistake if players don't want to come here because I think in the future Manchester City will be a fantastic team."</p>
              <p class="article">Mancini believes former boss Mark Hughes should also take half the credit after laying the ground work before his sacking in December.</p>
              <p class="article">The Italian said: "Hughes worked here for the first five months of the season and worked very well. If we get fourth position he deserves 50 per cent of the credit. "I think he worked well here. I've worked for five months, he's worked for five months, so the season has been split between us."</p>
              <p class="article">With so much resting on tonight's game at Eastlands, Mancini is calling on the fans to raise the roof. He said: "The supporters must be better than in our last game against Aston Villa on Saturday - even though we won 3-1. We really need a good atmosphere for this one."</p>
