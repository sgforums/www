            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/107157.jpg"><br><br><strong>Chelsea captain John Terry has confirmed that talks over a new contract have broken down. Terry confirmed for the first time that contract talks between himself and the club have broken down but insisted the situation was not irretrievable and wants them all to remain at Chelsea. However, the England captain also maintained he would not be making the next move in a bid to solve the impasse as his future and those of midfielder Lampard and coach Mourinho continue to cloud a sensational season for the club.</strong><br><br>Terry still has two years of his contract left to run but is disappointed with both the length of his proposed contract extension as well as the wages on offer. The Chelsea stalwart wants to stay at the club for life and is understood to have wanted a nine-year extension but the club have only offered him five and a salary way below his Â£130,000-a-week demands.<br><br>The club have yet to make a formal contract offer to Lampard and Mourinho fears he will be axed by Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich - even if he delivers an unprecedented quadruple of trophies this season. Now Terry, speaking at the launch of the King of Shaves 'Young Blades' programme for 2007, revealed: "There is no movement at the minute. We've been in and the offer has been made but it has gone no further than that. I won't be me making the next move - no.<br><br>"I said to the club that I want to stay for life and it is as simple as that. "Negotiations have broken down, like they do throughout contracts, but who knows when we are going to be speaking again. "I am not going in as I said. I've got so many more important things on my mind. "The situation is retrievable and it is not linked to what Jose does. Definitely not. "He's been great for me and hopefully the club will do the right thing by him, myself and Frank Lampard - who is up for renewal.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terry style of defending is not really in demand in Europe... Anyway, i don't find him to be a really great defender. Just look at Woodgate, as good as terry if not better... Lampard would be more able to adapt to the European style better.<br><br>Anyway... 9 years contract? Come on... Does he really think he can still play like he is presently at 34, 35? He better wise up and accept the 5 yrs one or he will be sold off...</div>

And it was also to lure them to the Bridge.  Terry is already at the Bridge... Imagine $130,000 for 9 yrs! If Sol Cambell got a 9 yrs contract from arsenal back then, Right now they will still need to pay him this super huge salary at 33 yrs old even if he is no longer the same guy they signed yrs ago... would that be fair to the club?</div>
