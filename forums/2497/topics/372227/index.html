              <p class="small bold">BLUE SUITS YOU, ROO ... Chelsea star Lamps would love to have England pal Rooney alongside him for his club</p>
              <p class="small bold"> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">FRANK LAMPARD has revealed that Wayne Rooney is his dream team-mate. The Chelsea midfielder lined up alongside Wazza for England in Holland in midweek - but admitted he would love to have him in his club side, too. That is a wish Manchester United are not going to grant but Lamps' opinion shows just how highly he rates Rooney.</h2>
              <p class="article">With Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez having left United this summer, the Old Trafford club will be looking towards Rooney for inspiration more than ever.</p>
              <p class="article">As far as Lampard is concerned though, his Three Lions mate is more than capable of handling the pressure. Lampard, 31, said: "Wayne is the most talented player I have ever played alongside.</p>
              <p class="article">"As a midfielder, as soon as I get on the ball I want to play it in behind the other team's midfield or defence. "I need someone to be ahead of that action, already getting into a good position. As you learn to play with Wayne, you realise that his awareness is exceptional. It's his key strength.</p>
              <p class="article">"Wayne Rooney is an incredible player. He would get into any club or international side in the world." Of course, Rooney took his nick name of 'Wazza' from England legend Paul Gascoigne.</p>
              <p class="article">Lamps puts the 24-year-old on the same level as Gazza though and reckons Rooney is next best thing to playing with Gascoigne. He said: "If Chelsea could have one player from the history of the league then for me it would be Gazza.</p>
              <p class="article">"Gazza was buzzing everywhere. Characters like Paul Gascoigne and Wayne Rooney bring a lot more to the team than their evident ability. "Gazza had the ability to see a pass before anyone else and he also had an amazing aura about him. When I was growing up and first playing football Gazza was my hero."</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea open the Premier League season today at home to Hull in what will be Carlo Ancelotti's first competitive match in charge. Lampard has been asked to play in a more advanced position in a diamond formation. It has meant the England man has been slightly less involved in build-up play, but he remained completely unfazed by the change made by Ancelotti. </p>
