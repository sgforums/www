              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER is jealous of Manchester United's FA Cup exit because he reckons it has done them a huge Champions League favour.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Arsenal boss saw his side scrape through to a tricky fourth-round tie at Stoke. Goals from Aaron Ramsey and Eduardo cancelled out an Alessandro Diamanti opener.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger is hunting his first trophy in five years with a fight on all three fronts in the FA Cup, the Premier League and the Champions League. But he insists that United's shock KO by Leeds will help rival Alex Ferguson's European quest.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger said: "I'd have preferred United to have won. Losing to Leeds has not done them so much of a favour in the Premier League when you look at the fixtures. "But in the Champions League, yes. The fifth round of the cup is just three days before United go to AC Milan. "And just before the fifth round, we would play in the previous midweek and four days after it we play Porto."</p>
              <p class="article">In fact, the Gunners face a mammoth task between the fourth and fifth rounds of the FA Cup - should they triumph at the Britannia Stadium.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger's boys play Aston Villa, United, Chelsea and Liverpool in an 18-day spell that will shape their entire season.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger shuffled his team against the Hammers, as injuries bit deep, making five changes from the side that thrashed Portsmouth in midweek.</p>
              <p class="article">The world's oldest knockout competition is the last on Wenger's list of priorities. And when asked if he would still try to put out his strongest side should they get past Stoke, he replied: "It depends on how many players I get back from injury and whether I do something in the transfer window.</p>
              <p class="article">"I have Andrey Arshavin, Theo Walcott, Denilson and Cesc Fabregas out and that is without even mentioning the players at the back who cannot play."</p>
              <p class="article">West Ham counterpart Gianfranco Zola was clearly annoyed at the way his team threw away a deserved lead but admitted the Arsenal winner was a stunner from Eduardo.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger said: "If Manchester United or City buy a British player in the window, then yes, it will be busy. If those two buy a player from abroad, then I think the window will be very quiet."</p>

              <p>He has a point. Somehow they like to schedule FA Cup matches just after or before Champions League matches.</p>
              <p>E.g. 07/08 season FA Cup Round 5 Arsenal Vs Man U then Lyon away 4 days later. Round 6 Lyon home then Portsmouth Vs Man U 4 days later.</p>

              <p>Big guns Dimitar Berbatov and Gary Neville are in line for the chop when United face bitter rivals <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/clubs/manchester-city">Manchester City</a></abbr> in tomorrow's Carling Cup semi.</p>
              <p>Anderson, Gabriel Obertan, Danny Welbeck, Darron Gibson and Fabio could also be ditched.</p>
              <p>Old Trafford boss Fergie was left stunned by Sunday's FA Cup loss to Leeds.</p>
              <p>His No 2 Mike Phelan said: "We will start to think a little bit differently with our selection for Wednesday.</p>
              <p>"I don't think we did ourselves justice against Leeds in certain
              departments of the field. We had players out there who play for <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/clubs/manchester-united">Manchester United</a></abbr> and they did not perform as expected of them."</p>
              <p>Fergie had virtually selected his team to make the short journey to
              Eastlands - but the 1-0 defeat by Leeds has forced him to think again.</p>
              <p>Phelan insisted they expected the XI put out against the League One side to be comfortably good enough to win.</p>
              <p>He added: "We either go experienced, or we go youth. This time we picked a bit of a mixture and it didn't work.</p>
              <p>"This is a major blow. We need to progress in this cup. We need
              to be in finals of cup competitions like this. To go out at the stage
              we have is unacceptable really."</p>
