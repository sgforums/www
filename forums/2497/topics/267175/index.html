            <div class='col-md body'><strong>STEVEN GERRARD can't wait for Liverpool's tussle for the title.</strong><br><br>The Reds skipper is delighted with the Â£20million signing of Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres.<br><br>Gerrard believes the Spaniard's arrival will send shockwaves through the Premier League.<br><br>And the England star insists it proves Liverpool will be battling among the big boys next season.<br><br>He said: "Torres has all the attributes to become firmly established as world class.<br><br>"Some of the other players we're being linked with excite me too. It's great to see us looking at young, hungry players with their best years ahead of them.<br><br>"Since I've been in the first team I can't remember us making such a major statement of intent in the transfer market as this.<br><br>"In recent years it's only really been Manchester United and Chelsea buying players around the Â£20m mark, so it's great to see us able to compete for players of that kind of value.<br><br>"The Liverpool board has always backed the manager and we've invested heavily over the years.<br><br>"Roy Evans and Gerard Houllier spent a lot of money, but we've all been looking for that extra step to close the gap and attract the kind of players United and Chelsea are able to afford.<br><br>"This is the first summer in a long time we've been able to do that. I'll bet players and fans from other clubs have been looking at us and thinking: 'Aye, aye, Liverpool are making a move for some of the big boys now.'<br><br>"That's what's so exciting. When the American owners took over they talked about three stages.<br><br>"The first was proceeding with the new stadium, which they're doing. Then they wanted to secure the key players on long-term contracts, which they've done.<br><br>"Stage three is all about spending money on the players to make us compete for the Premiership, which has now started.<br><br>"We're looking in great shape, not only going into this season but for the next few years."<br><br>Gerrard has also backed club record signing Torres to set the Premier League alight.<br><br>He added: "I've never played against him but I've watched him a lot. I really like him and I'm sure he will prove a great signing for us.<br><br>"Not only is he a great player now, but potentially he has all the attributes to become firmly established as world class.<br><br>"He's at the right club and will be working with the right people to make that happen.<br><br>"He's a fast, strong centre-forward who likes the ball being played into his feet. They are the kind of strikers I love playing with.<br><br>"I've no doubt we're going to get our money's worth out of him, with him being such a young player."</div>
