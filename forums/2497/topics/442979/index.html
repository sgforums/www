              <p>Should he be found guilty of insulting or offensive behaviour, Suarez could be handed a two-match ban which would see him miss <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/"><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool's</span></a> forthcoming ties with QPR and Aston Villa.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was cautious when quizzed after the game about the allegations.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>"I've not seen the picture and I am not taking anybody's word for it," he said. "But until you have proved it is true to me, I won't comment."</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Dalglish went on to defend his striker after he was subjected to<span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">"cheat" taunts by fans unhappy</span> at the way the player went to ground regularly.</p>
              <p>"Scandalous," the Scot said of Fulham fans' behaviour. "I would like to see you write that in the paper because you would be in a bit of trouble as well. You write what you want to write.</p>
              <p>"At the end of the day, we will look after Luis the best we can and I think it is about time he got a bit of protection from some people."</p>
              <p>Suarez is currently awaiting a date for his hearing at which he will deny an FA racism charge after allegations made by Manchester United defender Patrice Evra back in October.</p>

              <h1>Little Sympathy For Spearing And Suarez</h1>
              <p>Not many of you disagree with Jay Spearing's red card. And it seems as though Suarez is still public enemy number one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I forsee the following happening:<br><br>1) Luis Suarez denies having ever made a gesture<br>2) Suarez says 'I only showed them a gesture which the Fulham fans show each other' once there is evidence of him showing a gesture towards Fulham fans<br>3) Suarez then says 'It is a Uruguayan gesture of affection towards West Londoners' when the actual nature of the gesture is made public<br>4) Gus Poyet comes out in support of Suarez saying 'I've been showed rude gestures my whole career and the Fulham fans should stop crying like babies'<br><br>Suarez is a mega-twunt. Even Tevez is more palatable.<br><strong>Saj (Tevez is gonna make me regret that last statement, isn't he?), Singapore</strong></p>

              <p><strong>It Was A Red Card<br></strong>I thought I would drop you a line or two based on the reactions of the Liverpool supporters who surrounded this one lonely Fulham supporter last night.<br><br>1) It was a red card, get over it. Studs up, both feet off the deck is a dangerous leg breaking tackle. Getting the ball does not provide you with impunity.<br><br>2) The Senderos incident: the first contact was outside the box so yell for a penalty all you want, it wasn't one. There were other Fulham players in the area so it wasn't a red card either.<br><br>3) Suarez wasn't offside but we'll chalk that up to karma as a balance to his continual affliction to the laws of gravity.<br><br>4) Surrounding and berating the ref after a red card has been given makes the team look like Manchester United when you wear red.<br><br>5) Dalglish has said he will take action against Suarez for the gesture at the Fulham crowd so when he sees the picture it will be interesting to see what the action is.<br><br>6) Why does Dalglish dress like a Market Street trader selling knock-off gonzo porn?<br><strong>Mark 'Fortress Cottage' Fawkner, Dublin</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><br>...Regarding Jay Spearing's red card last night, for Dalglish to say "it's not his fault there's somebody standing there" as an excuse for a reckless tackle is clearly pathetic. Is he saying that you are free to launch into any kind of reckless challenge you wish and if an opponent happens to be in the vicinity of the ball he can expect whatever consequences? As for "he won the ball" - again, totally irrelevant. The follow-through was over-the-top, so he had to walk.<br><br>Still at least the red card gave 'King' Kenny an excuse for yet more dropped points against "lesser" opponents. <br><br>YNWA? More like YAWN...<br><strong>Christopher Yorckstrasse</strong></p>

              In the grand old scheme of things Suarez indicating the score to the Fulham crowd is not a terrible act. I'm sure the 'there were kids present' crowd will start their moralising (although I would argue that kids shouldn't be at a football match at 9.45pm on a school night anyway..still...), but it's hardly a war crime. I think his persistent diving is a far worse blight on the game personally.<br><br>The most amusing stuff I've seen though is via the non-idiot proof medium of Twitter. There are genuinely Liverpool fans accusing the media of photo-shopping the picture to create the image. Genuinely.<br><br>And I thought Gooners were paranoid at times.<br><strong>Tom (cheered my evening up just reading the online nonsense) Cheshire Gooner</strong></strong><p></p>

              <p>* Congratulations to Alex Ferguson and the media in their successful campaign to ensure that Luis Suarez has to be hung, drawn and quartered before the referee will even consider a freekick. I know he makes a meal of things, but is there any other player who is apparently fair game for any foul? <br><strong>Nick Smith</strong></p>

              <p>Fourth Out Of Reach?</p>
              It didn't take long for us to miss Lucas did it?<br><br>Yes the red card was harsh but even with 11 there were big spaces between defence and midfield that Dempsey drifted into making Fullham look very dangerous every time they attacked.<br><br>Johnson was again partly (Reina did spill it badly) at fault for the goal. He does not seem to realise you should not let the attacker cut inside and show him down the outside. It was the exact copy of what Mata did to him a few games ago. Does he not watch the match DVDs and learn from his mistakes? When is Kenny going to understand he is just a big liability in defence? Please play Kelly instead.<br><br>Adam is also just too slow for me (and easily exposed when run at) and his dead ball delivery/passing was not great last night. For me a central midfield of Adam and Spearing is just not good enough. <br><br>Carroll seems a million miles away from anything like the player he was at Newcastle. Obviously lacking confidence and belief and can't seem to stay on his feet anymore. What has happened to him?<br><br>Fourth is looking very unlikely this season and will be interesting to see how the American owners react if we fail in our attempt to get there. Will Kenny be shown the door?<br><strong>Stef (At least Enrique and Suarez had good games) LFC</strong></strong><p></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LUIS SUAREZ will today discover if he faces a second FA charge for his hand gesture in the defeat at Fulham on Monday night.</h2>
              <p>The Uruguayan was caught on camera flicking a finger towards fans who abused him in the 1-0 loss.</p>
              <p>If the FA decide he has a case to answer, Suarez could land a two-game suspension or hefty fine.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney got a similar ban for swearing down a TV camera.</p>
              <p>Suarez is facing a racism charge, which he denies, following claims from United's Patrice Evra in an Anfield draw in October.</p>
              <p>Suarez has also had to contend with claims from opponents he is a diver.</p>
              <p>His gesture to Fulham fans came after they berated him with 'cheat' chants when he went down under a Brede Hangeland challenge, but referee Kevin Friend ignored his penalty claims.</p>
              <p>Yet Fulham's ex-Kop star John Arne Riise said: "That's football. If he is diving or not, that's not up to us. If we feel it's not a free-kick we tell him. Suarez is a good player."</p>
              <p>Liverpool are unlikely to appeal Jay Spearing's red card in the 1-0 defeat.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Luis Suárez" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luis-suarez"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Luis Suárez</strong></span></a><strong> has been charged with improper conduct and </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> with failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion for incidents that occurred during the 1-0 defeat at Fulham on Monday evening.</strong></p>
              <p>Suárez was pictured allegedly making an obscene gesture towards Fulham fans as he walked towards the tunnel at the end of the match and when Jay Spearing was sent off for a dangerous tackle on Moussa Dembélé on 72 minutes, the Liverpool players surrounded Kevin Friend, the referee, to protest against the decision.</p>
              <p>Regarding the charges a statement on the Football Association website said: "Liverpool Football Club have been charged by <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on The FA" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa"><span style="color: #005689;">the FA</span></a> with failing to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion, following the dismissal of Jay Spearing. The charge is in relation to Liverpool's Premier League fixture at Fulham on 5 December 2011. The club has until 4pm on Monday 12 December to respond to the charge. Luis Suárez has also been charged following an incident in the same game. The Liverpool player is charged with improper conduct, in relation to an alleged gesture made towards the Fulham fans at the end of the fixture. The player has until 4pm on Monday 12 December to respond to the charge."</p>
              <p>A short statement on Liverpool's website said: "Liverpool FC today received notification from the Football Association of their decision to charge both the club and Luis Suárez following the game against Fulham. The club will take the appropriate time to properly review the documentation sent to us before making any further comment."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Finger of fury: Luis Suarez gestured toward the Fulham fans on Monday night</p>
              <p><br></p>
              <p><strong>The count against Suárez follows the Uruguayan being charged by the FA with racially abusing Patrice Evra when Manchester United played Liverpool on 15 October. Evra told the French TV station Canal Plus that Suárez had used a racist insult to him "at least 10 times".</strong></p>
              <p>While Suárez strongly denies the allegation and Liverpool have stated they are "fully supportive of him", an FA statement said at the time: "The FA has today charged Liverpool's Luis Suarez following an incident that occurred during the Liverpool versus Manchester United fixture at Anfield on 15 October 2011. It is alleged that Suárez used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards Manchester United's Patrice Evra contrary to FA rules. It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra."</p>
              <p>The charges related to the Fulham game are bound to further anger Kenny Dalglish, who called for more protection for his players after Suárez reacted at Craven Cottage to fans who were apparently calling him "cheat".</p>
              <p>The manager said: "Scandalous. I would like to see you write that in the paper because you would be in a bit of trouble as well. You write what you want to write. At the end of the day, we will look after Luis the best we can and I think it is about time he got a wee bit of protection from some people."</p>
              <p>Suárez will hope to be found innocent regarding both of the charges against him as he may feel that, unfairly or not, he is beginning to acquire the wrong reputation due to these two incidents. If found guilty of one or both of the charges the striker could face a heavy fine or a ban or both. However, each charge will be taken in isolation so there is no possible multiplier effect regarding the sanctions Suárez may receive.</p>
