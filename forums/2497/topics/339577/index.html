              <p class="small bold"><em>PHIL-ING THE STRAIN ... Scolari. Senior players like Terry and Lampard are not happy with the style of play.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">THE first cracks have appeared in Phil Scolari’s Chelsea regime. With the pressure on in the Premier League and in Europe, SunSport can reveal: </h2>
              <ul>
              <li>John Terry and Frank Lampard have had talks with the Brazilian about his coaching techniques.  </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p>Lampard has called publicly for Chelsea to be less predictable.</p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
              <ul>
              <li>And skipper JT has questioned the desire of his team-mates.  </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Terry, whose side go to Bolton today, admitted: “Two wins in seven isn’t good enough for a team like us. We need to put a string of results together now and over the Christmas period. </p>
              <p class="article">“We’ve been doing a lot better away this year which is strange because we had a great home record for so long.” Terry and midfielder Lampard went to see Scolari on Thursday to ask him to increase the intensity in training. </p>
              <p class="article">Both stars feel the coaching has become too laid back and repetitive and that it is transmitting itself on to the field. SunSport can also reveal there have been a series of team meetings this week in which players have vented their frustrations. </p>
              <p class="article">Terry has been banging the drum and questioned the squad’s desire. Chelsea have lost the Premier League lead and face a Champions League clash with Romanian side Cluj on Tuesday which they have to win to be sure of qualifying for the knockout phase. </p>
              <p class="article">Lampard is worried the Blues could become too predictable but boss Scolari insists his men must carry on passing. Lamps said: “We might have to try to adapt to playing against defensive sides because people will see that other teams have got results doing that. It is important to mix things up if you are trying to play through a team and it is not quite working. </p>
              <p class="article">“Sometimes you can play a bit more of a direct style, sometimes you can try and get the ball wide so the team can put more balls in the box.” </p>
              <p class="article">But Scolari said: “I don’t have the players for a long ball or a high ball. “The character of my players is to take touches on the ball, short passes. “It’s not a long ball from the central defender to the striker because our character is not for this. “When we tried this, we are wrong. We lost some games but we need to lose games with our characteristics. Not change them. “The players understand that, sometimes, it’s impossible to change because we have some players out with injuries.”</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p class="article">Chelsea travel to the Reebok today and Terry said: “Hopefully we can get a win at Bolton . . . we certainly need it.” Scolari added: “I want to say sorry for losing points at home. “But I will try my best every day at Chelsea.”</p>

              <p>Schoari is right...theres no players who can really receive long ball or high ball other than Drogba...but theres only Anelka where u can only pass through balls to him to shoot...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thats why... Scholari really have to offload the players who were defensively trained by Mourino and recruit more and better attacking players if he want to have a short-passing Chelsea.</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1092563" rel="1092563_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1092563/Chelsea-censor-Scolaris-rant--Club-edits-criticism-owner-manager-tells-fans-We-need-buy-new-players.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari is on collision course with owner Roman Abramovich after the club censored critical comments he made to fans over the club's transfer policy.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazilian World Cup winner told a supporters' forum at Stamford Bridge on Thursday night that the club must sign players in next month's transfer window if they want to win trophies this season.</p>
              <p>Scolari said: 'I think the board know it, I know it and the fans know it. 'We need one or two more players to put in the team and if we get them then we are in good condition to win trophies at the end of the season and, if not, there might be problems. If we have two more players in the squad, we will have a good chance.'</p>
              <p>Scolari's words were greeted by loud applause but when Chelsea's official website reported on the evening his implied criticism of Abramovich, who has ruled out spending on players in January, was deleted from a transcript of the question and answer session.</p>
              <p>With Chelsea facing a vital Champions League match against Romanian club CFR Cluj on Tuesday, where failure to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League would jeopardise the new manager's position, tensions are evident at the club.</p>
              <p>Scolari has repeatedly pressed for two new players, including a striker, while chief executive Peter Kenyon insists there will be little or no transfer activity next month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/06/article-1092563-01C287380000044D-13_306x423.jpg" alt="Bridge exit: chief scout Frank Arnesen is set to leave Chelsea following cut-backs in his staff" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>Bridge exit: Chief scout Frank Arnesen is set to leave Chelsea following cut-backs in his staffing quota</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With chief scout Frank Arnesen poised to leave after the axing of more than half his international scouting staff, and reports that Chelsea players have asked Scolari to increase the intensity of training, Chelsea face a difficult run-up to the transfer window, with the manager insisting there will be problems if he cannot sign two new players in January.</p>
              <p>Scolari must be aware of the risk he runs should Chelsea go a second season without winning a trophy. Abramovich places a high value on silverware and is already on his fourth manager in five years at the club.</p>
              <p>Scolari's position contrasted with Kenyon's statement at a Press conference last Monday when he said the club would be busy in the transfer market in the summer, but not in January.</p>
              <p>Kenyon said: 'I don't think we will be doing any business in the January transfer window because the type of players we are looking for are not available. Another reason is that we have still got some long-term injuries coming back and in January or February, Chelsea will have more player availability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/06/article-1092563-029C1201000005DC-500_468x338.jpg" alt="On the way back: Chelsea striker Didier Drogba is set to return from injury to give the Stamford Bridge club some more attacking options" width="468" height="338"></p>
              <p><em>On the way back: Chelsea striker Didier Drogba is set to return to give the Stamford Bridge club some more attacking options</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'It's too easy to say we've got to have more players in the squad. Sure, we've had more strikers here but we only ever played with one or two at any one time, and Didier (Drogba) will be back soon. He's a big player.'</p>
              <p>Kenyon has repeatedly stressed that the club need to wean themselves off the strategy of signing players when problems arise and decried the previous policy of 'throwing bodies at the problem.' <br></p>
              <p>Scolari has repeatedly said he wants to bring in a South American wide player after the failure to land Robinho last summer. A compromise is likely to be struck, with Kenyon attempting to bring a player in on loan or entering the market if the club could offload any of the current squad.</p>
              <p>Scolari will be content if he gets additions but his insistence that the club could fail without them indicates his desperation to improve his squad. Chelsea admitted yesterday that the Scolari transcript had been edited.</p>
              <p>A spokesman said: 'Transcripts can be edited for a variety of reasons. In this case it may have created unnecessary and misconstrued media speculation again about the transfer window, a subject the manager was always going to be asked to address in his Press conference on Friday.</p>
              <p>'The manager's remarks on Thursday and Friday are entirely consistent with the club's public position.'</p>
              <p>Despite a wonderful start to the season and after just four months in charge, Scolari is under pressure after winning only four matches out of Chelsea's last 10, losing the four-and-a-half year unbeaten home record and going out of the Carling Cup to Burnley.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have begun to make cuts in their staff, axing 15 scouting staff last month in a move that precipitates the departure of chief scout Arnesen in the next few weeks.</p>

              <p>but he did explained himself that there was too many players. which i kinda agree. i mean with so many people in the squad, its hard to pave way for reserves/youngsters to break into first team. and those backup players will just be unhappy not to have first team action.</p>
              <p>i believe scholari didn't expect drogba to get a 3 match ban and neither di santo to get injuried. most importantly, he expected robinho to be inside the squad.</p>

              <p><br>Yeah I remember he did explain that's why I said he was the one who wanted the squad to be cut down in numbers hoping to keep them happy... I meant he could have easily kept Pizarro and Swp what... They didn't want to go but he moved them off nonetheless... Swp was happy sitting on the bench and coming on when called upon.</p>
              <p>Players getting ban and injuries over the duration of 9 months are all part and parcel of the game, He has been in football long enough to know this, so no excuse here... Owen Hargreaves wasn't expected to be out for the whole season, but now he is but they still have to get on with the job, know what i mean...</p>
              <p>The only thing i think could be the reason is, Scolari isn't experienced in the Premier League yet and being away from club management for such a long time (about 8yrs) didn't help... But he is still a good coach tho only I find his used of subs not as effective as Jose or even Grant last season... Honestly speaking, he has a very good set of players under him currently... Shouldn't have this problem.</p>
              <p>Grant also didn't had Drogba and Essien for long periods of last season, Drogba injured then later he and Essien go ACN... Ballack didn't play until Dec... Carvalho, Terry and even Lampard was in and out...</p>
              <p>Now with JT and FL questioning their training... You have to wonder also... Players normally would want to relax but now the 2 senior players telling the coach he is too relax from their previous experience... Maybe he will learn something from them...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">A BIT like Chelsea, Phil Scolari seems to have lost his way in recent weeks. First he said he’d go back to Brazil if his team didn’t beat CFR Cluj. But yesterday, the Blues boss made a remarkable U-turn and claimed he was under <strong>ZERO</strong> pressure before tonight’s must-win game.</h2>
              <p class="article">Chelsea need three points — or qualification for the knockout phase of the Champions League is out of their hands. Winning the competition could net Chelsea up to £70million and, in financial times that even Roman Abramovich is finding hard, his manager’s demeanour was puzzling to say the least.</p>
              <p class="article">According to Scolari, being in charge of Chelsea is a piece of cake compared to managing the Brazil national side. His comments came after assistant Ray Wilkins said his boss was tired and feeling the pressure in England.</p>
              <p class="article">Scolari responded with defiance yesterday. He said: “You know how many people live in Brazil? More than 100million and I was there managing the national side. “You think here is pressure. It is zero pressure. Pressure was when I was coach of the national team because everyone in Brazil is the coach.”</p>
              <p class="article">Fair play, he won the World Cup in 2002 and delivered the trophy every Brazilian treats as his birthright. Problem is, Abramovich feels the same about the European Cup and every coach who has failed to deliver has met the same fate — the sack.</p>
              <p class="article">But if Scolari is living in fear of his job he’s doing a great job to disguise it. When asked if this was his most important game in charge of the club, he was nonchalant in the extreme. He replied: “No, this is one more game. It is important for our qualification for next phase, the next level, but it is the same in other games.</p>
              <p class="article">“It is three points and we need to win. If we win we are in the second round. If we win we will be in the next level. It is not the most important game, it is one more game.” But Chelsea only drew with Cluj in Romania and have managed just one win in their last five attempts at home.</p>
              <p class="article">This record hardly inspires confidence. Take away their talisman Frank Lampard — who is suspended — and the alarm bells are chiming. Scolari will stick with John Obi Mikel as anchor and Deco and Michael Ballack in front in Lamps’ absence.</p>
              <p class="article">Deco admitted their home form has been poor. He said: “Away we are better at controlling games and scoring on the counter-attack. “At home our opponents are playing really closed football and causing difficulties.”</p>
              <p class="article">There’s little doubt Cluj will attempt to lock down the game tonight, making it as difficult as possible for Chelsea to play. Deco also admitted it will be even harder without the team’s leading European goalscorer, Lampard. He said: “It’s difficult to play without Frank. He is one of the leaders. “But we know how important the game is and we know that we need to win.”</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea fans will be pleased to hear someone willing to admit what a big game this is for the club.</p>

              <h1 class="heading">Luiz Felipe Scolari put to the test by Chelsea player unrest.</h1>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p class="heading"><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00450/scolari_360_450207a.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="360"></p>
              <p class="heading"><em>Scolari asked to explain his substitutions by several senior players</em></p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>Luiz Felipe Scolari is facing a growing challenge to his authority from the dressing-room in light of Chelsea’s recent poor performances. The Times understands that the Chelsea manager was asked to explain his substitutions by several senior players after the 1-1 draw at home to West Ham United in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea’s players have a genuine fondness for Scolari as a man, but there are increasing concerns over certain aspects of his management. The latest worries to emerge centre on Scolari’s substitutions against West Ham, with several players demanding to know in a dressing-room meeting why Michael Ballack was replaced at half-time rather than the underperforming Deco, who stayed on for the entire 90 minutes.</p>
              <p>It is not the first time that Scolari’s substitutions have been subject to scrutiny by his players. It is understood that in the aftermath of last month’s 2-1 home defeat by Arsenal, several players asked sarcastically whether Scolari was aware that Chelsea were chasing the game rather than attempting to hold on, because they were unimpressed by his decision to bring on the inconsistent Florent Malouda and inexperienced Miroslav Stoch for John Obi Mikel and Deco.</p>
              <p>Chelsea’s run of only one win in five home league matches has brought such complaints to the surface, but there have been concerns about some of Scolari’s methods all season. John Terry and Frank Lampard went to see the manager a fortnight ago to ask if the intensity of training sessions could be increased and several others have admitted in private that Chelsea are lacking the physical power with which they used to swat opponents aside even while playing badly under José Mourinho. Another complaint muttered in private concerns alleged preferential treatment of Deco, who has remained in the side despite contributing little since he returned from a thigh injury in October.</p>
              <p>There is also concern that some players are struggling to understand Scolari’s instructions, as appeared to be the case against West Ham. Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka and Joe Cole played close together in a front three after Drogba’s introduction in place of Ballack at half-time, with Scolari clearly frustrated with their performance.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian admitted afterwards that he needs more time to work with his players on the training ground, but that is not a luxury afforded in the Premier League, when the top teams play matches every three days.</p>
              <p>Scolari retains the support of the club’s board — as well as some measure of sympathy given the injuries he has encountered this season — but it is open in admitting that results have not been as good as was expected when he was appointed last summer.</p>
              <p>While Roman Abramovich, the owner, has remained in the background, Peter Kenyon, the chief executive, and Eugene Tenenbaum, a director and Abramovich’s closest aide, have been regular visitors to the dressing-room in recent weeks. Chelsea, however, insist this is normal practice at the club but declined to comment further.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the players will return to training this morning after two days off to begin preparations for the Premier League match away to Everton on Monday and — at their own request — can expect to be put through their paces.
