              <h1>Luiz Felipe Scolari set to be offered Brazil escape route.</h1>
              <h2>Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has been linked with a return to the Brazil job as rumours continue about dressing room unrest at Stamford Bridge.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01207/scolari_ap_1207469c.jpg" alt="Luiz Felipe Scolari linked with Brazil return" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Homeward bound?: Luiz Felipe </em>Scolari set to be offered Brazil escape route<em>.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Embattled Brazil coach Dunga faces the axe in the New Year after a stumbling 2010 World Cup qualification campaign, which has seen them win just four of their 10 games.</strong></p>
              <p>And Brazilian FA president Ricardo Teixeira is coming under increasing pressure to sack the former World Cup-winning skipper - and ask Scolari to perform the same salvation act that he did before, leading his country toWorld Cup glory in 2002.</p>
              <p>Chelsea were booed off at Stamford Bridge after Sunday's 1-1 draw with West Ham extended their awful recent home league run to just one win in five games.</p>
              <p>Scolari publicly insists that his only interest is guiding the Blues to the domestic and European crowns Roman Abramovich craves. But a fresh call from his homeland might make the 60-year-old stop and think.</p>
              <p>Pressed on whether he was ready to ditch under-pressure Dunga, Teixeira would only say: "This is not the time to discuss that. We are coming close to Christmas."</p>
              <p>But sources close to Teixeira insisted last night that Brazil are likely to turn again to Scolari. "Dunga is very unpopular, both among the fans and the Brazilian Federation," said the insider.</p>
              <p>"It looks like a matter of time before he goes and that means Teixeira has to make the right appointment. "He will definitely ask Felipao first. It looks as if Felipao is not enjoying himself at Chelsea, and maybe he might want to listen to what Teixeira is saying."</p>

              <h1>Scolari Set For Chelsea Exit - Reports</h1>
              <h2>Stamford Bridge unrest continues to snowball, according to reports, with gaffer Felipão linked with a return to Brazil...</h2>
              <p><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/08/12/240/Chelsea-v-West-Ham-Luiz-Felipe-Scolari_1628621.jpg" border="0" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Scolari: stats prove he</em> is the w<em>orst Chelsea manager in Roman's time... Behind Mourinho, The Tinkerman Ranieri and even Avram Grant...</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Since taking his place in the Chelsea hot-seat in the summer, Luiz Felipe Scolari has impressed the media, for the most part, and has talked about the fatherly relationship he enjoys with his charges.</strong><br><br>However, reports continue to suggest that Chelsea's Brazilian boss is perhaps a little deluded. The Blues' home form at Stamford Bridge has gone out the window and he continues to hint at the need for fresh blood - a playmaker and a striker - despite the board's clear unwillingness to spend in January.<br><br>Now, hot on the heels of media claims insisting that the players preferred previous bosses Jose Mourinho and Avram Grant to Scolari, <em>The Times</em> reports that the current manager is losing the dressing room.<br><br>The Pensioners drew 1-1 with West Ham United at the weekend, with several players apparently furious that Michael Ballack was hooked instead of Deco at half-time. They apparently see Deco as Scolari's golden boy.<br><br>Allegedly, senior squad members have also demanded an increase in training intensity and have bemoaned Scolari's lack of verbal clarity.<br><br><strong>Link</strong><br><br>Meanwhile, <em>The Mirror </em>thinks Scolari could be headed back to his homeland in order to replace under-fire coach Dunga. A Seleção's World Cup qualifying campaign has been poor, and a source close to Brazilian FA president Ricardo Teixeira has been blabbing.<br><br>The insider is quoted as saying: "Dunga is very unpopular, both among the fans and the Brazilian Federation. It looks like a matter of time before he goes and that means Teixeira has to make the right appointment.<br><br>"He will definitely ask Felipao first. It looks as if Felipao is not enjoying himself at Chelsea, and maybe he might want to listen to what Teixeira is saying."</p>

              <p>Anyway, the Brazil FA is too poor to compensate Chelsea if they want to take him away... Unless he make himself "free" from Chelsea...</p>

              <h1>Alex: I want to get out of here.</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00684/Alex_684622a.jpg" alt="BRAZIL NUTS ... Phil Scolari and Alex" width="682" height="400"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">UNHAPPY stars, dressing-room unrest and a bit of unsolicited help from the owner. It seems kidney stones are the least of Phil Scolari’s problems at the moment. But whatever pain he has in the gut, Alex’s determination to leave Chelsea next month is a big sore point for the manager. </h2>
              <p class="article">SunSport broke the news last week that the Brazil defender wants to quit the Blues. Now Alex has again stated his wish to leave — and he has arranged a meeting with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich to talk it over. If Scolari allows the Brazilian international to go then Chelsea will be without one of their most reliable defenders. </p>
              <p class="article">Alex, 26, is desperate for regular first-team football and last season appeared in more games than John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho. That was because of injuries to the first-choice Chelsea central defensive pairing but being a reserve is the reason Alex wants out. </p>
              <p class="article">He told Scolari of his feeling as soon as the manager arrived last summer. And Alex revealed he is more determined than ever to get away. He said: “I know it’s not the best time to go in January, in the middle of the season. But I have to think about other things, I have to think about my own interests.</p>
              <p class="article">“I tried to leave before this season started but when Scolari arrived they did not want to let me go. I had already spoken to the club before he came. Now that the transfer window will open again in January I will try again. I think this time it will happen.” </p>
              <p class="article">Alex insisted he was not trying to cause boss Scolari more worry than he has already. After all, with just one win in their last five home games and nothing to spend in January, losing a player is the last thing on his mind. </p>
              <p class="article">Alex explained his desire to play regularly to make it back into the Brazil team is his reason for wanting to leave. He said: “It’s a difficult situation for me. I have nothing against the manager but he has two great defenders in Terry and Carvalho. I have nothing against the guys who are playing — they are always very good. </p>
              <p class="article">"Chelsea have one of the best defences in the world. Terry and Carvalho are doing very well. They don’t make many mistakes and have been playing together for four years.” </p>
              <p class="article">Even so, the Alex situation could not have arisen at a worse time for Scolari. With the team struggling to break down opposition such as West Ham and Newcastle, the Brazilian coach will be looking for inspiration — not dissent.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet questions about what is going wrong for Chelsea are being asked by the fans, players and the owner. SunSport told of how Terry and Frank Lampard asked Scolari to increase the intensity of the training sessions. </p>
              <p class="article">Others have debated whether Deco is receiving preferential treatment from the boss. The Portugal international has struggled to reach the heights of his early-season form since returning from a thigh injury. </p>
              <p class="article">Despite that, Scolari has kept faith with him and even subbed Michael Ballack at half-time last weekend, leaving Deco to play out the full 90 minutes. </p>
              <p class="article">Deco was the fulcrum of Scolari’s Portugal team during his six years in charge and is the only player he has bought for Chelsea. Alex cannot be accused of getting any favours from his countryman Scolari. He said: “It wasn’t a question of whether the new manager was Brazilian, it was always going to be difficult for me. </p>
              <p class="article">“There are big clubs where I could be playing while here it’s more difficult for me. There are so many big clubs who need centre-backs. There were so many offers in the summer but they did not let me go. </p>
              <p class="article">“The only problem is I want to play, that’s the only problem I have.” If only Big Phil Scolari could say he had only one problem.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PHIL SCOLARI’S grip at Chelsea appears to be weakening further with Roman Abramovich now becoming involved in the Alex dispute. </h2>
              <p class="article">SunSport revealed last week that cracks are starting to appear in the Scolari empire — and that the Blues defender wants to leave. </p>
              <p class="article">Now Red Rom is personally intervening in the Alex wrangle. Abramovich will meet the Brazil centre-half in the next two weeks to discuss his transfer request. </p>
              <p class="article">The Russian billionaire’s decision to wade in is highly irregular and casts further doubts over Scolari’s authority. </p>
              <p class="article">Alex said: “I think I will be allowed to leave in January. "Mr Abramovich called after he heard that I wanted to leave. "I have a meeting between Christmas and new year with Mr Abramovich.”</p>
