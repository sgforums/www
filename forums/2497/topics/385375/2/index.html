              Rafa wants the 20mil?

              <p>Pool players apart from kuyt and Torres, don't seem to be wanting to play for Rafa anymore... Even Grant seems more like an able manager than Rafa... His Portsmouth players were running like crazy despite having ran themselves silly against Chelsea just 3 days ago only...</p>
              <p>Another thing I kind of heard was... Rafa have not beaten Grant all this while?</p>
              <p>The commentary just going on and one of the guy said Rafa is playing for the sack? Could this really be true?</p>

              <p>Pompey were good value for the three points as <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>'s campaign goes into free fall.</p>
              <p>Nadir Belhadj opened the scoring to put the hosts ahead after poor defending from the Reds.</p>
              <p>Mascherano was red carded for a nasty tackle on Tal Ben-Haim before an unmarked Daniel Agger headed high for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Late on Frederic Piquionne's volley from a tight angle sealed the home side's deserved victory.</p>
              <p>Rafael Benitez's pre-match guarantee that his side would finish in the top four is now looking a little optimistic.</p>
              <p>Benitez believes the first-half dismissal of Javier Mascherano signalled the beginning of the end for his side.</p>
              <p>He told <em>Sky Sports</em>: "If you analyse the first half we were doing well, even with their goal but then came the Mascherano incident.</p>
              <p>"We were a good team in the first half and the sending off changed everything.</p>
              <p>"We had some chances, we should have scored, we were controlling the game and everything changed with Mascherano.</p>
              <p>"Now we have to hope we can win our next game."</p>
              <p>The result also means <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr> boss Avram Grant maintains his unbeaten record against Benitez after posting two wins and two draws during his time at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> in the 2008 season.</p>
              <p>"Today we played like a team," he said.</p>
              <p>"From game to game we are playing better and today we deserved the win.</p>
              <p>"We played on Wednesday against a team in first place at home, and we
              showed ourselves if we can do things well at the bottom of the table we
              can still surprise the other team, and today it went well."</p>

              <p><br>look, hiddink wouldn't come over...1st, y would he want to work for crap owners who expects him  to perform well n yet dun want to provide their OWN $$ for more depth? 2ndly, he has ties with roman avarmovich who happens to be chelsea's owner, n tt's y chelsea managed to gt hiddink to be the care-taker manager. 3rdly, how the hell is he going to get rid of deadwood like kuyt, dossena, lucas and babel when selling them is also a big problem? 4thly, how is he going to convince top players like gerrard, torres, masherano, benayoun to stay. lastly, how is he going to change the mentality of the players in such a short time, btw chelsea itself is alrdy very strong, it's just that scolari is stubborn( see the similarity?) , it doesn't take a very smart person to see that if one lone striker dun work, then get a strike partner la..so wat hiddink did was to motivate the players and tweak the system...</p>
