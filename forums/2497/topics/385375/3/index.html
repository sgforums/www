              <p><strong>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez suffered a disastrous trip to Portsmouth after 
              Javier Mascherano was dismissed during a miserable defeat at Fratton 
              Park.</strong></p>
              <p>Pompey's victory, with the goals coming from Nadir Belhadj and Frederic 
              Piquionne, will ignite hope of survival in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>However, Liverpool chances of finishing in the top four are uncertain - they 
              missed a chance to record back-to-back league wins for the first time since 
              September.</p>
              <p>It means Avram Grant maintains his unbeaten record against Benitez after 
              recording two wins and two draws during his time at Chelsea in the 2008 
              season.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>Back then he ended the Spaniard's Champions League hopes at the semi-final 
              stage - this time he has dented their chances of even qualifying for the 
              competition.</p>
              <p>Benitez was furious with Lee Mason, who sent two Liverpool players off during 
              the defeat to Fulham earlier in the season, for his straight red for Mascherano, 
              who will now miss four games through suspension.</p>
              <p>The defeat also meant there was no celebration to mark Jamie Carragher's 
              600th appearance for Liverpool - until Belhadj's strike he would not have 
              enjoyed an easier 30 minutes in his previous 599.</p>
              Benitez was boosted by the return of Fernando Torres after the Spain striker 
              rested his troublesome groin in the midweek win over Wigan - but he was limited 
              to half-chances.<br><br><p></p>

              <p><strong>PORTSMOUTH, England (AFP) - – Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez insisted he 
                      does not fear the sack despite seeing his team suffer their seventh Premier 
                      League defeat of an increasingly poor season at bottom club Portsmouth.</strong></p>
              <p>Midfielder Javier Mascherano was sent-off for the third time in his Liverpool 
                      career as the visitors' fading title hopes were all but extinguished in a 2-0 
                      loss at Fratton Park.</p>
              <p>The sorry Reds have now won just four of their last 12 league games and are 
                      struggling even to secure a top four finish and a place in next season's 
                      Champions League.</p>
              <p>When asked if he was worried for his job, Benitez replied: "I am only worried 
                      about the next game (against Wolves).</p>
              <p>"I can only prepare for the next match. If we can win hopefully it will be 
                      easier to prepare for the next ones," the Spaniard added.</p>
              <p>"We have to change our targets and can only think about one game at a time. 
                      We have to stick together and try to pick up three points and see what 
                      happens."</p>
              <p>Liverpool were already trailing to Nadir Belhadj's first goal since December 
                      26 last year when Mascherano was dismissed on the stroke of half-time.</p>
              <p>The Argentina midfielder was shown a straight red card by referee Lee Mason 
                      as punishment for a reckless lunge on Portsmouth defender Tal Ben Haim on the 
                      half-way line.</p>

Portsmouth celebrate Nadir Belhadj's opener as Fernando Torres stands dejected" width="120" height="95"></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>Belhadj scored his first goal since December 26 last year</em></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Benitez was clearly angered by the decision and reserved some sarcastic 
                      comments for Mason at his post-match news conference.</strong></p>
              <p>"We were the better team in the first half and the sending-off changed the 
                      game," he said.</p>
              <p>"I have seen a replay and for me it was not a sending-off but the referee was 
                      perfect. He did not make any mistakes. He was correct to not give fouls against 
                      Fernando Torres. He was perfect."</p>
              <p>Benitez added: "We had plenty of possession and were in control but it is 
                      difficult playing with ten men away from home when you are 1-0 behind.</p>
              <p>"We had to keep trying to go forward but we left some spaces and there was 
                      always a danger we would concede another goal."</p>
              <p>Portsmouth had taken just 11 points from 17 games prior to his match and the 
                      south coast club remain beset by financial problems.</p>
              <p>Liverpool had the better of the opening exchanges, with stars Steven Gerrard 
                      and Torres posing a constant threat.</p>
              <p>Torres came within inches of putting Liverpool in front with a majestic 
                      20-yard curler, which had Portsmouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic beaten before 
                      nestling on the roof of the net.</p>
              <p>Despite Liverpool having plenty of possession Begovic, deputising for the 
                      injured David James, did not have a meaningful save to make before Belhadj 
                      opened the scoring in the 33rd minute.</p>
              <p>Kevin-Prince Boateng's driven low shot was palmed away by Pepe Reina but 
                      Liverpool failed to clear the rebound and the ball broke kindly for Belhadj, who 
                      lashed an unstoppable right foot shot into the roof of the net from an acute 
                      angle.</p>
              <p>Daniel Agger put a free header wide moments later while Begovic produced a 
                      brilliant reaction save to keep out Gerrard's defected second half shot.</p>
              <p>France striker Frederic Piquionne sealed the points eight minutes from time, 
                      brilliantly flicking up Boateng's cross before firing past Reina at the near 
                      post.</p>
              <p>Victory saw Portsmouth boss Avram Grant maintain his record of never having 
                      lost to Liverpool as a manager.</p>
              <p>"It is true I have never lost to Benitez and I am pleased to keep that run 
                      going," said former Chelsea manager Grant.</p>
              <p>"This is a terrific win for us and hopefully it can kick-start our season."</p>

He didn't say much, the reporter Keys asked him and he didn't say anything really bad, he only gave his opinion when asked at the end of a match Liverpool lost... He never said he wanted Rafa's or the Pool job... Its the Press that thinks he is still keen on it afterall, it was the Pool owners themselves who went looking up for him wasn't it? He never went looking for them... For all we know, he don't even want the job thats why he turn it down at the first time... Graeme Souness said more unpleasant stuff that night... Why don't they also say he wants the Pool job?</p></div>
