              <h3>WAYNE BRIDGE'S relationship with John Terry is at rock bottom after snubbing peace talks with the former England captain. </h3>
              <p>Bridge has blanked phone calls and text messages from Terry and is refusing to have any contact with his former best friends. </p>
              <p>Terry has made several attempts to get in touch with the Manchester City left-back to explain his part in his affair with Bridge's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Peronncel. </p>
              <p>Instead Bridge is refusing to take his calls and he maintains that he will continue to ignore him if they meet up for next month's England friendly. </p>
              <p>Bridge is disgusted that Terry is refusing to admit - either in public or private - that he had an affair with his ex-girlfriend. </p>
              <p>His position in the squad has suddenly been enhanced by the prospect of Ashley Cole struggling to make the squad because of a broken ankle. </p>
              <p>Bridge has been backed by his England team-mates to get over his personal trauma and play in the World Cup in South Africa. </p>
              <p>Bridge has been called by several influential members of the dressing room urging him to play on through the emotional pain barrier. </p>
              <p>The Manchester City left-back is torn between quitting international football or declaring himself available for selection ahead of next month's friendly with Egypt. </p>
              <p>Bridge intends to make a formal statement outlining his future ahead of Fabio Capello's squad selection. </p>
              <p>Capello has not spoken to Bridge about his future and has left discussions to England's general manager Franco Baldini. The Italians have made it clear they intend to name Bridge in their squad to prepare for the Wembley game against Egypt. </p>
              <p>Bridge has always been the recognised second choice left back under Capello, but Cole's injury has catapulted him back into the public eye. </p>
              <p>He has been agonising over the decision all week and is also known to be anxious about City's meeting with Chelsea on February 27. </p>
              <p>That is the first time he will have seen Terry since details of his affair with Peronncel became public. </p>
              <p>It has already crossed Bridge's mind that Premier League players are required to shake hands with the opposition before matches, but Bridge has yet to decide whether he will accept the gesture from Terry. </p>
              <p>Several City players have already said they will snub Terry as a show of support for their team-mate.</p>
