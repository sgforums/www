He will be replaced by his assistant Chris Hutchings, who also took over from Jewell at Bradford in 2000. The move comes just 24 hours after he saved the Latics from relegation on the final day of the Premiership season.</strong><br><br>The ex-Bradford boss kept Wigan in the top-flight yesterday by beating Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, sending the Blades tumbling into the Championship. Jewell has been tipped to replace under-fire Stuart Pearce at Manchester City. But it appears he will not make an immediate return to management.<br><br>Jewell said: "I have made this decision with a heavy heart as I feel it is time for me to have a break from football. "I have given everything I have as a person to bringing success here over the past six years. "It is not an easy thing to walk away from somewhere and something which has been such a part of your life for so long. "The intensity of football at the highest level, although completely addictive, is very draining. "I feel I would be kidding the chairman, my players and the supporters if I was to carry on without being able to put in the energy and dedication I know is required to be successful at this level."<br><br>The Liverpool-born boss spent six seasons at the JJB Stadium and guided the club from League One to the Premiership. Latics chairman Dave Whelan has called a press conference for 3pm, when he is expected to name Jewell's replacement.<br><br><img src="http://www.football365.com/Images/114319.jpg"><br><br><strong>Wigan Appoint Hutchings As Boss</strong><br><br>Chris Hutchings is the new manager of Wigan - seven years after he was appointed Bradford boss and won a grand total of one Premiership game in three months in charge of the Bantams. Latics chairman Dave Whelan says departing boss Paul Jewell has been "physically drained" in recent weeks as Wigan fought the battle against relegation.</div>

Hopefully Mourinho won't be one of those leaving.<br><br>I think Paul Jewell has done well with Wigan and it's very sad he lost quite a few good players from last season who wanted to go bigger clubs. But kudos to him for getting the much needed victory at Bramall Lane over the weekend.<br><br>With his nerves going this past season and his health in decline, guess it's good that he takes a break from football for a while. Spend some time with the family to something.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Jewell gets a Â£1million payoff</span><br><br>PAUL JEWELL quit Wigan with a Â£1million thank you from chairman Dave Whelan. Jewell earned the bonus for keeping the Latics in the Premiership on a dramatic last day of the season as their 2-1 win at Sheffield United sent the Blades into the Championship.</strong><br><br>Jewell left yesterday citing a need for a six-month break from the game. But his exit is not linked to Stuart PearceÂ’s sacking at Manchester City. Wigan supremo Whelan will demand Â£750,000 in compensation if Jewell does take over at City. But Whelan believes Jewell is in no fit state to take the Eastlands job after becoming worn out by the relegation scrap.<br><br>Whelan said: Â“If he has a three-week holiday and Manchester City or anyone else appoint him thereÂ’s a penalty clause. Â“If heÂ’d said to me on Monday morning, Man City or Newcastle or another club have approached me, IÂ’d have released him. ThereÂ’s a clause in his contract that if anyone takes him itÂ’s Â£750,000 theyÂ’d have to pay.<br><br>Â“When he told me, I asked him Â‘who are you going to work forÂ’ and he told me no club has approached him. Â“His health has deteriorated over the last two or three months. HeÂ’s not been the same man and IÂ’ve had to lift his spirits.Â” Whelan has appointed JewellÂ’s No 2 Chris Hutchings as manager on a 12-month deal.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Whelan: Paul has cracked up</span><br><br>WIGAN supremo Dave Whelan has revealed the desperate battle to stay in the Premiership took a heavy toll on Paul Jewell. Stressed-out Jewell handed in his resignation just hours after the LaticsÂ’ dramatic 2-1 victory at Sheffield United on Sunday kept them in the top flight. Yet the decision to quit came as no surprise to Whelan, who had watched his managerÂ’s well-being slowly deteriorate in recent months.</strong><br><br>The pressure he was under also affected his marriage and family life and has left him needing a six-month break from football. Jewell even turned down the chance to spend a month in Barbados thinking over the future, as chairman Whelan fought to keep him at the JJB Stadium.<br><br>Whelan, who has appointed JewellÂ’s No 2 Chris Hutchings as his new boss, said: Â“PaulÂ’s health has deteriorated over the last two or three months. He has not been the same man and IÂ’ve had to lift his spirits. Â“ThatÂ’s not Paul Jewell. ItÂ’s usually him lifting my spirits.<br><br>Â“I know he has been falling out with his wife and family, so the pressure has told on him. Â“Everyone knows what heÂ’s like. HeÂ’s so bubbly but he hasnÂ’t been his normal self. Â“I offered him the chance to have a few weeks at my holiday home in Barbados and then see what he thought about it.<br><br>He said Â‘Thank you but I need six monthsÂ’ rest Â— minimumÂ’. And I agree with him. IÂ’ve seen his health and mind recently.Â” Whelan believes the massive financial incentives on offer in the Premiership had become a heavy burden for Jewell to cope with. He added: Â“Our game on Sunday alone was worth Â£40million and one man is responsible for that. "It could be Â£100m if you stay up for another year after that and itÂ’s an enormous amount of pressure.<br><br>Whelan assumed Jewell had another job lined up when he handed in his notice but now believes he just wants a break. He added: Â“When he told me, I asked him Â‘Who are you going to work for?Â’ He said no club has approached him. He does tell the truth, he never hides and he never lies. He has to have six months off.<br><br>Whelan is sure Hutchings will prove the doubters wrong and show he can be a successful Premiership boss. HutchingsÂ’ one previous management spell was an ill-fated stint in charge of Bradford City at the start of the 2000-01 season Â— again following in JewellÂ’s footsteps. He won just one of 12 Premiership games Â— against Chelsea Â— and the Bantams finished up relegated.<br><br></div>
