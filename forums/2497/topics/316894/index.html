              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>PETR CECH has launched a scathing attack on Arsenal for their failure to win a trophy for three seasons. The Chelsea keeper reckons the Gunners' fancy football counts for nothing as they have not delivered silverware.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Blues are also in danger of finishing empty-handed this season despite being on the brink of winning the Champions League and Premier League. And Cech says that Arsenal's record should act as a warning to the Stamford Bridge stars.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "You need to get the trophies because in the end if you take the last three years of Arsenal, I don't think in 10 years people will remember that between 2004 and 2008 they played brilliant football.</p>
              <p class="article">"No-one will remember because they finished fourth and third — this is what I am talking about. "History recognises the winners, so if you take someone who won the Champions League 20 years ago and ask them who their opponent was, they don't remember."</p>
              <p class="article">Cech is determined to ensure Chelsea do not suffer heartache when they face Manchester United in the Champions League final next month. He added: "To lose a final is the worst feeling. "If you lose the semi-final it is a big disappointment because you are close to the final. "But to lose the final is worse because you are so close and in the end you get the same prize as the ones who lost in the first round - nothing.</p>
              <p class="article">"You don't go to the final to take part."</p>

              <p>Not really. You can earn a lot of money just from going through to the final. The prize money of winning the match isnt much i think.</p>
              <p>The fact that one in the final mean one will gain a lot of money. The amount earned just from the match itself is so much that the prize money for winning the final becomes almost insignificant.</p>
              <p>However, players go for the prestige of being remembered as champions la.</p>

              <h1>Chelsea goalkeeper Cech says new orange kit will distract strikers to boost push for double... and scientists agree</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Goalkeeper Petr Cech today claimed to have the secret weapon that will help Chelsea to a Premier League and Champions League double - his new orange kit.</p>
              <p>Cech believes the striking design is scientifically proven to distract players when shooting for goal and will wear the top in the Blues' crucial title showdown against Bolton on Sunday.</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old is also almost certain to use the new kit against Manchester United in Moscow and claims the new adidas shirt, labelled 'Warning' by club officials, will boost his side's chances of success.</p>
              <p>"Studies say the orange colour spreads the most when the striker attacks, in the split of a second as he focuses," said Cech, whose side need to get a better result at Stamford Bridge than United achieve at Wigan to win their third title in four seasons.</p>
              <p>"This colour is like a sort of alarm or alert which really spreads and is very difficult to avoid, so this should be good for me." Aside from the eye-catching colour, Cech's new jersey could clash with United's red shirts in Moscow on 21 May.</p>
              <p>A UEFA spokesman said: "Chelsea's goalkeeper jersey for the Champions League final match will be fluorescent orange. The reserve jersey will be dark grey.</p>
              <p>"The referee of the game always has the final word regarding the jersey. Therefore it is impossible to say today which jersey Chelsea's goalkeeper will be wearing in Moscow."</p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_02/CechOrange_468x412.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><em>Future's bright: 'Studies say the colour is like an alarm or alert that spreads and is very difficult to avoid'</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kit issues have been raised in the past, with United famously changing from their ill-advised grey strip at half-time in a match they were losing 3-1 at Southampton in 1996, after Sir Alex Ferguson claimed his players were struggling to identify each other against the backdrop of the crowd.</p>
              <p>Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos designed his own eccentric jerseys in the 1990s with the aim of increasing his popularity and distracting the opposition.</p>
