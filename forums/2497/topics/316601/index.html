              <p><em>Has Daria replaced Chelsea as the love of his life?</em></p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ROMAN, Roman, wherefore art thou, Roman? </strong></p>
              <p class="article"><strong>Enjoying life with his own Juliet home in Russia, no doubt. </strong></p>
              <p class="article"><strong>The recent whereabouts of billionaire Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has been the big talking point in football. As the Blues beat Liverpool last Wednesday to book a first appearance in the Champions League final, his seat at Stamford Bridge was once again empty. He has not been seen there since the 2-1 win over Arsenal on March 23.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Roman’s absence has been attributed to both business and political reasons, his presence required in Moscow during the build-up to the moment this week when Dmitri Medvedev succeeds Vladamir Putin as President. And yet no one should underestimate the effect of the beautiful Daria “Dasha” Zhukova on Abramovich following his divorce from Irina, the mother of his five children.</p>
              <p class="article">There is a belief that towards the end of his marriage, Abramovich was looking for something to fill the emotional and recreational void in his life. At that moment, his energy and commitment went into Chelsea. Rarely missing a home game, he was also a regular visitor to the magnificent Chelsea training ground being built at Cobham in Surrey.</p>
              <p class="article">This was a hands-on owner who liked nothing more than mixing with his players. With his money, success came quickly with consecutive Premier League titles under the flamboyant management of Jose Mourinho. But something was still missing — the style and exciting football that had first gripped Abramovich when he was a guest at the spectacular Manchester United v Real Madrid Champions League quarter-final in April 2003.</p>
              <p class="article">The Russian was also a little non-plussed when it was Mourinho, rather than he, who received most of the credit for turning the club around. Eventually, Mourinho talked himself out of job to be replaced by Avram Grant, who would do as the boss ordered. Meanwhile, Abramovich, 41, was spending more and more time with former model Daria, 26.</p>
              <p class="article">Hating the spotlight that followed him here — and with the political situation changing in his homeland — Abramovich has been seen here less and less. Certainly, it is very difficult even for those close to him to get an answer as to his future plans for the club. Not long ago, Grant was expecting to meet Abramovich for some guidance as to his continuing role at Stamford Bridge. Instead, he was met by Abramovich’s ally Eugene Tenenbaum, who apparently would go no further other than to say Grant was ‘doing a good job’.</p>
              <p class="article">Today, Chelsea are at Newcastle, seeking a win to keep the title race alive. Should they achieve that, it will go to Sunday with United at Wigan and Chelsea at home to Bolton. But when will Blues fans next see Abramovich?</p>
              <p class="article">Especially since most imagined he’d have wanted to be at Stamford Bridge last week for one of the greatest night’s in the club’s history — a night when Grant’s success validated the Russian’s decision to oust Mourinho.</p>
              <p class="article">Or could it be that Daria has now replaced Chelsea as the love of his life?</p>

              <p>Even great men have fallen to the power of women...</p>
              <p>I think this Daria has taken away Roman's interest in Chelsea... At least now he is no longer as keen as before where you will find him at almost every Chelsea match... These days, he is no longer showing that much interest... Even in the transfer market this season, he wasn't spending as much as he used to previously...</p>
