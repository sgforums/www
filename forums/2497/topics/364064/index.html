              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>'s senior players were happy to see <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr> sold to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ronaldo</span></abbr> had grown apart from his team-mates, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> had sensed it - and that is why the Old Trafford manager was happy to take <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr>'s £80million.</p>
              <p>On the training ground, they were tiring of his tantrums. On the pitch, they were fed up of his selfishness.</p>
              <p>And it culminated in fury from senior players after Ronaldo tried to
                                  single-handedly beat Barcelona in the Champions League final last
                                  month.</p>
              <p>A United insider told the <em>News of the World</em>: "To many, that was the final straw and showed what he had become.</p>
              <p>"Wayne Rooney had to change position three times to accommodate
                                  Ronaldo. The experienced players in the squad had seen it coming and
                                  weren't happy about it.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldo had been getting more and more temperamental in
                                  training and the others were getting fed up with him. They knew his
                                  mind was elsewhere and they thought he was becoming a distraction.</p>
              <p>"The senior guys couldn't believe it when he threw the tantrum during the Manchester City game."</p>

              <p>Departing <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> star <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr> couldn't care less what people think of his extravagant move to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p><strong>"I love it when people jeer me. I love to see the hate in their eyes,
                  to hear the insults. It doesn't bother me,"</strong> he said in an interview
                  with the French magazine <em>So Foot</em> which was given before his move to Madrid and will be published this month.</p>
              <p>"It's true lots of people hate me but there are even more who love me
                  and who support me. I feel bad only when I play badly. Fortunately,
                  that happens rarely."</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Ronaldo quit Man Utd over Ferguson policy against commercial contracts</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr>'s determination that his players not cash in on their off-field profile was key to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr> seeking a move to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr>, it has been claimed.</p>
              <p>It is a scenario that echoes the experience of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">David Beckham</span></abbr>, whose departure to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> in 2003 was influenced by Ferguson's view that his off-field profile was distracting focus from the team.</p>
              <p>Mary-Ellen Field, a leading expert in commercial and licensing rights, told <em>Observer Sport</em>: "Ferguson's view that [commercial exploitation] takes a player's mind off the game is valid.</p>
              <p>"However, the contract between the player and licensee means they usually have to work 20 days a year at most.</p>
              <p>"With any brand building, whether it's a person or product, the more
              positive exposure you get, the more valuable your brand becomes. It
              would have been beneficial for the club and player to get as much
              exposure as possible."</p>
              <p>In 2002, United signed a 13-year £300m contract with Nike that
              allows the company to control the club's ­global licensing and retail
              operations. believes that if Ronaldo had been able to develop, for
              example, his own perfume brand, like Beckham's lucrative Pure Instinct,
              it would have been mutually favourable.</p>
              <p>Despite being the world and European player of the year,
              Ronaldo's only major deal is a recent agreement with Castrol, in
              contrast to Beckham's blue-chip partnerships with Armani and Adidas.</p>
              <p>"There is no downside. The player is happy with his
              endorsements, and the club can sell the product and get the mark-up –
              website sales are huge," Field said.</p>
