              <p>Portsmouth aren't giving up on Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says Pennant has turned down a permanent move to
              Portsmouth, who had agreed a fee with Liverpool, and the South Coast
              club are now considering trying to take the winger on loan.</p>
              <p>Pennant is out of contract in June and would prefer to move on a free transfer then.</p>

              <p>Portsmouth chief Peter Storrie has revealed they're "very, very close" to landing Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant.</p>
              <p>"We are trying our very best to bring players in,” Storrie told the <em>Portsmouth News</em>. “As far as Jermaine is concerned, it's very, very close – as we are with one or two others.</p>
              <p>“It was only ever going to be a loan or short-term permanent deal. He
              is a free agent at the end of the season and he doesn't want to give up
              those rights.</p>
              <p>“Whether it is a contract until the end of June or a loan, it's a bit irrelevant.”</p>

              <p class="article">The right winger had been linked with Real Madrid, AC Milan and Hull. But he has decided to move to south coast to join old Arsenal team-mate Tony Adams.</p>
              <p class="article">Pompey boss Adams said: "I’ve known him a long time. "We were together at Arsenal a long, long time ago. He was the new kid on the block and a very exciting prospect.</p>
              <p class="article">“He’s quick and technically very gifted. He can have a go at defenders. “I saw him play with Peter Crouch for Liverpool at Fulham last year and was constantly getting past their left-back and getting crosses in for Crouchie.</p>
              <p class="article">“That’s a good combination that I wanted to put back together. “He’s going to put some good crosses in and hopefully weigh in with a few crosses himself.”</p>

              <p>Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant has made the move to Portsmouth on loan.</p>
              <p>The 26-year old will link up with Pompey boss and former Arsenal star Tony Adams whom he spent time with at the Gunners.</p>

              <p>Adams said he is excited about the move and looking forward to seeing

              <p><br>I think its because Portsmouth offered him the best personal deal I guess and it helps having Tony Adams there...</p>
              <p>Pennant looks like he isn't interested on a move to another club permanantly at this moment... It seems like he wants to run down his contract and leave Pool as a free player...</p>
              <p>Being a free player, there are many advantages... Firstly, he will be due a sign-on fee, all the money to himself and secondly, most likely he would get a better salary than a player sign with a transfer fee... Thats why he seems only interested moving on a loan deal... and even rejected Real Madrid's offer...</p>
