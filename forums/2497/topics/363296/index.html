              *Liverpool determined to keep hold of Xabi Alonso*
              .
              .
              
              *Liverpool are determined to hold on to Xabi Alonso despite the midfield playerâ€™s desire to move to Real Madrid. Sources at Anfield indicated that it would take a â€œmind-blowingâ€� offer by the Spanish giants to prise the 27-year-old away from the club.*
              
              Florentino PÃ©rez, the Real president, told The Times yesterday of his interest in Alonso. â€œXabi is a magnificent Spanish player, so of course weâ€™d love to have him,â€� PÃ©rez said. â€œBut everything would involve reaching an agreement with Rafael BenÃ­tez. It will need to be an agreement that is in the best interests of both clubs.â€� 
              
              Liverpool made it clear yesterday that they have no intention of selling the Spain player, who has three years left on his contract. Alonso, however, has made it equally clear that he wants to move on. After the 3-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on the final day of the season last month, Alonso met BenÃ­tez, the Liverpool manager, to try to force the issue. 
              
              The Spaniard has been unsettled for some time, despite having a superb season. Before the Champions League qualifying match against Standard LiÃ¨ge in August, he was reluctant to play to avoid being cup-tied in Europe with any potential new club. However, Liverpool are adamant that they will resist any move for Alonso â€” Manchester City and Arsenal have also been linked with the player. Suggestions that Â£25 million would tempt BenÃ­tez to sell were laughed off as being â€œnowhere nearâ€� Liverpoolâ€™s valuation. 
              
              BenÃ­tez will be active in the transfer market despite Liverpoolâ€™s accounts revealing that the clubâ€™s profits failed to cover interest payments on debt last year. Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr, the clubâ€™s American owners, are almost certain to get an extension on their Â£350 million loan deal with Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Wachovia, due for repayment on July 24. RBS, which owns 75 per cent of the debt, is unconcerned by the reported loss of Â£43 million since most of it was due to â€œnon-cashâ€� write-downs in the value of players. 
              
              It is understood that the bankâ€™s only reservation about the performance of the owners is their inability to finance a new stadium. The banks are encouraging Hicks and Gillett to look for new investment to push through the new ground. 
              
              RBS was reassured when BenÃ­tez and Fernando Torres signed extensions to their contracts in the closing weeks of the season. The Spanish pairâ€™s commitment to the club was a significant factor in giving the Americans financial breathing space.
