It was 15 August, he was 18 and, post-World Cup, Barcelona's normal first-teamers were not yet fully ready. There was no Busquets, no Xavi, no Iniesta and no Valdés; no Villa, Piqué or Puyol and no Messi either. Sergi Gómez, also 18, joined Romeu in the side. Jonathan dos Santos was included too. And the goalkeeper was Rubén Miño. Barcelona lost 3-1 and the scoreline was, in Pep Guardiola's words, "a heavy price to pay, considering how the game went".<br><br>Romeu, in particular, had impressed as the deepest of the midfielders: quick and well positioned in front of the defence, using the ball swiftly and simply, mature and unflustered. In the second half, Sevilla introduced Fredi Kanouté and stormed back, an aggressive, high-intensity game paying off. But Barcelona's control in the opening 45 minutes, with Romeu in the middle of it, had been extraordinary.<br><br>It was supposed to be the beginning of many appearances in Barcelona's first team. Romeu still had to develop, to complete the stages upon which Guardiola insists, but he was promised that he would spend much of the campaign alternating between Barça B and the first-team squad. He was the natural back-up for Sergio Busquets and Barcelona had noted that there was little need to chase a replacement for Yaya Touré, recently departed for Manchester City. Romeu, who had joined Barça from local rivals Espanyol in 2004, was that player: muscular back-up for a team of tiny technicians.</p>

              <p>One have to wonder how good he really is that Barcelona is willing to sell him away for $4.5m only or even let him leave...</p>
              <p>Anyway... Barcelona have confirmed the deal includes a buy-back clause of £8.7m after one year and £13m after two.</p>
              <p>So if he suddenly becomes successful... Barce will want him back at peanuts price...</p>
              <p>In other words, Chelsea lose out either way... Cos if he flop, Barce will not bother to look at him again. But after all the training and if he does well... They will take him back on the cheap...</p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Chelsea new boy Oriol Romeu would like to return to Barcelona one day, but is currently only thinking about being a success at Stamford Bridge.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The 19-year-old defensive midfielder this week joined the Blues on a four-year contract and will link up with Andre Villas-Boas' men at the end of Spain's Under-20 World Cup campaign in Colombia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Barca confirmed Chelsea had paid 5million euros (£4.35m) for Romeu, with the deal including a buy-back clause of 10m euros after one year and 15m euros after two.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Regarding the possibility of one day returning to the Nou Camp, Romeu said: 'You never know what can happen in the future. I will always support Barca and hopefully some day I can return there.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'But, right now, what I want is to succeed at Chelsea and be well there.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Romeu, who made his first-team debut for Barca at the end of last season before being deemed surplus to requirements by coach Pep Guardiola, will help fill the void at Chelsea left by the injured Michael Essien, who is set to be sidelined for six months.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The 6ft Romeu will also provide competition for midfield anchorman John Obi Mikel, while he can also play at centre-half.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Romeu is hoping to learn at lot at Stamford Bridge, adding in quotes reported by the Spanish press: 'They (Chelsea) have players of enormous quality. The coach is also of a very high level and what I want to do is continue improving as a player there.'</span></p>
