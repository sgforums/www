            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MIKEL JOHN OBI faces another bust-up with Jose Mourinho after ignoring the Chelsea boss to play for Nigeria. On Monday, the Blues officially pulled the Â£16million midfielder out of the friendly, claiming he would miss the next two weeks with a thigh injury.</strong><br><br>But Mikel, 19, who has already clashed with Mourinho this season over poor time-keeping, went behind the clubÂ’s back to play the full 90 minutes at Brentford. Nigeria boss Austin Eguavoen said: Â“For Chelsea to say he is injured there must be something wrong. Â“He trained with the squad on Monday and I when I told him he was going to play 90 minutes he said Â‘yes coach, no problemÂ’.<br><br>Â“Everyone saw how he played so to say he was injured, maybe Chelsea werenÂ’t being straight with us.Â” Mourinho was already fuming after Wayne Bridge picked up an injury training with England. And to make matters worse, Newcastle hitman Obafemi Martins did not even feature in NigeriaÂ’s squad after giving in to Glenn RoederÂ’s demands not to take part.<br><br>Eguavoen added: Â“We wanted him to play but he was nowhere to be found. We will take this to the highest authorities.Â” Laryea Kingson, Sulley Muntari, Junior Agogo and Asamoah Frimpong earned Ghana an easy victory. Taiwo Taye managed a late consolation from the penalty spot.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Chelsea run to FIFA over 'injured' Mikel</strong></span><br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/02_1/mikel0702_228x169.jpg"><br><br><strong>Mikel John Obi will face a FIFA probe after Chelsea confirmed last night that they are making a formal complaint following his selection for Nigeria on Tuesday night. Chelsea chief Jose Mourinho claimed that Mikel had suffered a thigh injury during their 1-0 victory over Charlton last Saturday that was likely to keep him out "for about 10 days".</strong><br><br>According to Stamford Bridge sources, the player was assessed by the club's medical staff after he was substituted at The Valley in the 75th minute and told not to join up with his national team for their friendly against Ghana. Although Chelsea were at pains to point out that their player did not defy his club manager, no one at the Nigerian FA put a gun to his head when he declared himself fit to face Nigeria at Griffin Park on Tuesday evening. Miraculously, Mikel managed to play all 90 minutes of Nigeria's 4-1 defeat against their African rivals, but his appearance will have done little to improve his relationship with Mourinho.<br><br>Chelsea, who court controversy at every turn, claim they will fire off faxes to FIFA and the Nigerian FA this week, but Mikel has the most to lose after another moment of indiscipline. Mourinho has not been impressed with Mikel's attitude since his Â£16.5m move from Manchester United in the summer and he has only been in the starting line up because of injuries to other players.<br><br>The manager was not impressed when the midfielder made light of his appalling time-keeping in an ill-advised interview with the Chelsea programme and he has been disciplined several times already this season. Mourinho left Mikel out of the team to face Reading on Boxing Day and he followed it up with a stinging attack on his midfielder after he was left in the stands for the 2-2 draw with Fulham on Dec 30.<br><br>At the time, Mourinho said: "Two things irritate me and both are a little bit out of my hands. One is injured players and the other thing you cannot control is that some of the players, sometimes in a quiet way, sometimes in a more noisy way, complain that they are not playing. And when they do play, they don't play at a level they should do.<br><br>"I hope some of the players have enough character to deal with the situation. Sometimes, it is easy for players to speak out when they are not playing and to get some friends, agents and parents to speak, too. I think some of them should close their mouthS and not speak too much."<br><br>Mikel can expect more questions when Mourinho returns to Stamford Bridge on Thursday, but Chelsea refused to confirm on Wednesday night whether he will be considered for selection against Middlesbrough on Saturday.<br><br>Nigeria coach Austin Eguavoen said: "For Chelsea to say Mikel is injured there is something wrong. He trained and I told him he was going to play 90 minutes and he said: 'OK coach'. Everyone saw how he played, so Chelsea weren't being straight with us."<br><br></div>

The Newcastle forward instead chose to fly back to Lagos to be with his mother, a trip that Newcastle officials have claimed Martins was allowed to go on. </strong><br><br>However Nigeria coach Austin Equavoen is still furious at the unexplained absence of the 22-year-old and has called on FIFA to investigate, with the risk of a potential ban now hanging over the player.<br><br>I will go to FIFA as it's the highest authority in football and this is the highest level of disrespect," said Eguavoen. Strict new rules now mean Martins could face a ban if he is found guilty of snubbing his country.<br><br>Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder had initially questioned the wisdom of Martins playing in the friendly, but then Newcastle issued a statement on Monday saying they had not prevented the player linking up with the Nigerian squad.<br><br>Unbeknown to Eguavoen, Martins had gone home to be with his sick mother, who has returned to Tyneside with him. "Oba was back in training on Wednesday after making a lightning quick return to Nigeria to attend to his mother who has been poorly," said Roeder.<br><br>That may not be good enough for FIFA. Earlier this season they threatened to ban Claude Makele for two matches for every France game he missed. Jose Mourinho has had similar difficulties recently over Mikel John ObiÂ’s availability. Roeder has had problems with the Nigerian FA this season, when a leading official questioned MartinsÂ’ wisdom in moving to Newcastle.<br><br>MartinsÂ’ saving grace may come with the appointment of Bertie Vogts this week to replace Eguavoen as Nigerian coach.<br></div>
