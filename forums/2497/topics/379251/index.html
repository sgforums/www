              <p><strong>Manchester City boss Mark Hughes feels the air of invincibility surrounding the top four has been stripped away.</strong></p>
              <p>Although City were not able to capitalise on defeats by Chelsea and Liverpool when they were held to a 1-1 draw at Wigan, it is already clear the cash-rich Blues will mount a sustained assault on the Premier League's established elite.</p>
              <p>Third-placed Tottenham are also riding high, while Aston Villa will hope to maintain a challenge as well having got themselves into a great position last term, only to throw it away in a dismal final 10 games.</p>
              <p>Such a disastrous finale is unlikely to happen again, which Hughes senses has led to a twitchiness amongst the high and mighty, which just makes them even more vulnerable.</p>
              <p>"There are some good teams in the Premier League this year," said Hughes. "There is a focus on ourselves because we have the ambition to have a good season. But the fact there is a threat to the teams who have had those top four places is adding extra pressure.</p>
              <p>"You just sense maybe that feeling of invincibility is no longer there. Other teams think they can take points off them."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson mentioned it yesterday after Manchester United had endured a nervy final 15 minutes before collecting three points against Bolton.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are the ones who presently have most to fear, although all the big clubs are having problems.</p>
              <p>"There are two or three teams who quietly think they can get into the top four," said Hughes.</p>
              <p>"They don't broadcast it so they keep themselves under the radar. We can't help but be one of the teams people think should be in the top four. "We have to deal with that anyway. I just think this year has the potential to be as open as it has ever been because the top four teams will drop points.</p>
              <p>"That has been evident at the beginning of the season and I think it will continue. It is good for the Premier League."</p>

              <p>I agreed that Wigan was well organised against Man City.</p>
              <p>The overall game play by the BPL have improved as players forced themselves into first team for world cup.</p>
              <p>It is more exciting to watch as the mid table teams are also playing quite impressive.</p>
              <p>Ask sunderland, they deserved the victory and they are HUNGRY.</p>
