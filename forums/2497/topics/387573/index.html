              <p><em>The war between Liverpool’s fans and the club’s American owners exploded last night.</em></p>
              <p>The son of co-owner Tom Hicks, who is also a club director, launched an offensive e-mail attack on a supporter.</p>
              <p>A
              member of the Spirit of Shankly, the fans’ group set up to give
              supporters a forum to voice their disapproval of how Hicks Senior and
              George Gillett are running the club, contacted Tom Hicks Jnr.</p>
              <p>He
              made the Texan businessman aware of a local newspaper article
              questioning why boss Rafa Benitez was being forced to manage the club’s
              debts.</p>
              <p>Hicks Jnr’s despatched a one word response: "Fool”.</p>
              <p>Hicks Junior then sent a follow-up message which read:“Blow me f**k face. I am sick of you.”</p>
              <p>Hicks
              Junior’s incredible behaviour will come as a major embarrassment to
              Liverpool’s owners and will inevitably intensify the level of anger
              felt by supporters.</p>
              <p>Paul Rice, chairman of Spirit of Shankly,
              said: “It is totally indefensible for a director of the club to speak
              to a fan in that manner.</p>
              <p>“We feel this makes Tom Hicks Junior's position as a director of Liverpool Football Club untenable.”</p>
              <p>For
              months there has been a simmering mood of anger towards the American
              owners from disillusioned Anfield fans. But this latest insult looks
              certain to prompt a ferocious backlash from the Liverpool faithful.</p>
              <p>When
              the American owners arrived at Anfield three years ago they claimed the
              club was in good hands, that they would build a new stadium and have
              direct lines of communication with the fans.</p>
              <p>Last night Hicks Senior sent a personal apology to the offended party in a desperate exercise in damage limitation.</p>
              <p>But his son's gaffe could prove the insult that unites all Liverpool fans against the club hierarchy.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span><strong>director Tom Hicks Junior has become involved in an extraordinary and abusive war of words with the influential fans’ group, Spirit of Shankly, as manager Rafa Benitez added to the club’s financial uncertainty by admitting he is unlikely to spend significant sums this month despite selling as many as three players.</strong></p>
              <p>Hicks, whose father Tom bought Liverpool in 2007 with his business partner George Gillett, snapped after receiving repeated emails from the Spirit of Shankly group questioning the transfer budget handed to Benitez.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">In emailed responses to organisation member Stephen Horner, Hicks Jnr first called him an ‘idiot’ and later wrote ‘Go to hell. I’m sick of you’. He also branded the Kop activist a ‘f*** face’.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Texan’s attitude to life-long Liverpool fans will not help quell fears among supporters at a troubled time for the club.</p>
              <p>Benitez, who is trying to sell £12million Ryan Babel to raise additional funds after netting £6m for Andrea Dossena (who has joined Napoli) and Andriy Voronin (Dinamo Moscow), admitted he may have to wait until the summer before he spends the money.</p>
              <p>He is currently waiting on Atletico Madrid and Argentina star Maxi Rodriguez to sort out a loyalty payment in order for the player to move to Anfield in a £1.5m move — and that may be his only signing this month.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: ‘I’m not sure if I will spend more money in January. There aren’t many top players you can sign at this time in a season for £8m.’</p>
              <p>There is disquiet on Merseyside that a failure to finish in the top four will see star striker Fernando Torres sold. So far, attempts by the owners to find £120m in fresh investment have failed, despite overtures apparently made to the royal family in Saudi Arabia.</p>
              <p>Benitez admitted it would take a colossal offer to prompt a discussion with the owners and managing director Christian Purslow on the departure of Torres if one came in from Manchester City. He said: ‘I have said before that I want to keep our best players.’</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s game today against Tottenham, whose opening day victory at White Hart Lane heralded the Reds’ poor season, is off, but they face Reading in an FA Cup third-round replay at Anfield on Wednesday.</p>

              <p><strong>As an epitaph to the calamitous Hicks-Gillett regime at Liverpool, the ten-word e-mail sent by Tom Hicks Jr at 4am on Saturday, in response to a polite message from a concerned supporter, ticked just about every box. Brash, arrogant, offensive, crass, uncouth, contemptuous and hopelessly naive, it was the defining moment of almost three years of blundering, back-biting and broken promises at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>Hicks Jr, the son of Tom Hicks, the co-owner, eventually apologised to the supporter in question for "losing my temper and using bad language with you", calling it "a kneejerk reaction". A jerk’s reaction would probably be a better way of putting it and a more considered, appropriate response now would be to resign from his position on the club’s board.</p>
              <p>But still, at least it was an apology; Liverpool’s supporters have been waiting a long time for one of those.</p>

              <p><strong>Hicks and George Gillett Jr made all the right noises when they swaggered into Liverpool in February 2007, red-and-white scarves draped around their shoulders, oozing folksy charm and pledging, among other things, to start building work on a new stadium within 60 days (oops), not to take the club into debt (it now stands at around £245 million), to be accessible ("go to hell") and "to add to the lustre of the club, not detract from it" ("blow me, ****face").</strong></p>
              <p>For a company director to insult a customer in such a way (and, yes, it irks to use such terminology) is a disgrace and yet somehow it is not the foul-mouthed language that irks most about Hicks Jr’s e-mail. Far worse is the contempt that runs through every word: contempt for the concerns expressed by a supporter who, without further comment, sent him a link to an article in the <em>Liverpool Echo</em> in which concerns were expressed about Rafael Benítez’s alarming struggle to find money to invest in a depleted, demoralised squad that is in severe danger of missing out on Champions League qualification.</p>
              <p>The supporters’ concerns for Liverpool’s future, short and long term, are legitimate. Benítez appeared to acknowledge for the first time over the weekend that he may be forced to sell players such as Fernando Torres if they fail to qualify for next season’s Champions League — previously, in an interview with <em>The Times</em> in November, he had said he would resign rather than tolerate such a scenario — and for Hicks Jr to sneer at such concerns, whether he uses foul-mouthed insults or wit worthy of Oscar Wilde, is not acceptable.</p>
              <p>For the sake of balance, it is worth pointing out here that Hicks, Gillett and their families have been subjected to some rather less civil e-mails and, according to Gillett, telephone calls since their ill-conceived dalliance with Liverpool took the first of many turns for the worse.</p>
              <p>On a visit to Merseyside two years ago Hicks Jr decided, flanked by minders, to go for a post-match drink in The Sandon pub "because I have wanted to go for quite some time to see the birthplace of the club and I also wanted the opportunity to have a direct talk with some of the supporters". Suffice to say it was a brief conversation.</p>
              <p>Liverpool’s supporters did everything to make Hicks and Gillett feel welcome in the spring of 2007. Unless it has been burnt, whether out of embarrassment or anger, there is a fan somewhere with a banner that, echoing the words of the MasterCard advert, ends with the phrase "for everything else, there’s George and Tom".</p>
              <p>It was not until the season after — the unedifying and very public spats with Benítez, the talks with Jürgen Klinsmann, the decision to take the club heavily into debt, the continuing fiasco over the stadium — that warmth turned to hostility of the type that the Glazer family faced on their early visits to Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Outsiders mistake the antiAmerican sentiment on Merseyside as a misplaced sense of empathy with Benítez. They look at the purchases of Torres, Javier Mascherano, Robbie Keane, Glen Johnson and others and suggest that Benítez, having been backed to the hilt, has only himself to blame for Liverpool’s failure to win a first league title since 1990. That is a different argument and a spurious one; whatever Benítez’s perceived faults — and his judgment in the transfer market last summer, albeit faced with a constrained budget, was highly questionable — he is far from being Liverpool’s weakest link.</p>
              <p>Hicks and Gillett have made some good appointments in the commercial and financial sphere, helping to drive up the club’s revenue, but none of that counts for a bean when Liverpool were forced to pay £36.5 million in interest last season (and, at best, a similar figure this campaign). Ivan Gazidis, the Arsenal chief executive, said in an interview with <em>The Times</em> last week that "not all debt is bad", pointing out how the club’s interest bills are more than covered by the revenue generated by the move to the Emirates Stadium. Liverpool’s debt, by contrast, is very bad, existing for no other reason than to prop up a regime that, in every other sense, ran out of credit long ago.</p>
              <p>Gillett took the unusual step of telephoning me the last time I criticised him and Hicks, telling me I had "got it all wrong" and that "debt per dollar, we are in a far better position than our rivals". His response was certainly more polite and more reasoned than that from Hicks Jr in the early hours of Saturday, but my deep reservations were not overcome. It is not a case of saying that Gillett or Hicks or their sons are bad people. It is simply the case that, between them, they have repeatedly shown themselves to lack the qualities needed to be worthy owners of Liverpool Football Club.</p>
              <p>In February 2007 — the day he said that "the shovel needs to be in the ground within 60 days" with regards to the construction of a new stadium, where two years, 11 months and four days on, no shovel has yet been seen — Gillett said that "this isn’t about making money. This is about winning and passion and tradition".</p>
              <p>Yet passion has been directed in all the wrong areas, traditions have been ignored, the aforementioned lustre has been tarnished and the widespread belief persists that they would be as willing as ever to sell up if they could be guaranteed a huge enough profit to show for all their hard work and dedication to the Liverpool cause.</p>
              <p>That will be the final insult, when they depart — whether it is in six weeks, six months or six years — with a profit to their name. Hicks Jr’s e-mail in the early hours of Saturday was merely the latest, but, with those ten words, he plumbed new depths. Next time he is passing The Sandon, he would be advised to keep walking.</p>

              <p>one viable option, but still seem a little far fetch for now is the shareliverpoolfc campaign that is being waged now by a group of true reds. this concept is similar to barcelona fc, which is majority owned by catalans.</p>
              <p>the sports culture between the americans and the brits are quite different. for a club of liverpool's stature, i think the poor management of the club by the higher ups impacted liverpool's ascendancy.</p>

              <p>Tom Hicks Jnr has been forced to resign from the board of
                                          Liverpool after an amazing email attack on a supporter.</p>
              <p>Stephen Horner wrote to Hicks Jnr to express his concerns over
                                          the lack of transfer funds for boss Rafael Benitez. First, Horner
                                          was branded an "idiot". Then a second response from Hicks jnr said:
                                          "Blow me, ****face. Go to hell. I'm sick of you."</p>
              <p>In a statement on their official website read: "Liverpool
                                          Football Club today announce that Thomas Hicks Jr has resigned as a
                                          director of both the club and its parent company Kop Holdings.</p>
              <p>"Three new directors have been elected to the boards of both
                                          companies. These are Philip Nash, LFC Chief Financial Officer; Ian
                                          Ayre, LFC Commercial Director; and Casey Coffman, Executive Vice
                                          President of Hicks Holdings."</p>
              <p>Fans' organisation The Spirit of Shankly (SoS) had already
                                          called for Hicks jnr to resign.</p>
              <p>An SoS statement had read: "Spirit of Shankly, the Liverpool
                                          supporters' union, are calling for the resignation of LFC board
                                          member Tom Hicks Jnr after his foul-mouthed response to a union
                                          member's polite enquiry about the funding challenge facing Rafael
                                          Benitez during this transfer window.</p>
              <p>"Not only did Hicks Jnr label the enquirer an 'idiot', he
                                          followed this up with an expletive-ridden tirade.</p>
              <p>"This behaviour comes from a director of a club that has prided
                                          itself on its relationship with its fans over the years, a club

                                          respect that is essential between the club's board, staff and its
                                          fans.</p>
              <p>"We call upon Mr. Hicks Jnr to recognise his shortcomings, not
                                          only as an individual but, more importantly, as a 'custodian' of
                                          the club, and to do what any honourable person would do and
                                          resign."</p>
              <p>Hicks Jnr did offer his apologies to the fan over the
                                          foul-mouthed tirade. He said: "I apologise for losing my temper and
                                          using bad language with you. It was a kneejerk reaction.
                                          Tommy."</p>
              <p>Tom Hicks Snr and George Gillett have been the subject of the
                                          Liverpool fans ire for most of their time in control of the club
                                          since taking over in 2007. The actions of Hicks Jnr are hardly
                                          likely to help.</p>
              <p>Added to that, Benitez admitted on Sunday that he could be
                                          forced to sell star striker Fernando Torres in the summer should
                                          the club fail to make it back into the Champions League. That could
                                          be the final straw for many supporters, angry over the way the club
                                          has been run and the level of debt Hicks and Gillett have piled
                                          onto the books.</p>
              <p>Purslow, Nash and Ayre have played increasingly important roles
                                          in the last few months as they work towards putting the club on a
                                          healthier financial footing.</p>
              <p>That has already led to the signing of a new shirt sponsorship
                                          deal with Standard Chartered Bank worth around £80 million.</p>
              <p>One of Purslow's priorities since taking over from Rick Parry in
                                          June last year has been to find new investment in the club as they
                                          seek to get the funding in place to build a new stadium.</p>
              <p>Hicks Jr had no real input into decision-making at the club on a
                                          daily basis and so his departure will not affect on-going
                                          plans.</p>

              <p><br>I didn't come up with that idea... Nevertheless, its not a bad one though you will need a lot of fans like I said earlier. And if there was really such a thing that I belief would be helpful to the club I support, I wouldn't mind one bit to invest if they are listed on the Sgx... The $500 pounds or S$1118 isn't a big deal... If the club have good potential, why not? There will be yearly returns in dividends... and the share price may even strengthen in the years to come...</p>
