              <p><br>I didn't come up with that idea... Nevertheless, its not a bad one though you will need a lot of fans like I said earlier. And if there was really such a thing that I belief would be helpful to the club I support, I wouldn't mind one bit to invest if they are listed on the Sgx... The $500 pounds or S$1118 isn't a big deal... If the club have good potential, why not? There will be yearly returns in dividends... and the share price may even strengthen in the years to come...</p>

              <p>Well, it came across this way to you, too bad, I wanted a yes or no, not an essay.</p>
              <p>Anyway, talk is cheap, Whoever gave you the rights to doubt another person's support for his club? Whoever he/she may be. Unless of course your love for your club is based on monetary basis and fame, which I think is true on your case since you did analysed about the possible dividend returns</p>
              <p>Based on your analysis then, all poor people shouldn't watch Football because they're not real fans, they can't put their money when their mouth is.</p>

              <p>Your replies are so incoherent and lack proper answers... You jumped into things and let your assumption run wild... And to top it up, you have an aggressive nature of posting even from the start... I would only return what others try to give... If people show some respect, I will return the goodwill and reply accordingly... Nevertheless, I will still take it easy as I respect you as an older member here.</p>
              <p>Did you personally found it to be offending when I asked where are they going to find 1 million fans? let alone willing to donate' $500 pounds each? Well, have I said anything wrong? It's like a general question and not remote to Liverpool alone. So I don't think I said anything wrong there. Cos if they could, they would have bought it 3 yrs ago when it was only $218m... they have not, and now its going to be more difficult as it's now more than double that sum... Nevertheless, I always keep an open mind, it can happen in the future, who knows... But the fact is it hasn't to date. And not even coming close yet as well.</p>
              <p>Now, I find it rather strange that someone would ask me... Whoever gave me the rights to doubt others... Let me tell you this, unless you are really that naive, everyone does it on a daily basis for your information... It is something that takes place before you come to a decision on most things... and before you make it, you are still consider...in doubt.  </p>
              <p>This forum does try its best to promote freedom of speech on football matters thank you very much, but I don't find anything noble about it. It is weird to know someone feels giving freedom is something noble... To me, freedom is one's right. It's just a way we choose to run it... If others prefer to post in a more restrictive forum and get their post edited on lots of occasions, by all means, go ahead... No one will stop you, we can respect your choice. If others want to come here and throw stones, come as well... We are able to defend ourselves. </p>
              <p>For me, people who subscribe to the idea of "Freedom of Speech with Intelligence" Wait a minute, What is "Freedom of Speech with Intelligence." ?</p>
              <p>Let's see, I think it's those who only wants to be heard but restrict others... It's like a tyrant saying only I can speak and be heard and any dissenting opinions right or wrong can't as they are all unintelligent opinions to him?</p>
              <p>Personally, the term make me laugh... I don't know what "Freedom of Speech with Intelligence" is... It comes across to me like saying you like chicken rice without the chicken or the rice... lol... Or Mee rubus without the mee... imagine that, kind of funny right... lol. </p>
              <p>But if you so strongly believe in it then I suggest you try practising it more... Because I don't seem like the one caught between a rock and a hard place... whatever that is... lol.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I hope you won't take offence again this time... its just a discussion, no need to get all excited...</p>

              <p>Wow, we have an eloquent tongue here. Come on, Who needs more knowledge between the 2 of us? To even doubt Liverpool has 1 million fan? What a joke, like I said, just in Asia alone, Manchester United and Liverpool have about the same fanbase with each either ahead or behind by a little. By belittling the amount, how does it spell for your level of knowledge, this is a comment, <strong>don't get all excited and post another wall of text because honestly I don't have that much time to read it.</strong></p>
              <p><br>So you enjoy spilling the blood first before you get spilled on? That right? Seems right from your accusations. From your ignorant comment, pardon my vocab, I couldn't find a more suitable word. Being a true fan means to pump money to your club when your club needs it? Thing is, not all fans are rich enough to have 500 pounds. Are you that ignorant to think all who watch Football have at least 5 digits in their bank statement?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, Do you think the fans would trust such a foundation as well, I'm not saying they're not trustworthy, but have you thought that some fans just don't feel well putting money into such a public company to run it? Put your money where your mouth is? What an ignorant and condescending statement.</p>
              <p>You being in doubt, that's why I told you kindly to read a book, but you refused. Now now, one shouldn't stop learning.</p>
              <p>Freedom with Intelligence, god I love this. Come on, don't get me to spill all the beans on you, you used flamatory topics to gain popularity for your forum. I don't even need to dig, I'm sure the older members here can relate you very well in terms of aggressiveness with a certain <strong>Chelsea Fan</strong> who used to roam around.</p>
              <p>So much that being a General Football &amp; EPL forum, this forum seems to put a certain club in good light and every other club in the bad.

              <p>Err... answer to your first question... Seriously... You. and I am not kidding here... Anyone reading what you posted might even laugh at the replies you made... really...</p>
              <p>Any club can say they have 1 million fans or 10 million fans for that matter... I even said does it concern whether United have even 1 fan or 1 million? But its still hearsay and estimates at best at the end of the day... Can you line-up one million fans in asia to prove it? Tell me if you can do so... Otherwise, allow me to keep my doubts. Personally, I find there is nothing to feel belittle about, it's quite silly actually to take it so personal. Even when you asked does Manchester United have 1 fan... Its only those who feels insecure or having inferiority complex will take it so serious. But the fact of the matter is, do they have the 1 million fans ready to cough up the $500 pounds? Cos I am not seeing it yet, so?</p>
              <p>There you go again... assumption, assumption, assumption... No I don't like "spilling the blood first before you get spilled on" whatever that means... Everyone can see I don't resort to personal attacks I try to post solely on the topic of the thread but if someone wish to go down to the lower levels by behaving arrogantly and try to insult others... Then I am all game for it too.</p>
              <p>On your second paragraph... Man, its totally rubbish with insinuations from my original words... So don't see a need to even reply to it... I will just say this... Go back and read it carefully again (2nd time) and ok, I pardon your vocab and ignorant comments.</p>
              <p>On your third, this is getting more funnier... You are actually answering the question for me now... lol. Have you been reading properly or not? That's what I have been saying all this while I have serious doubt if there are 1,000,000 of him. So you see the point of my doubt now? Valid ? Or still cannot get it? Anyway, thanks for answering the question though.</p>
              <p>On your "Freedom of Speech with Intelligence" Please spill as many beans as you can... I like to hear more of it... lol. It's a really funny point each time I see those few words put together. I am curious to see how much more you can turn it... lol.</p>
              <p>Inflammatory topics to gain popularity for the forum? My, what a wild accusation level on us. Well, I don't agree with the statement. Cos I don't even regard the ratings with importance or something worthwhile these days. But you should check the place you are mod though, weird right... The place you are mod of seems to use inflammatory remarks as one of its best tool to gain popularity... But its your opinion, just like I have mine. So be it, It's a free country...</p>
              <p>Please if you need to dig, be my guest... Do you need a shovel? I am very sure the older members here can remember well enough on who was the one who engage in a topic manner and who likes to resort to personal attacks and name callings... </p>
              <p>On your second last paragraph, again its your opinion so be it... I am only a little disappointed with Newton's 3rd law though... For every post I made, I am not even getting an equal reaction... lol</p>
              <p>Finally, don't you worry... I am far from upset. I am actually having a blast of a time... I have to say this, I have engage many others in here and usually on a topic basis and I find them worthy opponents... Mainly because they know what they are talking about, they asked the hard questions and keep it respectful... But unfortunately, I don't find the same from yours...</p>
              <p>You are aggressive in the wrong areas, attitude rather then the questions.</p>
              <p>You asked me rather silly questions - Like who give me the right to doubt?</p>
              <p>Given freedom is something noble when it should be one's right.</p>
              <p>"Freedom of Speech with Intelligence" I still don't know what it means. Maybe you can try harder next time... cos it seems so amusing one can have such a direct contradiction in just so few words... amazing...</p>
              <p>Litter with baseless accusations...</p>
              <p>Questioning me in an earlier post then helping me to answer it... Fyi, I couldn't have done any better if you must know... lol.</p>
              <p>So, you still strongly believe in "Freedom of Speech with Intelligence"? </p>
              <p>Well, like I said earlier, you should try practising it more rather than going against your own believes... So how's the feeling being caught between a rock and a hard place?  Man, you sure have weird metaphor as well... rock and a hard place... what's that? lol.</p>
              <p>Ok, don't you go jumping into things and let your assumption run wild again ok... Learn to read things carefully and not misconstruce things again. And also don't you worry, if you got no time to read. Its ok, others might have...</p>

              <p>Aww come on, do you really need to come up with another wall of text? I don't have all that time to read it, you don't really need a wall of text to grab my attention okay? Just a paragraph with proper points noted out.</p>
              <p>Never mind, out of courtesy I read all those, seems like you just basically rephrased then reposted your previous post and avoided those that were not in your favour.</p>
              <p>If you really want my reply, just read my previous reply because I don't want to repeat my words.</p>
              <p>Do you remember why you decided to come up with this forum? Because of a certain fan constant flaming on a certain forum that led to this, you forgot that you were similar to him just that he was way more extreme than you.</p>
              <p>Because, no one bothered to mod him which led to this forum's creation. Right now, seems like you're repeating the same mistake the previous forum has done.</p>
              <p>Once again, please re-read my reply and you don't need a wall of text to gain my attention.</p>
              <p>Last note, there's a fine line between being in doubt and drawing assumptions.</p>
