              <p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FAS lifts ban imposed on Aussie footballer Abbas Saad in 1995</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Football Association of Singapore (FAS) council on Thursday lifted the suspension imposed in June 1995 on Australian Abbas Saad from all football activities in Singapore. <br><br>The suspension followed his conviction in Singapore's Courts for helping then team-mate Michal Vana in a conspiracy to fix matches in the FAM Premier League competition. <br><br>The FAS said Abbas had appealed to have the suspension lifted. In reaching its decision, the council considered the circumstances, nature and extent of the violation, the punishment meted out by the court and the character and contributions of Abbas Saad. <br><br>Abbas was a key player when he represented Singapore in the FAM Semi-Pro League, FAM Premier League and the Malaysia Cup competitions for three seasons in 1990, 1993 and 1994, especially in helping the Lions achieve a double in 1994 when Singapore won both the FAM Premier League and Malaysia Cup. <br><br>The council noted that Abbas has already served almost 14 years of suspension and has kept a clean record since. The FAS added that Abbas has expressed interest to return to Singapore to contribute to local football in future. <br><br>Abbas said: "I am grateful and thank FAS for giving me this second chance. I acknowledge that Singapore has strict laws. I am determined to erase this dark incident of my life forever and look forward to starting a new chapter for the better and to make good back in Singapore to all the football supporters who have given me so much love and support during my playing days. I look forward to contributing to the development of Singapore football." <br><br>FAS General Secretary Winston Lee said: "Considering all the circumstances of the case, it is timely now to lift the ban. We believe that he can contribute to the further development of Singapore football. <br><br>"However, this does not mean that FAS is softening its tough stand against football corruption. Once again, we reiterate our tough stand against any form of football corruption and our firm commitment to weeding out this scourge from the game. We will remain ever-vigilant and will press on with measures to detect and punish wrongdoers." <br><br>Abbas Saad played for Singapore in two spells, first in 1990 and then from 1993 to 1994 in the FAM Semi-Pro League, FAM Premier League and Malaysia Cup competitions. <br><br>He also turned out for Johor in 1991 and 1992. Abbas was capped at senior international level for Australia and turned out for them in two World Cup qualifying campaigns. <br><br>On June 1995, he was found guilty for his part in helping then team-mate Michal Vana in a conspiracy to fix results in the FAM Premier League competition. <br><br>Abbas was implicated when he agreed to help Vana to win games for Singapore by scoring goals. He never received any money and pulled out after three matches. On the whole, Abbas played a minor role. He was a first-time offender. <br><br>In imposing only a fine instead of imprisonment, District Judge Mr Khoo Oon Soo pointed out that Abbas was a "secondary conspirator", unlike previous football corruption cases. <br><br>The learned Judge cited two previous cases involving "primary conspirators" who were given stiff sentences as follows: the first was imprisoned for 18 months and fined S$40,000, while the second was imprisoned for 30 months and fined S$40,000. <br><br>FAS subsequently imposed a life ban on Abbas from participating in all football activities in Singapore. The ban was extended to a worldwide ban by FIFA. <br><br>FIFA lifted this world-wide ban after one year. Abbas then resumed his playing career in Australia till 2003 before hanging up his boots. <br><br>He then turned to coaching. Today, he is a certified and qualified coach, having received coaching certificates at the Junior, Intermediate and Senior Levels from the Football Federation of Australia (FFA). <br><br>His expertise is in youth development. He was recently appointed the Youth Coaching Director at Sydney Olympic FC. He is also the National Head Coach of deaf football Australia, as well as head coach of Trinity Grammar School. - CNA/vm <br></span></p>

              <p>Yes, I remembered that time when Singapore was playing great football then. Malaysia Cup Competition. And it never fail whenever Singapore play at home ground, the crowd that support our players playing against our neighbour state. </p>
              <p>Abbas and 'Alister Edward' was it?</p>
              <p>It would be nice to see Abbas back here in Singapore to contribute to our local soccer as a coach maybe.</p>
