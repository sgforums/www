              <p><br>the coach made the right decision... if you allow the fans to kick the opposition team players and get them sent off, then it's a very big advantage to home team games... imagine the score 0-0, i send some hooligans to kick and make the opposition team players angry, they get sent off, HOME TEAM ADVANTAGE!!! good strategy, even barcelona we also can win when they play in singapore if we use this strategy to send off 3-4 of their players. =D</p>

              <p>To be honest, the player deserved a send off. He should never have retaliated. Instead, he shd have grabbed hold of that fan and handed him over to the police. The coach was wrong to ask for a walkout like that. Think there was a walkout (was it France?) before and that team were handed a heavy penalty. As a head coach of a big club, he has actually jeopardised the club's reputation, finances and position at the top of the table by doing that.</p>
              <p>I saw the ref's reaction, he knew exactly what he was doing and when the coach staged the walkout, you can bet to your last dollar that the ref knew exactly what would come.</p>
              <p>Since the keeper kicked the fan, he shd have whacked the vital areas like the head or balls. He did neither and is instead looking at a lengthy ban. Pathetic.</p>

              <p>hmmm based on your points, yep, correct... i do think they will be fined, but then what do you think about very cunning clubs using such strategy to get opposition teams sent off like during champions league final when your enemy is leading 1-0 and u need to chase the game urgently <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>I remember very well thank you. And I remember when you said go down, you were referring to not win anything. My reply to you was they didn't need to win anything to remain a top club. They just have to remain in the top 2, 3 or even 4th place and they will still do well and remain profitable. Look at Arsenal, they haven't won a single thing for like 6 yrs... But they are still very much a top club and a very profitable one too mind you!</p>
              <p>As to this year's champions league, it is just one year. Why don't you see that they were in this season's champions league as compare to Liverpool, Spurs or Newcastle? But more importantly, have you ask yourself why are you looking from a lot money gone? And not a lot money gain from having qualified for this season? That extra $10m to $20m they got would be consider a windfall to those clubs who didn't qualify in the first place.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid have not won the league title for like 3 yrs? And they have not got pass the 2nd round of the CL for like many years prior to this... Does it make them any smaller a club? Does it mean they are going down?</p>
              <p>Finally, results currently show your words are very far from right my dear as United are in a rather good position to qualify for next season's as well... and probably one of the 4 clubs to be rewarded with the extra millions. Again, i can't emphasize enough to you, and that is, you don't necessary need to win everything to be a top club. Get it?</p>

              <p>Howere, i don't think 2 years alone would be enough to transform United into an average club. Cos look at Pool, 20 years on and not having won the title, and they are still consider a big club.</p>

              <p><br>i dun think they will go to average (i.e. mid table) in 2 years lah... more realistic is if they can't win the epl (something they been so dominant in) or that they get into champions league final lesser. but i am looking more towards after alex ferguson, with him around, i think proper order is in the house. the next guy may not be able to take over, sometimes the players "bully" the manager, afterall the players know they are powerful nowadays.</p>
              <p>things in life can be predicted given enough information, for example if you know a dice has 6 sides, given a certain number of rolls, a certain percentage will come out... casino made use of these information to calculate the house odds. so in a way, they are predicting based on those information to make money.</p>

              <p>If you read my statements, I was saying if the person has enough information, he can make a good calculated prediction... very very simple question is if i tell you the coin has 2 sides, both sides are head, now if I do a coin flip, what's your prediction? My prediction is if the coin has 2 sides and both sides are head, it is very likely to land on head... Are you going to tell me it will have some other outcome?</p>

              <p><br>You don't even need any educated information with your fast minimizing examples you are giving.</p>
              <p>First it was a whole league, then it became a choice of 6 (dice), and now you are further minimizing it to a choice of 2 (coin)? Sorry, 1 only as your coin has 2 heads.</p>
              <p>For this kind of examples mentioned, Can it even qualify as a prediction cos i don't even need any information to get my guess correct all the time. Even if it's a normal coin, chances are half the time i will get it right. It has become a matter of chance rather than a calculated prediction.</p>
              <p>You have to come up with a better analogy and not one like that. It's like I'm asking which of my leg am i going to move in order to walk by myself? But I only have a right leg and no left leg?</p>
              <p>Are you going to tell me it will have some other outcome? (Quoting you) if I don't intend to crawl, roll, jump, fly, float?</p>
