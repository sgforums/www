              <p>The Gunners failed to close within a point of leaders <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> as <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> deservedly shared the spoils with the North Londoner's, and will feel hard done by not to have left with the three points.</p>
              <p>Leon Osman put the visitor's in front with a towering header from a <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Landon Donovan</span></abbr> corner after only 12 minutes.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> were struggling with the conditions but drew level just before the half
              hour when Denilson's shot took a deflection off Osman to leave Tim
              Howard stranded.</p>
              <p>A blizzard enveloped the ground after the break but still <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> looked comfortable and it was no surprise when they regained the lead with just nine minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>Steven Pienaar beat the offside trap, raced clear and cleverly lifted the ball over the advancing Manuel Almunia.</p>
              <p>But credit to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr>'s side for keeping going, and in the second minute of added time Thomas Rosicky's shot went in off Lucas Neill.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> now no longer have a game in hand over <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>

              <p>As an Arsenal fan, i thought it might be good that Arsenal lost this match so that Wenger can have a wake-up call and realize that the squad is weak and needs improving.

              <p>look at last night's squad, do you think Traore, Song, Denilson, Diaby are even in the same league as Cole, Vieira, Ljungberg, Parlour. Definitely not.</p>
              <p>Traore is too inexperienced, clearing the ball even when not under pressure.</p>
              <p>Song is too slow.</p>

Its true that Arsenal may have to endure droughts for a few seasons but this season you can start to see a 'golden' generation surfacing. I cannot help but think that Arsenal in a couple more years will be the team that will be dominating the BPL just like the 'beckham and neville' era for Man U.</p>

              <p><br>You have too high a hope for Arsenal... Arsenal is a selling club. I once said Fabregas won't be there by the time he reach 25 but now I won't be too surprise if Fabregas is next to be sold at the end of this season... The current shareholders are still there and they have a history of enriching themselves before they finally sell in to some billionaire Russian or American... And with Wenger always so eagar to show he can bring in more youngsters... The team will always lack maturity and experienced.</p>
              <p>True they are a good side on a normal day... But when the pressure starts to built on them, they lose their way alittle... Therefore, I still have my believed that who ever ends up above Chelsea, will be the champion this season.</p>

              <p>That's what you get with a team of youngsters. People who are prone to injury, especially crucial problems for their star players: V Persie, Fabregas.</p>
              <p>And look at Denilson: it's like he accidentely took sleeping pills during half time and it kicked in just when he holding the ball in vulnerable position. lol</p>
              <p>I wouldn't mind Arsenal with these problems. But Arsene Wegner is a big talker and turns me off with his stubborness and his arrogance. Look at O Neil from Aston Villa. He is much more humble and down to earth. And he beat Man Utd AND Chelsea this season, unlike Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Arsenal did not deserve to win this match, even a draw is pushing it. Without Fabregas and V Persie, their players just run around like mad dogs mostly. Reminds me of 10 Dirk Kyuts. No direction, no gameplan, just rely on individual skill and some quick passing, hoping for a lucky break.</p>
              <p>Dont know why so many people are optimistic about Arsenal, when it's looking more and more that they are a one man show. Whether they can challenge for the title largely depends on Fabregas' continuning form and fitness. How sad</p>

              <p>it is not hard to realise arsenal is a selling club. why would arsenal spent so much money on young talent? how do this young talent get the chance to promote if arsenal dont sell their stars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>unless some the US or russian Billionaire fully take over arsenal and write off arsenal debt like roman done to chelsea, arsenal will be a selling club until their finances are clear of debt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>or unless, AW leave arsenal. AW has too much power in arsenal dressing room and the board are not pressuring him for success. because the board know, there isnt manager out there who can spent less and gurantee UCL spot.</p>
