              <h1>Liverpool title hopes hanging by thread - already</h1>
              <div class="smalltext"></div>
              <p>LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Coming off an international week
              and visiting a Sunderland side still abuzz from their Old
              Trafford efforts, Liverpool's title hopes could sustain a hole
              below the waterline even earlier than usual on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Their 2-0 loss to Chelsea last time out was their third
              defeat in eight league matches and has left them six points
              behind the table-topping Londoners.</p>
              <p>Another loss at the Stadium of Light, combined with wins for
              Chelsea at Aston Villa and Manchester United at home to Bolton
              Wanderers would leave Rafa Benitez's side with a mountain to
              climb.</p>
              <p>Liverpool fans who celebrated their then-record 18th
              championship title and 10th in 15 years in 1990 would have taken
              some convincing that 20 years on they would still be searching
              for their 19th but that is already starting to look a strong
              possibility even before the end of October.</p>
              <p>In recent seasons Benitez has made little attempt to
              disguise his feelings that the Premier League was strictly a
              second priority after the Champions League.</p>
              <p>While they were winning and reaching the final of Europe's
              elite competition the fans could just about swallow it but when
              Manchester United equalled their record of 18 titles last season
              enough was enough.</p>
              <p>Benitez certainly seemed to have more of a focus on domestic
              duties in the first two months of the season, with less rotation
              in the league, but his team have still been inconsistent.</p>
              <p>They preceded the Chelsea defeat with a loss, and a poor
              performance, to Fiorentina in the Champions League. They follow
              the Sunderland game with a Champions League match against Lyon
              and a Premier League clash with United.</p>
              <p>Assistant manager Sammy Lee, a key midfielder in the 1980s
              when Anfield league titles came along like London busess, told
              the club's website (www.liverpool.tv) that high-pressure games
              were the norm.</p>
              <p>"At this football club, every week is massive," he said.</p>
              <p>"It's been a mixed start to the season - there have been
              some good points and some bad.  But it's still only October and
              we're going to be working very hard to ensure we're there or
              thereabouts come the end of the season in all competitions."</p>
              <p>GROIN STRAIN</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard missed England's World Cup qualifier against
              Belarus on Wednesday with a groin strain but could feature on
              Saturday, while Fernando Torres was excused boots from Spain's
              game against Bosnia having played 55 minutes against Armenia on
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>"There is no window for us to have any kind of international
              hangover - we don't have that luxury,"  Lee said.</p>
              <p>Sunderland were heading for a famous victory at Old Trafford
              on Oct. 3. before a last-minute own goal scraped Manchester
              United a 2-2 draw and, having beaten Wolverhampton Wanderers 5-2
              the week before, confidence is high.</p>
              <p>United have also been misfiring at times this season, though
              they have still won six and drawn one of their eight games, but
              will expect to claim another win at home to Bolton.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's win over Liverpool was the perfect riposte after
              their perfect start to the season had been ended by Wigan
              Athletic and they face another stiff test at Villa.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, who have already scored 24 goals in their seven
              games, are at home to Birmingham City, Tottenham Hotspur visit
              manager Harry Redknapp's former club Portsmouth while Manchester
              City visit Wigan on Sunday.</p>
