              <h1>Jose Mourinho prepares Real raid for Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard 
              and Ashley Cole <br></h1>

              <p>Jose Mourinho has opened the door to moves for Steven Gerrard, Frank 
              Lampard and Ashley Cole as he prepares to take over at Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>The
               former Chelsea
               boss admits Liverpool captain Gerrard and the midfielder's Stamford 
              Bridge counterpart Lampard are 'both great players' who he would have no
               problem splashing out for.</p>
              <p>Mourinho is also keen to set up with 
              an attacking team at the Bernabeu, starting from the back with attacking
               full backs 'like Ashley Cole and Maicon'.</p>

               star Steven Gerrard to the Bernabeu </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Sportsmail revealed last week that the relationship between 
              29-year-old Gerrard and Anfield boss Rafa Benitez was strained enough 
              for the England ace to consider a move abroad.</p>
              <p>Madrid are 
              seen as the favourites to make a bid, while a move for Lampard, 31, is 
              likely to prove more difficult to pull off. Mourinho admits he hugely 
              admires both and would have no problem making a move for players 
              approaching the twilight of their careers.</p>
              <p>'I like players at
               the end of their careers,' he told Spanish newspaper AS. 'I love to 
              have some players who are 33 or 34.</p>

              <p>'They are players who you buy and do not recover the money but if 
              you get a good performance for two or three years and you've got more 
              than enough value.</p>
              <p>'Both (Gerrard and Lampard) are two great 
              players and always give everything.'</p>
              <p>England left back Cole 
              is also thought to be considering his future at Chelsea as his marriage 
              to Girls Aloud singer Cheryl heads for divorce.</p>

              </div>
              <p>The 29-year-old is on the list of candidates to fill the problem left
               back position at the Bernabeu and Mourinho admits he is a huge admirer 
              of the raiding defender.</p>
              <p>Explaining how his Madrid side would
               set up, Mourinho said: 'Normally we play with four (at the back) but 
              with two offensive full-backs of the style of Ashley Cole or Maicon. In 
              midfield we can play in diamond or triangle. If we play with the 
              triangle, then we line up to three forwards.'</p>
              <p>Madrid are in 
              advanced negotiations to sign Angel di Maria from Benfica after cooling 
              on Franck Ribery, though they face competition from Chelsea, and both Manchester
               United and City for the Argentina winger.</p>
              <p>Mourinho confirmed
               he supported a move for the 22-year-old, but claimed he wasn't a fan of
               paying over the odds - despite overseeing a huge spending spree with 
              Roman Abramovich's money at Stamford Bridge between 2004 and 2007.</p>
              <p>'If we can sign Di Maria at an affordable price, then I say sign him 
              but if the price is exorbitant then I say no because I don't like my 
              clubs to pay crazy prices for players,' he said. 'I want three or four 
              defensive players, but we will improve the attack too.'</p>

              move to Blackburn Rovers </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>One player who looks to be on his way is veteran playmaker Guti. 
              Blackburn are among the sides chasing the 33-year-old, who has also been
               linked to Tottenham Hotspur, and Mourinho said: 'Guti is out for me,' 
              said Mourinho. 'I read his statements and to me that's what counts. He 
              said goodbye to the fans and went around the field.'</p>
              <p>As for 
              his ambition, the Portuguese said: 'I want to win the league, because 
              any player and any coach wants to win the English championship, the 
              Italian and Spanish. And I'd be the first coach to lift three Champions 
              Leagues with three different teams.</p>
              <p>'I have many motivations 
              but I do not want to lose humility so I can not come and say that I will
               win the league because there is a super team in front called 
              Barcelona.'</p>

              <p>Chelsea will do their utmost to 
              retain Lampard and Cole, who 
              signed four-year contracts in 
              2008 and 2009 respectively.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid will raise the possibility of a player-exchange, with Brazil
               superstar Kaka, who worked with Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti at AC 
              Milan, and Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain in the frame.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti is consulting his bosses over the make-up of his team for next
               season and while he is understood to be considering changes to his 
              backroom staff, with Ray Wilkins' future as assistant coach under 
              review, he would be reluctant to lose two such crucial players.</p>
              <p>Mourinho,
               who left Chelsea in 
              2007, is to be installed as Real 
              Madrid manager tomorrow following 
              last Saturday's triumph 
              in the Champions League with 
              Inter Milan. He will want a 
              number of his former players 
              around him at what promises to 
              be his most testing role to date in transforming Real after two years 
              without a trophy.</p>

              </div>
              <p>He is already negotiating to take Inter Milan right-back Maicon to 
              the club but wants to add a left-back and a midfielder. Cole is 
              understood to be ready to consider a move after his pop star wife Cheryl
               filed for divorce last week, although Real may baulk at improving his 
              wages of £120,000 a week and are tracking Lazio's Aleksander Kolovov as a
               contingency.</p>
              <p>Lampard would find it difficult to resist the lure 
              of rejoining former mentor Mourinho.</p>
              <p>However, neither Ancelotti 
              nor Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich would want to lose such an iconic 
              player, who signed his current four-year deal when Mourinho attempted to
               recruit him for Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>Lampard is 32 next month and 
              Mourinho's interest represents his final chance to make the move abroad 
              which he has always said he would like to experience before his career 
              ends.</p>
