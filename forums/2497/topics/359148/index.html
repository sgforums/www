              <p><strong>After exiting both the FA Cup and Champions League in recent weeks,
              Arsenal have received some much needed good news with the club
              confirming that Theo Walcott has signed a new ‘long-term’ contract.</strong></p>
              <p>Walcott, 20, has been rewarded for a season in which he has tangibly
              progressed despite suffering from a nasty shoulder injury, scoring in
              the FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea and Champions League quarter
              final against Villarreal, as well as claiming a remarkable hat-trick
              for England against Croatia.</p>
              <p>That feat, achieved in Zagreb in September, served notice of
              Walcott’s growing potential to an international audience and after
              opening negotiations over a new deal in January, Arsenal have moved
              swiftly to secure the future of one of their brightest prospects.</p>
              <p>“We are absolutely delighted that Theo has committed his long term
              future to Arsenal Football Club,” manager Arsene Wenger told the club’s
              official website.</p>
              <p>“Theo is an intelligent player with amazing ability and speed, and has developed extremely well this season.</p>
              <p>“At still only 20 years of age, Theo has huge potential for the
              forthcoming years and we are all looking forward to see him grow even
              more in an Arsenal shirt.”</p>
              <p>Walcott became the most expensive 16-year-old in history when
              joining Arsenal from Southampton in January 2006 and, although he had
              to wait until the following season to make his debut for the club, he
              was a shock inclusion in Sven Goran Eriksson’s squad for the World Cup
              in Germany.</p>
              <p>The forward, who has more often than not been utilised as a winger
              by Wenger, claimed his first goal for the club in the Carling Cup final
              defeat to Chelsea in 2007 and has to date scored 14 goals for The
              Gunners.</p>
              <p>After claiming Thierry Henry’s old number 14 shirt in the summer,
              Walcott looks on course to become the Frenchman’s long-term replacement
              at Emirates Stadium and the fans’ favourite is delighted to have
              extended his stay at the club.</p>
              <p>“I’m absolutely delighted to have signed a new long term contract,”
              said Walcott. “I’m so happy here and just want to say thanks to
              everyone who has helped me get to this point in my career.</p>
              <p>“Together with the belief of my team mates, the boss and everyone on
              the staff, everyone has got behind me here at Arsenal which is
              brilliant.</p>
              <p>“It’s fantastic to work with the best manager in the world and play
              at Emirates Stadium, which is an unbelievable place to play in. I just
              want to continue playing my football at this club and look forward to
              many successful seasons ahead.”</p>
