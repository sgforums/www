            <div class='col-md body'>i think its too little too late.  I think one of Pardew's job is to prepare Charlton for relegation &amp; then bring them up again next season.  Seeing that he has brought West Ham, I think the charlton management had similar ideas / mental prepration.<br><br>Of course to outside, they will say they will fight, but realistically, given the position and the way they're playing....haiz.<br><br>its sad cos Darren bent was once the most lethal striker in UK.  But I think if Charlton is to go down, he shld leave.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Â£1M BONUS IF PARDEW CAN SAVE ADDICKS</strong><br><br>ALAN PARDEW will be handed a Â£1million bonus if he rescues Charlton from Premiership oblivion after the ruthless Christmas sacking of Les Reed. And Pardew, the Addicks' third manager this season, will raid his old club West Ham with a Â£3m bid for midfielder Hayden Mullins after signing a three-and a- half-year contract at The Valley.<br><br>Charlton made a swift U-turn in appointing 45-year-old Pardew, on the scrapheap himself just a fortnight ago when he was sacked by the Hammers.<br><br>They brutally axed Reed, 53, late on Christmas Eve after just 41 days, the shortest managerial reign in Premiership history, and his pay-off is thought to be only Â£250,000.<br><br>Murray claimed: "We are very fortunate a manager of Alan Pardew's calibre is available and we have moved very, very quickly to secure his services. Les has Charlton in his blood, but this decision is best."<br><br>Pardew, who spent four years as a player at Charlton, opens his reign with tomorrow night's home derby with Fulham. He has been given a Â£6million transfer war chest to keep Charlton in the P remiership.<br><br></div>
