              <p>The match started with Man U being more adventurous of the two. Man U also seemed more confident and played the better passing game until Lampard scored. Chelsea continued to put up a good fight right to the end.</p>
              <p>It might have been very different had Chelsea scored first, Chelsea afterall even outside of this match has always seemed more capable at defending a lead. Even during this match itself, Chelsea's defence seemed more composed even though they were under more pressure early on.</p>
              <p>Both sides had decent chances to score and win the game throughout the match. Man U found it hard to beat Cech who played superbly and was not to blame for the first goal. Chelsea did better in beating the keeper but couldn't beat the post on a number of occassions.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo caused lots of problems on Chelsea's right flank while on their left flank, Ashley Cole had lots of decisions going against him.</p>
              <p>Drogba was actually having a not too bad game, did his usual of holding up the ball and bringing team mates into play. But the red card was deserved and it was a foolish thing to do on his part.</p>
              <p>I expected Joe Cole to have a better first half and he did have a better second have with some good defensive work. I think he was tasked to mark out Ronaldo together with Essien. But he never quite seemed like be the threat I expected him to be. Maybe due to lack of service.</p>
              <p>It's a pity that Park Ji Sung wasn't even on the bench for Man U. Did see him in the celebrations.</p>
              <p>I felt it was great that Lampard scored again and I feel he showed why Chelsea needed him. He scored the important equaliser in the first half and in the second, he did nicely to turn his defender and his effort fully deserved a goal, but sadly he hit the post. It would have been nice to be able to see him and his family being able to celebrate a Champions' League Victory but it wasn't to be. And between him and Ronaldo, the two regular penalty kick takers, he was the one who still managed to put away his penalty after extra time while Ronaldo missed his.</p>
              <p>Actually when it came to penalties, I expected Chelsea to win it. Van Der Sar does not have a fantastic record when it comes to penalty shootouts and I think any other keeper would have saved Ashley Cole's penalty. Chelsea in my opinion also had so many experienced players who have been to this level before like Anelka, Carvalho. And other than Lampard, players like Ballack are penalty takers for their national team as well. Besides, the Chelsea players were older, more mature players as compared to the many younger ones Man U had taking the penalties.</p>
              <p>Just to comment on a few refereeing decisions, I felt Makelele didn't deserve that yellow card from his tussle with Scholes.</p>
              <p>Then there was the issue of the free kick given for Ferdinand's foul on Lampard, the one where Ferdinand got a yellow card. If that foul and free kick was given, I feel a similar challenge by Brown on Cole earlier in the game should have been a foul as well. I've actually seen these challenges not being penalised in EPL, but I'm not so sure how it is viewed in Europe. But I'd expect at least some consistency from the same ref within the same game.</p>
              <p>I've already said the red card on Drogba was fully deserved.</p>

              <p>It was nice to see after all the battling and aggression on the pitch, when the match was over there were still signs of friendship between players from both clubs.</p>
              <p>Scholes specially walked over to lay a pat on Terry while he was being consoled by Grant.</p>
              <p>Lampard also gave Scholes a pat while going up to get his medal.</p>
              <p>Nani and Carvalho also exchanged pats as Chelsea went up to get their medals.</p>
              <p>Giggs had a soft word or two with Malouda/Kalou after they came down with their medals.</p>
              <p>Some of this is nice stuff to watch, instead of all the fighting and slaps on chins or whatever.</p>

              <p>I also feel Lampard underlined his importance to Chelsea and he is well worth any contract that is required to keep him at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea is a team expected to challenge on many fronts including the ever fast-paced EPL.</p>
              <p>And if you're going to be playing extra time in Champion's league matches against Liverpool and Man U, who better to be in your team than Frank Lampard Jr who has got lungs of iron.</p>

              <p>well, I do agree cause the big mega-stars did not really perform. And it boils down to both teams negating each other.but given the chances, shots and drama, it was not crap. Like I said, both teams did not deserve to lose.</p>

              i didn't stay beyond the final whistle....the second half was certainly more blues than red on the pitch....grant was praised recently for taking chelsea so far...but reality is that the team out there was what the last guy had molded and would have sent out....these chelsea players basically organised themselves.... grant did nothing to put on the squeeze in the last quarter when fergie was clearly flustered...the mouth in the ass mourinho was sure to have done something, especially after drogba's close effort, for playing the better game in the second half but not score, it frustrated chelsea and drogba imploded....
              
              ....manu played a good controlled game in the beginning, allowing little space but that momentum got knocked out when lampard scored....carrick was pretty much wasteful, the 3 amigos upfront didn't do too much for this game....and you're right, neither deserved to lose and penalties in any final is still crap...

              a tale of 2 halves.  Man U started off strongly and make Chelsea looks normal.  Even after Ronaldo score the first goal, they could have scored two more had not been Cech.  Then van de Sar begins slipping and concede the equaliser due to some unfortunate deflections.
              
              second half chelsea played stronger.  And I find Man U lacking ideas, Chelsea clammed down on the flanks, Ronaldo and Evra could not get passes together.  Or they will pump the ball into the Chelsea box but finding no one.  Almost no traffic on the right flank as Heagrave was switched to more defensive role.  And Chelsea is unfortunate, they hit the woodwork twice, had a penalty waved (one tackle was a valid penalty) and there are several incidents where it should be corner kick but referee awarded goal kick.
              
              This also expose Man U's problem with striker this season - for most of the second half, they are pumping balls into Chelsea's box but none can get to it.  Tevez is too short.  Ronaldo is pegged down to the flanks.  Rooney is crowded out mostly by Terry and Cavalho.  And perhaps most tellingly, with the game dragging to extra time, Chelsea is able to bring on Kolou and Anelka for strikers and they still have Shevechenko on bench ! Man U on the other hand, has no real striker after Rooney was withdrawn.  Giggs is midfield and he is old, leaving only Tevez who is too small to do any damage.
              
              Saha is the sickpot and does not have the match fitness to make the bench.  During the penalty kick, one can tell Ronaldo is trying to be arrogant or cheeky and gave a tame one...
              
              Its really luck that Terry miss the penalty.  It is skill that Van der Sar saved Anelka's kick.  At the end of the day, Man U have a large dose of luck to ride through the 2nd half to come to penalty
              
              Hence, man U is lucky this season - just like in 1999 they were lucky.

              <p>why does everyone says that its luck?</p>
              <p>In the first place you have to work hard for chances to happen, and when a chance come if you're capable to take it, than you deserve it. Luck wouldnt just come to you, while you have to work hard to earn it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For chelsea case, they worked hard, chances came, however they are not capable of taking it. e.g. hitting the woodwork isnt unlucky, its just that they arent good enough to take the shot from that angle or they are being pressured thus the shot was poorly taken.</p>
