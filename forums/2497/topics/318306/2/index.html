              <p>you probably means there is only a thin line separating Chelsea and ManU this season.. (which i agreed) but as with all competition, the difference between Champion is that no ones remember the runner up after 2-3 years so its either you win or you don't, sad case but its a realilty</p>

              <p>sumone3.. i couldnt agree more.. i just felt the ref was also very dodgy in his decisions.. couldn't say which side he swayed too cos i saw a lot of dodgy decisions all over.. and red card was fully deserved yes. like i said, welcome him to the club of mascherano and nani.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this season i have watched man u played their football and when they played superbly, they lost matches 1-0 and so on in the BPL and even against portsmouth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the final yest could have been chelsea had terry had scored, and we wouldn't blame luck wouldnt we? because clearly i think chelsea played better football overall. or at least of the 2 teams, chelsea looked like the one who is gg to score. but nevertheless, luck as it seems to have evaded us previously in a few matches, returned and won us the cup so yeah im happy for that. =P</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to slip and miss a simple penalty under no pressure knowing that a simple kick could won your team the title, tell me it aint luck? tell me terry lacks the skill to take a proper penalty?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im a man u fan, but more importantly im a soccer fan. but most importantly im human and these are just my 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p><br>Yeah i know... unfortunately people don't remember the saved he made during the match, but more likely the missed or the mistakes... Even Terry himself will feel the same way... It happens with everyone not just him...</p>
              <p>Today there are still people who remember Baggio missing his penalty and giving the WC to Brazil in 94... Beckham's silly sending off in 98, David Seasan's mistake that allow Ronaldinho to score and win in 2002...</p>
              <p>Then there is Zizu's headbutt incident in 2006... Despite him playing so well in that tournament and getting them to the final... we will always remember him for that single moment... Thats what i am referring to... Thats why i said it will always haunt him whenever he think back... Cos he could also have thoughts of being the hero for them, Their first captain to lift the cup, helping them to win the cup in their first final... all these things...</p>

              <p>Yup, there is a thin line, but at the end of the day... That thin line of even 1 mm will be the difference... Wasn't Lampard's equalizer came about by a stoke of good fortune... or how you sum it up as luck?</p>

              <p>And had Riise not scored that almost impossible own goal 5 mins into injury time (rather long injury time i felt)... I think Chelsea wouldn't even be in the final...</p>
              <p>So you still think they didn't had their fair share of luck? I think Pool fans wouldn't agree...</p>

              <p><br>Why not? Everyone has a right to talk... And who doesn't know every team in any sports needs some luck on their side in order to win anything... So lets not say who deserve or don't have the right to say it... Cos if Chelsea don't have that "little" bit of luck of having Roman Abramovich buying them... They would probably still be a mid-table side... Don't you agree? That alone is the biggest slice of luck any club can ever get...</p>

              <p>Thats why i said it will always haunt him whenever he think back... and i dare say that by the next Wc in 2010, they will still be talking about Zizu's headbutt incident.</p>
              <p>2 months from now? I think 2 years from now we will still hear it... I can already say very sure that come next season's premiership, the commentary will still be mentioning about this if you don't believe...</p>
