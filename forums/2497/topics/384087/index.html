              <p>Manchester United midfielder Ryan Giggs believes Paul Scholes can match his own longevity and continue to impress for the Red Devils for years to come.<br><br>The
              36-year-old Giggs believes that Scholes, 35, is too important a member
              of the United squad to even consider retiring from the game in the
              summer.<br><br>"It is totally up to Scholesy. It all depends on how you
              feel and it is the same with me," Giggs said, according to the official
              website of the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"It is still fairly early in the season. It is the middle of the
              campaign and not at the end and I feel good at the moment. I am sure
              Scholesy feels the same.</p>
              <p>"With the experience he has got and the quality he has got you want that around the place for as long as possible."</p>
              <p>Scholes netted his 99th Premier League goal in the win over the
              Hammers. Giggs, who reached his own century the week before against
              Portsmouth, thinks his team-mate is adjusting to not playing every week.</p>
              <p>"We
              all want to play every game and Paul is no different. He wants to play
              every week but with the squad we have got that is impossible," the
              Welshman added.</p>
              <p>"It is difficult at times when you go two or three weeks without a
              game and internationals come along and you are not involved in those as
              well. It is difficult to get back into the rhythm of it.</p>
              <p>"You have to adapt to not playing every week but I have probably
              been doing it for the past three or four years so I have got used to
              it. Scholesy isn't used to it the same. But I am more of a dynamic
              player than Scholesy so perhaps I need more breaks.</p>
              <p>"He can still get forward or sit in front of the back four and
              control the game. I can also play a number of positions but he is just
              the centre of midfield so it is more difficult to play every week.</p>
              <p>"So all this not playing regularly is new to him. But he'll adapt to it as he has been proving.</p>
              <p>"Saturday was what Scholesy is all about - controlling the game. He
              never gives the ball away. His passing range is the best in the game
              whether it is five yards or 45 yards, he is capable of doing both.</p>
              <p>"Paul is showing over the last couple of weeks just what a great player he still is."</p>
