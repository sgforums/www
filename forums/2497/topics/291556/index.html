"I've got a lot of faith in him, I've enjoyed working with him and speaking to the other players I'm sure they feel the same.<br><br>"There is no point changing managers every five months or every year. You need continuity and I feel we are moving in the right direction."<br><br>Owen echoed Gerrard's comments although the Newcastle striker also dismissed reports that the players would be sending a delegation to FA chiefs to try and persuade them to keep McClaren on.<br><br>"I think every player you would ask would back the manager, that is a natural thing to do," Owen said.<br><br>"We think he is the right man for the job. All this talk of going to (FA Chief Executive) Brian Barwick is paper talk but I think every player will come out and say they hope the manager stays."<br><br>If Russia fail to beat Israel, England will be able to qualify by beating Croatia at Wembley on November 21 and they could also be thrown a lifeline by Macedonia, who host the Croats on Saturday.<br><br>If Macedonia, who can be difficult opponents, pulled off a surprise win over the group leaders England could find themselves needing a three-goal win over Slaven Bilic's side at Wembley next Wednesday.<br><br>That would be a tall order and the more likely outcome must be that the cream of England's "golden generation" will have to face the wrath of their own supporters in a match with nothing at stake.<br><br>"It could be a difficult week," Owen acknowledged. "We have got to try to block out quite a lot of things and be in the right mental and physical state so if anything was to go for us on Saturday then we will be in the right frame of mind to go on and do our best on the Wednesday," said the Newcastle star.<br><br>"It is all about preparing right and being in the right frame of mind to pounce."<br><br>England find themselves in their current predicament as a result of having squandered a lead in their last match, which ended in a 2-1 defeat by Russia in Moscow.<br><br>But they are also paying the price of poor results earlier in the campaign, most notably a goalless draw at home to Macedonia and their failure to beat Israel in Tel Aviv.<br><br>McClaren's position has been strengthened however by some good performances this year, with England having won five consecutive qualifiers 3-0 in the run-up to what was a somewhat unlucky setback in Moscow.<br><br>"We had some sticky results at the start of the qualification campaign, but certainly in the last half dozen games there has been a massive improvement," Owen emphasised.<br><br>"We won five of them 3-0 and played some very good football in the process. We had that one hiccup in Russia where we had a mad five minutes but apart from that results have been on a steady upward curve over the last few months."<br><br>With Wayne Rooney ruled out by injury, Owen is expected to partner Peter Crouch in attack for both upcoming matches.<br><br>Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves has been ruled out of the trip to Vienna but could still feature in the Croatia game if England need a result.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOL<br><br>As I've said before, this is but a facade. I'm not sure about the other national teams, but I notice a trait in the English team. The players always back their coach up when he's still in charge. However once he's given the boot, they will start to pour out their grievances and how sucky they think it is.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
