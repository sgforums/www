              <p class="first"><strong>Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari says the club could appeal against John Terry's red card against Man City.</strong></p>
              <p>Skipper Terry was sent off 13 minutes before the end of Chelsea's 3-1
              victory over Manchester City for bringing down striker Jo as he went
              through on goal.</p>
              <p>Scolari claims to have not seen the incident but will speak to the club hierarchy before deciding any action.</p>
              <p>"I will speak to the players and the board because I don't have any idea what happened," said Scolari.
              </p>
              <p>Referee Mark Halsey ruled Terry to be the last man, although Ricardo Carvalho was behind his defensive partner.</p>
              <p>If Terry's red card is upheld, the England captain would miss Sunday's key Premier League game against Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The last time the two teams met, Terry missed a crucial spot kick as
              his side lost 6-5 on penalties in the Champions League final.</p>
              <p>Scolari was non-committal on whether he felt the decision was correct when interviewed after the game.</p>
              <p>"I would need to see it again on TV before I could really speak about it," he said. "I let the referee make decisions."</p>
              <p>Manchester City manager Mark Hughes felt the decision to send Terry off was wrong.</p>
              <p>"I think it was harsh, but the referee was a little bit erratic," he said.</p>
              <p>Terry would also miss Chelsea's visit to Portsmouth in the third round of the Carling Cup.</p>

              <h1>Lamps wants Terry red card reversed</h1>

              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Frank Lampard has accused referee Mark Halsey of
              dropping a major clanger by dismissing Chelsea skipper John Terry at
              Manchester City.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Terry could miss next Sunday's encounter with
              Manchester United after being sent off 13 minutes from the end of
              Chelsea's 3-1 win at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>The England skipper hauled Jo to the ground after being sold short by Deco's back pass.</p>
              <p>Halsey brandished the red card, ruling Terry had been the last
              man and committed a professional foul by denying the Brazilian a clear
              run on goal, even though he was only just inside the visitors' half.</p>
              <p>Yet Ricardo Carvalho was already behind Terry when the incident took place, with Jose Bosingwa racing back to cover as well.</p>
              <p>Lampard feels it was an obvious mistake and thinks Halsey has to reverse the decision.</p>
              <p>"If there are two men behind the ball it cannot be a professional foul," argued the England man.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully they will address it.</p>
              <p>"I saw Robbie Keane brought down by Nemanja Vidic at Anfield
              today. It was exactly the same thing and it was a yellow card, which is
              what a block like that should be."</p>
              <p>It was the only blot on Chelsea's day as Luiz Felipe Scolari's
              men battled back from an early deficit to record a decisive and
              deserved win.</p>

              <p>I felt Terry made many fouls throughout the match... He should have been sent off for this match anyway. In the first half he body checked a City striker on his way through and the referee amazingly waved play on... I couldn't believe what I saw... Even the commentary fellows started to say maybe being England's captain he gets away with many things... The referee probably went in during half time and was told by some how he didn't shown Terry card for that and a few other offence...</p>
              <p>Although 2 wrongs doesn't make one right but during commentary, they later mentioned the official word for the offence was for rough play rather than the obstruction or being the last defender didn't they?</p>
              <p>I feel Terry won't be a big lost to Chelsea cos Alex is better in the defending department... Vidic on the other hand is more important to United cos Brown isn't as tough as him...</p>

              <p><br>Yes indeed, easy come easy go... I am only commenting on the incident I saw and the commentary i heard from this match... We are only discussing on a particular incident... And that is "Did Terry deserve to be sent off" ?</p>
              <p>If it was just for being assumed as the last defender, then its wrong. A yellow was the correct colour even tho he commited an almost similar offence earlier and should have got book for that too but didn't... 2 yellows would have meant a send off as well that is why i said he deserve it over the whole match...</p>
              <p>But the thing here could be, normally, a send off for being the last defender are usually a foul commited by foot, obstruction on purpose or a bad challenge like a goalkeeper coming out and miss the ball and get the striker instead... But here, Terry was like grabbing the guy intentionally with full force, his feet was far away from him... He was like a wrestler rather than a footballer...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway... </p>
              <p>Did you saw Terry body check a City player earlier and the referee waved play on?</p>
              <p>In your view, was that a yellow card offence?</p>
              <p>And did you hear the commentary immediately after that?</p>
              <p>Did I not say 2 wrongs doesn't make one right if assuming it was for the pull back? But the commentators later mentioned the official word for the offence was for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rough play rather than the obstruction or being the last defender...</span></p>

              <p><strong>Frank Lampard has claimed referees will reduce games to five-a-side matches after Mark Halsey stood by his decision to send off John Terry during </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong>'s 3-1 win at </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Terry will formally appeal against the red card after being offered some encouragement that the FA may yet overrule the referee.</p>
              <p>Halsey will submit his report to the FA on Monday but Sportsmail understands he is standing by his decision after reviewing the controversial incident.</p>
              <p>As it stands, the England skipper will serve a three-match ban, starting with the Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester United on Sunday, after he was dismissed for a foul following a collision with City striker Jo. </p>
              <p><strong>Terry believed he had initially been dismissed for preventing a goalscoring opportunity but Halsey claims the England skipper was sent off for serious foul play.</strong></p>
              <p>Lampard said: 'He's obviously been sent off for a professional foul, it can't have just been for the block. 'If you start giving out red cards for that, we will be reduced to five-a-sides.'</p>
              <p>Lampard also spoke out in support of assistant manager Steve Clarke after Chelsea refused to let him move to West Ham. He said: 'If Clarke goes, it will be a loss but I don't think you can take away a man's right to do what he wants.'</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea have appealed the red card John Terry was given for bringing down Jo during The Blues' 3-1 victory over Manchester City.</strong></p>
              <p>Terry pulled down Jo over 40 yards from goal but was adjudged to
              have denied him a goalscoring opportunity by referee Mark Halsey, which
              sees him at present banned from Sunday's clash with Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The FA announced have confirmed receiving Chelsea's complaint and a regulatory commission will consider the claim on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>If Chelsea's appeal is successful Terry will lead Luiz Felipe
              Scolari's side into battle in the re-run of last season's Champions
              League final at Stamford Bridge.</p>

              <p><br>That absurd, when a match starts till it ends, an opportunity for a penalty is still an opportunity for a match winner. Regardless of whether its in the 1st min or the last...</p>
              <p>Matches have been won in the 1st mins as well as the last over the years... But all these isn't the important point we are discussing are we? </p>
              <p>The thing here is you are assuming that Fergie would have in your words "screamed his pants off"... Well and I have since ask you did he done so in the post match interview?</p>
              <p>Could he have brough it up during the interview couldn't he? Nothing wrong if he did right considering the result?</p>
              <p>So did he?</p>
              <p>So your assumption was incorrect afterall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Assuming, assuming as usual... From the start, I don't even bother which club you support just like I treat everyone here... It didn't even cross my mind whether you are A, B or C fan... I discuss with everyone here base on the topic at hand. I think its you who is the one assuming me to be bias just because of the club i happen to support. I can tell you unreservingly that if the points isn't strong enough for me to make, I would have just kept my mouth shut on it but I belief it is therefore I made it. </p>
              <p>I am not speaking from any club point of view... I am only concern about the topic at hand. And that is "Did Terry deserve to be sent off" ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have since asked you... and unlike you, I have put my foot on where i stand on the Terry issue in my very first post but you don't seem too eager to reply... sitting on the fence are we?</p>
              <p><strong>So did you saw Terry body check a City player earlier in the match?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>In your opinion, was that a yellow card offence? </strong></p>
              <p><strong>(To me, even had it been a United player I would also said it was and I dare say that unbiased diehard Chelsea fans would agree that it was a yellow card offence too)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Did I not say 2 wrongs doesn't make one right in my very first post on this issue if assuming it was for the pull back? So what bias are you talking about?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, commentary may be just an opinion but I am afraid professional commentaries are normally the general opinion in most cases... Don't go around crying wolf calling others bias... I have only given an opinion to the point of the discussion at hand... And doesn't pick on any one individual because of their support for whatever club.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should also start to take a stand on the issue and not aim on any individual here...</p>

              <p>Whether his appeal is successful or not its another matter altogether... The FA may not want their Captain's name to be in the bad books for international reasons but we shall see... To be honest, I am a bit disappointed that he even dare to appeal on it... Looks like the Terry of old is back. The one that became England's captain after McClown made him... I was just thinking if the captaincy was still be be decided, maybe he wouldn't have committed the foul in the first place...</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry will lead Chelsea out against Manchester United for the
              first time since last season’s Champions League final after the club
              successfully appealed the three-match ban handed to their skipper on
              Saturday. </strong></p>
              <p>Terry was shown a straight red card for an uncouth challenge on Manchester City’s Jo in The Blues’ 3-1 win on Saturday teatime.</p>
              <p>However, Chelsea lodged an appeal against the decision on the
              grounds that Terry’s tackle did not deny City’s Brazilian striker a
              clear goalscoring opportunity, due to the presence of covering
              defenders. </p>
              <p>“At an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today, a claim for
              wrongful dismissal from Chelsea's John Terry was upheld,” said a
              statement on The Football Association’s website.</p>
              <p>”Terry was shown a red card for serious foul play during Chelsea's match against Manchester City on September 13.</p>
              <p>”As a result of today's hearing, Terry's three match suspension has been withdrawn.”</p>
              <p>The England captain is now free to face United at Stamford Bridge on
              Sunday in the two title favourites’ first clash since Moscow, in which
              he missed the penalty that would have handed his side their first
              Champions League trophy.</p>
              <p>The positive news is in stark contrast to United, who will have
              Nemanja Vidic suspended for the game and discovered on Tuesday that
              Michael Carrick could be out of action for upto six weeks.</p>

              <h2>Terry free to face United</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.setantasports.com/upload/Sport/Football/2008-2009/Prem/chelsea/terry_off.jpg" alt="" width="356" height="190"></p>
              <p><strong>John Terry will lead Chelsea out
              against Manchester United for the first time since last
              season’s Champions League final after the club successfully
              appealed the three-match ban handed to their skipper on
              Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>Terry was shown a straight red card for an uncouth challenge on
              Manchester City’s Jo in The Blues’ 3-1 win on Saturday teatime.</p>
              <p>However, Chelsea lodged an appeal against the decision on the
              grounds that Terry’s tackle did not deny City’s Brazilian striker a
              clear goalscoring opportunity, due to the presence of covering
              defenders. </p>
              <p>“At an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing today, a claim
              for wrongful dismissal from Chelsea's John Terry was upheld,” said
              a statement on The Football Association’s website.</p>
              <p>”Terry was shown a red card for serious foul play during
              Chelsea's match against Manchester City on September 13.</p>
              <p>”As a result of today's hearing, Terry's three match suspension
              has been withdrawn.”</p>
              <p>The England captain is now free to face United at
              Stamford Bridge on Sunday in the two title favourites’ first clash
              since Moscow, in which he missed the penalty that would
              have handed his side their first Champions League trophy.</p>
              <p>The positive news is in stark contrast to United, who will have
              Nemanja Vidic suspended for the game and discovered on Tuesday that
              Michael Carrick could be out of action for upto six weeks.</p>
