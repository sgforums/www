              <p>It is rather interesting to see that the most international capped player other than Casillas is van der Vaart.</p>
              <p>In fact, Gallas and Carvalho is joined third is the most international capped player.</p>
              <p>It is a good chance for van de Vaart to kick RM in their face for wasting his talent, like what Sneijder did.</p>
              <p>My prediction 2-2 draw, with both goals for Spurs from Rafael van der Vaart.</p>

              <p>Peter
               Crouch's red card after 15 minutes compounded Harry Redknapp's woes 
              after Adebayor had given Madrid an early lead in the Spanish capital. 
              The Spurs striker earned himself an unwelcome Champions League record 
              for the fastest sending off after two bookings after sliding in wildly 
              on Marcelo just seven minutes after being cautioned for a rash challenge
               on Sergio Ramos.</p>
              <p>With winger Aaron Lennon ruled out due to 
              sickness shortly before kick-off, Redknapp was forced to bring in 
              Jermaine Jenas, although Spurs were boosted by the fitness of Gareth 
              Bale.</p>
              <p>However, Spurs found themselves on the back foot after just
               four minutes as Adebayor sent a firm header goalwards, with Luka Modric
               getting the ball stuck under his feet and failing to clear.</p>
              <p>A 
              goal and a man down after 15 minutes, Spurs battled resolutely - and 
              escaped a strong penalty appeal when the ball struck Michael Dawson's 
              arm - and they went into the break just a goal down, but Adebayor's 
              header shortly before the hour mark saw the Champions League debutants' 
              hopes of reaching the semi-finals fade.</p>
              <p>Angel Di Maria's 
              sweetly-struck strike from the edge of the penalty area then saw Spurs' 
              hopes recede even further, and Heurelho Gomes' failure to keep out 
              Cristiano Ronaldo's late volley all but killed the tie.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, in the night's other quarter-final, holders <strong>Inter Milan</strong> left themselves with serious work to do after <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/315209">losing 5-2</a> at home to <strong>Schalke</strong>.</p>
              <p>Inter
               twice took the lead at the San Siro, but two goals from Brazil forward 
              Edu helped the German side take a three-goal advantage into the second 
              leg.</p>

              <p>Crouch was shown two yellow cards in the opening stages of the Champions League quarter-final, first-leg tie as he brought down <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/41579/Sergio-Ramos">Sergio Ramos</a> and Marcelo with late challenges.</p>
              <p>While Tottenham had already gone 1-0 down to a header from <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/16684/Emmanuel-Adebayor">Emmanuel Adebayor</a>, the loss of Crouch left them toothless in attack and Harry Redknapp's side went on to suffer a potentially fatal <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/315212">4-0 loss</a> in Madrid.</p>
              <p>Redknapp
               described the red card as "disappointing", but Carvalho has said that 
              Crouch could have been treated with more leniency.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/5388/Peter-Crouch">Peter Crouch</a> should have been sent off," Carvalho said. "The first one was a yellow 
              card. The second one? I don't know. Maybe the second one was unlucky for
               him and unfair for his team-mates."</p>
              <p>Former Arsenal striker Adebayor netted twice at the Bernabeu, with Angel Di Maria claiming a stunning third and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/22774/Cristiano-Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> finishing off the scoring when taking advantage of some suspect goalkeeping from Heurelho Gomes.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo
               felt the red card was not decisive in determining the final result, but
               urged his team-mates to shun complacency ahead of the second leg at 
              White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>"I'm very satisfied because the team put in a 
              good performance. Recording a 4-0 win in the quarter-finals of the 
              Champions League is a great result," Ronaldo told <em>TVE</em>.</p>
              <p>"We 
              shouldn't get carried away though. It's important to stay focused and to
               continue working very hard to hold on to our advantage. Anything can 
              happen in football. We put in a good performance, regardless of the red 
              card for Tottenham. We were always on top. We struggled a bit before the
               break, but improved in the second half."</p>

              <p>Tottenham captain <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/19812/Michael-Dawson">Michael Dawson</a> admitted <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/5388/Peter-Crouch">Peter Crouch</a>'s sending-off made a tough task much harder as his side were <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/315212">hammered 4-0</a> by Real Madrid at the Bernabeu.</p>

              <p>Crouch
               was sent off in the 15th minute of the Champions League quarter-final 
              first leg for two bookings when Spurs were 1-0 down and Madrid took full
               advantage of their numerical superiority.</p>
              <p>''We go away disappointed, we've got to pick ourselves up because we've got to put in a performance next week,'' Dawson said on <em>Sky Sports</em>. ''After going down to 10 men early on it was so difficult.''</p>
              <p>Tottenham, who conceded an early <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/16684/Emmanuel-Adebayor">Emmanuel Adebayor</a> goal, managed to keep the scoreline to 1-0  by half-time, but Madrid 
              ran away with the match it the second half as Adebayor doubled his tally
               before Angel Di Maria and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/22774/Cristiano-Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> also netted.</p>
              <p>''We
               defended well after giving the early goal away, we got blocks in,'' 
              added Dawson. ''To give another goal away was disappointing and then 
              they scored two top-class goals.</p>
              <p>''The White Hart Lane faithful will be there next Wednesday and we've got to go out and give it our all.''</p>
              <p>Redknapp
               admitted everything had gone wrong for Tottenham, who had to change 
              their team at the last minute, bringing in Jermaine Jenas for the ill 
              Aaron Lennon.</p>
              <p>''We lost Aaron Lennon a minute before kick-off, he 
              didn't feel well, just said he had no energy, no strength. We had to 
              change the team just as we were leaving the dressing room,'' he said.</p>
              <p>''Then
               we went a goal down and got Crouchy sent off. 'It's difficult to come 
              here with 11 men let alone to come and play with 10.''</p>
              <p>On the 
              sending off, Redknapp said: ''He's certainly not one for getting red 
              cards, but I've not seen it.'' He added: ''To get to half-time like we 
              did, I thought we could hang in there and would have a chance, but then 
              our legs ran out a bit.</p>
              <p>''It was one of those days where anything 
              that could have gone wrong did go wrong.'' Redknapp revealed Gareth Bale
               struggled with cramp in the second half and Vedran Corluka was forced 
              off with an ankle problem.</p>
              <p>Madrid boss Jose Mourinho admitted he 
              felt sorry for Tottenham after Crouch's red card made their task nigh on
               impossible. ''I know at his level, 11 against 10, it's almost 
              impossible,'' he said.</p>
              <p>''It's just a question of the team with 11 
              keeping concentrated and we did that in the second half, not in the 
              first half but in the second half we did that. 'For a team with 10 men 
              for such a long time is an impossible mission. 'I feel sorry because 
              with 11 against 11 the match would be much better.''</p>
              <p>Mourinho 
              said, though, Tottenham were still alive in the tie. He said: ''I know 
              English football well, I know the English mentality. In another culture,
               yes, but with the English concept of football it's not over.''</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/13842/Xabi-Alonso">Xabi Alonso</a> insisted the tie was not over. ''Not even close,'' said. ''We have seen
               so many great comebacks. Hopefully this won't be the case, but we have 
              to be ready.''</p>
              <p>The Spain international added: ''We needed to be 
              patient, we knew the chances would come. As soon as we scored the second
               one they were a little bit down. 'The result is fantastic but the tie 
              is not won yet.''</p>

              <p>just my two cents, normally a red card to the keeper is the most devasting, cause it means someone is sacrifice to bring in the reserve keeper and the whole team's direction/tatics get a major revamp.</p>
              <p>for spurs case, won't it be a 4-4-1? and they just hope to counter if there are chances, but why a sudden collapse??</p>
              <p>i think even with couch in, spurs may not do as well, as they thought they could have. but maybe the mental aspects of that, just too much for the spurs players.</p>
              <p>but let's hope the game at WHL, will be different, and spurs can conjure up a real game.</p>
