              <p>AC
              Milan have opened talks over the summer transfer of Didier Drogba from
              Chelsea. The Italian club's sports general manager, Ariedo Braida, met
              two of Drogba's representatives in a Paris hotel on Tuesday to discuss
              Milan's reinforcement plans. But any transfer could depend on whether
              the Italian club qualify for next season's Champions League.</p>
              <p>Braida
              informed them that Milan intended to buy Ronaldinho from Barcelona,
              bring Andriy Shevchenko back from Chelsea and sign Drogba as a
              principle centre-forward. Salary was not discussed, although Milan are
              expected at least to match the Ivorian's current weekly wage of around
              £90,000.</p>
              <p>However, Milan are two points outside the Champions
              League places, a gap that would be increased to five with two games
              left were they to lose today's home derby with leaders Inter while
              Fiorentina won at struggling Cagliari.</p>
              <p>Milan, who were last
              season's European champions, were eliminated from this year's
              tournament by Arsenal. They face a trip to mid-table Napoli and a home
              game against Udinese - who are chasing a Uefa Cup spot - in their last
              two matches. Fiorentina face games against two more teams battling
              relegation, at home to Parma then away to Torino on the last day of the
              campaign.</p>
              <p>Drogba, who scored twice in last week's Champions
              League semi-final defeat of Liverpool, resolved to leave Chelsea after
              their dismissal of José Mourinho in September. He has told friends that
              he believes he will be permitted to join another club and has allowed
              some of his feelings for current manager Avram Grant to become clear.
              The striker opened a recent column for French magazine Sport with the
              words: 'Don't ask me what I think of Grant. It's better for everybody
              if I keep quiet.'</p>
              <p>Two other sides who have definitely qualified
              for next season's Champions League are in the running to sign the
              30-year-old: Spanish league leaders Real Madrid and Inter, provided
              Mourinho agrees to replace Roberto Mancini as the Serie A club's coach.</p>
              <p>Grant
              has been unable to guarantee Drogba's presence at the club next season.
              On Friday the Chelsea manager said: 'There are a lot of rumours about
              everybody. Didier can only play for one club, but he's been linked to
              six or seven. He's at the club. Sometimes he has good days, sometimes
              he has bad days. Most of the time, you have to give answers to
              questions like this on the pitch. In the semi-finals, he was good.'</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              despite Avram Grant's disclosure that Roman Abramovich called to
              congratulate him following Chelsea's defeat of Liverpool in last week's
              Champions League semi-final his job is still not safe, according to a
              Stamford Bridge executive.</p>
              <p>The source also claimed that the
              Russian billionaire had been absent from many of Chelsea's recent games
              because he was 'unhappy with the club's results'. 'He is happier now,
              of course,' the source said. 'But it is still unclear what will happen
              regarding Grant's future. Mr Abramovich was not present on Wednesday
              for two reasons. The first is because he was in Moscow due to the
              changing political situation. But he has also been unhappy at the form
              of the team.' Grant created history by leading Chelsea to their first
              European Cup final, but even if the club were to win the competition
              and the Premier League, his future could still be in doubt, the source
              said.</p>
              <p>Sven-Göran Eriksson, who has been told by Manchester City
              owner Thaksin Shinawatra that he will be sacked at the end of the
              season, is one candidate to replace Grant if he were to leave, with the
              Israeli a possible mover in the opposite direction. 'The club would be
              interested in Grant. The owner likes him very much,' a City insider
              said. West Ham are also thought to be monitoring Grant if they decided
              to replace manager Alan Curbishley in the summer.</p>
