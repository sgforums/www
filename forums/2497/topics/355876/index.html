              <p><strong>No1: Hereford 2 Newcastle 1 (1972)</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Non-league Hereford had already secured a 2-2 draw with top-flight Newcastle before this incredible replay win. The Geordies looked set for a place in the fourth round when Malcolm Macdonald fired them in front but Ronnie Radford’s rocket levelled the tie. Ricky George then grabbed a priceless extra-time winner but it is Radford’s screamer that sticks in the memory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No2: Wrexham 2 Arsenal 1 (1992)</strong> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The season before the sides met, Arsenal won the title and Wrexham finished bottom of the Football League. Yet, that counted for nothing in this third-round classic at the Racecourse. The Gunners led until Mickey Thomas struck a superb free-kick midway through the second half. Steve Watkin then pounced for a winner that rocked the North London giants.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No3: Yeovil 2 Sunderland 1 (1949)</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Top-flight Sunderland, led by the great Len Shackleton, were humbled by Southern League minnows Yeovil in the fog at Huish Park. The mist and sloped pitch helped the Somerset side produce the greatest moment in the club’s history when Alex Stock scored the winner in this fourth-round shock.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No4: Sutton 2 Coventry 1 (1989)</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Coventry, sixth in the First Divison at the time, had won the cup two years previously but they were brought crashing back down to earth by part-timers Sutton. Goals from Tony Rains and Matt Hanlan produced a remarkable victory – the last time a non-league side has knocked out a club from the top flight</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No5: Barnsley 1 Chelsea 0 (2008)</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Chelsea’s starting line-up cost over £115million and also included world stars such as John Terry and Michael Ballack. But that meant nothing to Barnsley, who followed up their triumph over Liverpool by pulling off another sensational result. Kayode Odejayi's header secured their place in the semi-finals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No6: Liverpool 1 Barnsley 2 (2008)</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>This was the moment when Barnsley’s incredible cup run exploded into life. Liverpool’s decision to rest key men did not look ill-advised when Dirk Kuyt fired them in front. But Steve Foster’s leveller and a dramatic late winner from Brian Howard handed the Tykes an amazing victory at Anfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No7: Colchester 3 Leeds 2 (1971)</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Leeds had reached the final a year previously and would lift the trophy 12 months later — but sandwiched between was this fifth-round horror. Fourth Division Colchester stormed three goals in front against Don Revie’s side and even late strikes from Norman Hunter and Johnny Giles could not save the Yorkshire giants from embarrassment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No8: Bournemouth 2 Manchester United 0 (1984)</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>They may not have been the force of today but Manchester United were still the holders of the FA Cup when they faced Third Division Bournemouth in the third round. Goals from Milton Graham and Ian Thompson sent the Red Devils crashing out — the first of a trio of shock cup exits to a team managed by Harry Redknapp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No9: Sunderland 1 Leeds 0 (1973)</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Holders Leeds were hot favourites to retain the cup when they met Second Division Sunderland in the final. But the Mackems pulled off a glorious triumph at Wembley when Ian Porterfield grabbed the deciding goal midway through the opening half. Keeper Jim Montgomery also played a crucial role by making an incredible save to deny Peter Lorimer an equaliser.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No10: West Ham 1 Arsenal 0 (1980)</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The Hammers are the last club to have won the cup while outside the top flight. Trevor Brooking, hardly renowned for his heading ability, stooped to nod home the winner at Wembley to hand the underdogs an unlikely success against giants Arsenal.</p>
