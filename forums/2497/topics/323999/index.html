              <h1>Pele To Ronaldo: No Slavery, Just Honour Your Contract</h1>
              <h2>Brazilian legend Pele believes that Cristiano Ronaldo should honour his contract at Manchester United, and has rubbished Sepp Blatter’s comparison of modern footballers with slaves.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00530/pele_280x390_530028a.jpg" alt="LISTEN UP ... Pele has a point to make" width="280" height="390"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>PELE has blasted FIFA president Sepp Blatter for labelling Cristiano Ronaldo a 'slave'. Blatter insists the Portuguese ace should be allowed to break his contract and join Real Madrid against Manchester United's wishes. Unsurprisingly, Ronaldo was delighted to hear the comments from the head of world football as he battles to engineer a move to Spain.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">But Pele, arguably the game's greatest player of all time, believes Blatter's view is wide of the mark. The Brazilian legend said: "You are a slave if you work without a contract or you don’t get paid. "If you have a contract then in any job you have to finish the contract. "I think that when Ronaldo finishes his contract, then he should be free to go wherever he wants to."</p>
              <p class="article">England World Cup hero Gordon Banks also believes Ronaldo should remain loyal to United. He said: “Ronaldo should respect his manager and honour his contract. “I don’t understand what the problem is. He plays for a team that has just won the European Cup and the Premier League.</p>
              <p class="article">"He plays for his country. What more does he want? “It’s like anything in life. If a businessman signs a contract then he has to honour it. It’ s no different than a professional footballer."</p>

              <h1>Blatter won't apologise for 'slavery' comment</h1>
              <p id="stand-first">Bruce and Redknapp hit out at Fifa president</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://image.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/07/11/blatter460276.jpg" alt="Blatter" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sepp Blatter has no plans to apologise for claiming that Manchester United's desire to hold on to Cristiano Ronaldo is tantamount to "modern slavery", despite attracting widespread criticism for his remarks. The Fifa president, who also suggested clubs should not keep contracted players against their wishes, has been urged to retract his comments by senior figures in football, but last night there was no indication that he would bow to outside pressure.</strong></p>
              <p>"Not at the moment," said a Fifa spokesperson when asked whether Blatter planned to clarify his comments or issue an apology. "For the moment we are not commenting on what he said. We never comment on interviews that have been done. What he has said is obviously on the record. He has no plans to follow up on that. For the time being, we have not heard or seen that he is planning to make additional comments."</p>
              <p>Premier League managers were not slow to add their own thoughts today. Steve Bruce and Harry Redknapp both condemned Blatter for his remarks, insisting he had overstepped the mark and demonstrated a complete lack of understanding over the transfer system. "I don't agree with Sepp Blatter's comments on them being slaves because I believe they have the best job in the world," said Bruce, Wigan's manager. "If they are slaves, what the hell are the rest of us? They have got a good job."</p>
              <p>"It's rubbish, isn't it," added Redknapp in response to Blatter's comments. "You can sign somebody at a football club who turns out to be a disaster. He might not be playing, might be no good, but you have to pay him for four years. So when somebody does fantastically, you're supposed to just let them go? It doesn't work like that. You sign a contract and it has to be mutual agreement, if the club receives a good offer, that's how it works. It's not slavery, is it? That's absolute nonsense."</p>

              <p>Erm.... if anything, Cannavaro would in fact benefit from having Ronaldo on his team.</p>
              <p>Saying that Ronaldo should serve out his contract is testament to Cannavaro's level of professionalism, in my humble opinion.</p>
              <p>If you sign a contract, you do so in the full knowledge that you have to honour it come hell or high water. Giving players the right to make or break contracts at will makes a mockery of having contracts in the first place.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>don't think its any good for Ronaldo to be staying in ManU after all these shit.. but to have ppl saying slave in modern days just say alot about him as a person, especially if its coming from the president of world football.. then again Pele's involvement might have some kind of motive in it, probably trying to put himself in the running for the post when president term is up for vote..</p></div>

              <h1>Sven-Goran Eriksson backs Manchester United in Cristiano Ronaldo 'slavery' row</h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/07/13/article-0-01EBA5AE00000578-5_233x554.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo" width="233" height="554"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="story"><strong>Sven-Goran Eriksson has defended Manchester United's attempts to retain the services of Cristiano Ronaldo by dismissing Sepp Blatter's comparisons between the player and the slave trade as potentially disastrous for football.</strong></p>
              <p class="story">Former England and Manchester City coach Eriksson, now managing Mexico, believes United are firmly within their rights to pursue their current course. He said: "When he came to Manchester, Ronaldo was a huge talent and today he is one of the best players, if not the best player, in the world. But it's thanks to United that he is the player he is.</p>
              <p class="story">"And if Real Madrid really want him, they must be prepared to pay what United really want." Eriksson warned Blatter that he risked anarchy within football by suggesting that the contracts of players are there merely to be broken.</p>
              <p class="story">"There is a lot of money involved for players and for the clubs because football is business today," he added. "There are obviously contracts, but that's not slavery.</p>
              <p class="story">"Any work you have, you can't just get up and walk out without paying some sort of fine, or whatever it is. If football really wants to change all the rules, we should all sit down and discuss it.</p>
              <p class="story">"But you can't do that overnight. That would be a disaster."</p>
              <p class="story"> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile United will write to FIFA president Sepp Blatter this week after he waded into the furore over Cristiano Ronaldo's future. </p>
              <p>United will cite the apparent double standards Blatter has expressed. In February of this year, the FIFA president backed the sanctity of players' contracts with clubs after the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced Andy Webster's fine from £625,000 to £150,000 for ripping up his deal with Hearts to move to Wigan.</p>
              <p>'The decision which CAS took is very damaging for football and is a pyrrhic victory for those players and their agents who toy with the idea of rescinding contracts before they have been fulfilled,' Blatter said at the time.</p>
              <p>But, discussing Ronaldo last week, he said: 'I'm always in favour of protecting the player and if the player wants to leave, let him leave.'</p>
              <p>United could be forgiven for thinking Blatter's sympathy for Ronaldo has something to do with his soft spot for Real, who made him an honorary member in November 2006 and presented him with a gold and diamond club insignia.</p>
              <p>Real president Ramon Calderon revealed Blatter was a fan in his teens and, in a gushing response, the FIFA president said: 'Allow me to again relay my sincere gratitude for the warm welcome, the incomparable hospitality, and the honourable distinction.'</p>
              <p>Portugal physio Antonio Gaspar told Ronaldo he has no hope of meeting his target of playing again within three months of ankle surgery. 'He will not be in an optimum state for competition until 12 weeks are up,' he said.</p>
