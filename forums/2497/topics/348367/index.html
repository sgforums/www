              <p>Rafa Benitez last night claimed Liverpool were the poor relations of
                  the Premier League big guns - and admitted they have to hold their
                  nerve to have any chance of winning the crown.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard
                  remains unrepentant over the wisdom of last month's verbal assault on
                  Sir Alex Ferguson, insisting it was a battle that needed to be fought.</p>
              <p>But
                  with Liverpool likely to be five points behind Manchester United after
                  the title holders play Fulham tomorrow, Benitez went on the front foot
                  as he insisted his club were overachieving given their financial
                  position.</p>
              <p>"Every year, United collect £60million more than us
                  - and that means they can buy three £20m players each season," said the
                  Liverpool boss. "Chelsea will have spent £500m over the last five years.</p>
              <p>"We've made a team that can compete with them but economically we're inferiors and can't afford the players they can.</p>
              <p>"I
                  have enough data to bore you with it. But if you look at United, it
                  wasn't just spending £32m on Dimitar Berbatov - they can spend whatever
                  it takes for what they need every year. Last year it was £17m on Owen
                  Hargreaves, £18m on Nani and £20m on</p>
              <p>Anderson. Seven years ago they paid £30m for Rio Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>"In
                  my five years, I've paid less in transfer fees than I've received, even
                  though I spent £40m on Fernando Torres and Robbie Keane. It's as simple
                  as that." Benitez, set to end his contract stand-off with the board and
                  the club's American owners by signing a new deal, knows excuses will
                  count for nothing if Liverpool fail to land the title in May.</p>
              <p>While
                  he insisted he was 100 per cent right to stand up to Fergie, he
                  admitted the desperation of the Anfield fans is an extra factor his
                  side must conquer. Benitez added: "Ferguson controls everything in this
                  country. These are the facts, as everyone knows.</p>
              <div class="advert"></div>
              <p>"And when he decided
                  to speak about Liverpool, I knew I had to respond to him. Now we're out
                  of the FA Cup, it's necessary to look for the positives and those are
                  that we will play fewer games and be able to concentrate more on the
                  Premier League and the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"The title in England
                  is very competitive, more so than in Spain, because every opponent you
                  face in the Premier League will make it hard for you.</p>
              <p>"So far
                  we've never lost control of the games we didn't win but what we
                  couldn't do was finish the matches off. Our biggest problem is in the
                  great expectations of success that surround us.</p>
              <p>"All we ever
                  hear from the fans is: 'The League, the League, it's 19 years since we
                  had it'. Since I've been at the club we've won four trophies, fought
                  for more and been in another Champions League semi-final.</p>
              <p>"I
                  feel we're where we need to be but the problem for us now is the
                  anxiety around us. We must handle it and that is not easy." Liverpool
                  travel to Real Madrid next week in the last 16 of the Champions League
                  with Benitez optimistic of success against his old club. He said: "I've
                  the experience of the duel we had with Barcelona. They were the big
                  favourites but we knocked them out.</p>
              <p>"We didn't have luck when the draw came out as we have different goals for the season now.</p>
              <p>For Madrid, it's all about the Champions League. That is all they have to win.</p>
              <p>"We're
                  still alive in the title race but what matters is the condition of my
                  players when the games come. Torres is still getting back to his best
                  form, while Steven Gerrard, who is to our team what Raul is to Real,
                  the emblem, is still recovering from a hamstring injury.</p>
              <p>"It's
                  fair to compare Steven to Raul. Both are charismatic players, with
                  enormous hearts, whose personality makes a mark on the rest of the
                  team."</p>

Not worth the gamble, keep him for the 2nd leg better.</p></div>

              <p><br>His rant was a total disaster... Before he made it, Pool were leading the table but after he said those things... Pool went 4 matches without winning or pick up 3 out of a possible 9 points... That 6 points would have put them above United by 4 even before today's game. </p>
              <p>I think he is also trying to highlight Parry's doing a poor job by comparing how much $$$ United makes each season in marketing and commercial gains compare to Liverpool... <img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p>Rafa is half right... The Fools are overachieving given their plight for the past 19 yrs... But at the same time HE is underachieving... His track record at buying players sucks...
