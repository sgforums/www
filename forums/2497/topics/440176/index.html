              <p class="art-txt-first">Wesley Sneijder has revealed that Inter Milan were prepared to sell him to Manchester United in the summer transfer window because of money.</p>
              <p>The two clubs were in negotiations over the summer for the transfer of the attacking midfielder from the Italian giants to the English champions, but failed to reach an agreement.</p>
              <p>Inter, who are said to be suffering from financial problems, eventually sold striker Samuel Eto'o to Russian outfit Anzhi Makhachkala for a reported transfer fee of Â£18.4millon (21m euros).</p>
              <p>Sneijder has now explained exactly what happened during the summer that led to much speculation of him leaving the 2010 European champions.</p>
              <p>"I never thought that I would have to leave Inter," the 27-year-old told La Gazzetta dello Sport. "I left for vacation with the coming back to the team, but when I was on holiday my agent called me and told me that we needed to talk to Inter.</p>
              <p>"And then Inter told me that if there was a possibility, then they would sell me. It was not a technical problem, I think it was a question of money.</p>
              <p>"In short, something had changed so I decided to change my way of thinking too. When I arrived (to the training camp) in Pinzolo, I spoke with club (president Massimo) Moratti, who is a very important person for me, with (club directors) (Marco) Branca and (Piero ) Ausilio, and they all told me that I am very important for Inter.</p>
              <p>"But I knew that one between me and (Samuel) Eto'o had to go: on the day that Eto'o left, I realised that I would remain, and I am happy to do so."</p>
              <p>The Holland international joined Inter from Real Madrid in 2009 and won a historic treble in the 2009/10 campaign with the Milan giants.</p>
              <p>Sneijder, who spent two seasons with Los Blancos and won the Primera Liga in 2008, believes that there is more competition in Serie A than in the Spanish top flight.</p>
              <p>"I like the Italian league," he explained. "I like the pressure here.</p>
              <p>"In Spain you can win almost every match, even away.</p>
              <p>"In Italy, you can lose in Novara, in Catania, so it's more fun."</p>
              <p>Claudio Ranieri's Inter are currently 17th in the Serie A table with four points from six matches and host Chievo at San Siro on Sunday afternoon.</p>
