            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sunderland have agreed a Â£5million fee with Cardiff City for top scorer Michael Chopra.</strong><br><br>The former Newcastle United striker enjoyed an impressive debut season at Ninian Park, notching 22 goals in 42 Championship appearances.<br><br>He also scored both goals in Cardiff's 2-1 win at Sunderland last October and is now discussing a move to the Stadium of Light.<br><br>Bluebirds boss Dave Jones recently revealed the club had fielded no offers for the 23-year-old and stressed his wish to hang on to Chopra.<br><br>But Jones told the South Wales Echo: Â“I am sorry to see him go, everybody in the camp is.<br><br>Â“But at the end of the day there is a price for every player. The money could go on to make us stronger.<br><br>Â“This is good business for us and after all, we are in a business. And for Michael it means Premiership football Â— we cannot stop him. We wish him all the best with Sunderland.Â”<br><br>Roy Keane has moved for Chopra after pulling out of a Â£6million deal to sign David Nugent from Preston North End.<br><br>Meanwhile, Iraq international Nashat Akram is still waiting for an update on Sunderland's reported interest in his services.<br><br>The midfielder claimed last month that talks were being held over a potential move from his current Saudi Arabian club Al-Shabab, but has heard nothing since.<br><br>Akram said: "I haven't heard anything. My agent is dealing with everything, but for now I am playing at the Asian Cup and I am concentrating only on this.<br><br>"I have never spoken to anyone at Sunderland, only my agent has talked to them.<br><br>"Of course I'd like to play in the Premier League, everybody wants to play there.<br><br>"I know about their coach Roy Keane and that would be good for me and good for Iraqi people."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Why Â£4m for Chopra is sign of Keane's uphill task</span><br><br>Roy Keane has never been a man to settle for cosiness but the Sunderland manager has effectively, albeit temporarily, asked the club's fans to go out and join him in the discomfort zone after Sunderland offered Cardiff City Â£4m for the former Newcastle United striker Michael Chopra. Keane is sure to instigate bigger deals in his time, and Hearts' goalkeeper Craig Gordon may fall into that category if he moves south for Â£8m or more, but few will equal the shock of the news of Chopra's possible signing.</strong><br><br>Chopra is yet to agree personal terms, but if that proceeds smoothly inside the Stadium of Light the reverberations will still be felt outside. This is the fickle age of message boards and phone-ins and, on a couple of levels, financially and emotionally, this transfer has raised questions on Wearside about Keane's stewardship for the first time.<br><br>The reason is that while Chopra may have played one season with Cardiff, and impressed with 22 goals in the Championship, Sunderland fans know him as a hardcore Geordie who scored only one Premiership goal for Newcastle. It came against Sunderland, at the Stadium of Light, a goal celebrated vigorously by Chopra. Newcastle United wasted no time yesterday in putting footage of the moment on their official website.<br><br>That goal came in April of last year and when Chopra returned six months later as a Cardiff player he scored twice in a 2-1 win and again marked his goals with robust celebrations. There was no doubting his local affiliation.<br><br>Keane was complimentary about Chopra that October night, saying: "He looks like one of those players who was unlucky at Newcastle. I have seen the lad play a number of times when he was at Newcastle, sometimes for their reserves against Manchester United, and he looks like a natural goalscorer."<br><br>And once the hysteria ebbs in that section of supporters who will always be most voluble and vociferous - Shay Given, Chris Waddle, Michael Bridges, Robbie Elliott and Lee Clark have all played for both Newcastle and Sunderland in recent years - it may be that the mooted transfer says more about that state of the market and the state of English football, rather than a parochial preoccupation.<br><br>Keane bemoaned "a lack of quality" on Tuesday. Due largely to a lack of opportunity at St James' Park, Chopra is unproven at Premiership level and yet costs Â£4m, a sum that will rise to Â£5m should Sunderland and Chopra prove harmonious. But then David Nugent, Keane's previous target and someone yet to kick a ball in the Premiership, has just been sold to Portsmouth for Â£6m. Then again, this is a market where Darren Bent costs more than Thierry Henry.<br><br>It may be that the Gordon deal collapses because of such inflation. In Scotland Hearts are reported to have turned their nose up at Â£8m and asked for Â£10m and, while Keane is on record as saying Sunderland "can compete", there comes a point where the price is simply unjustifiable.<br><br>A legitimate question then arises about alternatives. From Ross Wallace and Liam Miller to Greg Halford and Russell Anderson, Sunderland so far under Keane have bought British or Irish players or foreigners who have played in England - the Trinidadians Carlos Edwards and Dwight Yorke being the most high profile - even though players from abroad generally cost less in terms of fees and wages.<br><br>This could be a policy decision or it could be a broader issue. On Tuesday Keane said: "A lot of players, especially those abroad, do take everything into account. Believe it or not, the weather plays a massive part. Obviously I have been lying through my teeth saying it is always sunny up here.<br><br>"But I suppose I was a bit like that before I came up here thinking the north-east is in the middle of nowhere. That is part of my job to try and sell the club and the area. But I have settled in, I really enjoy it and so do my staff that I brought with me. It is part of my job to sell the club and say come up, have a look around. We have had players, shown them the areas where we think they could live, stuff like that. It is part of the challenge because the temptation for a lot of players is to live in Manchester or London."<br><br>There will be no difficulty selling the area to Chopra since he is born and bred in the north-east. However, not until he has scored at least one Premiership winner for Sunderland will many on Wearside consider embracing Keane's new signing.<br></div>
