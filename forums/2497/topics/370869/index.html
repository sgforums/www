              </div>
              <p><strong>Harry Redknapp is exploring the possibility of bringing Joe Cole to </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></span><strong>, the manager hoping to convince the </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong> midfielder to make the move to further his England hopes in a World Cup year.</strong></p>
              <p>Cole has less than 12 months to run on his contract at Stamford Bridge and although the club are keen to prolong the agreement and the player, a boyhood Chelsea fan, is not agitating for a move, other clubs, chief among them Spurs, have scented an opportunity.</p>
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti, Chelsea's manager, intends to play a four-man diamond midfield this season and has said that Cole could feature in the most advanced role or in the wider positions, where he has tended to play under previous regimes. But with Frank Lampard most likely to start at the tip and with the new signing Yuri Zhirkov as well as Florent Malouda, Michael Essien and Michael Ballack providing fierce competition for the wider berths, Cole knows that his chances of being a regular starter have diminished.</p>
              <p>They will lessen even further if Ancelotti completes the signing of Andrea Pirlo from his former club Milan. Chelsea have opened talks with the Italian club over the 30-year-old playmaker and it is understood that figures have been discussed.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti also wants two overlapping full-backs to help to provide width. Cole, an England international who is determined to play regularly in the run-up to a probable World Cup in South Africa, is recovering match fitness after suffering a serious knee injury last season in an FA Cup tie against Southend United.</p>
              <p>Redknapp, who has confirmed his interest in the Newcastle centre-back Sébastien Bassong, is a confirmed admirer of Cole – not only the talent but also his professionalism and work ethic – having given the 27-year-old his professional debut as a callow teenager at West Ham United.</p>
              <p>The Spurs manager has made a series of expensive forays into the transfer market since his arrival, spending around £45m on Wilson Palacios, Jermain Defoe and Robbie Keane last January and a further £9m on Peter Crouch last week. He remains in the market and the Real Madrid striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar is also of interest to him.</p>
              <p>Redknapp has to offload players to help balance the books and Darren Bent remains likely to move to Sunderland. The North-east club have also shown an interest in the Tottenham centre-half Michael Dawson and the midfielder David Bentley who, surprisingly, did not travel with his team-mates to Asia for a pre-season tour. Redknapp has already sold Didier Zokora to Sevilla for £8m.</p>
              <p>He faces problems in accommodating all his leading players in the starting line-up and with Defoe and Crouch expected to be Redknapp's first-choice strike partnership, there has been conjecture about where the captain Robbie Keane will fit in. The Spurs manager, who has always liked to work with a large pool of players, sprang something of a surprise in today's 2-0 friendly defeat to South China by introducing Keane as a half-time substitute in central midfield.</p>
              <p>"I brought him on as JJ [Jermaine Jenas] had a bit of an injury and I didn't want to push him too far," said Redknapp. "Robbie came on and he played in there. He is a good player and he can play several positions.He is always enthusiastic and he loves to play wherever he is asked to play."</p>
              <p>Bassong was left out of Newcastle's 1-1 draw with Dundee United today though their interim manager Chris Hughton claimed that this was because he is suspended for Newcastle's first league match of the season. The defender is believed to be keen on the switch to White Hart Lane, if an agreement can be reached between the clubs.</p>
              <p>Spurs have problems in central defence with Dawson and Jonathan Woodgate set to miss the start of the new season with injuries and Ledley King yet to kick a ball in pre-season. "He [Bassong] is a player that I was interested in," said Redknapp. "I like Bassong, he is a young player with a good future and a good central defender. I don't think we have made an offer for him, as far as I know. I am sure the chairman has not made an offer."</p>
              <p>Bassong is determined to leave St James' Park, where he earns £5,000 a week, to play top-division football. Newcastle are likely to demand about £10m for the 23-year-old Frenchman</p>

              <p><strong>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp has launched a £10million raid for Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole. Redknapp is a big admirer of England star Cole (above) after giving him his debut at West Ham and would love to take him to White Hart Lane.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spurs boss has already made some discreet enquiries as to whether Chelsea will be prepared to sell the 27-year-old. But Carlo Ancelotti does not want to lose Cole and the midfield star will be offered a new contract as he only has less than 12 months on his current deal.</p>
              <p>And even if they did sell, Blues would want to see a lot more money. But Redknapp believes he may be able to lure Cole with the guarantee of regular football in a World Cup year where he faces a fight for his place.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti is also chasing AC Milan’s Andrea Pirlo which has alerted Redknapp to Cole.</p>

              <p><strong>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp is trying to sign England No.1 David James in a swap for Italian Carlo Cudicini as part of a massive merry-go-round.</strong></p>
              <p>Redknapp wants James to join him again and he is willing to give Portsmouth a deal worth £1million and former Chelsea shot-stopper Cudicini for nothing.</p>
              <p>James would love to make the move as Pompey run into problems and lose their star players and the switch to White Hart Lane could even happen this week. He is concerned about his England World Cup hopes if in a survival-fighting side.</p>
              <p>Pompey are interested in Cudicini, who would be 'free' in the deal but who will want a two-year contract at Fratton Park.</p>
