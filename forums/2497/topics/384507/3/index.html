              <p>anyway... arsenal played well i think... can pass can shoot well.. can pressure well thus creating an owl goal. can hold ball in 2nd half to prevent liverpool comeback...</p>
              <p>well done arsenal.... going to nudge MAn u aside soon to be No 2! Ha!</p>
              <p>But still need further improvement and better team strategy to overtake chelsea.. doubt wenger can do these things well... maybe still got some chance i think...</p>

              <p>Liverpool were so disappointing... I really thought they could win this one or at the very least not lose... The foolish Glen Johnson i don't know what the hell he was thinking... $18m defender and played like that! The first goal he can don't even have to touch it cos the Arsenal player have already over ran the ball but this smart alec somehow manage to score an own goal almost in ridiculous slow-mo fashion and gave Arsenal the confidence again to come back... The second goal also... can't even mark Arshavin properly!</p>
              <p>Pool are just bad right now... I don't know where they are going to go from here... Last night was their first team already and still played like that? And people can forget about that AA man... He doesn't look like a good player to me at all. I think it's another $20m going down the drain... I am guessing why Rafa isn't playing him much despite his father coming out to say he has been fit for 1 month already is he doesn't want the world to see what a waste of money he has done again... This AA man probably need a season to get use to the Premier League... Cos he was like a headless chicken not knowing what to do... He isn't worth the wait... Rafa shouldn't have bought him in June! He should have left him in Italy until he has fully recover then buy. Now he wasted 4, 5 months. That $20m could have been better used by getting someone like Scott Parker, Matthew Upson, Morten Gamst Pedersen or Richard Dunne... I think he could have got 2 or even 3 with that amount considering Dunne went to Villa for only $6m...</p>
              <p>Rafa should just do the right thing for the club and resign by his own accord like Kenny Dalglish when he knew he couldn't take the club any further...</p>
              <p>Overall, it was another good epl match to watch... lots of robust tackles and fast end to end action... Only a pity Liverpool threw it away after having taken the lead...</p>

              <p>Liverpool were so disappointing... I really thought they could
              win this one or at the very least not lose... The foolish Glen
              Johnson i don't know what the hell he was thinking... $18m defender
              and played like that! The first goal he can don't even have to
              touch it cos the Arsenal player have already over ran the ball but
              this smart alec somehow manage to score an own goal almost in
              ridiculous slow-mo fashion and gave Arsenal the confidence
              again to come back... The second goal also... can't even mark
              Arshavin properly!</p>
              <p>Pool are just bad right now... I don't know where they are going
              to go from here... Last night was their first team already and
              still played like that? And people can forget about that AA man...
              He doesn't look like a good player to me at all. I think it's
              going another $20m down the drain... I am guessing why Rafa
              isn't playing him much despite his father coming out to say he has
              been fit for 1 month already is he doesn't want the world to
              see what a waste of money he has done again... This AA man
              probably need a season to get use to the Premier League... Cos he
              was like a headless chicken not knowing what to do... He isn't
              worth the wait... Rafa shouldn't have bought him in June! He should
              have left him in Italy until he has fully recover then buy.
              Now he wasted 4, 5 months. That $20m could have been better
              used by getting someone like Scott Parker, Matthew
              Upson, Morten Gamst Pedersen or Richard Dunne... I think he
              could have got 2 or even 3 with that amount considering Dunne went
              to Villa for only $6m...</p>
              <p>Rafa should just do the right thing for the club and
              resign by his own accord like Kenny Dalglish when he knew he
              couldn't take the club any further...</p>
              <p>Overall, it was another good epl match to watch... lots of
              robust tackles and fast end to end action... Only a pity Liverpool
              threw it away after having taken the lead...</p>

              <p><br>I won't feel for either one of them cos they are paid a lot of money as players and Gerrard had his chance to go to Chelsea few years back when Mourinho was still manager and even handed in a transfer request but last minute changed his mind due to Pool were willing to pay him more money after losing Owen...</p>
              <p>He opt for an easier life rather than a more conpetitive one at Chelsea... Therefore, I feel if he ends up without a league winners medal... He only have himself to blame for taking an easy way out rather than joint the elite at Chelsea and risk losing out to a group of good players...</p>
              <p>Forget about the argument that he was being loyal to Liverpool... If he really was, handling in a transfer request isn't the way to show it... He was looking out for himself as much as anyone around... A comparable pay to the offered he received from the Blues and a comfortable surroundings kept him from going...  </p>
              <p>The only few players that comes to mind I would qualify as loyal is, Ryan Giggs, Solskjaer, and some of the old gunners... Matthew Le Tissier was also one more... He turned down bigger money and bigger clubs to stay at Southampton all his career... This I guess cannot be match by many other players...</p>

              <h1 class="main-headline">Rafa - Johnson OG changed game</h1>
              <h3>But Reds boss felt Gerrard was denied first-half penalty</h3>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><img src="http://img.skysports.com/09/12/218x298/Rafael-Benitez-Liverpool-Premier-League_2396763.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="298"></p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"> </p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"> </p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Rafa Benitez conceded Glen Johnson's own-goal paved the way for Liverpool's demise to Arsenal on Sunday. It was the second time in a week that the Kop faithful had witnessed their side surrender a lead after the Gunners came back to pile more misery on the Reds, as they suffered their sixth league defeat of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool's dire week began in awful fashion as their UEFA Champions League campaign came to a sorry end when Fiorentina secured a 2-1 win on Wednesday. And Sunday's identical score-line was the first time since Robert Pires' winner for Arsenal in 2003 that the Reds relinquished a lead in the league on home soil.</p>
              <p>The Reds were 1-0 up through Dirk Kuyt's strike at and seemingly cruising going into the interval, but the Merseysiders crumbled in the second-half as <span style="color: #000000;">Andrey Arshavin</span><span style="color: #000000;"><span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon  lingo_icon_black" style="position: static; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; margin: 0pt; width: 12px; display: inline; background-repeat: no-repeat; float: none; height: 12px; visibility: visible; vertical-align: top; top: auto; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; left: auto; border: 0pt; padding: 0pt;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""></span> sealed the win with his fifth Anfield strike in two seasons after </span><span style="color: #000000;">Johnson</span><span style="color: #000000;"> put the ball in his own net.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Benitez's </span><span style="color: #000000;">side now trail fourth-placed </span><span style="color: #000000;">Aston Villa</span> by five points and are a serious doubt to regain their Champions League status, which according to former boss <span style="color: #000000;">Graeme Souness</span> would see them go into financial meltdown.</p>
              <h4>Positve</h4>
              <p>But Benitez was trying to focus on the positives and insists his side still stand a good chance of a top-four finish, so long as they play like they did in the first-half and not the second. "I think the own goal changed everything," the Spanish tactician told</p>
              <h4>Sky Sports</h4>
              <p>"The confidence changed and then we started making mistakes - we conceded the second goal too early too - but the first half was really, really good and we were very pleased and we thought it could be even better. "But the second-half changed and then they were playing with more confidence and we were playing with less confidence."</p>
              <p>Benitez did lament Liverpool's failure to get a first-half penalty when <span style="color: #000000;">Steven Gerrard</span> was sent tumbling by a clumsy William Gallas challenge in the 12th minute. "I think it was a penalty," said the Reds boss, whose team have now won just three times in their last 15 games.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't matter if the ball goes away because it at the end of the day it doesn't matter if you foul someone in the box - it's a penalty."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Must-win</h5>
              <p>Wigan are the next team up for Liverpool on Wednesday and Benitez knows his side must bounce back quickly. He added: "We know we have another important game on Wednesday, we have some players coming back so we have to keep working hard and be ready for the next game.</p>
              <p>And the Reds tactician still maintains his side are on course to qualify for the Champions League next term despite Sunday's reverse. "I think again top-four is the same target, it's a long way (until the season ends), we have to keep going, keep winning the games we can."</p>
