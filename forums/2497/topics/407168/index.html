              <p>Blackburn Rovers could be the latest Premier League club to fall into
              the hands of foreign owners, as Indian entrepreneur Ahasan Ali Syed has
              reportedly launched a £300 million bid to takeover the former Premier
              League champions.</p>
              <p>Syed is the head of Bahrain-Swiss based investment firm Western Gulf
              Advisory and has singled out Blackburn because of the club's potential
              for growth, according to a report in<em> the Telegraph</em> on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Blackburn
              won the Premier League in 1994-95 thanks to huge financial backing from
              Jack Walker, their much-loved former owner who died in 2000.</p>
              <p>And
              while the Walker estate has continued to retain control over the club,
              funds have recently been drying up and chairman John Williams has been
              actively seeking a buyer for the club for the past two years.</p>
              <p>Williams revealed on Wednesday: "There have been a number of interested parties for some time and discussions are ongoing.''</p>
              <p>Syed
              may well fit the bill and has reportedly made a formal approach to the
              club's financial advisers, Rothschild, offering to buy the club, pay
              off their outstanding debt and invest in the team.</p>
              <p>Originally
              from Hyderabad, Syed can trace his wealth back to the East India
              Company and is planning on using family funds channelled through
              Western Gulf Advisory (WGA) - believed to have assets close to £8
              billion - to finance a takeover at Blackburn.</p>
              <p>A sale could be
              completed as early a September, with Syed confident that he can
              transform Rovers from Premier League mediocrity into potential title
              challengers again.</p>
              <p>WGA have a non-disclosure agreement about the talks but a company spokeswoman told<em> The Sport Briefing:</em> "I can confirm that we made a formal approach to buy Blackburn Rovers.''</p>
              <p>He
              would start by clearing the debts of around £20 million, and around
              £300 million would then be available to improve the club's
              infrastructure in the long-term, as well as providing a sizeable
              transfer kitty to manager Sam Allardyce.</p>
              <p>But Syed's approach is
              likely to be more considered than that of Manchester City's Abu Shabi
              owners, with the Indian entrepreneur not looking to immediately splash
              the cash on superstars, but build up a team capable of competing for
              top honours in the future.</p>
