              <p><strong>No1: Kaka (AC Milan)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Milan’s hopes of becoming the first club to retain the Champions League largely rests on the shoulders of this brilliant Brazilian. As Kaka demonstrated against Manchester United last season, he has the ability to change a match in an instant. A master with the ball, the forward can score from any range and few would bet against him reaching a third final in four years</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No2: Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Where do you start with Ronaldo? The Portuguese star could land the European Golden Boot awarded despite playing most of the season on the right wing. Few questioned his talent but by adding an incredible scoring record to his game, the United ace has become virtually untouchable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No3: Ruud van Nistelrooy (Real Madrid)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Alex Ferguson usually gets it right on selling star players but did the Manchester United boss let Van Nistelrooy leave a little too early? The Dutch striker has continued his extraordinary scoring spree at Real Madrid. Now 31, this could be his best chance of winning the Champions League.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No4: Didier Drogba (Chelsea)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>It has been six weeks since Drogba last pulled on a Chelsea shirt and the Blues will be delighted to have him back from African Nations Cup duty. The Ivory Coast star has blossomed into a fearsome package of power, pace and skill with a scoring record to match. But can Avram Grant accommodate him and Nicolas Anelka in the same team?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No5: Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Inter Milan)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The Swedish ace is the tournament’s current joint-top scorer with Cristiano Ronaldo. The lanky forward has shrugged off his bad-boy tag to become one of the continent’s deadliest finishers. Ibrahimovic will be a key factor in whether Inter can enjoy European as well as domestic success</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No6: Lionel Messi (Barcelona)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Have we finally found the genuine heir to Diego Maradona? The Argentina star has excelled again this season, adding an impressive number of goals to his fearsome attacking threat. With Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto’o misfiring, Messi has often saved Barca single-handedly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No7: Emmanuel Adebayor (Arsenal)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The surprise package of the season. Adebayor has eased into the void left by Thierry Henry with a superb scoring spree this term. His power and pace alone will trouble any defence. Yet, the Togo hitman has not scored during this Champions League campaign. Gunners fans will be praying his heroics are not restricted to the Premier League.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No8: Fernando Torres (Liverpool)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The Spanish striker is lumbered with saving Liverpool’s season and Rafa Benitez’s job – no pressure, then. Torres has been a rare shining light in the Reds’ poor season. He undoubtedly has the talent but can he cope with the spotlight in his first ever Champions League knockout clash?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No9: Wayne Rooney (Manchester United)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The England star is not – and may never be – an out-and-out scorer but that is exactly why Europe’s top sides fear him. Rooney’s habit off dropping deep to trigger United attacks can lead to devastating results. And he has a superb talent for producing sensational goals from nowhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>No10: Ronaldinho (Barcelona)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The Brazilian master has been criticised left, right and centre after being accused of shedding his form and piling on the pounds. But there is little doubt that Ronaldinho still possesses that magic that has tormented defences across Europe. Opponents would be foolish to write him off just yet</p>
