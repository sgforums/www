              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Arsène Wenger" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsene-wenger"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsène Wenger</strong></span></a><strong> has admitted that Robin van Persie's long-term ankle injury will force him to search for a replacement striker during the January </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Transfer window" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/transfer-window"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>transfer window</strong></span></a><strong>. The </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Arsenal" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong> manager , who is generally wary of the mid-season window, associating it with desperate measures, said he would only do business if any deal were viable. But for the first time since the full extent of Van Persie's injury became clear, he conceded that it had affected his thinking.</strong></p>
              <p>"It has to," he said. "It has to because I didn't feel we were in the need to buy anybody, but we will be out on the market, that is for sure. But we will only make a decision if it suits us." Wenger's words will be welcomed by many of the club's supporters who saw him sell Emmanuel Adebayor to Manchester City over the summer but choose not to replace him. He instead put his faith in Van Persie, Nicklas Bendtner, Eduardo da Silva and Carlos Vela. All four, though, have suffered injuries, with Van Persie's the most demoralising.</p>
              <p>Van Persie was hurt while playing for Holland against Italy last month following a challenge from Giorgio Chiellini, the motives of which Wenger has now questioned. "I watched the tackle of Chiellini again; it looked anonymous but it's not as anonymous as it looks at the start and in between [the Holland forward] Dirk Kuyt has come out and said that they were kicked by the Italians," Wenger said. "In such an important season for us we lose players in friendlies on tackles like that and it is really difficult to accept." Chiellini has denied any malicious intent.</p>
              <p>Van Persie was diagnosed by the Dutch FA's doctors to have suffered a partial ligament tear but after further tests by Arsenal's medics, the ligaments were revealed to have been severed. He has been ruled out for five months, virtually the remainder of the domestic season.</p>
              <p>Bendtner, who has not played since the beginning of last month because of groin surgery, is not expected to return until Christmas at the earliest.</p>
              <p>Wenger's interest in the Bordeaux striker Marouane Chamakh is well documented, although a January deal appears unlikely. His other targets include André-Pierre Gignac of Toulouse, Milan's Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Mario Balotelli of Internazionale. Sampdoria's Giampaolo Pazzini is another Serie A striker on Wenger's radar.</p>
              <p>Arsenal face Manchester City at Eastlands in the <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Carling Cup" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlingcup"><span style="color: #005689;">Carling Cup</span></a> quarter-final tonight and because of injuries, Wenger's team will be even more experimental than that which beat Liverpool in the previous round. The 17-year-old midfielder Jack Wilshere, a loan target for Celtic, will start.</p>

              <p><abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/clubs/arsenal">Arsenal</a></abbr> boss <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/players/arsene-wenger">Arsene Wenger</a></abbr> admits he's fed-up with the treatment of his club by national FA's.</p>
              <p>Wenger has lost the likes of Nicklas Bendtner, Theo Walcott and <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/players/robin-van-persie">Robin van Persie</a></abbr> to injury while on international duty.</p>
              <p>"We will not accept that situation to go on like that," Wenger told <em><abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/clubs/arsenal">Arsenal</a></abbr> TV Online</em>.</p>
              <p>"A player like (Abou) Diaby goes away and is injured and you cannot
              even get him back because they (France) decided to keep him. They knew
              from the first day on that he would never play for them but they didn't
              want to call another player up. So they decided to keep him and make
              everybody think he would play.</p>
              <p>"The result? He comes back; the next day tries to have a little
              run and gets a setback and we have to deal with the consequences. It is
              disrespectful to the clubs, and it is not acceptable for the clubs. We
              pay the wages.</p>
              <p>"For political reasons they keep the players in the squad and
              we have not a say, how can that work? Three days later you have to play
              a game and you have to win it. They don't care.</p>
              <p>"Something has to change in there."</p>
              <p>Wenger added: "In every other sport it is the club who decides
              if the player stays in the national team when he is injured. Only in
              our sport it is the federation who decides to keep the player if they
              want to keep the player. Why?</p>
              <p>"That means they decide they are in a better situation to treat
              the player than you. Then they have to pay the player at the end of the
              month. Then they can decide, that would be logical. But you can do
              nothing because they have the rule in their favour."</p>
              <p>it seems this chicken/egg thingy is never going to go away.</p>

The Gunners' boss is ready to smash their transfer record to sign the powerful Bosnia international next month. And he is praying bitter rivals Manchester United can do him a favour by dumping the German club out of the Champions League next week. </h2>
              <p class="article">Wenger has vowed to splash out on a proven goal-poacher, after top-scorer Robin van Persie was ruled out for four months by ankle trouble. And Dzeko, 23, has shot to the top of his wanted-list, having blasted rank outsiders Wolfsburg to the German championship against the odds last season with 36 goals </p>
              <p class="article">He has hit another 13 in the current campaign. Wenger, whose young team was overwhelmed by Chelsea on Sunday, is prepared to top the £12m he forked out on Andrey Arshavin last January. </p>
              <p class="article">At more than 6ft 3in, current German Footballer of the Year Dzeko is the powerful attack leader Wenger has been seeking since selling Emmanuel Adebayor to Manchester City back in July. </p>
              <p class="article">He only signed a new four-year deal in the summer. But the Germans may have to cash in on their hottest property if they lose to United and miss out on the next round of the Champions League. </p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal have already agreed a £1.6m deal to sign 17-year-old Brazilian wonderkid Zezinho from Juventude.</p>

              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says United pulled the plug on their deal to sign
              Partizan Belgrade youngster Adem Ljajic to free up funds in January's
              transfer window.</p>
              <p>With Antonio <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Valencia</span></abbr> impressing on the right for United and Gabriel Obertan able to operate
              on both flanks, Fergie decided he did not need more cover in the same
              position.</p>
              <p>The money saved from the potential deal will free up funds for
              Fergie to buy a striker to complement Wayne Rooney, Dimitar Berbatov
              and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Michael Owen</span></abbr>.</p>

              <p>Personally, I don't think they needed to do this even if they were truly interested in signing this guy...</p>
              <p>Its just that they have second thoughts about signing the player after monitoring his progress these last 12 months... It's like sometime we want to buy something on the spot then after a while, we might have second thoughts of going back to actually buy it kind of stuff...</p>
              <p>I think they have just decided not to follow up on their interest and nothing else... If he was really very good, even $12m also they will sign him. But having seen the slow to catch up Tosic having problems getting use to the Premier League... It might have given them something to think about with this other guy thats all... So to play safe, don't buy now.</p>
