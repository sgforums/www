              <p><em>Mourinho, put himself in the frame for Fergie's job at United.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h1>'If you want me to rule out being Man United manager I can’t'</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>JOSE MOURINHO has sensationally put himself in the frame to become the next manager of Manchester United.</h3>
              <p>The former Chelsea boss admits he expects to be considered when Sir Alex Ferguson finally quits Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Mourinho, who takes on Fergie when his Inter Milan side face United in the Champions League this week, rates himself as “one of the best managers in the world.” And he reckons United will be unable to ignore his credentials when they begin the search for Fergie’s successor.</p>
              <p>Mourinho’s gift for self-promotion has never been stronger as he claimed: “I have big jobs left in me that is for sure — but I can’t commit to which ones. “If you want me to rule out ever being Manchester United manager I can’t. Special clubs need special managers so in theory it could work, but nobody knows what the future is in football.</p>
              <p>“The England national team wanted me as coach and that is the biggest job in England, so I am sure when Sir Alex retires they will look at the best managers in the world and I certainly fall into that category.</p>
              <h4>Continue</h4>
              <p>“How much time I can’t say, Sir Alex doesn’t look like he is ready to stop. But when you are managing a winning team you don’t want to stop — and if you have health then there is no reason to.”</p>
              <p>Opinion is mixed over Mourinho’s claims to become United manager. Rio Ferdinand has nominated the Portuguese as the best candidate to take over from Fergie — but United legends Sir Bobby Charlton and Bryan Robson believe his brand of football would not be to everyone’s taste.</p>
              <p>There is no immediate sign of Sir Alex stepping down from his role as United boss. At 67, he claims his health is good enough to enable him to continue in the job, despite previous suggestions that he would quit in May 2010. Fergie insisted this week: “You might have to carry me out. I’m not even thinking about retiring.”</p>
              <p>Mourinho’s future at Inter was under scrutiny last week — even though his team are still clear leaders of Serie A. He has been involved in a running battle with the Italian media and told them on Friday: “In another 86 days I will leave Italy and go on holiday. Will I still be the coach of Inter? In football you never know.”</p>
