He was an excellent player and is now a good coach."<br><br>City are aiming for their seventh straight home league win and despite the heavy defeat by Chelsea, Eriksson's side would go third with a win.<br><br>Eriksson, however, remains guarded about whether Sweden's Andreas Isaksson will retain his place between the posts and keep out Joe Hart.<br><br>"They are both good goalkeepers who deserve to play," said the City boss. "I have not made my mind up.<br><br>"While Joe did not play at Bolton it had nothing to do with the Chelsea result. We had decided before that game to change goalkeepers for the cup game."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree....it used to be six but they sort of want to level the playing field since big clubs got more back ups so became five.<br><br>considering not everyone is as gungho as neil warnock in not fielding a gk sub, you only got 4 outfield players to fill the bench....and smaller clubs now got bigger squads too...so  subs doesn't help anyone anymore....</div>
