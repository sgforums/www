              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">JOHN TERRY goes into today's FA Cup final filled with fury after Claude Makelele accused him of getting Jose Mourinho the sack. </h2>
              <p class="article">The Chelsea captain has always fiercely denied any part in forcing out Blues' most successful manager. But Makelele has reopened the wounds in his biography, claiming an amazing show of player power cost Mourinho his job - despite the 'Special One' landing five trophies in three years at Chelsea. </p>
              <p class="article">As Terry prepared to lead out Chelsea in today's Wembley showpiece, Makelele's accusations will have provoked a furious reaction. In his book called 'Claude Makelele - quite simply', the Stamford Bridge cult hero, a Chelsea regular for five years, reveals he was told of Mourinho's sacking in a phone call from team-mate Didier Drogba. </p>
              <p class="article">He claims: "I thought Mourinho was practically untouchable - the next morning at training it was chaos." Makelele asked physical trainer Rui Faria if everything was OK only to be told the rumours were true and Mourinho had been fired. </p>
              <p class="article">"I asked why and he explained a lot of players had complained about him, notably John Terry." Makelele claims Terry had been told by Jose he was on the bench to give him time to recover from a back operation. Terry did not want to be a sub and insisted he was OK to play. But the Chelsea boss stuck by his guns to drop him. </p>
              <p class="article">Makelele adds in his book, released this week: "War had been declared. For John, this was treason. He believed, rightly in my opinion, that in giving his all in the second half of the previous season, even though he was in great pain, he deserved more playing time in order to find his optimum level." </p>
              <p class="article">Makelele, now at Paris St Germain, also suggests Mourinho could have engineered the showdown because he wanted to end his stay at Chelsea. </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/29/article-0-028805850000044D-166_468x468.jpg" alt="Chelsea's John Terry (R) congratulates Claude Makelele" width="468" height="468"></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>Such is Terry's stature at Chelsea, Makelele rated his position as untouchable. He added: "Mourinho knew, so why take such a risk? Because he'd had enough and was looking for a way out?"</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Makelele alleges Terry let Peter Kenyon know he was unhappy and that there was even talk of a move from Chelsea. Makelele said: "Roman Abramovich reacted immediately, the departure of Terry was totally unimaginable and Mourinho was asked to pack his bags." </p>
              <p class="article">A spokesman for Terry said last night: "We have been informed that in a book by Claude Makelele it has been claimed that John was in some way involved with the removal of Jose Mourinho as manager of the club. </p>
              <p class="article">"This is categorically untrue. There is no foundation in this allegation. "We also confirm John has never asked to be transferred from Chelsea. He has asked lawyers to look at any further comments in this book."</p>

              <p>I think there is more to this story than just wanting to sell books...  I believed it could be true cos during that time Jose was saked, I recalled the Press did mentioned some players were unhappy with him and only Lampard and Drogba was really sad to see him go...</p>
              <p>It was also reported 4 players were happy to see him leave as well... And Terry was one of the four, the other 3 mentioned are Ballack, Shevchenko and J Cole... The rest didn't bother too much and started playing again under Grant...</p>
              <p>It happen right after their embarrassing 1-1 draw with Rosenborg... This was how it was reported...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Tuesday, 7:11pm, the home dressing room. Chelsea’s squad of 18 are called out for their pre-match warm up. All the players step out for the carefully prepared drill - except one. John Terry remains sitting where he is. One of Jose Mourinho’s assistants urges Terry out. Chelsea’s captain refuses, swears, and, according to an eye witness, says he is upset and has ‘things on my mind’. Terry is said to be furious after finding out that Mourinho had been asking in Chelsea’s treatment room whether there was a medical reason for his perceived loss of form over recent weeks. The stand-off continues until a team-mate cajoles his friend out on to the pitch.</p>
              <p>The game starts, Chelsea quickly lose a goal at a free kick as Miika Koppinen stretches ahead of Terry to turn in a near-post cross. Chelsea go in at half time 1-0 down and Jose Mourinho takes his captain to task, blaming the defender for the deficit. Terry says nothing but all his team-mates can see the anger on his face.</p>
              <p>The pair had once been the closest of footballing allies, but within 24 hours Mourinho is no longer Terry’s manager as Chelsea agree to a £10.5million pay-off to rid themselves of a man they describe as ‘the most successful manager the club has known’.</p>
              <p>‘The relationship broke down not because of one detail or because of something that happened at a certain moment. It broke down over a period of time.’ - Jose Mourinho, 21 September 2007.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But whateve it is... if its not true, we see if Terry will dare start legal action to prove it or just say, say only but don't dare to follow up with it as Claude Makelele may be able to prove his claims in his autobiography in an open court...</p>

              <p>As Carlo Ancelotti prepares to take over as manager, Terry’s former team-mate Claude Makelele claims in his new autobiography, published in France, that a transfer request from the skipper led to Jose Mourinho’s departure in September 2007.</p>
              <p>The England captain issued denials last night through his legal representatives, who said: ‘We have been informed this evening that in a book by former Chelsea player Claude Makelele it has been claimed that John was in some way involved with the removal of Jose Mourinho.</p>
              <p>‘We also confirm (should it need confirming) that John has never asked to be transferred from Chelsea. John has instructed lawyers to look at any further <br>comments in this book and at any further publication of untrue allegations that may be reported from it.’</p>
              <p><br><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/29/article-0-0522ED53000005DC-582_468x286.jpg" alt="Jose Mourinho, the Chelsea manager, consoles his captain John Terry" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Strained relations? Mourinho and Terry</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From Makelele's autobiography:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Makelele writes that on hearing he was going to be dropped by Mourinho, Terry went to Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon to voice his discontent and demand a transfer.</p>
              <p>Makelele writes: ‘John, who didn’t want to be a sub, let it be known that he was OK to play on. Mourinho insisted. He told him (Terry) his level of performance was suffering because of his back performance was suffering because of his back problems and repeated clearly that he would be replaced until told otherwise. He even pointed out that the central defence from now on would be Ricardo Carvalho and Alex. War had been declared.</p>
              <p>‘For John this was treason. He believed — rightly so in my opinion — that in giving <br>his all in the second half of the previous season, even though he was in great pain, he deserved a bit more playing time to find his optimum playing level.</p>
              <p>Mourinho had provoked a “clash” too far. If there is one person who is untouchable at Chelsea then it is John. And Mourinho knew. So why take such a risk? Because he’d had enough and was looking for a way out?</p>
              <p>‘When John Terry let his discontent be known to Kenyon and asked him for an immediate transfer, Abramovich reacted immediately. The departure of Terry was <br>totally unimaginable. Mourinho was asked to pack his bags.’</p>
              <p>Faced with a choice of either losing their talismanic captain or their flamboyant manager, Makelele, now with Paris Saint-Germain, insists that billionaire owner Roman Abramovich reacted by axing title-winning boss Mourinho, sparking the <br>managerial musical chairs at The Bridge.</p>
              <p>Recalling the departure of Mourinho two years ago, Makelele adds: ‘Rui [Faria] — our physical trainer — explained that a lot of players had complained about Mourinho, notably John Terry.’</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Makelele’s claims will come as a huge embarrassment to Chelsea and Terry as they today try to win their first trophy since the 2007 FA Cup, when Mourinho was in charge.</p>
              <p>Chelsea maintained that Mourinho’s departure was by ‘mutual consent’ despite handing him a huge compensation package.</p>

              <p>Terry did not want to be a sub and insisted he was OK to play. But the Chelsea boss stuck by his guns to drop him.</p>
              <p>Makelele adds in his book, released this week: "War had been
              declared. For John, this was treason. He believed, rightly in my
              opinion, that in giving his all in the second half of the previous
              season, even though he was in great pain, he deserved more playing time
              in order to find his optimum level."</p>
              <p>Makelele, now at Paris St Germain, also suggests Mourinho could
              have engineered the showdown because he wanted to end his stay at
              Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Such is Terry's stature at Chelsea, Makelele rated his position as untouchable.</p>
              <p>He added: "Mourinho knew, so why take such a risk? Because he'd had enough and was looking for a way out?"</p>
              <p>Makelele alleges Terry let Peter Kenyon know he was unhappy and that there was even talk of a move from Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Makelele said: "Roman Abramovich reacted immediately, the
              departure of Terry was totally unimaginable and Mourinho was asked to
              pack his bags."</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Terry told <em>The Sun</em>: "We have been
              informed that in a book by Claude Makelele it has been claimed that
              John was in some way involved with the removal of Jose Mourinho as
              manager of the club.</p>
              <p>"This is categorically untrue. There is no foundation in this allegation.</p>
              <p>"We also confirm John has never asked to be transferred from
              Chelsea. He has asked lawyers to look at any further comments in this
              book."</p>

              <h1>Terry baffled by 'bizarre' Mak claims</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"></span></p><blockquote>
              <p>"Funnily enough, Mourinho
              called me on Friday and we spoke about it," said Terry. "It's bizarre,
              actually, because he knows the real truth and, if anything, I was one
              of three players phoning Roman at 1am or 2am the night I heard he'd
              been sacked, to keep him on.</p>
              <p>"I was speaking to Peter Kenyon, speaking to Roman, speaking to Eugene (Tenenbaum) and hoping we could keep him.</p>
              <p>"Myself, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba were all fighting to
              keep him at two in the morning. So it's bizarre where it's come from.</p>
              <p>"Me and Jose know the truth. It's bizarre that Maka has put
              this in his book, but I tried to call him Friday night and his phone
              was off. I'm sure I'll make contact in the next few days.</p>
              <p>"Jose texted me and I called him straight back, and we spoke
              about the situation. We know what happened, the relationship between
              him and the football club. They parted on mutual terms."</p>

              <h2>MAKALELE HAS POP AT JOSE</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/03/240/claudemakelele_2063002.jpg" border="0" alt="Makelele: Questioning methods"></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Claude Makelele has lifted the lid on Jose Mourinho's tenure at Chelsea, and has not been complimentary.</strong> </p>
              <p>The French midfielder, who is now on the books of Paris St Germain, spent five years at Stamford Bridge between 2003 and 2008. He was taken to England by Claudio Ranieri, but played under the Italian for just one season before he was unceremoniously sacked. </p>
              <p>Mourinho, fresh from helping Porto win the UEFA Champions League, was appointed in his place and quickly made his mark upon his arrival with the Blues. </p>
              <p>He enjoyed considerable success throughout his first two seasons at the club, but saw his relationship with his players and the Chelsea hierarchy begin to unravel when his philosophies were questioned. </p>
              <p>"For two years at Chelsea we lived as a group of friends, dining together, getting drunk together, going to training together and winning matches together," Makelele writes in his autobiography <em>Tout Simplement</em>. </p>
              <p>"Between 2004 and 2006 the solidarity in the Chelsea camp was amazing. Mourinho then broke all that when he banned key elements and treated certain players as 'stars'. </p>
              <p>"Very early on in the 2006/07 season, Mourinho took a step back from his players. In that one day, the brotherhood spirit that had gathered us around him was harmed. </p>
              <p>"Then he had a bust-up with (Roman) Abramovich. The chairman asked the players to express themselves more freely on the pitch, but Mourinho stubbornly refused to change his methods. </p>
              <p>"A relationship at the top of the club was broken and the players began to feel it. "During that third complete season under his control, I was stunned to see how Mourinho forget the value of his players and claimed all the credit for the results. </p>
              <p>"To him, individuals didn't make the team work well, his methods did. At the end we felt that he was in danger as soon as a player was under the spotlight more than him."</p>
