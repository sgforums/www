              <h1>Bebe blunder! Manchester United could have had £7.4m signing for £125k<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden"></div>
              <p>Manchester United could have signed Portuguese striker Bebe for as little as £125,000 last January, it was claimed last night.</p>
              <p>United
               manager Sir Alex Ferguson shocked the football world three weeks ago by
               sanctioning a £7.4million deal for a 20-year-old he had never even seen
               play on TV.</p>
              <p>Bebe has not played competitive football at a level higher than the Portuguese third<br>division and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> can now reveal that his former club Estrela da Amadora touted him 
              around Europe for just 150,000 euros as they desperately sought cash to<br>stave off a winding-up order.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              Trafford last month for £7.4million - but United could have snapped him

              </div>
              <p>Former Estrela coach Jorge Paxaio told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> last night: ‘Last season we had<br>no money at all. We were trying to transfer Bebe to other clubs. We had to raise money<br>desperately. We told everyone in England and in Europe: “For 150,000 Euros you can<br>have
               him”. We couldn’t get anybody interested. Nobody trusted him. None of 
              the clubs were interested because he had never played at a high level.</p>
              <p>‘I
               was surprised with the sudden way it happened with United. I was hoping
               he would move to a bigger club in Portugal or to a medium-sized club in
               Europe. I didn’t expect Manchester United.’</p>

              </div>
              <p>Bebe grew up and lived in a homeless shelter outside Lisbon until he 
              tore up his contract with Estrela and moved to Portuguese Premier League
               club Guimaraes on a free transfer in the summer.</p>
              <p>Last season he earned £12,000 a year at Estrela, the same amount he now earns at United in a week.</p>
              <p>Last
               night, Bebe’s former agent Goncalo Reis said: ‘Bebe would have been 
              very cheap during last season and then we tore up the contract because 
              he wasn’t being paid by Estrela and so then he was free.</p>

              <p>‘A scout from United could have contacted me or the club last
              season. There was no secret. But I understand that the United scout
              just saw certain games in Portugal and only realised Bebe was a great
              player when he saw some pre-season games involving Guimaraes.</p>
              <p>‘If they had looked wider they would have seen him earlier and paid very little. But everyone was the same.’</p>
              <p>Bebe
               is back in Portugal this week after being selected for the Under 21 
              squad for the first time. He could face England tomorrow night.</p>
              <p>Coach Paxaio added: ‘Having said this, Manchester United have signed an extraordinary player.’</p>

              <p>United fans last night claimed a significant victory over the Glazer 
              family after it was confirmed that the club have failed to sell their 
              full allocation of season tickets for the first time in years.</p>
              <p>United
               have fallen 2,200 tickets short of their 54,000 target, although chief 
              executive David Gill claimed the figure was still ‘pretty good’ in the 
              economic climate.</p>
              <p>Owen Hargreaves has been included in United’s 25-man squad for the Premier League despite his ongoing knee problems.</p>

And who knows, the market value might be much higher by then as it keeps going up this past few years. Therefore, it's very unlikely...

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>New boy: Manchester United raised eyebrows by plucking Bebe from obscurity - but those who know him say Reds fans are in for a treat</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Manchester</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> United’s new £7.5million forward Bebe flew from </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">England</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> to </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Lisbon</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> with his Old Trafford team-mate Nani on Sunday morning, following his first call-up to the </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Portugal</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> Under 21 squad.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Nani continued his journey north to meet up with his country’s full squad near </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Porto</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Bebe, however, took a taxi to the remote southern </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">village</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> of </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Santo Antao</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> do Tojal and spent the night at the homeless shelter that was his home until just two months ago. Bebe, a man of 20, wanted to sleep among his friends at the Casa do Gaiato for one last time before his life changed forever. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘He came and had lunch here with me and my wife and children,’ the shelter’s director, Jose Joao, told <span style="font-style: italic;"><em>Sportsmail </em></span>this week. ‘He shook hands with every single person here. He thanked them. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘He spent the night here and the next morning someone from the Football Federation picked him up. I think he wanted to say goodbye properly. He lived here with us for eight years. He knows that without this place he would have been just another lost kid.’ </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Owned and funded by the Catholic church for 62 years, Casa do Gaiato sits in generous, if rudimentary, grounds some 20 kilometres outside </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Lisbon</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">. It is currently home to 80 young males between the ages of four and 25. It is here that Bebe learned to read and write. Here, on a dusty pitch, that he learned to play football. Others from the shelter have made good, too. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘We’ve had teachers, lawyers and businessmen emerge from here,’ smiled Joao. ‘We even had an actor. But this is the first one like Bebe.’ Bebe’s journey from the third division of Portuguese football to the Barclays Premier League  is one of the more remarkable sporting stories of recent years. Just as inspiring is the fact that he reached adulthood at all.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Abandoned as a young child by his father Francisco and his mother Deolinda, Bebe — christened Tiago Manuel Dias Correia — was being raised by his grandmother in a rough </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Lisbon</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> suburb when a court order delivered him into the care of the church at the age of 12. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Joao explained: ‘He was in danger. Kids in that area were locked into street life. Bebe was about to enter oblivion. He came here and had virtually no schooling. But we have looked after him and raised him and now football has made him a man. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt;"><br><br></span></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘At the end of last season when Guimaraes [of </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Portugal</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">’s Premier League] signed him he told me he did not want to go, to leave the shelter.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘I told him he had to go, that he had to make something of his life. Bebe cried and said: ‘‘You are trying to get rid of me’’. But I told him it was time to go, that it was time for his life to begin for real. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘Even in the summer, when he was at a pre-season training camp with Guimaraes, he would come here to sleep if he had a day off. It was 200km away but he came anyway.’ </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Given his background and his obvious dependency on his friends and mentors at the shelter, it is tempting to wonder just how Bebe will cope in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Manchester</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">. There will be no comforting trips ‘home’. His private bedroom — at one end of a 15-bed dormitory — was given to him a year ago as a sign of his seniority. Now, it belongs to somebody else.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘There are concerns but we feel he is going to the right club,’ said Joao. ‘In </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Manchester</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> he will be OK. We think his grandmother may travel there to be with him. We hope so. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘We have heard about Sir Alex Ferguson. He is a leader and that is what Bebe needs. He is tall and strong now but he is just a kid. He needs to be loved.’ </span></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Bebe’s grandmother, Ilda Romana, has attempted to provide some stability over the course of his difficult young life. He has ‘senhorinha’ — little lady — tattooed on his arm.

His father has disappeared.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Recommended to the amateur club Loures, local to the shelter, four years ago, Bebe played there for two years before a 16,000 euros move to Estrela da Amadora in downtown </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Lisbon</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">After two seasons in the club’s junior teams, his form in Portugal’s semi-professional division three last season led him to Guimaraes and then — without playing a competitive game for them — to United. In </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> — on a wage of £12,000 a week — life will certainly be different. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Here in the hot, dusty Portuguese countryside, a daily routine of prayer, schoolwork and discipline has shaped him. He came here as an uneducated 12-year-old with poor prospects. He leaves with the chance to be the next  Manchester United superstar.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The car park of the Estadio Jose Gomes in the poor Reboleira suburb of </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Lisbon</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> is littered with used condoms and drugs paraphernalia.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Inside the tiny, rundown ground, weeds poke through the tarmac. This is where, just four months ago, the young forward they call Bebe played his last competitive game of football for Estrela da Amadora. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">He walked out five games before the end of last season because the club — now about to go bankrupt — could not afford to pay his 300-euro weekly wage. Jorge Paxaio was Estrela’s coach last season. He learned of Bebe’s transfer to </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> early last month when the forward sent him a ‘thank you’ text message.</span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘Manchester United are getting a truly remarkable kid,’ said the likeable Paxaio, smiling as he spoke to <span style="font-style: italic;"><em>Sportsmail</em></span>. ‘Remember that until he was 16 he was just playing with his friends. He has developed incredibly quickly. The first time he plays for United — and I am sure he will make it there — people will notice him because he is different. He has skills that not many players in that League have. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘He is also physically imposing. He will be like [Cristiano] Ronaldo in that point of view. But you will have to wait for him to be ready. I don’t just mean in football terms, but mentally. </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"><span style="font-size: small;">‘One day he had nothing and then the next day he had everything. That will be a shock to him, even if he hasn’t realised it yet. He was living in the shelter every day he was with us. He travelled in by public transport. He was like a child in that way.’ </span></span></span></p>

              </div>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Estrela were second in their division when Bebe stopped playing there. Without their tall, muscular forward, they lost their last five games and finished 10th. For much of the season, Bebe had been the only player getting paid. Eventually his wage was stopped, too.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Bebe’s agent of last season, Goncalo Reis, recalled: ‘His coach was always telling him that he had to do better as he was the only one that was being paid. ‘At 19, that was not fair. In the dressing-room he was the only one with the new shoes and the new shirt.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘His team-mates had children and wives and weren’t getting paid. It was hard for the kid but this pressure made him stronger. He coped with it. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘I think that will help him when he reaches Old Trafford. He will not be scared.’</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Certainly, life at Estrela was never straightforward for Bebe. United manager </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> suggested last week that his  new signing needs to develop physically, but there was little opportunity for that last season.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Coach Paxaio, now with another </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Lisbon</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> club, Mafra, revealed: ‘We used to have a gym and Bebe was in there often. But then one day the players turned up and all the equipment had gone. The club had sold it to pay off debts.</span></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘It will be a different world at United. I only had four staff, no dieticians or anything like that. Bebe used to eat his meals at the shelter so I couldn’t control what he was eating. He got food poisoning twice. But he was our diamond, our jewel. Our problem was that we didn’t have anyone else like him in the team.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘That was the way it was. I played two systems and both were used to get the best out of him.’</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As Bebe strides towards a new life, Estrela’s would appear to be coming to an end. Their failure to pay him towards the end of last season rendered a 1.2million euro buy-out clause in his contract worthless and he went to Guimaraes for free. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘It makes me sad,’ added Paxaio. ‘These things can only happen in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Portugal</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">. With that money Estrela would not be bankrupt. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘A good club is about to die. It is wrong. But I am happy for Bebe, even if he can be a rebel sometimes.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘I spoke to him many times. I told him that he had every chance of rising to the top but that he also had the risk of allowing himself to be dragged down. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘He could be irresponsible and things like that, but it was just due to his background. I told him it was as easy to become a professional footballer as it was to go on the streets to steal. I told him the choice was his. He made the right choice.’</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Urbane Goncalo Reis is the small-time football agent who has just seen the deal of a lifetime slip through his fingers. Sitting in the garden of the Lisbon Marriott Hotel this week, he stirred the ice in his Pepsi and lots of things went unsaid.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">What is known, though, is this. Until the end of Bebe’s time at Estrela da Amadora earlier this year, Reis represented him.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Having recognised his talent when he was a junior player, Reis used to buy Bebe his bus-passes to get him from the Casa do Gaiato shelter to training every day. Because it was a journey of two hours by bus, Reis would  sometimes take him in his car. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">He organised and paid for Bebe’s 18th birthday party and when he was selected for a Portugal Under 20 get-together Reis bought him new boots, clothes and luggage. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘I didn’t want him to look out of place and feel small,’ said Reis. Now Bebe is at Manchester United under the care and guidance of Portuguese super-agent Jorge Mendes. Reis is no longer involved.</span></span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">How Bebe came to change agents is not clear. Reis is vague on the matter and Mendes is not accused of breaking any rules.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Reis certainly knows Bebe better than most. He has, for example, always been welcomed by staff at Casa do Gaiato.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘The trip to training every day was not easy,’ he recalled. ‘It showed his dedication. ‘After training he would go to the shelter and help with the cleaning and things. They all pray at the end of the day. It’s an obligation.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘I don’t feel let down that I am not involved any more. That’s life. But I used to do a lot for him. All he has, I gave him.’</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Reis has read reports from </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> that Bebe has not yet been selected for United’s reserves. The implied criticism irritates him.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘It’s crazy that people say he is not good enough for the reserves,’ he said. ‘I know the qualities of Bebe and one day he will jump into the first team. It won’t be easy but he will get his space. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘He will not be as good as Ronaldo but will be better than Nani. Somewhere in between. But he will be humble and he will learn. He will be like a little boy with </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">. He will just wait for the orders. Then, one day, he will explode on the field.’ </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">If and when Bebe does make his impact, Reis’s only benefit will be an adrenaline shot to his pride. Is he angry?</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘I am moving on,’ he said. ‘I have some new boys. Hopefully I will find another Bebe.’</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Back at Casa do Gaiato, a skinny teenager kicks at the dust in his sandals and shorts. He loiters in the searing afternoon sun. His name is Adilson.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Once rated as a better young football prospect than Bebe, he also joined the junior ranks of the Estrela da Amadora club in </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Lisbon</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">. <br><br></span></span>
              </p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">For Adilson, though, the dream died. He never made it because he simply stopped growing. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">In the shelter he is safe and he is loved. Beyond that, though, his future is uncertain.</span></span></p>

              <p>There is still alot of time to judge him. Therefore, time will tell... And like i said, even at the worst possible case. He turns out to be a player totally cannot even sell which i find quite unbelievable since there are so many smaller clubs around. They still lose only $7.4m</p>
              <p>If you compare to some settled cases like paying $20m for a player than selling him back to the same club for half the price 5, 6 months later, that is a big loss, can certainly classified it as a big flop i belief... Or paying almost $20m for a player who hardly plays than loan him back after only one year with a clause to sell him back at a little lesser than 2/3 of his original fee, this is also another possible flop waiting to happen. Or there is another where paying $30m for a player past his best and having to pay his huge salary for the next few years while he plays for another club... These are major flop cases... Here it's only $7.4m so can hardly ever qualify as a major flop... And I am quite sure if given the odd league and fa cup appearance here and there for more exposure in the next 2, 3 yrs... Even if it don't works out, there could be smaller clubs queueing up to take him for $1m to $6m. So how to be a flop for such a small fee? At worse, just cut your losses lor correct or not?</p>

              <p>Errr... I think even if you were to combine all the players in S League, their combine total value might not even equal his transfer fee... Anyway, what a stupid comment.</p>
              <p>And it's very foolish for someone to ever consider Smalling as a flop so early in his career. Cos the kid is only 20 and has a long career ahead of him. And given that he is an English and already in the national team under 21, his value will only increase in time to come. His sale value was initially set at $7m but because of a certain Mr Wenger who himself is known to have an eye for bright young talent, it eventually became $10m with Smalling opting to join United rather than go with Wenger.</p>
              <p>The thing here is, if there was ever a flop proved player deals around, this is one of those that will be very close in that category... Cos we have already seen him play, and he is more than able to play for a mid or lower table club in the premiership even right now. So let's say after a few years of training and he still don't improve...  He will still have an after sale value given his age and the added incentive of being not just "home grown" but English. You never know if the FA, whom some have criticised will  work to improve on the ruling after watching Arsenal's 8 "home grown" and only 1 is English...  It could become 4 / 4 in the near future who knows...</p>
              <p>Anyway, of the 3 players Fergie bought, he is probably the least likely to turn out as a flop signing in my opinion cos of the conditions in his favour.</p>

              <p>hmm i don't know about smalling but he was stellar at fulham. He doesnt strike me in any way as a flop. But Bebe.....7.4m leh!! And what's the ratio of talent and money here.....possibly poles apart!</p>
              <p>Anyway, I don't trust Carlos Queiroz....he's a great assistant and that's all he should be.</p>

              <p>Errr... I think even if you were to combine all the players in S
              League, their combine total value might not even equal his transfer
              fee... Anyway, what a stupid comment.</p>
              <p>And it's very foolish for someone to ever consider Smalling as a
              flop so early in his career. Cos the kid is only 20 and has a long
              career ahead of him. And given that he is an English and already in
              the national team under 21, his value will only increase in time to
              come. His sale value was initially set at $7m but because
              of a certain Mr Wenger who himself is known to have an eye for
              bright young talent, it eventually became $10m with
              Smalling opting to join United rather than go
              with Wenger.</p>
              <p>The thing here is, if there was ever a flop proved player deals
              around, this is one of those that will be very close in that
              category... Cos we have already seen him play, and he is more
              than able to play for a mid or lower table club in the premiership
              even right now. So let's say after a few years of training and
              he still don't improve...  He will still have an after sale
              value given his age and the added incentive of being not
              just "home grown" but English. You never know if the FA, whom
              some have criticised will  work to improve on the ruling
              after watching Arsenal's 8 "home grown" and only 1 is
              English...  It could become 4 / 4 in the near future who
              knows...</p>
              <p>Anyway, of the 3 players Fergie bought, he is probably the least
              likely to turn out as a flop signing in my opinion cos of the
              conditions in his favour.</p>

              <p>I'm saying he could be a flop at man u not his whole career like forlan.</p>
              <p>if smalling don't improve at man u, it'll be hard for man u to sell him at anything close to the original price however overvalued english players maybe but it could be different if o'neill decides to be a club manager again...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Of course he could be if we put it like this. Hell, every player can be consider one if we use this as a benchmark. Just take a look at Ben Foster, is he a flop at United? In honesty, he never made it... You can say he improved by just a slight margin only... But he was bought for around $1m and sold for something like $5 or $6m. So how do we judge this? lol.</p>
              <p>I think had Smalling joint Arsenal, he would probably be playing in their first team already and Wenger probably won't go out and buy the other defender very close to the end of the transfer window as well cos Wenger is known to trust youngsters in his team like Clichy, Gibbs and remember even a player like Senderos...</p>
              <p>All I am saying is of the 3, he is the most unlikely and if there was one amongst them, then i would pick Bebe. But at $7.4m, it won't be that great a price to pay.</p>
