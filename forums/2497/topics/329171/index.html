              <p><strong>With mere hours left in
              the summer transfer window, which closes at midnight on September 1,
              the biggest news concerning the future of Dimitar Berbatov was not
              about a breakthrough in talks with Manchester United, but reports about
              an unexpected bid for Tottenham's disgruntled Bulgarian striker coming
              from Manchester City.</strong></p>
              <p>Former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who faces the
              prospects of his assets in Thailand being seized, has reportedly agreed
              to sell his stake in City to Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and
              Investment just a year after buying the club.</p>
              <p>It is believed that the "first instruction to the Blues was to try
              and lure Berbatov for a reputed £28 million [34.5 million euro],"
              Manchester Evening News newspaper reported. "The Blues may try and use
              Martin Petrov to persuade his international team-mate to come to City,"
              it went on to say.</p>
              <p>United has pursued Berbatov since the start of the summer, but their
              £20 million (24.7 million euro) valuation of the Bulgarian fell some
              £10 million (12.3 millino euro) short of what Spurs want. That bid has
              reportedly been raised to £25 million (30.8 million euro) since then
              and recent media reports have suggested that United's 20-year-old
              striker Fraizer Campbell could be made part of the deal.</p>
              <p>Despite the late bid, it appears unlikely that Berbatov will settle
              for a move to another team playing in the Uefa Cup, having described a
              transfer to United and playing in the Champions league as "a dream".</p>
              <p>"The audacious move is bound to rile United, even if Berbatov goes to Old Trafford as expected," Manchester Evening News said.</p>

              <p>Wooo latest! Berbatov at Carrington talking to SAF now!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Berbatov 'in talks' with United</h2>
              <p><span><strong><em>Sky Sports News</em> understands that Dimitar Berbatov is currently holding talks with
                                      Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.</strong></span></p>
              <p>A tug-of-war is developing for the Bulgaria international's
                                      services with Manchester City having seen a shock deadline day bid
                                      in excess of £30million accepted by Tottenham.</p>
              <p>The Spurs striker has been tracked by the Premier League and
                                      European champions throughout the summer and has previously
                                      intimated that a move to Old Trafford is his 'dream'.</p>
              <p>City stunned the football world with their audacious late
                                      approach, but United remain very much in the equation.</p>
              <p><span>Mark Hughes has told <em>Sky Sports News</em> that he hopes to meet Berbatov later in the day, but Ferguson is
                                      already sitting down with the talented forward at the club's
                                      Carrington training ground.</span></p>
              <p>Berbatov has been left out of Juande Ramos' plans for the club's
                                      last two matches, with the coach feeling his presence was a
                                      disruptive influence on the rest of the squad.</p>
              <p>Ramos admitted earlier in the day he wanted the saga to be
                                      resolved one way or another, and has targets in mind to replace the
                                      Bulgarian.</p>
              <p>To add further confusion to the saga, reports from Spain suggest
                                      that Real Madrid are planning to make a €45million (£36.5million)
                                      bid for his services.</p>

              <p>ya..  Real should get him for 36m.. afterall 36m is peanuts for Real, even more so if they manage to sell Robinho for 28m..</p>
              <p>and serves ManU right if Real eventually get Berbatov, they have been hanging on to this transfer for far too long and its just a matter of time before someone comes along and buy over the only transfer ManU had been trying to get over the entire summer...</p>
