              <p>We can reveal the 30-year-old Chelsea midfielder is dating gorgeous Saskia Boxford, daughter of a wealthy financier. </p>
              <p>Multi-millionaire Lamps had a series of dates with his new 23-year-old girlfriend last week. The pair partied in clubs until the early hours and enjoyed an intimate dinner together—ending up back at Saskia’s west London flat. </p>
              <p>They got together weeks after the Stamford Bridge idol’s ex-lover Elen Rives, mother of his two daughters, showed him the red card. </p>

              <p><strong>Lampard—who twice cheated on former model Elen during a stormy seven-year relationship—has met Saskia several times over the last eight days.</strong> </p>
              <p>Hours after he’d scored for Chelsea last Saturday in their 2-1 win over Wigan, the player arrived alone at trendy Kensington restaurant Koi in an Audi at around 9pm. </p>
              <p>Shortly afterwards stunning Saskia joined him for dinner. The pair chatted intimately over their meal—but when they left later Lampard attempted some nifty footwork to put fans off the scent. </p>

              <p><strong>One witness said: “I saw him leave the restaurant on his own and get into an Audi. “Then a couple of minutes later the car appeared at the front of the restaurant.</strong> </p>
              <p>“I think it had driven around the block. It was bizarre and I wondered what was going on. “It didn’t take long to find out. As soon as it arrived a pretty girl nipped out of the restaurant and joined Frank in the back.” </p>

              <p><strong>The pair ended up partying at Raffles nightclub in Chelsea’s Kings Road before heading back to Saskia’s flat in west London in the early hours.</strong> </p>
              <p>Slim Saskia, who works for a fashion house in London, is an expert in design and attends all the launch parties for the latest trendy outlets. She obviously measures up pretty well in Frank’s eyes too. </p>
              <p>On Sunday afternoon, the Chelsea star was back to resume his love match—this time turning up at Saskia’s place in his £100,000 blue Ferrari. </p>

              <p>Fans saw them meet up with friends and spend the early evening there before going for dinner and then on to a club.</p>
              <h4>Bizarre</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“One of his pals got a cab and Frank and Saskia jumped in,” said an eye-witness. The couple ate at the nearby La Famiglia restaurant. A fellow diner told us: “They were obviously quite close, whispering in each other’s ears and gazing into each other’s eyes. Very lovey-dovey.” </p>

              <p><strong>They were picked up by a chauffeur-driven Merc with blacked out windows and when the car arrived at Boujis nightclub in Kensington, Lamps and Saskia went in separately.</strong> </p>
              <p>Saskia must certainly be a fun club date. She studied music at posh girls’ boarding school Roedean and in an interview with Tatler magazine six years ago she revealed: “Rap music turns me into a ghetto slag.” </p>
              <p>The sultry beauty has also done some modelling herself—and in 2005 she performed at a fashion show in aid fo UNICEF with Lisa B and Rosamund Pike. </p>
              <p>After partying the night away, Frank was spotted leaving Boujis in the early hours alone. The midfielder then went on to Saskia’s pad. Next morning Frank went to a club training session in Surrey while Saskia left for a flight to Paris for fashion week. </p>

              <p>She will spend her time looking after clients and dropping into top fashion outlets such as Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Christian Dior. Saskia’s father Michael, 66, is a successful businessman and a director of several companies. </p>
              <p>She has been pictured with her mother Pilar, 55, at a party for her designer Kara Ross at Selfridges and at Tramp for Tatler magazine and more recently attended an Oscar party bash in New York. </p>

              <p><strong>Former West Ham player Lampard—who was in action for Chelsea in their 2-0 FA Cup win at Coventry yesterday—had a chequered lovelife while he was with Elen.</strong> </p>

              <p><strong>In 2006, he bedded blonde driver Montserrat Lucas, 36, in Barcelona. The following year the News of the World caught him picking up a mystery brunette at a casino in Las Vegas only two months after his daughter Isla was born.</strong> </p>
              <p>The pair spent more than two hours alone together in a suite and he emerged with his arm around her at 2am. We watched as they strolled back to the gaming tables and he gave her an affectionate kiss goodnight on the cheek before heading off to find his pals. </p>
              <p>When we approached the girl she burst into tears saying: “He didn’t tell me he had a girlfriend and two daughters. This is terrible.” </p>

              <p><strong>The incident infuriated Elen who promptly gave back the engagement ring Lamps had given her in 2004. She later forgave him and the couple got back together. But fed-up Elen, 30, finally decided to call time on the relationship last month after a sunshine break in Florida with the children and a nanny.</strong> </p>
              <p>Lamps—worth an estimated £25 million—wanted to stay with her for the sake of the children but she insisted there was no way back. </p>
              <p>Elen has now moved into a new £3 million home in West London with their two daughters two-year-old Luna and one-year-old Isla. He has already put the family’s £8.5 million townhouse near the Stamford Bridge ground up for sale as he works out a settlement with Elen. </p>
              <p>Lamps, who suffered the heartache of losing his 58-year-old mother Pat to pneumonia last April, still dedicates his goals to her when he scores for Chelsea. </p>

              <p><strong>His spokesman, who confirmed the love split with Elen, said last month: “No one else is involved.” At the time a friend said: “It’s the saddest thing Elen’s ever had to do, but the love has gone. “She was the one who ended it and she’s the one who’s moving out.</strong></p>
              <p>Frank will continue to play a very active role in his children’s lives and see them every day. But he and Elen have grown apart. “The passion has gone out of their relationship. </p>
              <p>“There have been no huge rows—though obviously there were massive problems when he was splashed over the papers with other women.”</p>
