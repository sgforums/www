I have only slept a few hours and wake up every time hoping it has all been a bad dream,” said Terry.<br><br>“I walked forward to take the penalty knowing the game was there to be won and it was all down to me. What happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life. I have watched it again on TV and you can see I slipped – I still can’t believe it.</p>

              <p>I think that Steve McClaren made so many mistakes when he took over the England squad... Dropping Beckham, James, Cambell cos he consider them "old" and appointing Terry as captain made him a "big head"</p>
              <p>Look where he got them? Nowhere...</p>
              <p>Now Capello has brought back Beck, James and even Cambell i think in one of his earlier matches.</p>

              <p>Give terry armband no use one la. England didnt even qualify for the euro. If england did, then giving it to him may be justifiable as he will play very hard and focus 100%.</p>
              <p>Right now, giving it to gerrard is better as it will make terry fight very hardfor the armsband till the world cup 2010. (if terry is still in the england squad first 11 that is)</p>

              <p>Fabio Capello has mentioned he will rotate who wears the armband for a while before confirming who will be the captain. So I feel it is only fair that he lets Terry have a go. Terry is afterall a comitted player and cares for the team, whichever team it is that he plays for.</p>
              <p>How he responds to taking up the armband now will go a long way in showing the strength of his character and I believe Terry is one of the people who can do a good job. Even if he does not eventually get the Captaincy, I feel he is still a good player and good leader of men none-the-less.</p>
              <p>I feel Gerrard is as good a captain as Terry as both have the ability to lift the team and push them forward. And either would make a better captain than Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>Recently, who else has been considered for the captaincy?</p>

              <p>If it's Rooney then too bad for England. Of the other two I think Gerrard is a better choice.</p>
