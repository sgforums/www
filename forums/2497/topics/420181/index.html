              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Tottenham Hotspur" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> have agreed a deal in principle with Steven Pienaar, having beaten off competition from Internazionale and Atlético Madrid with a contract worth £70,000 a week over four years. It is unclear, however, whether they will pay around £2m to </strong></span><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Everton" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/everton"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Everton</strong></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> this month to push the transfer through or wait until the summer when the South African midfielder would be available as a Bosman free agent.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Everton would be reluctant sellers during this </span><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Transfer window" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/transfer-window"><span style="color: #000000;">transfer window</span></a> but the manager, David Moyes, has been told that he must generate funds for the three loan signings he feels he needs to make, with the priority a centre-forward. He will attempt to sign Monaco's Dieumerci Mbokani having freed up the funds for a £1m loan fee by allowing Yakubu Ayegbeni to join Leicester City. Yakubu will leave on loan with a view to a transfer in the summer.</p>
              <p>Pienaar's contract at Goodison Park expires at the end of the season and he has ignored the club's offer of fresh terms of £60,000 a week, which has been on the table since the end of the previous campaign. When Everton subsequently agreed terms of £75,000 a week with Mikel Arteta, Pienaar had hoped for parity but such a proposal has not been forthcoming.</p>
              <p>Moyes has said he would prefer to keep Pienaar for the remainder of the season, reasoning that forfeiting a transfer fee would be offset by the retention of a key player for the months ahead, particularly as Pienaar has continued to give his all for the club. Neither Moyes nor the Everton support has had reason to reproach Pienaar for his professionalism.</p>
              <p>The manager faces a difficult decision, though, because in spite of recent flickers from Louis Saha and Jermaine Beckford, he urgently needs a new striker. Everton have mustered only 23 goals in 21 Premier League matches.</p>
              <p>Harry Redknapp has tracked Pienaar for some time and although the Tottenham manager would appear to be well stocked at left midfield, where he has Gareth Bale, he knows that Pienaar can play in a central role and would be a viable alternative to Aaron Lennon on the right.</p>
              <p>Redknapp's move for the 28-year-old ought not to be interpreted as paving the way for Tottenham to cash in on Bale, who is a target for virtually every top club in Europe after his excellent calendar year of 2010. One aspect of Redknapp's philosophy is that you can never have too many good players. He does see Bale developing in the longer term into a left-back but he and the club have repeatedly stressed that the Welshman is not for sale at any price.</p>
              <p>While Tottenham continue to hold talks over a loan move for <a title="David Beckham, who trained with the squad" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jan/11/david-beckham-tottenham-hotspur"><span style="color: #000000;">David Beckham, who trained with the squad</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> today, their interest in Everton's club captain Phil Neville, is unlikely to materialise into a transfer </span><a title="despite Redknapp's desire to add the 33-year-old's wealth of experience to his squad" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jan/11/phil-neville-tottenham-hotspur-everton"><span style="color: #000000;">despite Redknapp's desire to add the 33-year-old's wealth of experience to his squad</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. </span>The Everton chairman, Bill Kenwright, rebuffed an inquiry from his Tottenham counterpart, Daniel Levy, when the clubs met at Goodison last week and Neville's club are unhappy the interest has resurfaced when, as is the case with Pienaar, no offer has been made.</p>
              <p>Moyes said: "I spoke with Harry Redknapp briefly before the transfer window opened. Daniel Levy and Bill had an even briefer conversation at our recent game against Spurs and mutually agreed that this would go no further. At no time was any offer made – nor would one have been welcomed. Phil Neville is our captain and is an important part of the Everton set-up."</p>
              <p>The Everton striker Victor Anichebe is expected to sign a new three-year contract with the club this week. The Nigeria international recently rejected an extension amid interest from Cardiff City and Celtic, and Everton would not have been entitled to a compensation fee at the end of this season had he moved to Wales or Scotland on a free, but has now agreed terms to stay.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Tottenham are looking to agree a fee of £2million with Everton for Steven Pienaar today in a bid to head off interest from Chelsea. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Manager Harry Redknapp has been sparked into action after Carlo Ancelotti made it clear he wanted the midfielder, who is out of contract in the summer, to join Chelsea this month. </span></p>
              <p><span>Sportsmail revealed last month that Tottenham had lined up a deal for Pienaar for this summer and their move for David Beckham looked to reaffirm that plan. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, Chelsea’s interest and the prospect of Beckham’s deal falling through have forced them into a re-think. </span></p>
              <p><span>They are now putting together a package to better Chelsea’s intended offer and hope it is enough to tempt Everton to sell. </span></p>
              <p><span>Relations are strained between the two sides following Sportsmail’s revelation that Tottenham also want Everton captain Phil Neville but the London club are hopeful an agreement can be thrashed out. </span></p>
              <p><span>Pienaar is an attractive proposition because he is eligible to play in Europe and it is understood he would prefer to move now rather than wait until the end of the season. </span></p>
              <p><span>Tottenham may yet throw loan players such as Robbie Keane or Niko Kranjcar into the bargain.</span></p>

              <p><span>Chelsea are set to miss out on Steven Pienaar despite having an offer accepted for the Everton star.</span></p>
              <p><span>David Moyes has given the South Africa international, who is out of contract at the end of the season, permission to discuss a potential move to Stamford Bridge in the current transfer window.</span></p>
              <p><span>But Pienaar is believed to favour a move elsewhere, with Tottenham still interested in bringing him to White Hart Lane.</span></p>
              <p><span>Pienaar, who will be available on a free transfer in the summer, has been on the radar of Europe's top clubs since signalling his intent to leave Everton.</span></p>
              <p><span>Moyes said: 'We have had two offers and one of those offers has been accepted. We have allowed his representatives to speak to the other club, but whether it goes through or not I don't know yet.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Pienaar has made a big impact at Everton since signing for £2million from Borussia Dortmund in 2007.</span></p>
              <p><span>He was the club's player of the season last year but the Merseysiders have been unable to tie him to a new contract.</span></p>
              <p><span>Talks with Pienaar had stalled but Moyes admitted that a contract offer was rejected some time ago, making his departure inevitable.</span></p>
              <p><span>

              </div>
              <p><span>When asked if Pienaar had decided he wanted to move on, Moyes said: 'I think the player probably decided that when he turned down his contract six months or a year ago, whenever it was. But he has done very well for us on the pitch, so we have no complaints.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Pienaar's form this season has not matched that of previous years but he remains an important member of Moyes' side.</span></p>
              <p><span>The club hope they can now recoup a fee for him rather than seeing him run down his contract.</span></p>
              <p><span>Moyes might appreciate the money having said he has no money to buy players this month and that any new recruits will be loan signings.</span></p>
              <p><span>Striker Yakubu became the first high-profile player to move this month, joining Leicester on loan on Thursday with a view to a permanent deal.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Steven Pienaar is to meet Chelsea again today after Tottenham failed to improve on their offer of £2million plus £1m based on performances. </strong></p>
              <p>The player’s talks broke down with Chelsea on Friday after they had a £3m bid accepted by Everton last week.</p>
              <p>Tottenham are reluctant to increase their bid with the midfielder out of contract in the summer. </p>
              <p>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp is bemused by the deal, saying: ‘I can’t get to the bottom of it. I think I do know but I’ll end up in big trouble.</p>
              <p>'It’s very strange to me how they have suddenly offered £3m. The manager at Chelsea, who is a lovely guy, comes on TV and he denies it. I don’t think he is a liar.’</p>
              <p>Everton are keen on Burnley’s Chris Eagles as a replacement.</p>

              <p>Yes, I have to agree he will sit bench most of the time... but for now I believe he might just have a chance to take the right wing place.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Talks with Spurs had collapsed after they failed to improve on their offer of £2million plus £1m based on performances, rival bidders </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span style="color: #000000;"> looked set to swoop but they failed to agree personal terms.</span></p>
              <p>South Africa captain Pienaar has always favoured joining Spurs and looks set to get his way now the north London club has matched the Toffees' £3million asking price.</p>
              <p>Pienaar was removed from the squad ahead of Sunday’s clash with Liverpool after the player told manager David Moyes he was not in the right frame of mind to play.</p>
              <p>And the Toffees are keen to cash in on the player whose contract ends this summer and would be allowed to walk away for free.</p>
              <p>An article on Everton's website read: 'Everton can confirm they have agreed terms with Tottenham over the possible transfer of Steven Pienaar.'</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, manager Harry Redknapp watched Blackpool midfielder Charlie Adam at the weekend as he considers stepping into the race to sign the Scotland midfielder.</p>
              <p>The 25-year-old has attracted interest from Aston Villa, Birmingham, Blackburn, Sunderland, Everton and Liverpool with Villa yet to have their £3.5m offer officially rejected.</p>
              <p>Adam has expressed a desire to leave but Ian Holloway wants him to stay until the summer. Tottenham chief scout Ian Broomfield also watched Adam last week against Liverpool.</p>

              <p>Tottenham's first offer was turned down by Everton and the South African winger looked to be heading to Chelsea for £3million.</p>
              <p>But now with a sell-on fee from Bent's move to Aston Villa, Spurs have matched the Blues' bid and that has been accepted.</p>
              <p>Harry Redknapp sold ex-ace Bent to the Black Cats in a deal worth up to £16million in August 2009.</p>
              <p>Tottenham have been locked in a battle with Chelsea to sign Pienaar, 28.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But they initially did not want to pay a fee in the January window, preferring to wait until he was out of contract in the summer.</p>
              <p>Everton boss David Moyes confirmed on Sunday he had accepted a Chelsea offer of £3m even though Pienaar had made it clear he wanted to go to White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>But now with the unexpected windfall from the Bent deal, Tottenham put in an offer, having already agreed personal terms with Pienaar's agent over a four-year deal.</p>

              <p>But Everton is not doing so well this season + he's out of contract soon and hitting 30s. The last chance of him winning silverware is now and of course, a huge rise in pay.</p>

              He is a very good player... Honestly, for $3m, he is a steal... I don't think he would be going at this price had his contract not left less than 6 months...
              
              Spurs seem to amaze me... Each time they are picking up good players at bargain prices... Kranjcar, Gallas, Vdv and now Pienaar...

              <p><strong>Pienaar has signed a 4½-year contract and awaits the formality of work permit clearance. The 28 year-old could make his debut at Newcastle on Saturday. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Redknapp said: “He’s a good player, a good footballer and he’ll be a good signing. I think he’ll fit into the way we play great, and I have always liked him. He has a good attitude, is a good trainer and I know David [Moyes] loved him at Everton, and it’s unfortunate [for him] that he decided not to stay. But in the end I think it’s a fair deal.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>It is a coup for Spurs after Pienaar spoke to <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span>. Redknapp added: “I think Everton got a decent fee for him, Chelsea were in for him, but he came and spoke to us and decided to come here.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">Earlier, Pienaar revealed on Twitter that he had chosen Spurs when he posted: “To end speculation I am going to Spurs. I’ve had brilliant years at Everton and it will always be a special place in my heart.”</div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <div class="body">
              <p>Soon afterwards Pienaar even posted the news that he would be wearing the No  40 shirt.</p>
              <p>Everton confirmed on Monday night that they had accepted a bid, understood to be £3 million, from Spurs, having already agreed a similar offer from Chelsea. Pienaar, who was out of contract with Everton in the summer, was given permission to discuss personal terms.</p>
              <p>Talks with Chelsea collapsed on Thursday night because the Premier League champions would not meet his £70,000-a-week wage demands.</p>
              <p>Pienaar can operate on either flank and that will offer Redknapp cover for Gareth Bale on the left, or for Aaron Lennon on the right. And with Spurs returning to Champions league action shortly, he will add extra strength to what is already regarded as one of the strongest squads in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>There was further good news for Redknapp yesterday when Jonathan Woodgate completed 45 minutes in a friendly against Queens Park Rangers, a game Spurs won 9-2 at the club’s Essex training ground.</p>
              <p>Woodgate has been out of action since November 2009 and has visited specialists in the United States and Australia in an attempt to resolve a long-standing groin problem.</p>
              <p>The former England defender played alongside Spurs’ other window signing, South African defender Bongani Khumalo. Redknapp said: “Jonathan Woodgate played and you’d have thought he’d never been away.”</p>
              <p>Tottenham have confirmed completion of the deal, hours after Pienaar revealed on Twitter that he had reached agreement with the north London club.</p>

              <p>But Everton is not doing so well this season + he's out of
              contract soon and hitting 30s. The last chance of him winning
              silverware is now and of course, a huge rise in pay.</p>

              <p>He's more likely to be a substitute at Spurs in my opinion. Spurs has just too many midfielders to content with.</p>
              <p>Central pairing is usually Modric and Palacios, with Jenas, Huddlestone, Kranjcar, Sandro and O'Hara (remember him?) as backups. On the left wing there's Bale and probably Van der Vaart too should Harry chose to play 2 out and out forward instead. On the right there's Lennon,  Townsend and Bentley was forced out on loan. With so many players to choose from, I highly doubt Harry would disrupt the team by putting Pienaar straight into the starting 11.</p>
              <p>Did I mention that Spurs has 5 forwards too? Keane, Pavlyuchenko, Crouch, Defoe and Dos Santos. And 7 Central Defenders? Kaboul, Gallas, King, Bassong, Dawson, Khumalo and Woodgate? Out of which almost half are crocked players (King, Woodgate).</p>
              <p>Mancini should learn a thing or 2 from Harry on Team Ego Management. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I think chelsea's interest may be misquoted by the press.</p>
              <p>how many times, we see one player names followed by tens of
              clubs who are interested, but in the end, no one bids.</p>
