              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> faces a massive test of his management in the coming weeks.</p>
              <p>After their demoralising Champions League defeat to Fiorentina on Tuesday, a trip to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> on Sunday awaits, then a critical Champions League meeting with Lyon followed by an Anfield showdown against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The sternest of tests at the best of times, but all the more daunting
              in view of the way Fiorentina put a new complexion on Liverpool’s
              recent run of six straight wins, all achieved against lower ranked
              teams.</p>

              <p>Rafa played some mind games last season with the crowd and through the Press and made the fans even more upset with the 2 American owners while they were fighting each other... Parry got the boot while Rafa got his contract renewed and total control of transfers in and out to pleased the fans... Pool's last year's result were probably their best showing in all of Rafa's 5+ yrs there... But I am not sure if it will be surpass anytime soon...</p>
              <p>I personally think the owners made a mistake in giving him a new deal... He has been there for 5 years and still have not won the title... His constant complaint about not having money to spend doesn't hold water cos the statistic shows he has spent just as much as United and more than Arsenal during this period... And when we take the selling into consideration, perhaps the margins may get wider...</p>
              <p>I kind of find Rafa bought a lot of average and below average players over the last 5 yrs he has been in charge... and have very little or hardly any coming through the youth system... He don't give them a chance to step up... I remember Pool have a very young English boy striker who came on and scored a goal and looked very promissing but I don't know what have happened to him since... I feel Rafa don't have an eye for good young players... And he may also have an attitude problem with his players... Keane, Crouch, Pennant, Baros... all wanted to stay but were treated poorly so they left... And not to forget Alonso, the biggest lost to them to date...</p>
              <p>I doubt Rafa will get the sack even if they end up 4th place as sacking him would be very costly in terms of $$$ now that he has just renewed his contract...</p>

              <p>benitez isnt that great a manager to begin with....</p>
              <p>against chelsea, both team would be desperate to improve on their recent displays.. I would say that liverpool should becareful, as they have lost alonso and with lucas playing, their midfield is weak. If torres and gerrard does not do well, then its game over for liverpool. Chelsea is too strong for pool with droga, lampard, terry, ballack, deco, anelka. Liverpool only have gerrard, torres and no more...</p>
              <p>Lyon and man utd would prove further tests for liverpool. Its hard to believe that pool will win 3. If they win all, they would be damn high in confidence, but i dont see that coming too.</p>

              <p>Zocoss analysis is correct.</p>
              <p>None of the youth players come through the rank as most of them are sold.</p>
              <p>Those senior players that are good are put on loan or put aside if they dun listen to Ah Ben.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben, given all the money and power, bought a winger that is having injury problem and still having MC.</p>
              <p>Coupled with the tactical weakness displayed by Ah Ben when he screwed up, the present squad did not strengthen under his leadership.</p>
              <p>He is only good at certain team tactics and lousy at player management and motivation.</p>
              <p>As for the match tomorrow, unless there is a miracle again, chelsea is the stronger team.</p>

              <p>thats why i say they can only pray for a guardiola...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but so what? even if you have all divine players but lousy mangement will still kill your team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>look at previous galati madrid.</p>
              <p>got raul, beckham, zidane, carlos and many more, who many did they win?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>barcelona then before guardiola came in is performing like shit, thats the reason why byebye to frank ri.</p>
