The Red Devils will be without half a dozen senior men through injury against Boro, with skipper Gary Neville the latest addition to a growing list after he suffered ankle ligament damage in yesterday's win over Bolton. Wes Brown will replace Neville in Ferguson's starting line-up, while Alan Smith may take over striking responsibilities from Ryan Giggs.<br><br>Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate will make a late decision on defender Emanuel Pogatetz. The Austria international was stretchered off with a knee injury 10 minutes into Saturday's 2-0 Barclays Premiership defeat by Manchester City, but Southgate is hoping the problem is less serious than it first appeared. Julio Arca is continuing to receive treatment for a groin injury which ruled him out at the weekend, but Jonathan Woodgate and Mark Viduka, who were rested against City, will return.<br><br>Team (from): Kuszczak, Heaton, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Cathcart, Heinze, Evra, Park, Carrick, O'Shea, Ronaldo, Giggs, Richardson, Smith, Rooney, Dong.<br><br>Team (from): Schwarzer, Jones, Parnaby, Davies, Xavier, Woodgate, Pogatetz, Riggott, Taylor, Boateng, Cattermole, Arca, Downing, Morrison, Euell, Johnson, Rochemback, Viduka, Yakubu, Lee.<br><br></div>

Tottenham boss Jol refuses to be intimidated by MourinhoÂ’s unrivalled record of success as he plans for the quarter-final replay at White Hart Lane.</strong><br><br>The Dutchman insisted: Â“I hate it when he calls himself the Special One. Â“I donÂ’t really know Mourinho that well. I think he is special. But not when he says it himself. Â“ItÂ’s all about respect for the other managers. We always talk before games, about how difficult it is in England and that sort of thing.<br><br>Â“I talked to Aidy Boothroyd before we played Watford at the weekend because I respect him. Â“I told him that when you are at a club like Watford, maybe he does a better job than the champions of England. How can you put it into perspective?<br><br>Jol also insists his team have nothing to fear from the current champions following their epic 3-3 draw at Stamford Bridge eight days ago. Dimitar Berbatov, Aaron Lennon and Robbie Keane will all return tonight after being rested for SaturdayÂ’s 3-1 win over Watford.<br><br>And Jol claimed: Â“I feel weÂ’re better than a lot of other Spurs teams over the last 25 years. Â“We have already won 28 games this season, so even if we donÂ’t win the FA Cup or the UEFA Cup you could say weÂ’re having a great year. Â“We have had a very difficult schedule and I hope people will give us a bit of credit for what we are doing. Â“We reached the semi-finals of the Carling Cup and weÂ’re in the last eight of the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.<br><br>Â“Other teams outside the top 10 have challenged for the cups in the past. Middlesbrough did it last year but they were 11th or 12th in the league and could concentrate on the UEFA Cup. Â“We canÂ’t do that at Spurs. We have to be in the top six or seven or we could miss out on Europe next time.<br></div>

Mourinho said: "For me every referee is good. We were unlucky twice against Tottenham - once with Mr Poll and once with Mr Riley.<br><br>"I trust every referee. I know every referee wants to do the best. He has to be honest like everyone is. My deep feelings are that everybody is honest. He needs a little bit of luck to be a good ref. "The reason why we lost the league game was that we scored a clear second goal. The result should be 2-0 but the referee disallowed the goal.<br><br>"A couple of minutes later 2-0 was transformed into 1-1 and we also lost our captain but we can do nothing about that, it is the past. It is a different game now. We believe we have a team to go there and win the game. "I like to play against Tottenham - every game is a good one. The only thing I hope for is another good game and that the referee will be at the level of both teams."<br></div>

A player born to hog the stage and the headlines. As brave as a lion, he embodies the never-say-die spirit running through Manchester United right now.<br><br>MiddlesbroughÂ’s bench and players called him a cheat last night after he won and converted the decisive penalty in this FA Cup quarter-final replay. Another, James Morrison, kicked him on to the cinder track and received a red card.<br><br>Afterwards, Ronaldo said: Â“Maybe someone does not like me because I am too good.Â” Every team he comes up against does not like him because, simply, he is too good. He also winds up players with his skill and his tricks.<br><br>To the extent last night that in injury-time Boro substitute Morrison lost it and slid in with an outrageous challenge that sent Ronaldo tumbling off the pitch. He was rightly given a straight red card for the challenge.<br><br>Wayne Rooney stormed in to tell Morrison exactly what he thought of him. The fact is that Ronaldo was bearing down on goal in the 75th minute and ready to drill home a winning shot. Jonathan Woodgate caught his back leg and, at the speed Ronaldo was going, he could not help but go down. To think it was Ronaldo too who had earned this replay with a penalty at the Riverside nine days earlier.<br><br>Last night, Ronaldo hit a powerful right-foot strike into the top right-hand corner. It was his 18th goal in what is proving to be an incredible season. So another win notched up for United and another step towards a second historical Treble. After that feat was first achieved back in 1999, boss Alex Ferguson said it would never be repeated.<br><br>Ferguson can now take a breather before the final push and just hope all his players return from international duty unscathed. For once, though, the United boss may welcome the break. By the time battle resumes he will have both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Louis Saha back fit and fresh.<br><br>Paul Scholes has also served his three-match ban for a sending off against Liverpool. There has been no damage done in his absence and, as one of the more senior members of the squad, the rest may have done him good. The players who have taken the absenteesÂ’ places have filled in admirably such is the confidence throughout the squad.<br><br>Nobody right now embodies that confidence more than Ronaldo Â— a young man who simply will not be stopped.<br></div>

A fan had to be carried off the pitch after appearing to confront England midfielder Frank Lampard as he celebrated his side's replay win.<br><br>At least one other supporter made it on to the pitch after the 2-1 win for the Barclays Premiership champions, who will play Blackburn in the semi-finals. Andriy Shevchenko and Shaun Wright-Phillips scored stunning goals to set up the win, with Robbie Keane pulling a goal back with a penalty.<br><br>The backroom staff from both teams also appeared upset with each other before the incident with Lampard. Police confirmed that one fan had been arrested for encroaching and suspicion of assault, and another had been arrested for encroaching.<br><br>Asked about the incident, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho told Sky Sports: "A fan came on to make an aggression to Frank. Frank said the guy was going crazy. "I think the security people were not expecting that. He tried to hit Lamps and after that people catch him.<br><br>"Everyone has to do his job, security has to do theirs. Maybe they relaxed with the final whistle. "They thought the situation was over and slept a little bit and it was enough for a fast guy to sprint in Lampard's direction."<br></div>

Boro chief Gareth Southgate was not convinced by referee Mike Dean's decision, but Ronaldo was certain he had been fouled.<br><br>"It is a decision for the referee," Ronaldo told Sky Sports. "For me it is a penalty. "You need to look at the television. "I just don't understand as every time with Cristiano it is a polemic and I don't know why. "I feel the contact, that is why I tripped. He touched me. "If he touches me I lose my movement and this is why I go down because he kicked me."<br><br></div>
