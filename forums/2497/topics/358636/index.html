              key member of the side which won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup in
              2001.</p>
              <p>A report on the official Liverpool website read: "Hyypia
              underwent a medical with the German outfit on Monday morning and will
              link up with his new team-mates in the summer for the start of

              every Liverpool supporter."</p>
              <p>Hyypia explained his reasons for joining the Bundesliga club on the Leverkusen website.</p>
              <p>"The discussions with Bayer were very positive. They gave me the feeling they wanted to sign me," he said.</p>
              <p>"I look forward to the task in Leverkusen and hope that we will be successful together."</p>
              <p>Bayer's sporting director Rudi Voller was delighted to have snared the experienced defender.</p>
              <p>He said: "Sami will bring experience and presence to our young squad."</p>

              <p>Liverpool had confirmed that Hyypia will be joining Bayer Leverkusen on a
              two-year deal in the summer, but his contribution to the Reds' success
              over the last ten years will ensure he forever holds a special place in

              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/liverpool/hyypia_training.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez has hailed Sami Hyypia after the defender opted to prolong his playing career with Bayer Leverkusen. </strong></p>
              <p>Despite being offered the chance to remain at Anfield for a further
              season with the option to join the coaching staff, the 35-year-old has
              agreed to move to the Bundesliga in the summer as he seeks more regular
              first-team football.</p>
              <p>And, although Benitez is disappointed to see Hyypia leave, he feels
              he deserves the opportunity to continue playing at a high level.</p>
              <p>“We are disappointed for us because we will miss Sami, but we are
              really happy for him because he can play two more years to his maximum
              with a good team in a good league,” he said in the Liverpool Echo.</p>
              <p>“With three other centre backs at Liverpool it was going to be
              difficult for Sami to play as often as he would like so he has decided
              to go to Leverkusen and, like I said, we are happy for him.</p>
              <p>“The fact that we were talking to him about becoming a coach shows how much we think of him – he is a perfect professional.</p>
              <p>“In every single training session and in every single game, he gives
              100 percent for the team and he has been a fantastic servant to this
              club.</p>
              <p>“He is always keen to help the youngsters and he sets them a really
              good example but he has also been very supportive of me and my staff
              since I first came to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>“From my point of view, I have been really pleased to work with him and now I must wish him luck for the future.”</p>
              <p>Hyypia has confirmed that a lack of playing time led to his decision
              to quit the club, but he has not ruled out the possibility that he
              could return as a coach in the future.</p>
              <p>“The main reason is I still think I'm young enough to play
              football and I know chances to play here would be limited,” he told the
              club’s official website.</p>
              <p>“I spoke to the manager and I didn't want him to make promises
              about how many games I would play, but this season has been mentally
              very difficult. I haven't played a lot and playing is what I enjoy
              most.</p>
              <p>“I understand it isn't possible to play enough games here for
              me to be happy, so I had to look elsewhere. I got the option to go
              abroad to Bayer Leverkusen. The whole package was good, they have big
              plans for me and hopefully I can go there and help them to be
              successful.”</p>
              <p>He added: “Coaching is something which has always been in my
              mind, but I have to take my badges first. At the end of my playing
              career I will look to take the badges and then see.</p>
              <p>“I would like to come back here one day as a coach.”</p>

              </span></p><p>All good things must come an end, though,
              and Hyypia insists he needs to move on in order to find regular
              first-team football in the twilight of his career.</p>
              <p>"The main
              reason (for leaving) is I still think I'm young enough to play football
              and I know chances to play here would be limited," the 35-year-old told
              Liverpool's <em>official website</em>.</p>
              <p>"I spoke to the manager

              <p>While admitting that leaving Liverpool
              will be a wrench, Hyypia has not ruled out the possibility of returning
              to the club in the future as a coach.</p>
              <p>"Yes, hopefully," he said.</p>
              <p>"Coaching is something which has always been in my mind, but I have to take my badges first.</p>
