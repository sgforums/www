              <p>The Spaniard, 26, had an awful debut against old club Liverpool eight days ago.</p>
              <p>But he hopes to open his account at Fulham tonight to keep the Blues owner happy.</p>
              <p>Torres said: "As a striker I'm asked for goals so I'll pay in goals.</p>
              <p>"I still haven't seen Roman Abramovich. To put so much money down for me speaks of his dreams to keep on making history.</p>
              <p>"We want to repay him for this effort. I have to pay my debt on the pitch. It's beautiful he paid so much for me.</p>
              <p>"When the season started I expected to play a lot to forget about my injuries. But Liverpool didn't start well.</p>
              <p>"There was no light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
              <p>"An incredible door opened for me when there was six months of fight ahead of me.</p>
              <p>"Now I can fight for what I've always dreamt about fighting for."</p>
              <p>Torres hopes Liverpool fans will have forgiven him by the time he visits Anfield in Chelsea blue.</p>
              <p>He added: "People on the outside can't understand some things about football.</p>
              <p>"The problem was that when Xabi Alonso and then Javier Mascherano left I could only see a light at the end of the tunnel when Chelsea opened the door.</p>
              <p>"It just happened that my time came to leave. In time I hope Liverpool fans understand.</p>
              <p>"I would like to return to Liverpool and be recognised. I only have gratitude towards the people, the club and everybody in Liverpool."</p>
              <p>John Terry has been warned he can no longer expect to play every game following the £23m arrival of David Luiz.</p>
              <p>With Branislav Ivanovic signing a new deal until 2016 and Alex due to return from injury next month, Blues boss Carlo Ancelotti will be spoilt for choice at centre-back.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: "We can have more rotation with our players and maintain more fresh defenders.</p>
              <p>"John has played many games but when a good player like Luiz comes in to improve the squad, everyone is happy.</p>
              <p>"Luiz will be one of the best defenders in the world in the future.</p>
              <p>"And he can help us build our play better from the back when opponents try to close us down in midfield."</p>

              <p><br>I think we have to look at the bigger picture here. He may not be in full flight at the moment, but I think many will agree that he is at a club where he has more potential to win the title or CL in the next 4 yrs than had he stayed back at Pool wouldn't you agree?</p>
              <p>Realistically, he will be Chelsea future... The other 2 strikers who are well into their 30s may not even be around by next season... And with Roman around, you can be sure Chelsea will be bringing in new quality players to the team... The type of players that his former club may not even be able to afford...</p>
              <p>Whatever happens, the fact is, he has been very successful on a personal level. Scoring lots of goals, winning the WC, being rank one of the top Fifa players. But career wise, he had 4 barren years at Pool and he didn't see any chance of that changing. So when an opportunity came up to join a better club... How can you fault him for wanting to win something at club level? Not to mention, a better paid job too...</p>

              <p>football can be funny u know.....owen never won anything at pool for years and when he left for Real Madrid, they won the european cup.</p>
              <p>I don't think torres is a happy man now. Yeh a lot of money but a very hefty weight on the shoulders. And fans always booing him.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Wrong... Owen won the FA Cup, League Cup twice and even the Uefa Cup and the Uefa Super Cup with Pool before he left...</p>
              <p>Indeed, football can be funny just like is Michael Carrick, a better player than Gerrard? I don't think many would think so and yet when he move from Spurs... He has 3 League titles and a CL medal to show for... Gerrard to date still don't have a single league title medal to his name... and that can be quite sad for such a quality player when he look back once he stop playing...</p>
              <p>But most if not all players move for a better prospect or a higher salary... No one in their right mind move for the opposite. Gerrard himself came very close to moving too for a the same reason... Only a last min salary increment prompt him to stay back at Pool... But on hindsight, we never know when he retires without a League winners medal... He might just look back and think what if he had moved to Chelsea... His career might have been a lot different...</p>
              <p>As for Torres, only the Pool fans will be booing him... Only twice a season thing... The rest are probably indifferent to it... And if anyone tells me Pool have a better chance than Chelsea of winning the League next season... I don't think many would agree with it.</p>
