But he said he has been denied cash by Roman Abramovich to strengthen.<br><br>Angry Mourinho said: Â“IÂ’ve identified players that I want but they will not come. Â“ItÂ’s club reasons and I donÂ’t have to tell you why. Â“I have asked for players and itÂ’s not my choice that no one is coming. ItÂ’s not my club. I am just a manager.<br><br>Â“I expect my squad to be the same at the end of the transfer window as it was at the start. No one out and no one in. This is our situation at the moment. Â“The information I have is that nobody is coming and if thatÂ’s the case then nobody is leaving.<br><br>Â“I cannot let a player go, even if heÂ’s a player who should go, because we are very short on options and numbers. No chance.Â” The Blues boss would not be drawn on his own destiny. He said: Â“My future is not important. Chelsea is important.Â”<br><br>MourinhoÂ’s public admission will further damage his relationship with the clubÂ’s Russian billionaire owner Abramovich, which has been strained by recent results. Jermaine EasterÂ’s 77th-minute equaliser for League Two Wycombe leaves the semi-final wide open with the second leg in 12 days.<br><br>Wycombe chief Paul Lambert said: Â“We wanted to keep the tie alive. Chelsea are a world-class team but we matched them through sheer effort.<br><br>Â“I am very proud of my players and now we will go to win the match at Chelsea.Â”<br></div>

Any manager in the Premiership would have wanted them before they came to chelsea... And Abramovich also came out to give an interview saying "he insisted that boss Jose Mourinho has the final say. I am not involved in team selection," he said. "I cannot say I am completely not involved in buying players but my role would be significantly lower than that of the manager's."<br><br>As for Gallas, if they didn't chase A cole in the first place, maybe they wouldn't have lose Gallas to Arsenal... But anyway, they had A Cole in exchange so wouldn't make a difference as Gallas also didn't want to play for them and was prepared to sit and wait till his contrach was over this june... and mourinho did bring in another defender as well in Boulahrouz  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway to quote mour on the day shev signed:<br><br><span style="color: olive;">"Today is a day when the dream became reality. Andriy has always been my first choice for Chelsea since I arrived. Before it was not possible, now it is for real. He has great qualities, ambition, discipline, tactical awareness and of course he is a great goalscorer. I did not need to meet with him to convince him about Chelsea, in the same way we did not need to talk a lot about why I wanted him. Everybody knows him as a player, tactically he can play in the Chelsea system no doubt"</span><br><br></div>

He intended to let him rot in the reserved for the balance of his 1 year contract for going against him. Moreover he got A cole right or he would never have got him this season. And like i said, mourinho did bring in another defender as well in Boulahrouz so that area should have been covered already.<br><br>And where did i say shev was his 1st signing?<br><br>Lastly, i belief many clubs would still be happy to take shev or ballack anytime.
