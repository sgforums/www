              <h1>Real Madrid star Sergio Ramos scored with Neredia Gallardo before Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
              <p class="byline"> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/0607_ronaldo_header.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="320"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Man U and Portugal ace Ronaldo will want to rethink his possible move to Real Madrid, where Sergio, who was on Spain's winning Euro 2008 side, would be a team-mate. One of her pals said: "Cristiano doesn't know Nereida's already slept with one of Real Madrid's top players.</strong></p>
              <p>"He's a jealous guy and she's kept it a secret from him because it's something in her past. Sergio's a bit of a joker and the last thing she wants is him welcoming Cristiano to Madrid by announcing he's already tackled his girlfriend."</p>
              <p>Nereida, 24, started seeing £120,000-a-week Ronaldo, 23, in January, but scored with £80,000-a-week Sergio, 22, earlier in November, after they met in Madrid nightclub Joy Eslava. The pal said: "Sergio was there with two friends and they and Nereida's mates all ended up back at his house. Sergio was all over Nereida and ended up leading her by the hand into his bedroom.</p>
              <p>"Nereida didn't go into details afterwards, but she made it clear to all her friends that they didn't talk about football or count sheep."</p>
              <p>The pair have since stayed in touch—as friends. "Sergio rang her to wish her all the best when he heard she was going out with Cristiano and they've chatted a couple of times on the internet," said the pal.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo is expected to have surgery for an ankle injury which could see him miss the start of the season on August 16. The striker has signalled he wants to fulfil a dream by playing for Real Madrid, but Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson wants him at Old Trafford for at least another season.</p>
              <p>After our revelations, it might be Nereida who has to worry about the transfer window...</p>

              <h1 class="art-headline">Real Madrid ready to launch £70million bid for Ronaldo</h1>
              <h2 class="art-byline"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/sm3/oct2007/1/1/5ABF0465-9E18-31CB-E2BB22B837AD84B7.jpg" alt=""></h2>
              <p class="art-byline"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Real Madrid are ready to launch a £70million bid for Cristiano Ronaldo in the next 48 hours and have urged the Manchester United star to hand in a transfer request. Real have made it clear they will not offer more than £70m for the Portugal winger, despite United's insistence that their most saleable asset is not for sale at any price.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">The long-running and acrimonious transfer saga involving Ronaldo, United and Real is set for a dramatic development with the official bid set to be lodged imminently, according to reports from Spain last night. Although United will reject immediately the world recordbreaking offer, the Spanish champions are confident a formal transfer request from Ronaldo will help force through the deal.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Pressure is being applied on Ronaldo and his representatives to come out and make clear their position, with Real president Ramon Calderon wanting a swift conclusion to the ongoing tug-of-war over the player. Real are convinced they will be able to sign him within a matter of days once the player publicly declares his desire to join them, despite United's firm refusal to sell the world's most sought-after player.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Keeping a player once he has expressed a desire to leave is likely to prove beyond even the famed man management skills of boss Sir Alex Ferguson, which is why Real are urging Ronaldo to formally request a move. Over the past few weeks Real have been putting the finishing touches to the financial package to lure Ronaldo to the Bernabeu, which will see the 23-year-old winger become the world's highest-paid player on £175,000-a-week.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">The record-breaking £70m transfer fee alone is £37m more than the previous world record set by Real when they paid Juventus £33m for former France skipper Zinedine Zidane in 2000.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">And Ronaldo's annual £9.1m wages over the four-year deal Real are offering add up to £36.4m, taking the total outlay for him to a staggering £106.4m, not including extra revenue generated from image rights and other commercial deals. Real also believe that his decision to stay at his home in the exclusive Lisbon resort of Sintra to recover from ankle problems away from the influence of Fergie and his United team-mates, will make it easier to make a clear decision over his future.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">As revealed by Sport last week, Ronaldo is reluctant to meet Fergie face-to-face and wants his future resolved without the need for what would prove to be an uncomfortable meeting with his combustible boss. The entire United hierarchy, including Ferguson, chief executive David Gill and club owners, the Glazers, are in no mood to allow Ronaldo to leave this summer - no matter what Real are prepared to pay.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Having dug their heels in and reported Real to FIFA for their persistent public courting of their top scorer, the issue has become a matter of principle for United, who know capitulation would now be a huge embarrassment for them. But Ronaldo's camp, led by his agent Jorge Mendes, are keen to maximise the player's huge current market and commercial value by pushing through a move to Madrid this summer.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Although he is indebted to Fergie and United for helping develop him into the best player in the world, the winger's dream is to play in the famed white shirt of Real and feels it is time for him to make the move from Old Trafford. Ronaldo's determination to leave United was strengthened by Fergie's recent remarks about the Glazers being ready to stick their most influential player in the stands, rather than sell him to Real.</p>
