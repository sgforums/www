               City will step up their quest for a striker this week as they 
              prepare to take their summer spending past £150million.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/04/article-0-090B95AB000005DC-632_306x423.jpg" alt="Target man: but Wolfsburg's £50m asking price for Edin Dzeko may

              </div>
              <p>City spent £60m last week when they confirmed deals for Jerome 
              Boateng, Yaya Toure and David Silva, and they plan to conclude another 
              £42m worth of business with Lazio's Aleksandar Kolarov and Aston Villa's
               James Milner over the next few days.</p>
              <p>As Sportsmail has revealed,
               they are significant steps in what will be the biggest spending spree 
              under taken by a British club in one summer, dwarfing the £120m they 
              spent last year, and the piece de resistance is yet to be delivered.</p>
              <p>City
               fear they will miss out on Fernando Torres because of his preference 
              for playing elsewhere if he leaves Liverpool, but the club have other 
              strikers in mind.</p>
              <p>They have made a play for Wolfsburg's Edin 
              Dzeko and were alarmed at the German club's £50m demands.</p>
              <p>Juventus and Bayern Munich have made counter-offers but the Bosnia 
              international is keen on City and has asked to go. The problem for Dzeko
               is that fiercely proud Wolfsburg would have to back down.</p>
