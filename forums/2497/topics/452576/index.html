              <p><span><strong>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is offering to pay Belgium star Eden Hazard a staggering £250,000 a week, which he believes will see off competition from Manchester City and United.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Hazard's agent was in London on Saturday according to reliable sources in France.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea expect a £30million fee for Lille's 21-year-old attacking midfielder and the offer of a fiveyear deal will be successful.</span></p>
              <p><span>Only City's Yaya Toure is thought to earn more, at £270,000 a week.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea's offer is one that even City's Premier League titlewinning Roberto Mancini and his Abu Dhabi paymasters are reluctant to match as they try to reduce their losses to comply with UEFA's financial fair play regulations. </span></p>
              <p><span>City are also in the hunt for Arsenal striker Robin van Persie and need to get stars like Carlos Tevez, Edin Dzeko and Emmanuel Adebayor off the wage bill before they can break the bank again.</span></p>
              <div class="moduleHalf">
              <div class="sport item"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ChelseaMail"></a><span>City cite Hazard's wage demands and high agent's fees as the stumbling block to a deal. </span></div>
              <div class="sport item"> </div>
              <div class="sport item"><span>They were seen as favourites to land Hazard, to the point of inviting him to the crucial derby match against United at the Etihad and taking him on a tour of homes in the more fashionable areas of Cheshire.</span></div>
              <div class="sport item">.</div>
              </div>
              <p><span>But negotiations floundered as City lost patience with Hazard's representatives over their refusal to budge from his sky-high wage demands and an incredible £6m fee for organising the move from the French First Division club.</span></p>
              <p><span>City received one boost when Mario Balotelli quashed talk of a return to Italy by pledging his future to the club. </span></p>
              <p><span>The volatile attacker has been linked with a move back to Serie A following a number of highprofile incidents on and off the pitch.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span><strong>The 21-year-old admits he loves his homeland but this will not tempt him away from the Etihad. He said: 'I love Italy but I will stay at City. The Premier League is the highest level for a player, and is a league I enjoy.'</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Italian has impressed on the pitch but often struggles to keep cool when things turn against him and he admits he must be more consistent.</span></p>
              <p><span>He told an Italian newspaper: 'From a personal perspective, I can and should do better.'</span></p>
              <p><span>United fans will be worried, however, if they miss out on Hazard, given that their midfield needs strengthening after losing their Premier League crown to neighbours City. Figures released last week showed United's debt stands at £423m, while their cash reserves have dropped to £25m with overall income also falling by six per cent.</span></p>
              <p><span>It means Sir Alex Ferguson will find it hard to compete at the top end of the transfer market, which he has blamed clubs like City for making 'insane'.</span></p>
              <p><span>The United boss has pledged to rebuild the team by developing younger players rather than buying star names.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span><strong>Sir Alex, who must replace veterans Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs in midfield, has been linked with £7m Borussia Dortmund and Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa and another Belgian star, Mousa Dembele, of Fulham, who is refusing to commit to a new contract at Craven Cottage.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Tottenham were among the suitors for Hazard in the January transfer window but the fee and wages required have rocketed well beyond their scope.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hazard has expressed a desire to switch to the Premier League, indicating last week he would announce his decision tomorrow about which of the two Manchester clubs he would join. </span></p>
              <p><span>But clearly there would have to be a significant scaling down of his representative's demands before any such deal could go through and Chelsea's late move may swing the deal Abramovich's way. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Lille are planning to give Hazard a memorable send-off in their final home game of the season against Nancy today.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The 2011 French champions are already resigned to their star player leaving, most likely to a Premier League club.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We are going to celebrate him,' Lille coach Rudi Garcia told the club's website before the game against mid-table Nancy.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I am proud to have taken my part in his progress. I often said he would be one of the European greatest. </span></p>
              <p><span>'He's an exceptional player who made history at the club.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Hazard helped Lille to secure their qualification for next season's Champions League playoff and was named the best Ligue One player for the second year in a row. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>It appears Belgian star Eden Hazard has made up his mind about which club he will be moving to next. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Lille's playmaker has his heart set on a move to the Barclays Premier League, with Manchester United, title winners Manchester City and European champions Chelsea vying for his signature. </span></p>
              <p><span>The 21-year-old tweeted on Monday: 'good afternoon guys. i made up my mind. see you later. thanks'. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, Hazard forgot to mention which club he was going to, leaving English fans hanging and hoping he will choose their team over their rivals.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hazard has been playing games for a while now, flirting with his possible suitors. </span></p>
              <p><span>He told Belgian news website HLN: 'It will anyway be Manchester City, Manchester United or Chelsea.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Most recently the London side have appeared to be favourites, with Hazard praising them after their European Cup triumph.</span></p>
              <p><span>He told France Football: 'Now, yes. They won the Champions League so they will be back in that competition next season.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's important for me to play in that competition. Chelsea are a great team with great players. Of course it's a possibility.'</span></p>
              <p><span>The Manchester United left back Patric Evra has tried to give Manchester United an edge in the race to sign the playmaker by speaking out in the press.</span></p>
              <p><span>Evra is determined he should join him at Old Trafford rather than move to one of United's rivals.</span></p>

              <p><span>'That’s if he joins my Manchester, not the Blue side.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Hazard will not announce his choice until after he has played for Belgium against England at Wembley on Saturday, in a friendly match.</span></p>
              <p><span>He has demanded his new club play him as a central attacking midfielder in the No 10 role and guarantee he is first-choice.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It is all down to that,' he said. 'I have always dreamed of playing the No 10 role, and wearing that number on my back, and you can see what a difference it makes from how many goals I have scored and set up for others. </span></p>

              <p><span>Hazard can play on the wing but ever since he moved inside has become more productive.</span></p>
              <p><span>Last season he was the French League’s player-of-the-year, scoring nine goals from a wide position. </span></p>
              <p><span>This year he more than doubled that, hitting 20 from an attacking central midfield position.</span> </p>

              <p><span><strong>'I also had the most assists in the League (16), and I never believed I could possibly come up with such a fantastic set of statistics,’ he said proudly. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>‘Certainly, I could not have made such a decisive contribution, had the coach at Lille not changed my position.'</span></p>
              <p><span>His next team will likely have to pay Lille upwards of £30million as well as around a cool £170,000-per-week to the player. </span></p>
              <p><span>Hazard kept a cool head himself when he had to retake a penalty for Belgium against Montenegro on Saturday, scoring both attempts.</span></p>
              <p><span>His agent John Bico could even earn up to £6m himself from any deal.</span></p>

              <p>Chances are he will go to City as they can afford him. It's not just the transfer fee but his salary as well. Also, he wants the no.10 shirt which will likely be more possible as Edin Dzeko who wears that number for City could be sold soon.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's no.10 Juan Mata should be staying... As for United, No way Rooney will leave. And even if they didn't had him in the way, they can't afford fhis salary. So I think City should be the place for him.</p>

              <p>It will be either city or chelsea. United bo money to fight for him.</p>
              <p>But under the new money rule, i think city have to sell quite a few player to balance their income. Before able to buy in anymore. Somemore city is already packed with attacking midfielder, i dun think he will play much first.</p>
              <p>Chelsea not too bad for him. But i think actually United will be the best if he dun consider the money. United is having a young and talented team that will rise in the next few years. As a young player himself, the experience from the manager and senior players will definitly fuel his development even more</p>

              <p><span>Hazard announced on Twitter that he would be signing for Chelsea after weeks of talks with them, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span><span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span>The Lille playmaker, one of the most coveted players in Europe, will sign a five-year deal at Stamford Bridge once details have been finalised. </span></p>
              <p><span>It is an amazing coup for Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who has not even appointed a manager for next season but is intent on rebuilding a team that finished only sixth in the Barclays Premier League. </span></p>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>The deal is a clear indication that the west Londoners will challenge the might of the Manchester clubs, especially newly-crowned champions City and their Abu Dhabi owners. </span></div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"></div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>Hazard, 21, is with the Belgium squad preparing for Saturday's friendly against England at Wembley. City pulled out of the deal for Hazard last week because of his incredible salary demands, which are close to £200,000 a week, and his agent John Bico's demands for £6m. </span> </div>
              <div class="moduleHalf">.</div>
              <p><span>However, Chelsea are understood to have reached a compromise agreement with his representative.</span></p>
              <p><span>Hazard will play in a new-look Chelsea attack that is purpose built by Abramovich for the next manager.</span></p>
              <p><span>Juan Mata, Germany international Marko Marin, who will also be coming to Stamford Bridge from Werder Bremen in a £6m deal, and Hazard are being primed for the three advanced midfield positions to provide the ammunition for Fernando Torres. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Hazard came to prominence with Lille during their 2010-11 title-winning season and has just been named Player of the Year in France for the second successive season.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Belgian has been persuaded by Abramovich that his future lies at Stamford Bridge. </span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea's owner wants to reestablish them as the best team in the country and this is part of his plan to create one of the most attacking teams in Europe. </span></p>
              <p><span>Reacting to the developments, a Chelsea spokesman said: 'As with all transfers, when we have something to announce, we will announce it in the usual way.'</span></p>
              <div class="floatRHS art-ins sport"><span>Meanwhile, Bayern Munich, who Chelsea beat in the Champions League final, have reacted to an agonising end to their season by moving for Edin Dzeko and vowing to compete with City for Javi Martinez. </span></div>
              <p><span>Bayern officials initially distanced themselves from Dzeko, after <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> exclusively revealed in March that City manager Roberto Mancini had decided to offload the former Wolfsburg striker at the end of the season. </span></p>
              <p><span>They have had a change of heart, though, after deciding they need another proven finisher. </span></p>
              <p><span>With the Bosnia striker recently accepting that his days at City were numbered, a return to the Bundesliga looks certain, provided Bayern can come close to matching a likely £20million-plus asking price. </span></p>
              <p><span>Finance is unlikely to prove a stumbling block, after a clear signal that Bayern are ready to spend lavishly to reclaim their place at the top of German football. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span> have beaten off competition from <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span> — who had been clear favourites to sign the exciting Belgium international but grew frustrated at the negotiations — Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur after becoming the only club who would go close to meeting the forward’s demands. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>City are thought to have walked away from the deal last week with Spurs giving up some time ago. Hazard, currently on international duty and preparing to face England in a friendly this weekend, indicated to Chelsea on Saturday that he was set to accept their offer and yesterday took to the social media site Twitter to announce that he had “made up my mind”, adding last night: “I’m signing for the Champions League winner.”</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Chelsea will pay a fee of around €40 million (£35.3 million) to Lille, with Hazard having demanded wages of £4.6 million a year net of tax, so around £9  million a year for his new employer. That averages out at £170,000 a week.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>In addition his agent, John Bico, who has conducted an aggressive auction has made it clear that he wants a fee of £6 million.</p>
              <p>If all the demands are met and with Hazard expected to agree a five-year deal, it means the overall cost of the signing, fees and contract will amount to around £78 million which, even by Chelsea standards, is a substantial investment.</p>
              <p>Chelsea hijacked City’s deal after receiving a call from Bico on the eve of the Champions League final with the agent telling them that he could persuade Hazard to join them if his demands were met.</p>
              <p>The 21 year-old can provide some of the width and creativity that Chelsea have lacked although where he fits in remains to be seen as he has suggested he wants to play as a classic ‘No 10’ — as does Juan Mata.</p>
              <p>The signing probably ends Chelsea’s interest in the Brazil international Lucas Moura, who had been a prime target for previous manager Andre Villas-Boas.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are without a permanent manager with interim head coach Roberto Di Matteo on holiday and not dealing with transfer targets and negotiations.</p>
              <p>Instead, technical director Michael Emenalo is working with Abramovich to conduct Chelsea’s transfer business, which has so far included signing the German international wide midfielder Marko Marin for £6.5 million from Werder Bremen and releasing Jose Bosingwa and Salomon Kalou, while Didier Drogba, also out of contract, is leaving having agreed a deal with the Chinese club Shanghai Shenzua.</p>
              <p>It can be expected that the signing of Hazard will hasten the departure of Florent Malouda, who has a year left on his contract and is considering a number of offers, including a lucrative deal from a Turkish club. Paulo Ferreira has also been told he can leave with Chelsea aiming to sign a new right-back.</p>
              <p>They have again been offered Ajax defender Gregory Van der Wiel, who was a target of former sporting director Frank Arnesen.</p>
              <p>Hazard becomes the fourth Belgian in the Chelsea squad but, unlike the other three — Romelu Lukaku, Kevin De Bruyne and goalkeeper Thibault Courtois — he will not be loaned out next season.</p>
              <p>Courtois spent a hugely successful season with Atletico Madrid and is set to go back to Spain for the next campaign. It was announced that first-choice Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech, who recently turned 30, had won his battle for a new contract and had signed a four-year deal.</p>
              <p>Hazard has enjoyed a hugely successful season in France, where he was named Ligue 1 player of the year for the second season running, scoring 17 goals in 37 league games.</p>
              <p>City have spent 15 months wooing the player and he was their guest at the recent Manchester derby having also been shown houses in the area that afternoon. It had been claimed that Chelsea tried to sign Hazard in January but their interest is far more recent.</p>
              <p>Abramovich has already told his aides that he intends to create a young, hungry new team for next season. Chelsea also have a deal in place to sign Hulk from Porto, but that was negotiated by Villas-Boas.</p>
              <p>Hulk’s agent, Teodoro Fonseca, has insisted Chelsea remain interested.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are also in the market for a top-class striker but matters are complicated by Fernando Torres’s continued presence at the club and the claims that he has been guaranteed by Abramovich that he will have more opportunities next season.</p>
              <p>Reacting to today's developments, a Chelsea spokesman said on Monday night: "As with all transfers, when we have something to announce, we will announce it in the usual way."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What they are saying about Hazard</strong></p>
              <p>"Hazard is a very good player. He has many qualities. He is particularly rapid in the first 10 yards."<br><strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson </strong></p>
              <p>"He can play in any top team in the world, today or tomorrow."<br><strong>Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany </strong></p>
              <p>"His creative ability, his talent for unbalancing opponents, his vision of the game, and his consummate skill in making the final pass all make him an in-demand player."<br><strong>Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger </strong></p>
              <p>"Eden is technically gifted and very fast. I would take him to Real Madrid with my eyes closed. He can become a great footballer, he is a star of the future". <br><strong>Real Madrid director of football and former France international Zinedine Zidane </strong></p>
              <p>"Faster than Zidane, more technique than Thierry Henry."<br><strong>Former France international Christophe Dugarry </strong></p>
              <p>"At times he looks like Lionel Messi."</p>
