              <h2>
              <p>No1: Graeme Souness</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Where do you begin? The menacing Scot physically dominated and collected red cards in England, Scotland and Italy. Most famously, he nearly caused a riot by planting a club flag in the centre spot of Fenerbahce while boss of Turkish arch-rivals Galatasaray.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>
              <p>No2: Andoni Goicoechea</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The 'Butcher of Bilbao' did for Diego Maradona with a horror tackle from behind that put the Argentina star out for months. Goicoechea then crocked another Barca ace — Bernd Schuster — leaving him with a nasty knee injury. Opposing forwards lived in fear of receiving the ball with their back to goal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>
              <p>No3: Dave Mackay</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The hardest footballer in an era when the game really could be termed a man's game. Mackay came back from a twice-broken left leg to dominate in midfield for Tottenham during the 60s before a late and glorious swansong at Derby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>
              <p>No4: Romeo Benetti</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>If Serie A in the 70s was renowned for its uncompromising football, then midfielder Benetti was its leading light. An opponent once said of him: "He was a right beast. Didn't matter whether he was standing up, crouching or lying flat on his face, if you got close he'd always manage to clatter you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>
              <p>No5: Stuart Pearce</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>'Pyscho' was so hard that he attempted to run off a broken leg in the twilight of his career at West Ham. Given the nickname by Nottingham Forest fans, the devotee of punk rock cultivated a "hard but fair" image that had him respected up and down the country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>
              <p>No6: Roy Keane</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The uncompromising heartbeat of the Manchester United side that won so many trophies in the 90s and beyond. Grew up on the notorious Mayfield estate in Cork and was a talented amateur boxer. Infamous for his horrific revenge tackle on Manchester City's Alf-Inge Haaland.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>
              <p>No7: Norman Hunter</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>Probably the dirtiest player in the Leeds side in the early 70s. That was no mean feat in one of the most cynical sides in English football history and a team that contained Jack Charlton, Billy Bremner, Johnny Giles and Allan Clarke. Nicknamed 'Bite Yer Legs'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>
              <p>No8: Vinnie Jones</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>We've all seen the picture of Jones grabbing a young Paul Gascoigne's privates. But the Wimbledon hero was genuinely tough and it was his early foul on Liverpool "hardman" Steve McMahon that set the tone for the Crazy Gang's astonishing 1988 FA Cup Final victory.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>
              <p>No9: Ron Harris</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The Chelsea defender was nicknamed 'Chopper' — and not because of anything going on in his shorts. Harris came into his own in the 1970 FA Cup final replay against Leeds — two of the most bruising games ever seen. His assault on Eddie Gray in the second game was one of the reasons the Blues won the trophy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>
              <p>No10: John Terry</p>
              </h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p>The England skipper has always displayed the courage of a lionheart by putting his body, feet or head on the line. The defender once took an almighty blow to the head from Arsenal's Abou Diaby in the Carling Cup Final only to later discharge himself from hospital to celebrate the Blues' victory.</p>
