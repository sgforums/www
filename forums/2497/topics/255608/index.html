            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/05_02/beckhamG_468x535.jpg"><br><br><strong>David Beckham moved to within three games of winning the Spanish league title on Sunday night and Â— after another inspirational display for Real Madrid Â— raised his hopes that he could also be just one game from a dramatic England recall. Beckham, who starred in RealÂ’s thrilling 3-2 victory against Recreativo, is in action again next weekend as Real entertain Deportivo La Coruna but the Spanish season stops the following weekend for SpainÂ’s internationals.</strong><br><br>That leaves the former England captain free to join up with the squad should Steve McClaren decide to pick him for their first match at the new Wembley, against Brazil on Friday week, and the Euro 2008 qualifier away to Estonia five days later. On this form the England boss might find it hard to resist the calls to bring Beckham back. The 32-year-old delivered a vintage first 45 minutes of perfect passes and pinpoint crosses, supplying enough ammunition for MadridÂ’s strikers to wrap up the game at Recreativo before half-time.<br><br>Beckham delivered the cross for RealÂ’s opener on nine minutes. He swapped passes with full back Miguel Torres and whipped in a centre from the right which Robinho headed past Bertrand Laquait in the home sideÂ’s goal. It should have been the first of many as a rampant Beckham carved Recreativo open. His cross on 17 minutes found Fernando Gago in the same territory that Robinho had occupied when he scored the first, but the Argentine midfielder miscued a header wide.<br><br>Beckham then set up the same player again on 25 minutes but this time the finish was even worse Â— Gago barely making contact and allowing the cross to flash across the face of goal. Raul and Robinho also missed chances from Beckham passes as Real continued to dominate but they went in just 1-0 up at the break and nearly paid for poor finishing in the second half.<br><br>Then Uche swept in a corner to level with five minutes left. Beckham was booked on the hour for tangling with Poli but he kept his head as tempers flared and Madrid kept the faith to win the game with their last attack. Gago set up Roberto Carlos and the Brazilian full back converted to keep Real on top of the table, level on points with Barcelona Â— resounding 6-0 winners at Atletico Madrid Â— and two clear of Sevilla.<br><br>Victories in their last three matches will be enough to give Beckham his first trophy in Spain before he leaves to join LA Galaxy this summer. Relieved Madrid manager Fabio Capello admitted his side had nearly paid for not capitalising on BeckhamÂ’s superb first half. He said: "We had the chances to win it easily. "But if you relax then you can get punished. But I was delighted with our response and Roberto Carlos ran so far to get on the end of that move."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Henry: Bring back Becks </span><br><br>THIERRY HENRY has backed David Beckham for an England recall. Becks, 32, has been in the international wilderness since England boss Steve McClaren took charge last summer. But after a series of oustanding performances for Real Madrid, the midfielder is back in contention for next month's internationals with Brazil and Estonia. And Arsenal skipper Henry reckons Beckham deserves to get the nod when the England squad is announced on Saturday.</strong><br><br>The Frenchman said: "David has never dropped his quality. He has been the most consistent player at Real Madrid. "Maybe his quality was not appreciated with England before. "What Beckham has done at Real Madrid has been unbelievable. "I don't want to say anything controversial, because to be the England manager is probably the hardest job in the country and you have to respect Steve McClaren's choice. "But maybe when David was playing for England, people took him for granted.<br><br>"As soon as he's not playing people call for him to be recalled and that speaks volumes. "The guy has been magnificent for English football." Beckham insists he can still cut it at international level. He added: "If that chance comes, I've always said I'd be ready. "Whether the chance will come up to play for England again, who knows. "I've been so honoured to play and captain my country as many times as I have and everyone knows how I feel about playing for England."<br></div>
