            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Jermain Defoe has been told by Tottenham manager Juande Ramos that he is free to leave the club, but the striker is determined to prove the Spaniard wrong and earn a new contract at White Hart Lane.</strong><br><br>The England international has been handed just two Premier League starts so far this season, and despite scoring four goals during the rare opportunities he has been given to impress, Ramos has now deemed him surplus to requirements.<br><br>With mounting speculation suggesting Dimitar Berbatov could leave the club during the transfer window it is seems strange that Spurs would also be willing to part with a proven goalscorer such as Defoe.<br><br>The player himself though has indicated that he has no intention of looking for a move and will instead do everything possible to win over his boss and earn himself a new deal at the club he loves.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Joke</span></strong><br><br>"The manager has said I can leave if I want, but I want to prove him wrong. I want to stay here," the striker told The Sun.<br><br>"He called me into his office and told me. At first I thought it was a joke, I thought he was going to say I would be starting against Arsenal in the Carling Cup (on Wednesday) which was why he didn't give me a game against Reading (in the FA Cup) at the weekend.<br><br>"But he just said 'You can leave if you want to.' Yet I have no intentions of leaving this club because I love it here.<br><br>"I would love to sign a new contract, and I know people at the top of the club want me to stay.<br><br>"But no-one can expect me to sign a new deal if I can't get a game.<br><br><strong>Punished</strong><br><br>He added: "I train hard, I put plenty of time in the gym and I do power work. I prepare for every game as though I'm going to play, which is obviously the professional thing, and then I don't get a game.<br><br>"It's as though I'm doing all of this for nothing. But I have still been taken aback.<br><br>"It's as though I am being punished for doing well. But I want to prove everyone wrong. I don't want to go anywhere.<br><br>"I just want to get back into the team and then I will be desperate to sign a new contract.<br><br>"I have no desire to play for any club other than Spurs."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PAUL ROBINSON is on a hit-list of EIGHT players boss Juande Ramos wants to kick out of Tottenham.</strong><br><br>Jermain Defoe yesterday exclusively revealed to The Sun that Ramos has told him he can go.<br><br>And we can reveal the ruthless Spaniard has run out of patience with seven other stars Â— including EnglandÂ’s calamity keeper Robinson. Pascal Chimbonda, Lee Young-Pyo, Anthony Gardner, Paul Stalteri, Wayne Routledge and Hossam Ghaly are also facing the boot.<br><br>Axe man Ramos has already started telling the players their fate, having made it clear to chairman Daniel Levy he cannot rely on the squad he inherited from Martin Jol.<br><br>And Levy has no choice but to back his new boss, just a week after declaring: Â“Spurs are not a selling club.Â”<br><br>Ramos is fuming with his squad for a string of crazy results, with his priority a new keeper. RobinsonÂ’s howler in the FA Cup clash with Reading, when he carried Stephen HuntÂ’s free-kick into his own net, was the last straw.<br><br>GetafeÂ’s Argentina star Oscar Ustari, 21, is the top Ramos pick to take over. But he is also looking at ValenciaÂ’s Tino Hildebrand and BoltonÂ’s Jussi Jaaskelainen.</div>
