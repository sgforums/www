              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chelsea are set to make a
              profit by selling flop defender Branislav Ivanovic to Juventus - even
              though he has never played for the Blues.</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">The
              24-year-old Serbian international moved from Lokomotiv Moscow to
              Stamford Bridge after the Russian side accepted a £9million bid for him
              in January.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But he was
              unable to break into the side because of a lack of match fitness caused
              by the Russian league season being over when Chelsea signed him.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Chelsea beat off competition from the likes of AC Milan, Juventus, Inter and Manchester United for Ivanovic's signature.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But he has been unable to dislodge either Ricardo Carvalho or John Terry or even Alex - from the Chelsea first-team.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But
              Juventus boss and former Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri believes he
              can persuade the Londoners to part with the defender and is willing to
              make a £12m bid - around £3m more than they paid for him.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Should Chelsea refuse then Ranieri will try and take the versatile stopper on loan.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Juventus
              faced a defensive crisis last term when £7m summer signing Jorge
              Andrade was ruled out for the season after just four games, while
              Domenico Criscito was not a good enough replacement.</p>

              <p><strong>Branislav Ivanovic’s agent has claimed the player is close to signing for Milan.</strong></p>
              <p>The Serie A giants are interested in sealing a move for the Chelsea
              man in time for the start of the new season as cover for the injured
              Alessandro Nesta.</p>
              <p>The Serbia international has agreed terms with the Milan club and is set to sign in the next few days.</p>
              <p>“Ivanovic has already made an agreement with AC Milan and is set for
              a loan move with an option to a permanent transfer”, said Vlado Borozan
              to TMW.</p>
              <p>Ivanovic joined Chelsea from Lokomotiv Moscow seven months ago but failed to break into the Stamford Bridge first team.</p>

              <h1>Milan's Ivanovic Move Up In Smoke</h1>
              <h2>Branislav Ivanovic’s will not be moving to Milan after the
              Rossoneri couldn’t reach an agreement with Chelsea. Weeks of talks have
              been wasted and now the hunt is on for another defender.</h2>
              <p>An
              announcement was expected today revealing that Milan had landed the Serbian stopper but the
              move seems to have stumbled at the final hurdle.
              <br><br>Just
              as the Rossoneri thought they had the deal all wrapped up, Chelsea have come in to scupper the
              negotiations.
              <br><br>Sportmediaset
              claims The Blues are not willing to give Milan
              the right to buy the player on a permanent basis and thus everything  has gone up
              in smoke as the Rossoneri wanted the rights as part of the loan move.
              <br><br>Il
              Diavolo’s directors have now pulled out as a result and it seems as if they
              will not return for Ivanovic unless they have the right to take him on
              permanently.
              <br><br>Milan
              were ready to give Chelsea €2m up front and then a further €10m next year for
              the defender but the English club do not want to lose their player, a €13m
              investment in January, and thus the move has broken down.
              <br><br>The
              San Siro based club are now desperate to find another defender as cover. A
              number of injuries at the back have forced the club on the market and they
              will need to ensure they find an alternative for Alessandro Nesta.</p>
