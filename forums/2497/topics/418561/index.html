              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED'S future has been thrown into doubt after a club bigwig said the Glazers WILL sell up.</h2>
              <p>Old Trafford non-executive director Mike Edelson revealed: "It's no secret that, at some time, the family will sell." And that has now opened the door for the Qatar royal family, headed by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who have targeted United in a £1.5billion deal.</p>
              <p>Edelson's comment is the first clear indicator the Glazers will listen to offers for United, which they have plunged into debt. Having bought the Premier League giants for £790million 5½ years ago, the Yanks now stand to <strong>DOUBLE</strong> their money.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sources in the City are convinced the Glazers are ready to sell after they paid off £252m of the £752m of debt they saddled the club with. </strong> </p>
              <p>One top city source said: "The belief is that they have already brought in extra finance from a third party in a bid to set the club up for a sale."</p>
              <p>A Middle East football finance expert, meanwhile, told SunSport that Qatar Holdings - the business arm of the country's royal family - have been hovering around United waiting to strike.</p>
              <p>The source said: "They have made tentative moves before with little success but this time it looks like they could be going for it.</p>
              <p>"Now they have landed the 2022 World Cup, the country wants to expand its influence in the game across the globe."</p>
              <p>United board member Edelson has been a close confidant of the Glazers since they took over the club in 2005.</p>
              <p>He made his shock revelation in a Q&amp;A session at the Maccabi Sports Club in Prestwich, Manchester.</p>
              <p>Qatar's royal family has an estimated £40bn of assets and, last week, became the first sponsor of Barcelona's team shirts in a £125m deal.</p>

              <p>A new owner who wants a hands-on on every matter regarding the club or start building up close relationship with star players might create more problems than good...

              <p>Such actions can't be good for the manager cos he gets undermine and he probably will have to always think twice about not starting him or using him as a sub only apart from considering the whole team's gameplan... Remember Shevchenko? Because he was a good friend of the owner, he has to play while better performing players like Drogba have to make way when he first arrived... Or Terry, Lampard going behind Scolari's back and straight to Roman... This kind of stuff are not good for the whole team cos it leave the manager weak to do the things he wants to do...</p>
