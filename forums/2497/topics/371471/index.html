              </span></p><p>Defender Steven Taylor has hit out at Newcastle over their current predicament, labelling the club "a joke".</p>
              <p>The Magpies head into their first game outside the top flight
              for 16 years at West Brom on Saturday evening, with no full-time
              manager and uncertainty over the club's future ownership.</p>
              <p>Taylor expected Alan Shearer to take up the managerial hotseat
              following the club's relegation in May, but with no permanent
              appointment yet made it will be caretaker Chris Hughton in the dugout
              at The Hawthorns.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old said: "The players are very frustrated because
              all we want to do is have a manager and a bit of stability. That's all
              we ask for.</p>
              <p>"The new manager should be given time to do it his way and if
              he wants something just give it to him. The chairman, if he loves this
              football club, would do that. I'm devastated Alan Shearer has not got
              the job. As players, we haven't a clue what is going on.</p>
              <p>"I've read every week that next week Alan is going to be named
              manager. Then Joe Kinnear is going to get the job, then Kevin Keegan
              and then Alan Shearer again. I don't get it. The club is a joke."</p>
              <p>Taylor continued: "Everyone thought he would be back in place.
              We thought it might take a couple of weeks but then Alan would be the
              manager.</p>
              <p>"And that's why I missed the (Under-21) European Championship.
              He wanted me right for the start of the season and of course I was
              happy to do it. I have so much respect for him and whatever he says,
              you do it.</p>
              <p>"He said he would be back and would do it his way. I guarantee
              if he was still manager now, all our big players would still be here.
              The chairman would have had a headache over the wage bill but whatever
              Alan Shearer wants, you give him. He commands that much respect and he
              would take us straight back up."</p>

              <p>Alan Shearer remains hopeful of landing the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Newcastle United</span></abbr> job.</p>
              <p>Shearer, who ended last season’s relegation campaign as Toon’s
              caretaker-boss, was back on BBC TV duty at The Hawthorns yesterday.</p>
              <p>Shearer said: “I would love the chance to finish what I started last season.</p>
              <p>“I’m in limbo. I don’t know what’s going on. I want it sorted.</p>
              <p>“It could be someone comes in, buys the club and wants me as manager.</p>
              <p>“Would I like to be manager? Without a doubt.”</p>
