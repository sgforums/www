              <p><strong>Birmingham City players have formed a queue to disparage Arsene Wenger and slammed their opponents for being in "a bad mood" on Saturday after Eduardo's leg was snapped in half.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although Wenger withdrew his demand that Martin Taylor deserved a life ban for the tackle that has put Eduardo's career as a footballer in doubt within a matter of hours, acknowledging that his comments were "excessive" and made "in the heat of the moment", Brum first-teamers Sebastian Larsson, Stephen Kelly and James McFadden have all continued to condemn the Frenchman.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>McFadden termed Wenger's comments "disgraceful" while Kelly, bemoaning the red card issued to Taylor, branded them "scandalous". Larsson, meanwhile, described Wenger as "idiotic and childish".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Incredibly, having also disparaged Wenger as a "sore loser", the former Arsenal player went on to complain in an interview with The Daily Mirror that "Then again, his whole team were the same. Arsenal were in a bad mood all game."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's unclear whether Larsson, who led the complaints against Taylor's dismissal, has considered the reasons why Arsenal players may not have been the life and soul of the party on Saturday afternoon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As is the case with both the interviews of McFadden and Kelly, there are no quotes attributed to Larsson wishing Eduardo a speedy recovery. Instead, the club apparently remain preoccupied with a sense of injustice over Taylor's dismissal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manager Alex McLeish, having previously suggested that Eduardo's injury may have been the consequence of his studs getting "caught in the grass", has insisted to The Sun that Taylor "did not do anything wrong", while Kelly launched a lengthy criticism of referee Mike Dean for sending off the defender.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The reason the ref has sent him off is because he has seen Eduardo has broken his leg. I don't think you can send a player off for that. It was harsh Tiny [Taylor] being sent off. He didn't lunge. He didn't dive in. He is such a nice bloke," he maintained.</p>

              <p><strong>Shambles: The attitude of Gallas shames the great Arsenal captains of the past</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong>They need Captain Calm but William Gallas is Arsenal's Captain Chaos.</strong></p>
              <p>One week he's kicking Nani off the ball, because his team have been thrashed and he's throwing a tantrum.</p>
              <p>The next week, admittedly in exceptionally trying circumstances for Arsenal's young team, he's losing the plot; sulking at the wrong end of the pitch, weeping at the final whistle, losing his head.</p>
              <p>A captain of a football club is its leader, its talisman, its man for all occasions; first out of the tunnel and first up to collect a trophy, gracious in victory, calm and measured in defeat.</p>
              <p>When you wear the armband, with it comes responsibility. You need to be a match-winner, or a match-saver – and sometimes both.</p>
              <p>Arsenal, over the years, have had players of the stature of Pat Rice, Tony Adams, Thierry Henry – all inspirational captains for different reasons. Arsenal Football Club should have all our sympathies this weekend.</p>
              <p>Losing Eduardo in such a way demands our understanding but then Gallas and his stroppy moods only draw sneering ridicule.</p>
              <p>Having lost at Manchester United and drawn with Milan and Birmingham, it is time for Arsenal to stand as one, with their captain at the front, as they defend their position at the top of the league and plan for a second go at the European champions.</p>
              <p>Is Gallas, a man who turns drama into chaos, the right man for such a task? Not from what we've seen in the last week.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I feel for Gallas. But he shouldnt have reacted that way. As for Seb larsson,he can just fuck off. He's still hasnt gotten over the fact that he cant get a place in Arsenal's first 11 I think. Arsene has retracted what he said for ffs.</p></div>
