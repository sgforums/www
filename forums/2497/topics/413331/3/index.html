              <p>Do you know what you are blabbering about? 30 goals rooney? i
              lol'ed..very..hard</p>
              <p>nobody in the right mind would pay an exorbitant sum for rooney
              for his current form and he is also demanding a high wage.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why would you mention Uk teams exiting the
              UCL, rooney is cup-tied to man utd the moment he was fielded for
              UCL. Doesn't matter he goes spain, italy or stay at england, once
              he transfer at january means he cannot play UCL anymore.</p>
              <p>Example is andrei arshavin who transfer to arsenal at jan 2009,
              he's cuptied and cannot play UCL.</p>
              <p>It doesn't apply to league cups, but why spend so much, when now
              his value is so low?</p>
              <p>simple. no offence.</p>

              <p><br>I think there is an error here... He isn't scoring is mainly because he has this usual spell of going a few matches without scoring type. In fact, last season from Aug to Feb without Ronaldo and Tevez, he probably scored the most in his 6 yrs United career banging in 26 league goals with assist from Valencia, Nani and most of all Berbatov...</p>
              <p>Rooney is getting lots of opportunities like never before in front of goal after Ronaldo left but he is not scoring at the moment. Since March till today he haven't even put one away only a single penalty given to give him some confidence to get back his scoring touch. Almost 8 months without a single goal is strange for a top striker even for England duty during the WC where there was Lampard, Gerrard, Lennon, Milner to provide...</p>
              <p>As a United fan, there are many a times I would watch their match and hear the commentator saying he has gone how many games without a goal but it will come and when it does, the floodgate would open... But then it didn't... quite frustrating...</p>
              <p>Anyway, as I came to know, Rooney isn't exactly the more prolific goal scorer like Torres and Drogba. He needs more chances to score. His strong point is his work rate. This is his best part of his game.</p>
              <p>Btw, I don't really care which club they sell him to, City or Chelsea or Real isn't important as long as the price is the highest would be the smart deal to make.</p>
              <p>And cup-tied or not, I don't think it will effect as long as there are more than one serious bidder... Or take Robinho, I think he left only a year on his contract at Real and he refushed to sign too but when there are 2 heavyweight fighting for him... The price will be set by market forces.</p>

              <p>In a stunning public declaration, Manchester United striker Rooney confirmed he is quitting Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>United last night accepted the statement effectively spelt the end. The England superstar claims he made his decision after failing to get any assurances about United's future from Old Trafford chief executive David Gill.</p>
              <p>The Sun revealed on Monday that Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti is desperate to sign Rooney - but the Blues will not go beyond £160,000 a week for the hitman. However, Rooney's statement insists money is not the issue. 
              
              He said: "I met with David Gill last week and he did not give me any of the assurances I was seeking about the future squad. I then told him that I would not be signing a new contract. 
              
              "For me it's all about winning trophies."</p>
              <p>That brings Chelsea firmly into the equation and last night skipper John Terry urged Rooney to join, saying: "We've got a great squad of players and he would add to that and strengthen the squad.</p>
              <p>"He is the best player in the world for me."</p>
              <p>And even Blues striker Nicolas Anelka, who could lose his place to Rooney, said: "If he wants to come to Chelsea he would be very welcome. Would I buy him? Of course I would, he's a good player."</p>
              <p>Rooney's statement came 24 hours after United boss Alex Ferguson's emotional version of events. 
              
              He lamented the role of Rooney's agent, and clearly suggested money was being put ahead of loyalty and trust.</p>
              <p>Rooney, out with an ankle injury, said: "I was interested to hear what Sir Alex had to say and was surprised by some of it. 
              
              "It is absolutely true, as he said, that my agent and I have had a number of meetings with the club about a new contract. 
              
              "During those meetings in August I asked for assurances about the continued ability of the club to attract the top players in the world."</p>
              <p>Rooney claimed he was not disrespecting the club or the fans but simply believes it is no longer the place to land the biggest trophies in the game. 
              
              He said: "For me it's all about winning trophies - as the club has always done under Sir Alex. Because of that I think the questions I was asking were justified."</p>

              <p><strong>Wayne Rooney has stunned Real Madrid by demanding to become the highest paid Galactico of all if he joins Cristiano Ronaldo at the Bernabeu.</strong></p>
              <p>Madrid newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">Marca</span>, which has close links to the Real hierarchy, reports there has already been contact between the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United </span></a>striker's representatives and the Spanish giants.</p>
              <p>Manager Jose Mourinho and club president Florentino Perez are both keen to strike a deal, but Rooney's huge demands of £250,000 a week would be problematic.</p>
              <p>It is also claimed that the striker's camp would be reluctant to give up anything near the 50 per cent image rights which is standard at the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>Central to Perez's 'galacticos' business model is to share revenues that players make from their own commercial deals, which helped to justify massive deals for Ronaldo and Kaka last year.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Barcelona</span> <span style="color: #000000;">have told</span> <span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span><span style="color: #333332;">'s advisors that they have no intention of making a January move for his services, according to <em>El Mundo Deportivo</em>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333332;">The England striker's representatives are understood to have reached out to Barca but were firmly knocked back by sporting director Andoni Zubizarretta. The Primera Division champions intend to keep faith with Bojan Krkic and are unable to fund a big money bid in the New Year due to mounting debt.</span></p>
              <p>It is understood that Manchester City would contemplate offering Rooney £250,000 a week to help pull off a massive coup that would signal a shift of power between the rivals.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea are also interested - with owner Roman Abramovich prepared to bankroll a deal - but they would be reluctant to offer much more than the £160,00 a week paid to captain John Terry.</strong></p>
              <p>Ronaldo pulled in more than £200,000 a week when he quit Old Trafford for Real Madrid in a world-record £80million deal last summer, while Rooney's current £100,000-a-week deal expires in 2012.</p>
              <p>The England star delivered an explosive public statement on Wednesday in which he claimed United's lack of ambition was the reason he wanted to quit the club.</p>

              <p>Admit the fact that Ronaldo is more superior than Rooney......</p>
              <p>If Rooney still wants to stay Man U, confirm can play his best since no more Ronaldo to 'stop' him from playing his best like last season.</p>
              <p>Who blames for Rooney departure?</p>
              <p>David Gill.......</p>
              <p>Hope that Singapore billonaire can take over David Gill, axe the glazer family!!!</p>

              <p>See ALL England players did not manage to survive at overseas. You see what happened to Michael Owen, Woodgate, Beckham at Real Madrid and Hareagaves at Munchen, no more in Starting XI.......</p>
              <p>Conclude, England players should stay at their domestic league in order to play their best since they can't really adapt to the other countries' playing style.</p>

              <p><br>How about David Moyes?</p>
              <p>If David Gill not Man U chairman, I think Rooney may have signed a long-term contract just like Messi &amp; Fabregas do. Yes, both Messi &amp; Fabregas have high ego, but they are not really greedy, wants to stay with their respective club to strive their career and boost the squad.</p>

              <p>Lets not be cynical... The guy will do well anywhere he plays. Cos his work rate is one of the best in the business. The only short coming would be his temper and patience. If he can keep this under check, he would do ok anywhere. But how well it will left to be seen.</p>
              <p>And let's not blame all English players too, Beck have a good outing and did fairly well in La Liga with a winner's medal...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">And to put Owen Hargreaves in the same bracket is weird cos the guy started his playing days in Canada and signed for Bayern at the age of 16 and didn't play a day on England's premier league until United brought hin over 10 yrs later. And for the record, he did very well for them that is why they made it so difficult for United to sign him otherwise they would have pack him off long ago...</span></p>
              <p>And back to Rooney again, I think he should leave now that fellow team mates have spoken out against him for his disrespectful behaviour... If he stays back, he will have to really kiss their feets to get forgiveness. Otherwise, the unhappy feeling in the squad will only do more harm to the club than selling him away...</p>

              <p>If you watch how rooney plays last time, and now. Then you won't tell me rubbish like how rooney has no service. Even in pre-season, he cannot even score an open goal, it shows how bad he is.</p>
              <p>Can play in normal league, but who want to buy 20m for him? provided that man utd demands that transfer fee, when a year later he costs 5m, or best, free transfer after 18months. Real madrid swap benzema for rooney would be crazy, loss of striker for UCL.</p>
              <p>He's definitely leaving though, because of all the stunts he pulled.</p>
