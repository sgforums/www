              <p>Rooney's current form is bad because nobody is creating goals
              for him. It used to be Ronaldo, but theres no more Ronaldo now.</p>
              <p>There used to be Tevez, now theres no more Tevez.</p>
              <p>Who is there to supply goals for Rooney? Now Rooney can only
              provide assists for others to score instead of the other way
              round.</p>

              <p>He is having the same problem as Torres is having now but I think Torres is worse. At least he has Giggs &amp; Scholes &amp; Bebatov...and Nani &amp; Carrick which are all good at assist...and Valencia as well although he is injured now.</p>
              <p>While for Torres, it is only Gerrard who can supply him but Gerrard has been move back to central role...there are basically none who can supply him. Against Everton, Torres stand alone inside the box versus 6 Everton players!!! Some stupid fans slated him for being not loyal, not trying his best, etc. But those are the people who do not understand football at all. I am not surprised if he finally break and leave Liverpool once and for all..having been frustrated with lack of service, loss of form, and some guy named Hodgson saying it is a possibility that he will be sold to ManU, and then this fans reaction on his performance. People just kick him on the teeth when he is down...That's just not right.</p>

              <p>Also talks of Real Madrid and Chelsea pulling out to sign him leaving only Man City which he has received death threats about.</p>
              <p>In the end, he might just stay and get a new contract from Man Utd.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>There ends the spectualtion about transfer saga. Seems he still never forget about how Fergie nuture him into a pro player. Luckily he is a grateful guy unlike Ronaldo (but he adapt well in R Madrid), Admire!!! Stay at Man U is a good choice!!!</p>
              <p>Next, he should regain the trust from Fergie by playing well in crucial matches!!! Man U is still Rooney's home still.....</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Wayne Rooney has sensationally ended doubts over his future by performing an extraordinary U-turn to stay at Manchester United.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In a dramatic change of heart, Rooney - who demanded to leave United earlier this week - has signed a new lucrative five-year contract.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The club confirmed the news on Friday lunchtime, ending an amazing week which included Rooney insisting that United no longer matched his ambitions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It also leaves </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Manchester</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">City</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and other leading European teams cursing their luck after preparing their own deals to offer the star.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'I am delighted to sign another deal at United,' he said. 'In the last couple of days, I have talked to the manager and the owners and they have convinced me this is where I belong.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> star recognises damage has been done, possibly inside the dressing room and certainly with the fans who have regarded him as one of their own since he first arrived from Everton in 2004. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He also understands the need to improve his form, which has suffered so badly since he sustained an ankle injury against Bayern Munich in March, the last time he scored a goal for his club in open play.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>He added: 'I said on Wednesday the manager is a genius and it is his belief and support that have convinced me to stay. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'I am signing a new deal in the absolute belief that the management, coaching staff, board and owners are totally committed to making sure United maintains its proud winning history - which is the reason I joined the club in the first place.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">In a separate interview with MUTV, Rooney revealed he was determined to snatch the olive branch held out by </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He added: 'Since it became public knowledge we had to move quicker than everybody expected.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'Once it all came out, it looked as though there was nowhere to go. But the manager made it quite clear the door was still open for me to sign. The club still wanted me to sign.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'I spoke to my agent and said "let's go in and sit down and try to resolve it to get the deal done". We went in, spoke with the manager, the Glazers and David Gill. I am really pleased we managed to sort it out.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rooney insists </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> was a key factor in his decision to stay, adding: I am sure it has been difficult for him as well.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'He has to look after the club and was trying to convince me to sign a new deal at the club. He is a great manager. I have said many times one of the big reasons I joined this club was to work under him, with his experience, passion and will to win.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'I wanted to be successful working with him. I have managed to do that. I am hoping in the next few years we can do that again.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">After such a tumultuous week it barely seemed credible such a position could be arrived at so quickly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">And, after consultation with the owners, who allayed his fears about the future direction of United, Rooney agreed to extend his contract, which will now expire in 2015.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'It's been a difficult week, but the intensity of the coverage is what we expect at Manchester United,' said boss Sir Alex Ferguson.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'I said to the boy that the door is always open and I am delighted </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wayne</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> has agreed to stay. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'I am pleased he has accepted the challenge to guide the younger players and establish himself as one of United's great players. It shows character and belief in what we stand for. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rooney, who was previously on £90,000 per week, is understood to have taken a massive pay hike in his new deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> has also revealed Rooney has apologised after airing his concerns about the direction United were heading in.</span></p>

              <p>I am guessing between $150k to $180k per week tho no official word on it yet... But to leave was a no brainer cos for a start, his wife who only recently forgave him, won't want to leave her retarded sister so she won't leave the North West or stay too far away from her and also I don't think he would like it in Spain...</p>
              <p>City, well... Unless he wants to live in fear for the rest of his life... All the money is pointless if you can't live long enough to spend it... lol...</p>
              <p>Spurs, probably can't afford him simple as that.</p>
              <p>Then there is Chelsea, probably the most likely place with Terry, Anelka all having called him to join them and even Lotti's is very keen... He may be really cheap if their $20m offer is accepted. But the problem the club could face from the other players like <span lang="EN-GB">Malouda, Essien, A Cole, Drogba and even to a certain extend <span lang="EN-GB">Ivanovic who have also been doing well lately... The likes of <span lang="EN-GB">Malouda, Essien, Anelka isn't even known to earn $100k a week so you can imagine they </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">might </span>wonder how come they have been doing so well for the club and a chap comes along and get $200k a week having done nothing? It could bring back the Shevchenko, Ballack situation all over again with Terry, Lampard not happy the last time round.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">But I must say, Chelsea was his likely choice to me as Chelsea was genuinely keen on him as both Drogba and Anelka are well into their 30's...</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">This whole episode is very strange when we see the Ronaldo deal, the Fabregas, the Adebayor, the Milner, the Barry all drag on and on and on until it finally came to an end. This one happened so fast and it ended just as fast... I believe Rooney has been ill adviced by his agent who used him to play a game of dare with United and it ended badly for him... </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB">Whatever happens now, Rooney has a lot to make up of this 3 days of silliness... He has to apologise the his team-mates and the fans most of all... And as he hasn't been working hard enough, he has to work harder from now on...</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em> Gerard Houllier impressed by Sir Alex's press conference </em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal manager <span style="color: #000000;">Arsene Wenger</span> has played down the magnitude of the <span style="color: #000000;">Wayne Rooney</span> story and admitted his only shock was at United's initial willingness to make the news public.</strong></p>
              <p>"Once the club came out and said they couldn't find agreement, it was a message they wanted to sell,'' he said. "There's not a lot to talk about, when a player with 18 months on his contract speaks with his club. The only surprise for me was Manchester United came out and said that.</p>
              <p>"It was just a story that for me, from the start to the end, was completely out of interest. When I saw headlines I just turned the page.''</p>
              <p>Chelsea manager <span style="color: #000000;">Carlo Ancelotti</span> was spared too much questioning on the situation regarding Rooney when the news broke during Chelsea's pre-match press conference that the England player had signed a new five-year deal to stay at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>"I'm not surprised,'' said Ancelotti. "Manchester United are happy to keep a fantastic player. I think that Rooney did a fantastic job for Manchester United and, in the future, I think he will do the same.''</p>
              <p>Aston Villa manager <span style="color: #000000;">Gerard Houllier</span> believes Wayne Rooney has "taken the right decision in his development'' by opting.</p>
              <p>Houllier said: "I don't know what happened really (with Rooney). I was impressed by Sir Alex's press conference because he responded well to the situation. It was not easy and he felt emotion which showed the liking he had about the player.</p>
              <p>"I think in the end I would say, all (sides) win because I wouldn't imagine Rooney outside of Manchester United. I like the boy, I like the manager, it is a good club, and he probably made the right decision regarding contracts.</p>
              <p>"But you never know what happens. Ronaldo had a contract as well and he left and when a player wants to leave maybe you can delay that for one or two years. It is not good when a player has nine or 10 clubs and this is why I think Rooney has taken the right decision in his development, whatever happens next year. We don't know.</p>
              <p>"Whether Wayne has realised he can't play for Manchester City, I don't know.''</p>
              <p>As regards player power in football, Houllier added: "The power came with Bosman. But now it comes even one year before the end of a contract and the new FIFA rules.</p>
              <p>"That is why the contract does not mean a lot. This is why at some stage we need to think about the future because you know teams that succeed have got a certain type of stability.</p>
              <p>"What Chelsea are doing is interesting because they won the double but look at the team and how long they have played together.</p>
              <p>"You see the team now and they are gradually improving and to get stability and to improve the level of your football, you need a bit more protection.''</p>

              <p>it was a master stroke by the old wily fergie after his press conference, to force rooney to make a decision and use the media and fans to turn on rooney.</p>
              <p>in the end, rooney got what he wanted ie increased wages and assurances from the board that united will spend big in their transfers.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">WAYNE ROONEY last night said sorry to Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United team-mates.</h2>
              <p>Now the Old Trafford fans will get their apology as well.</p>
              <p>The England striker, 25 tomorrow, ended an amazing week by agreeing a new five-year deal worth £65million.</p>
              <p>United boss Ferguson confirmed: "Wayne has apologised to me and the players. He will also do so with the supporters, which is important because we've all been hurt by this."</p>
              <p>The statement came at the end of a staggering 24 hours which involved meetings between Ferguson, chief executive David Gill, Rooney and his trusted advisor Paul Stretford, plus the Glazers.</p>
              <p>United's owners pleaded with Rooney to stay at the club assuring him there was £80m in the coffers to spend on players.</p>
              <p>Now Rooney will be watching the next two transfer windows closely to see if they are good to their word.</p>
              <p>Rooney finally signed a new deal worth a basic £160,000 a week but which could be worth £250,000 with bonuses.</p>
              <p>Despite the assurances from the Glazers it finally needed a breakfast meeting with Ferguson at the Carrington training ground yesterday to convince him to stay. Rooney then issued his apologies.</p>
              <p>Ferguson added: "I always feel it's a quality in a person when they say they're sorry and realise they've made a mistake."</p>

              <p>Not true lah... I believed he could have got more at City or even Chelsea when the transfer fee would have been a bargain... The only good thing this happens during the close window and more than 2 over months to the window re-opens. Cos if it was very close, serious and better offers could turn his head.</p>
              <p>But to be fair, he should be getting somewhere in that range since he is seen as England's best player while the others like Terry, Lampard gets $160k, Rio $130k and Gerrard $120k, he was only on $90k which was rather low for his standard as he had more from personal sponsorship deals too compare to them which the club also earned a percentage from it.</p>
              <p>Anyway, which of the above didn't have to fight for a better salary from their clubs?</p>
              <p>Lampard and Gerrard's one was probably even worse, Gerrard even handed in a transfer request and agreed a deal with Chelsea only to change his mind the next day after Pool finally agreed to pay him the same amount Chelsea was offering... Lampard's, drag for like too long and even got Scolari burned along the way and it also hurt their season... Rooney's only lasted 3 days... There rest all was drag out for quite sometime even former captain Keane did the same during his time... The only difference is, Rooney's agent probably did a worse job than the rest. But at least it was quick... lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if money was the only reason, he could easily wait out till Jan afterall he will be out injured during this time... Or even worse case, he sits around till Jun then buy out his last year contract at $5m and join any club ready to give him a huge sign on fee like $20 to $40 million plus a $200k salary? There would be a enough clubs willing to take especially when they don't need to pay a huge transfer fee for him... I think City might even be willing to pay him even more under those circumstance.</p>
              <p>Whatever happens now, at least he has committed by signing-up. So even if he wishes to leave within this 2, 3 yrs which i don't think he would now... The club will still be well compensated and not like $5 to $20 million kind... Imagine the amount it would need to replace him... It would take twice or more to even get Torres if they only got $20m for him from Chelsea...</p>

              <p><br>Maybe. I also thought that Ronaldo would stay at Man U 2 seasons ago after ending the transfer saga. But during start of season, he signed a new contract with Real Madrid :( Is it because  Ronaldo contract at Man U had ended?</p>
              <p>Since Rooney had already signed a new 5 yr contract, he has to play for Man U.</p>

              <p>I think rooney will be sold if the off season if he doesn't perform.</p>
              <p>Afterall, now the trumpcard is with SAF.</p>
              <p>He make rooney sign a 5 year deal. So even if SAF wants to sell him, can sell at a higher price.</p>
