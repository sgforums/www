              <p><em>United putting the brakes on new contract talks and do not believe they</em> <em>can justify a £150,000-a-week deal for Rooney.</em></p>
              <p> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">REAL MADRID will use Karim Benzema as bait to land Wayne Rooney.</h2>
              <p>The Spanish giants were last night preparing a £50million deal to bag Manchester United's wantaway striker.</p>
              <p>Real boss Jose Mourinho is desperate to get his man and knows United chief Alex Ferguson is a fan of Frenchman Benzema.</p>
              <p>Mourinho will include the 22-year-old as part of a cash-plus-player swoop. Madrid managing director Jorge Valdano confirmed: "Our problem is who to get rid of if Wayne Rooney comes here.</p>
              <p>"We have a brilliant strikeforce in Ronaldo and Higuain and now we have added Ozil and Di Maria to complement them."</p>
              <p>When Madrid signed Benzema last year, Fergie admitted he was interested in the player but felt the £25m price tag was inflated.</p>
              <p>Real president Florentino Perez is a confirmed admirer of Rooney, who turns 25 on Sunday.</p>
              <p>A source said: "Signing Wayne has become an obsession for Florentino."</p>
              <p>United issued a statement insisting it was "nonsense" to suggest Roo would be sold in January.</p>
              <p>Yet ironically, Rooney's demand for a move coincided with United putting the brakes on new contract talks.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils do not believe they can justify a £150,000-a-week deal for a player whose stock has fallen dramatically in recent months.</p>
              <p>He has not scored in open play for the club since hurting his ankle against Bayern Munich in March and flopped for England at the World Cup.</p>
              <p>Revelations about his dalliances with prostitutes disgusted Fergie and the board, who pride themselves on United's image worldwide.</p>
              <p>SunSport first reported problems over contract talks on September 7. Since then he has been left out of the starting line-up for United's last three games.</p>
              <p>Fergie said an ankle injury had kept him out of the first two - a claim which Rooney contradicted last week after England's 0-0 draw with Montenegro.</p>
              <p>Roo was on the bench for Saturday's home game against West Brom, as United threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLO ANCELOTTI last night opened his arms to Wayne Rooney and said: Come and join us!</h2>
              <p>The Chelsea boss is monitoring Roo's crumbling relationship with Alex Ferguson, which could see the striker quit Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: "We have to wait to see if Wayne Rooney really wants to leave Manchester United, if they really want to sell him.</p>
              <p>"And also if Rooney is on the market, not only Chelsea would be interested but a lot of other teams as well."</p>
              <p>Blues owner Roman Abramovich recently ordered spending cuts. But a source close to the billionaire last night said: "If the money was right then Mr Abramovich would definitely be interested in Rooney."</p>
              <p>Rooney, 24, who has 18 months left on his current deal, is understood to want around £200,000 a week to re-sign for United.</p>
              <p>The England striker, who has just over 18 months left on his contract, has fallen out with Fergie.</p>
              <p>The rift follows revelations of Rooney's dalliances with a prostitute.</p>
              <p>Ferguson claimed the player had an ankle injury, leading to him being left out against Sunderland and Valencia.</p>
              <p>But Rooney contradicted that last week after England's 0-0 draw with Montenegro and was only on the bench against West Brom on Saturday.</p>
              <p>United no longer think he is worth the huge new contract which would see his weekly wage rise from £90,000 to £150,000.</p>
              <p>Since an ankle injury last March Rooney has flopped at the World Cup for England and not scored in open play for United.</p>

              <p>The only player earning this sum in the Premier League right now I belief is Yaya Toure... The rest like Terry, Lampard are on around $150k. Then there are those others at City like Adebayor, Tevez, Silva on about $170k... United's highest paid I belief is Rio on $130k. So Rooney can forget it if he thinks they will break their pay structure just to keep him when they wouldn't do so for even Ronaldo...</p>
              <p>Personally, I wouldn't mind if he is sold. The price for me isn't too important as long as they could get back their investment on him a few years ago I think should be good enough especially as he only left with 18 months on his contract.</p>
              <p>United without him won't be too much of a problem... In fact I think it could be better in a way cos Roon has quite a number of going long spells without a goal type and that shouldn't be happening for a top striker who gets to play almost in every match.</p>
              <p>I think the best place for him could be at Chelsea cos Drogba and Anelka are both in their 30's so might be a better option but I doubt Chelsea would pay anything close to $40m on a player whose contract is coming to an end. Another thing is with Roman making cut backs to be in time for the Uefa fair play rule, are they willing to pay him $200k a week thats another question...</p>
              <p>City on the other hand might but having seen that they have kind of gel together now, where would Rooney fit in we have to ask? Or do they even need him cos Mario Balotelli is said to be as good a player and they have just signed him and they still have Adebayor, Santa Cruz, Jo... So even if they get rid of one of the subs strikers and replace him with Rooney, Will Rooney be happy to sit on their bench and not be a disruptive force? Cos it could be very likely especially when City seem to favour playing with 3 upfront and 3 defensive midfielders but one lone striker in Tevez... I don't think Tevez can be replace after what he have done for them and Johnson, Milner &amp; Silva are doing a great job on the wings... So City going for him might not work out well unless Rooney is welling to be Tevez understudy and come on whenever he gets injured which hardly happens...</p>
              <p>In my own view, I would rather United sell him cos I don't know, I kind of feel it might be better for them in a way... And problems he could bring to the squad in future is still unknown. Cos I thought once he got married and settled down, then he won't have such problems anymore but unfortunately, his recent problem with prostitutes again... Only show that the guy has gone back on the wrong side and therefore, won't change... So i expect the same old problem to arise again anytime in the next few years...</p>
              <p>And for a striker, he had a good last season but I can't recall him ever once being top scorer despite the chances he gets... Too often he goes for long periods without a goal and that actually hurts United. Last season despite his best showing, Anelka still out scored him and he still took some of the United penalties while Anelka's didn't...</p>
              <p>So I think sometimes letting him go could actually be a good thing cos the guy could be problematic to the team if future... And his going could actually spur Fergie all over again... This season, Nani is the most effective United player for me... This one they cannot lose.</p>

              <p>well, I differ.</p>
              <p>I think WRooney is impt to MU and he should not be sold, more so to City.</p>
              <p>Rooney can change games, and we can see the impact of him not at his best. MU is not top of their game and the engine is suffering.</p>
              <p>I think we should give him support and his goals will come.</p>
              <p>-&gt; Form is temp, class is permanent.</p>
              <p>frankly, look at what we got from ronaldo's sale, u think after selling rooney for 50m, mu will have 130M to spend??</p>
              <p>just more for the glaciers to pump into their failing shopping centres..</p>

              <p>The only player earning this sum in the Premier League right now
              I belief is Yaya Toure... The rest like Terry, Lampard are on
              around $150k. Then there are those others at City like
              Adebayor, Tevez, Silva on about $170k... United's highest paid I
              belief is Rio on $130k. So Rooney can forget it if he thinks they
              will break their pay structure just to keep him when they
              wouldn't do so for even Ronaldo...</p>
              <p>Personally, I wouldn't mind if he is sold. The price for me
              isn't too important as long as they could get back their investment
              on him a few years ago I think should be good enough especially as
              he only left with 18 months on his contract.</p>
              <p>United without him won't be too much of a problem... In fact I
              think it could be better in a way cos Roon has quite a number
              of going long spells without a goal type and that shouldn't be
              happening for a top striker who gets to play almost in every
              match.</p>
              <p>I think the best place for him could be at Chelsea cos Drogba
              and Anelka are both in their 30's so might be a better option but I
              doubt Chelsea would pay anything close to $40m on a player whose
              contract is coming to an end. Another thing is with Roman making
              cut backs to be in time for the Uefa fair play rule, are they
              willing to pay him $200k a week thats another question...</p>
              <p>City on the other hand might but having seen that they have kind
              of gel together now, where would Rooney fit in we have to ask? Or
              do they even need him cos Mario Balotelli is said to be as good a
              player and they have just signed him and they still have
              Adebayor, Santa Cruz, Jo... So even if they get rid of one of the
              subs strikers and replace him with Rooney, Will Rooney be
              happy to sit on their bench and not be a disruptive force? Cos it
              could be very likely especially when City seem to favour playing
              with 3 upfront and 3 defensive midfielders but one lone
              striker in Tevez... I don't think Tevez can be replace after what
              he have done for them and Johnson, Milner &amp; Silva are
              doing a great job on the wings... So City going for him might not
              work out well unless Rooney is welling to be Tevez understudy and
              come on whenever he gets injured which hardly happens...</p>
              <p>In my own view, I would rather United sell him cos I don't know,
              I kind of feel it might be better for them in a way... And problems
              he could bring to the squad in future is still unknown. Cos I
              thought once he got married and settled down, then he won't have
              such problems anymore but unfortunately, his recent problem with
              prostitutes again... Only show that the guy has gone back on
              the wrong side and therefore, won't change... So i expect the same
              old problem to arise again anytime in the next few
              years...</p>
              <p>And for a striker, he had a good last season but I can't recall
              him ever once being top scorer despite the chances he gets... Too
              often he goes for long periods without a goal and that actually
              hurts United. Last season despite his best showing, Anelka still
              out scored him and he still took some of the United penalties while
              Anelka's didn't...</p>
              <p>So I think sometimes letting him go could actually be a good
              thing cos the guy could be problematic to the team if future... And
              his going could actually spur Fergie all over again... This season,
              Nani is the most effective United player for me... This one they
              cannot lose.</p>

              <h1>Chelsea prepare £20m bid for unsettled Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney</h1>
              <h2>Chelsea are preparing a bid of £20 million to try to sign Wayne Rooney in the January transfer window.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/19/article-0-0BADCAAE000005DC-603_634x386.jpg" alt="Careful what you wish for: A young fan pleaded with Fergie to buy Rooney back in 2004" width="634" height="386"></p>

              <p><em></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>Although the offer would fall far short of the expected £35 million bid by Manchester City, sources suggested on Tuesday night that </strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> believe they may be favourites to secure the </strong></span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-united/"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> striker because Sir Alex Ferguson would rather sell to them. </strong></span></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Indeed it is understood that Chelsea have been closely tracking </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/wayne-rooney/"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Rooney</span></strong></a><span style="color: #000000;">'s</span> situation for several months after being alerted that he may not be happy at Old Trafford and was open to the idea of leaving with less than two years on his contract.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Real Madrid are the only other club seriously in the running to sign the 24 year-old, but it is uncertain what kind of offer they are considering, especially as they would prefer to wait until the summer before making a move.</p>
              <p>United will make it clear to all suitors that they want to do a deal sooner than that. This is largely because the value of striker will have diminished by the end of the season, when he will enter the final year of his contract, and also because Ferguson has decided he wants the player to leave as soon as possible to cause minimum disruption.</p>
              <p>Although Rooney is, according to sources, "100 per cent sure he wants to move" and is prepared to join City, who will also offer him by far the biggest wages, he is believed to be keen on Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Ferguson, who has been given a mandate to sell by United's American owners the Glazers, would ideally prefer Rooney to leave the Premier League and move abroad.</p>
              <p>Real are the most likely to make an offer and there are undoubtedly players, particularly Karim Benzema and Kaka, in whom United would be interested, especially as it is understood that a straight cash deal would involve a large portion of the money going to Everton as a sell-on fee, believed to be 25 per cent of any profit United make on Rooney.</p>
              <p>Real have already made it known that they are looking to offload certain players, and that list includes Lassana Diarra and Fernando Gago. However, Rooney has also indicated he would rather stay in England.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's interest in Rooney is long-standing and manager Carlo Ancelotti, who is pushing for the signing, is an avowed fan, having praised the striker last season for his performances. On the eve of Chelsea's Champions League tie against Spartak Moscow, Ancelotti admitted he would be interested.</p>
              <p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is, according to sources close to him, still hoping to sign Fernando Torres having had a long-standing interest in the Liverpool striker.</p>
              <p>A bid was lodged in the summer, and although this fell below Liverpool's valuation, the club's plight, and the Spaniard's unhappiness, may lead to Chelsea making a renewed offer in the next transfer window.</p>
              <p>It is not beyond the realms of possibility that they could bid for both Rooney and Torres, with one source suggesting on Tuesday that this was "Roman's dream".</p>
              <p>Quite where that would leave Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka remains to be seen, although Chelsea are acutely aware that they will have to eventually replace their main strikers, who are both over 30.</p>
              <p>The likelihood is that Chelsea will not offer enough for Rooney to convince United to sell to them, rather than City. It will also be difficult to persuade Abramovich to increase his bid given the player's contract situation and the personal problems he has faced.</p>
              <p>He will want to drive a hard bargain for Rooney, who could buy himself out of the final year of his deal for about £5 million next summer. "Why would someone pay the market rate right now?" one source said on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp alluded to this on Tuesday night when he said: "It's an amazing situation that Rooney could become a free agent, someone who is worth £50-60 million.</p>
              <p>"He's in a situation whereby if he does not want to sign a contract then in 18 months he is a free agent. He's in a position where if someone gives him personally £30 million then he is still a cheap player. He can go down that road and Man United can do nothing about it."</p>

              <p><br>The CEO of Man United earn only $1.8m per year, even lesser than their team manager... And he is also one of the top paid CEOs in the league. Pool's CEO earn even less as reported recently... The highest paid CEO was Chelsea's Peter Kenyon at $5m before he left them...</p>
              <p>So not all CEO's earn great amounts...</p>
