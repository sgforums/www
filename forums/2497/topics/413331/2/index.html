              <p>Rooney will be missed dearly, cause he is one of the greatest player to don the MU's jersey.</p>
              <p>yes, no player is bigger than the club and for the moment, if the club, MUFC is without the yanks and making healthy profit and challenging in the transfer market, then yes, Rooney's departure may be channel into another great purchase.</p>
              <p>but then, that's a dream. all MU fans tot CR7's fees will be channelled into a great but instead, we got developing players, not the final articles and hence the team has taken a quality dip and a big confidence blow.</p>
              <p>if Rooney were to leave, who's next? nani? vidic? evra? the same swansong that Torres is making..but at least, they got a new owner. so What's next, Glaciers?? have you convert MUFC into a talent spotting/developing and selling club?</p>
              <p>Out with the YANKS..</p>

              <p>I think part of the problem also lies with the emergence of chelsea, man city in recent years. In the past, winning titles for man u was a breeze. Now when man u goes for a barren title spell for two years, players like rooney become unhappy. It doesnt help that players at chelsea and man city earn much higher salaries.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, rooney was not man utd's product, unlike the old generation who would swear loyalty to fergie until they're asked to go. Well, cantona has gone off, ince, schmeichel, keane, robson, hughes and the club has always done well. Ronaldo has left  and that cost a few goals but I would attribute the team's display this season to poor defending. You cant put o'shea and evans in the first team. They just don't cut it. I would think the defence is the only area that needs beefing up.</p>
              <p>When that problem has been looked into, man u will be champions of the world again.</p>

              <p>MUFC did have slight advantage in the 90s, but let's not negate gunners and their titles.</p>
              <p>the key is the transfer market. MU seems to be able to outbid players from UK and get what they want. but it seems now, they are severly curtailed, and that's the big problem Rooney is talking about (which we all got from the press).</p>
              <p>and maybe the rot started with Ronaldo leaving. but the crux is he left with MUFC getting a massive sum, not sure about rooney.</p>
              <p>as for defence, it is a team game, if the attackers have someone like tevez, always biting and a few hard-tackling MFs with enough leg power to play box to box, defence won't be overwhelmed. Look @ Milan now, they are short of box to box players and hence may be suffering.</p>

              <p>THis is really testing times for the club ....I agreed to some forumer who said that we should stop kidding ourselves and say we'll be all well (at least for this season) and start winning trophies again.The team missed out on the BPL last season after ronaldo &amp; tevez left and remember last season was super freakish with the top 4 dropping points here n there with united losing 7games and still within a point of chelsea in the end.The fact that Rooney steped up and sort of compensated for ronaldo's bulk of goals.Rooney is nv only about goals,its his overall play and drive and burst that contributes to overall team play,he's like a morale booster for the team.</p>
              <p>Look at it,will it happen again this season?..consistency may come back for chelsea n gunners but look at united..how many goals conceded already,how well have we done for our away games,struggling to break teams down and keeping with leads.</p>
              <p>I wish we could get like 30million pounds for rooney, and fergie can really SPEND the proceeds on some proven players.The best is for Rooney to leave for real madrid,i'm not considering for his future but in the case of manutd cause the fans and players wouldn't want to be sore seeing that betrayer again in BPL or what and real tend to pay high for united's players.Chelsea may not break the bank with roman curbing his expenses,ManC got the $ but seriously no sensible fan would want to see him there helping the neighbour building up their title charge with old partner Tevez..</p>

              Sir Alex Ferguson will hold emergency talks with Manchester United's chief executive, David Gill, tomorrow morning to decide whether to sell Wayne Rooney after the player's damning statement accusing the club of not matching his own ambitions and questioning whether they are in decline.
              
              Gill spoke with the Glazer family during the evening and a meeting has been arranged for 10am to decide whether to make Rooney available in the January transfer window. The club are incensed after Rooney went public with his misgivings about whether the club will be in a position to compete for major trophies over the coming years, an explicit admission that he feels United are stagnating under the ownership of the Glazers.
              
              The player's statement prompted a robust defence from Ferguson after the 1-0 Champions League defeat of Bursaspor and it is increasingly likely Rooney will never play for the club again.
              
              "The important thing is that we put it to bed," Ferguson said. "We have a meeting at 10am when we will assess the whole situation. David has already spoken to the owners, which is important. We don't want this carrying on. We don't want a saga and we don't want it becoming more important than the team. It could affect morale. If we carry on with one individual dominating the headlines and our thoughts we would not be doing our job."
              
              Ferguson said it was not an option to suspend Rooney but he did not disguise his anger about the way the England international, seriously considering a potential Â£260,000-a-week offer to join Manchester City, had publicly questioned United's ambition. "Have I won 30 trophies or what?" the manager said. "I have every confidence in the future of this club.
              
              "We have a good structure, the right staff, the right manager, the right chief executive. There's not a thing wrong with Manchester United. Some players like to think there's a better world somewhere else but it never really works. They look in a field and see a cow and they think it's a better cow than the one in their own field, and it never really works out that way."

              <p>well, from rooney's pt of view, he has just unearthed all MUFC fans' fears.</p>
              <p>MUFC is declining. and while we do have SAF, and his 30 trophies, the pipe is being painfully squeezed by the two blues.</p>
              <p>while SAF has his points, and worst result is to transfer-list Rooney, i seriously doubt the money will be flowing back to SAF's transfer plans.</p>
              <p>To lose MU's mainstay, in a period of Jan where MU traditionally steps on the gas and charge up the table is never good, plus the enemies may be reinforced.</p>
              <p>these are darks days.</p>

              <p>nobody in the right mind would pay an exorbitant sum for rooney for his current form and he is also demanding a high wage.</p>
              <p>I don't understand why would you mention Uk teams exiting the UCL, rooney is cup-tied to man utd the moment he was fielded for UCL. Doesn't matter he goes spain, italy or stay at england, once he transfer at january means he cannot play UCL anymore.</p>
              <p>Example is andrei arshavin who transfer to arsenal at jan 2009, he's cuptied and cannot play UCL.</p>
              <p>It doesn't apply to league cups, but why spend so much, when now his value is so low?</p>

              <p>personally i think he could go just to real madrid.</p>
              <p>the english tabloit are going to make him a hatred figure. thus i dont think he can survive the tuants should be move to chelsea or man city.</p>
              <p>city is out coz man utd would never sell him to them.</p>
              <p>chelsea? well i am not so sure roman is willing to spent that much and making him highest at chelsea could cause more unrest in wage demand from other player.</p>
              <p>barca is almost bankrupt.</p>
              <p>real madrid has the player which ferguson would want to trade +  cash + real has the spending power to pay roo wages.</p>
              <p>inter is another option, but i dont think he want to play in a league consider much below par than english game.</p>

              <p>The word in decline don't seem to be the correct one to be honest... United have always been this way for the past decade. They will buy one or two bigger name players over the years when it's needed but will also continue to buy younger ones too at the same time to develope.</p>
              <p>Like the arrival of Ronaldo was never expected to reap such returns. When Beckham was first sold away under almost the same circumstances though not as bad, many were disappointed, in fact I can recall even much more than right now with Rooney. And doomsayers were saying this is the end of United cos Beck was such a big player for them and you go out and replace one of your most influential players with a nobody, or a kid from Portugal... And the closes anyone have heard the name of a Ronaldo at that time was the Fat one. Of course people have short memories, cos the rise of thin Ronaldo soon put everything that was said then into the bin... </p>
              <p>The biggest difference today is the emergence of Chelsea (a few yrs ago) and now City. These are clubs today that can play outside the box which they never could over the last 2 decades because of having new rich owners...</p>
              <p>United, if you think carefully, they are still running in the same fashion as they did 10 yrs ago... And it would be suicide if they even try to follow in City or Chelsea's footsteps because they simply can't, not without a super rich owner. Roman of Chelsea seems to have realised this now after 6, 7 yrs and have begin to cut back in many unnecessary wastage to even a point of losing Joe Cole for free... Of course the new richer owner at City might discourage him a little too cos he used to be the only big fish in the pond but now there is someone bigger...</p>
              <p>So to say in decline is not the right word when they have been running it in this manner all along... Of course some fans will be upset and frustrated cos of the results but if we are being honest, this was bound to happen, with the funds City have available to them.</p>
              <p>Like I said last year, it was just a matter of time before they reach the top... Even if United don't have any debts it won't change the fact City will still rise cos United as a going club can only generate almost $100m profit a year but they can't even spend all of it while City can blow that same amount in one transfer window or let alone just one Kaka if the desire... And we are not even going into the salaries yet... So the expectation is not realistic... The only club that can match City right now has to be Chelsea but even then, I don't expect them to do so for very long if City continue in this fashion cos Chelsea is only back by Roman's personal wealth while City is being back by a whole Arab nation's wealth, which is a lot times more than Roman's...</p>
              <p>If we think carefully, United can still hold their own to clubs playing within the rules... The Arsenal, The Spurs, The Liverpools kind. City and Chelsea are a different animal not seen before. And I belief City will not only be King of England in the near future, I really belief the sky is the limit for them and they will be King of Europe too within 5 to 10 yrs. And I don't just mean winning the CL... People have short memories in football, and if City can be successful for the next 10 yrs and the kind of salaries they are able to pay, 10 yrs down the road players will be rushing to play for them rather than the Real Madrid or Barcelona who are both also in deep debts themselves...</p>

              <p>honestly, you compare man utd and man city this season, man city every department; defense, midfield and attack sis stronger or on par with man utd.</p>
              <p>that should be a big warning sign for SAF. start of season was scholes keeping utd up (at the expense of weaker defence), now it's berbatov and especially nani. the rest of the team is second rate.</p>
              <p>i watched the match against budaspor last night, man utd played very poorly. hernandaz? very inconsistent like a average EPL team striker. vidic? keep slipping (on Old Trafford pitch??) and nowhere his top form, looking more like liability.</p>
              <p>the rest are all very average so far. no more United fighting spirit.</p>
