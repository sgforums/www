              <p><strong>Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari insists he has the backing of his players ahead of what he is viewing as their biggest game of the season - against Southend in the FA Cup on Wednesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>The third-round replay against the League One side should be a formality for the multi-million pound Chelsea stars but the Blues are in the midst of their biggest crisis.</p>
              <p>A glut of defensive howlers in their last five games has undermined Chelsea's title aspirations and they go to Roots Hall on the back of a 3-0 drubbing by rivals Manchester United amid allegations the squad is either too old, in disarray or simply uninterested.</p>
              <p>But Scolari, who labelled the crucial cup tie as the "game of the year'' for both clubs, is adamant he has the continued support of his squad. "I think I have the squad behind me,'' declared a robust Scolari. "We are all in the same boat. If Chelsea lose a game it is not only Scolari, it is the Chelsea team.</p>
              <p>"There is not a problem with the spirit. It is a problem of mistakes not spirit. "It is the game of the year for Southend and it is the same for us. We need to think the same as them. "But if our spirit is not the same as Southend's, it will be difficult to win. If we have the same spirit and are thinking about the FA Cup, we have more chance than them. We have very good players who are technically better, but we need to prove it on the pitch.''</p>
              <p>One of the repercussions of their United mauling on Sunday has been Scolari's decision to ditch man-to-man marking and return to a zonal system. It is not a question of his squad being too old, he says, it is all about stamping out basic errors.</p>
              <p>"What has happened is a lesson for us,'' said Scolari. "It is a problem because we give chances for all teams to score goals from set plays. "What has happened in the last three or four games has not been good. "We have done well in 25 games and not well in five. I need to change something. I have changed the system to zonal and not man-to-man.</p>
              <p>"The responsibility now is for the group and not one man. But if we talk about the mistakes all the time, maybe we make more mistakes. "Mentally it is a problem. We lost many points from set-plays and mistakes. Now is the time to talk with the players about what is happening.</p>
              <p>"All the players know what I want from set plays. Sometimes mistakes happen. But my team, in the last four games, we have conceded five goals. It is more my mistake than the players' because it is my system.</p>
              <p>"I tried to do zonal marking but changed it back to man-to-man sometimes, now we change the system again. "I am responsible for us conceding the last two goals against United because I tried to change the result in the second half. I opened the midfield. I was wrong but this is my style.''</p>
              <p>Scolari's defensive problems are not his only concern however. Nicolas Anelka, often described as the 'incredible sulk' during his career, is understood to have voiced his latest displeasure at being left out of the starting line-up since Boxing Day.</p>
              <p>Anelka smashed 16 goals this season during Didier Drogba's enforced absence through injury, but he has been out in the cold since the Ivorian's return.</p>
              <p>The France striker, who last started for Chelsea in the win over West Brom, was alleged to have rowed with Scolari after being asked to play on the left flank - a position he hated under previous manager Avram Grant.</p>
              <p>But Scolari rejected the accusations of a bust-up with his top scorer and insisted it was his job as coach to choose the players for the job, irrespective of reputations or egos.</p>
              <p>"There has been no row with me,'' said Scolari. "It is my choice sometimes - this or that player. "I have 24 good players but only two centre-forwards. One is playing and not the other.</p>
              <p>"Everybody thinks it is easy to play two strikers because they are good. But I try to prove to the people and for me and Chelsea, that is difficult. "When one player is outside, as was Didier Drogba, he needs to play two, three or four games, and in that time I need to look at what's happened. Afterwards I have to decide. It is my option.''</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PHIL SCOLARI was ‘happy as Larry’ after surviving a scare by the seaside. Chelsea had to come from behind before finally sinking Southend in their FA Cup replay.</h2>
              <p class="article">Scolari’s No2 Ray Wilkins said: “Felipe is happy as Larry with tonight’s work — apart from Joe Cole’s injury. We were well beaten at Manchester United on Sunday and were determined to put that right.</p>
              <p class="article">I think we have come in for some unfair stick lately, but this was a real confidence booster for us. “People will say we’ve only beaten Southend, but they battled hard and made it difficult for us — just as they did in the first game.”</p>
              <p class="article">Cole went off with a knee injury in the second half. Wilkins said: “We don’t know what he’s done but we’re hoping it’s nothing long-term.”</p>
              <p class="article">Wilkins denied Scolari’s relationship with Didier Drogba is at breaking point after the striker was axed. He said: “It was Felipe’s decision — I don’t know if he has spoken to Didier but I wouldn’t say the two are at breaking point from what I’ve seen.”</p>
              <p class="article">Southend boss Steve Tilson said: “The scoreline was a bit harsh on us. “Petr Cech pulled off a fantastic save to stop us going 2-0 up. That probably changed the game.”</p>
