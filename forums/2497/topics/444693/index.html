              <h2>Sunderland stun City</h2>
              <p>Dong-Won Ji's stoppage-time goal gave Sunderland a shock 1-0 win over Manchester City at the Stadium of Light after Martin O'Neill's side repelled wave after wave of attack from the Premier League leaders.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>actually sunderland had chances to score earlier on but didnt take it chances. micah richards header hit the post in the 90th minute. end to end stuff at the end. exciting when he scored with the last seconds of the match. Mancini must be gutted with loss of 2 points when he thought a draw is in the offing, but he got a shocker when sunderland scored. no point at stadium of light for him tonight.</p></div>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROBERTO MANCINI ripped into his Manchester City stars after Sunderland blew open the title race.</h2>
              <p>The City boss was fuming as Dong-Won Ji leapt off the bench to score a dramatic 93rd-minute winner and send City crashing to only their second defeat of the season.</p>
              <p>Mancini blasted: "If you want to be a top team, you cannot defend like that.</p>
              <p>"The goal was offside but I've not been to see the ref about it.</p>
              <p>"I almost lost my voice shouting at the defence to hold their line and concentrate because of the danger Sunderland posed on the break.</p>
              <p>"We seemed to want to attack with 10 players and to do that is impossible.</p>
              <p>"And when they broke at the end we had five or six standing still when they should have been chasing back.</p>
              <p>"It's frustrating because we can't lose a game like today's. In the second half, we had I don't know how many chances.</p>
              <p>"But football is like this. Sometimes you can't win. Sometimes you score three or four goals in a game, sometimes you can't score even if you have 10 chances."</p>
              <p>Mancini had to seek out Sunderland boss Martin O'Neill for a late post-match handshake after storming off down the tunnel as soon as the goal was scored.</p>
              <p>And he hopes Mario Balotelli will be back for tomorrow's clash with Liverpool after missing out yesterday with an ankle problem.</p>
              <p>Mancini added: "I don't know how many chances we had but I am not concerned about not scoring. I'm more worried about having players on the pitch who understand the situation when we're vulnerable.</p>
              <p>"That is something we must improve. You cannot win every game but sometimes, you must make sure you don't lose.</p>
              <p>"I hope the players realised that we have lost a big chance today because getting those three points was very important. We have a game in 48 hours and we need to recover now."</p>
              <p>O'Neill was delighted with his injury-ravaged Sunderland side. He said: "It's been an incredible weekend and I was not too pleased with some of the results on Saturday because we still need the points.</p>
              <p>"They tell me our goal was marginally offside but for us to win the game was a fantastic effort.</p>
              <p>"We defended with our lives and just threw bodies at everything. The commitment was unbelievable. The roar for the goal was deafening and I was delighted to hear the roar for the final whistle as well.</p>
              <p>"It was a fantastic effort, really, really fantastic."</p>
              <p>John O'Shea paid tribute to O'Neill for inspiring the side.</p>
              <p>The Sunderland defender said: "To be fair to City they're a great team and they had a lot of chances but, as a unit, we were great today.</p>
              <p>"Credit has to go to the manager for giving us belief. He said 'We don't want to lose this game 1-0 and people say we did ok.'"</p>
              <p>O'Shea, a former Manchester United player, was pleased to do his old side a favour. He said: "They had a disappointing result yesterday and this will have cheered them up a bit. But, more importantly for us, it's a fantastic result.</p>
              <p>"The way the lads played showed the character we have in the team and we have to take that forward now."</p>
              <p>Midfielder Lee Cattermole also praised O'Neill. He said: "We've got a spirit where we go into games believing we will win.</p>
              <p>"We had some bad luck at the start of the season. I think we were playing the same as now but we weren't having that luck."</p>
