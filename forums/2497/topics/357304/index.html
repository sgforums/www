              <p><strong>Cesc Fabregas has been banned for two games over his behaviour following Arsenal’s FA Cup victory over Hull. </strong></p>
              <p>The club captain entered the field following the 2-1 win at Emirates Stadium on March 17 and Hull boss Phil Brown told Setanta after the game that Fabregas had spat in the direction of assistant manager Brian Horton.</p>
              <p>The FA held an investigation into events and Fabregas has now
              been banned for two domestic matches after he was found guilty of two
              charges of improper conduct.</p>
              <p>Arsenal are not expected to appeal the decision.</p>

              <p><em>Not too sure either, but since they're given untill May 12 to appeal, i guess any ban will be enforced only after that?</em>  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>An FA statement read: “Cesc Fabregas and Phil Brown have both been charged with improper conduct.</p>
              <p>“The charges relate to matters arising from the FA Cup match between Arsenal and Hull at Emirates Stadium on March 17.</p>
              <p>“Fabregas faces two charges of improper conduct relating to his conduct on the pitch following the game.</p>
              <p>“One charge concerns his behaviour in coming onto the pitch after
              the final whistle. The second charge relates to an alleged spitting
              incident.</p>
              <p>“The charges are based on submissions from Hull City and video evidence.</p>
              <p>“Brown is charged with improper conduct and/or bringing the game
              into disrepute in relation to media comments made after the game
              concerning referee Mike Riley.</p>
              <p>“Fabregas and Brown have until May 12 to respond.”</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger says he is bemused at the decision but suggested an appeal may be unlikely.</p>
              <p>"Fabregas has been charged for improper conduct on the night,” he said.</p>
              <p>“I always said we are always very open to co-operate with any investigation.</p>
              <p>"I personally looked at the reports, at the video evidence and there is nothing in there against Cesc.</p>
              <p>“I dont know if we will appeal – I will see what we can do about that.</p>
              <p>"At the start, I am not a great fan of appealing because I said we
              are very open to co-operate and now I don’t think we should stop that.</p>
              <p>"I am very positive that there was enough evidence in what I have seen that the case should have been dropped."</p>

              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood claims that the club have evidence which will clear Cesc Fabregas of improper conduct. </strong></p>
              <p>Fabregas was charged with improper conduct by the
              Football Association on Friday, for his behaviour in the aftermath of
              the FA Cup fifth-round tie with Hull City.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard was out
              injured for the game, but entered the pitch after the final whistle
              when he was alleged to have spat at Hull assistant manager Brian Horton.</p>
              <p>The
              FA has since decided to take action on the issue, judging that the
              incident was a case of improper conduct on two charges - entering the
              pitch and the alleged spitting.</p>
              <p>However, Hill-Wood is confident that the club have taped evidence which will clear Fabregas of any wrongdoing.</p>
              <p>"We have a video of the tunnel which we gave to the FA," the Arsenal chairman told the <em>Daily Star</em>.</p>
              <p>"I
              didn't see it myself but Arsene (Wenger) has and so has (chief
              executive) Ivan Gazidis, and they both said that the whole thing was
              innocuous. I think that the whole thing is ridiculous."</p>

              <p><strong>Cesc Fabregas has hit out at the FA over his improper conduct charge and says his conscience will be clear even if he is found guilty of spitting at </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Hull</strong></span></a><strong> assistant manager Brian Horton.</strong></p>
              <p>The feisty <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> captain said he did not even know he had been charged by the FA on two counts after remonstrating with Hull officials following the Gunners’ fiery 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final win on March 17.</p>
              <p>Fabregas also said players and officials from both clubs should be suspended for encroaching on the playing area following the game if he is punished at this month’s FA hearing into his conduct.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal midfielder said: ‘I don’t really know what I have been charged with. If they suspend me for that (spitting), my heart and mind will be relaxed because I have not done anything wrong.</p>
              <p>‘When I came on to the pitch another eight players were also on the pitch, so everyone should be suspended for that.’</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">Fabregas and Hull manager Phil Brown were charged by the FA last week and their cases are expected to be heard by an independent commission. </h2>
              <p>The Spain playmaker, who was out injured that night, stormed on to the pitch in a hoodie and black leather jacket to remonstrate with Hull’s players and coaching staff.</p>
              <p>According to Hull’s version of events, Fabregas continued the row in the tunnel, where he is alleged to have spat at Horton. Despite a lack of independent witnesses, Hull were so incensed by Fabregas’s alleged behaviour that they sent the FA a dossier of evidence. </p>
              <p>FA chiefs last week charged Fabregas and Brown with improper conduct, Brown for<br>comments about referee Mike Riley. Fabregas and Brown have until May 12 to respond to the charges.</p>
