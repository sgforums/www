              <p><strong>Details emerged last night of the content of the brochure that Michael Owen's management team have sent to </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Premier League</strong></span></a><strong> teams extolling the virtues of their client, who is available on a free transfer. The brochure is also available in Spanish and Italian. Here are some key parts of the sales pitch.</strong></p>
              <p>• A medical review by John Green, Owen's personal physio, says: "Michael approached me following tests at the West of England University, we deduced that his hamstrings were weak. Consequently Michael and I instigated an appropriate regime of strengthening exercises to rectify the muscular imbalances that had been noted. Four months later retests were performed and showed no deficits in strength. Green says that Owen's reputation as an "injury-prone player" is "nonsense".</p>
              <p>• Michael Owen is a global football star. After David beckham he is the best known English player in the world. Were it not for an unhappy spell at Real Madrid and two injury-scarred years at Newcastle, he would be spoken about in the same breath as Torres or Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>• False tabloid claim denied, one: <em>Michael Owen is always injured</em>. Between January 2006 and August 2007 he was. But he has appeared in 75% of Newcastle United's Premier League games, a figure which matches Wayne Rooney, Roque Santa Cruz and Fernando Torres and is higher that Didier Drogba, Robin van Persie and Obafemi Martins.</p>
              <p>• False tabloid claim denied, two: <em>He has lost his desire</em>. Don't believe that for a moment. He is a ruthlessly determined person who is desperate to be back in the England squad.</p>
              <p>• False tabloid claim denied, three: <em>He travels to Newcastle f</em><em>rom his stables in Cheshire every day by helicopter</em>. Michael has never once flown from the stables to Newcastle. He does have an investment in a helicopter company and one of the perks is that in a week when he has a day off, he will use the helicopter to fly to his other family home in Flintshire.</p>
