              <p class="article">Former Kop favourite Michael Owen has been criticised after scoring just once for the Toon during 2009.</p>
              <p class="article">And strike partners Obafemi Martins and Mark Viduka were also slammed as Alan Shearer’s strugglers drew 0-0 with Portsmouth last Monday.</p>
              <p class="article">But Anfield chief Benitez said: “I don’t think they will be playing for a draw. They have quality players in attack.</p>
              <p class="article">“If Manchester United make a mistake then we have to be ready, so we must take three points from each game.”</p>

              <h3>FERNANDO TORRES is out of Liverpool's must-win clash with Newcastle today. The Spanish star is suffering from a hamstring problem which has plagued him all season.</h3>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While it is not bad enough to threaten the remainder of the striker's season, Rafa Benitez has decided not to risk Torres, even though victory over Newcastle is vital if Liverpool are to keep the pressure on Manchester United.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is even more of a blow for Anfield boss Benitez as he was desperate to pair Torres with Steven Gerrard once more after the Liverpool skipper missed the last three games with a groin injury.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Benitez knows that any slip at Anfield this afternoon will virtually hand the title to Manchester United with Sir Alex Ferguson's men currently six points clear.</p>

              <p>The pressure is actually on Liverpool to catch up with MU.</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1176722" rel="1176722|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1176722/Humiliation-Owen-Striker-dropped-Lovenkrands-Shearer-hopes-Anfield-miracle.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Michael Owen faces a double dose of humiliation on Sunday when he makes an emotional return to Liverpool and the ground where he made his name as the most exciting teenage striker in Europe.</strong></p>
              <p>Owen is set to be dropped for a game at Anfield that is crucial to<a href="http://http//www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/newcastle-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"> Newcastle's</span></a> future as manager Alan Shearer opts to start with Peter Lovenkrands, an unsung Dane who arrived at St James' Park in January on a free transfer.</p>
              <p>And the 29-year-old's hopes of a dream move back to his beloved Liverpool in the summer have been firmly ruled out by manager Rafael Benitez, even though Owen would be available on a free transfer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only silver lining for Newcastle ahead of a game they cannot afford to lose is that Liverpool's star striker, Fernando Torres, is a major doubt with a hamstring injury after taking part in only limited training sessions over the past 72 hours.</p>
              <p>Shearer, accused of sitting on the fence too often as a TV pundit, is prepared to show his bold side as he seeks his first win as interim manager standing in for Joe Kinnear.</p>
              <p>With Newcastle stuck in the bottom three and staring a financially-catastrophic relegation in the face, Shearer is prepared to sacrifice Owen, his close friend, after a spell of one goal in 14 games to accommodate the only two fit left-footed players at the club, Lovenkrands and Damien Duff.</p>
              <p>Former Rangers striker Lovenkrands has scored twice since joining Newcastle and, crucially, he is seen as a better foil to Mark Viduka and Obafemi Martins, although Owen will still be called upon from the bench if Newcastle need a goal.</p>
              <p>The decision will be a bitter blow to Owen, who, from comments on his website, is not expecting to be dropped. The £100,000-a-week striker says: 'I wake up and know where I stand in terms of performance, my standing in the game, the goals I will score, given the opportunities. I have been around a long time and everyone knows if I get the chances I will score goals.</p>

              <p><strong>'We have to be brave and positive. We go to Liverpool and we finish the season at Aston Villa. If we can get some points from those games we'll grasp them. But it's the next home games against Middlesbrough and Fulham that are the focus.'</strong></p>
              <p>The reality is, however, that Owen wants to quit the north-east when his contract ends in the summer after three injuryhit years following a £17 million move from Real Madrid. Everton and Villa are looking at him but it emerged last night there is no chance of him winning a dream move back to Anfield, where he scored 158 goals between 1998 and 2004.</p>
              <p>Benitez is not interested in landing Owen, five years after selling him to Madrid. The Spaniard is aware of the club's history and once re-signed Kop legend Robbie Fowler to use him sparingly as a fourth-choice striker. But he will not do the same with Owen.</p>
              <p>Benitez said last night: 'The situation with Michael is different to what it was with Robbie. Robbie understood his role, he came here at a certain time in his career and it was a fantastic opportunity for him.</p>

              <p><strong>Ironically, Benitez faces a major dilemma over playing £27m Torres today after the recurrence of a hamstring injury as Liverpool try to keep the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester United.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez is having to consider wrapping Torres in cotton wool after confirming a Mail on Sunday story that the Spanish superstar will have just a three-week break between playing in the Confederations Cup for his country in South Africa on June 28 and joining up with Liverpool for their pre-season tour of Asia.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have accepted a lucrative fee to play in Thailand and Singapore in mid-July but have to play Torres and Steven Gerrard as part of the deal.</p>
              <p>Although Benitez would ideally like to have left Torres at home, he is reluctant to make it a huge issue as the tour revenue forms part of his summer transfer budget.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: 'I am sure Torres will go to the Confederations Cup and he will also go to Asia.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>'So he will have three weeks' break while the other players will have five weeks. 'It is a situation we can not change so we have to manage Torres in the best way. We know when he and Stevie are fit, the team is better.'</p>
              <p>Shearer was hailed as Newcastle's messiah when he arrived at St James' Park five weeks ago to fill in for Joe Kinnear, who is recovering from a heart operation.</p>
              <p>But Newcastle have won only two points from a possible 12 under Shearer and the pressure is on. 'I still believe that we'll have enough to stay up,' he said. 'The games are running out and it's easy for me to say that, but if I don't believe, who will?'</p>
              <p>The former St James' Park captain continued the guessing game about his future, saying: 'It's not relevant, not important. I said at the beginning I'm not getting involved in all that. It's not something I should be talking about - what I should be talking about is Anfield.'</p>
              <p>Shearer admitted that choosing between Owen, Martins and Viduka represented a tougher decision than naming all three to start at Anfield. And he raised the intriguing prospect of starting the game with three central defenders.</p>
              <p>'I played it at Stoke and for part of the game at Spurs but it's another matter whether I go to Anfield with three or not,' said Shearer. 'First and foremost, I'm looking for a performance and hopefully it will be enough to get a result.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We have to go there and put in a good shift and a good fight. They have a hell of a lot to play for and so have we.'</p>

              <h1 class="sIFR-ignore">Rafa rules out Anfield return for Owen</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/newcastle/owen_down_480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez has told Michael Owen that no amount of goals at Anfield on Sunday will convince him to re-sign the Newcastle man. </strong></p>
              <p>Owen could find himself axed for the Sunday encounter as Alan
              Shearer tinkers with the 4-3-3 formation he tried against Potsmouth,
              but Benitez will not be the man to rescue the former Liverpool man in
              the summer.</p>
              <p>Liverpool are widely recognised as needing backup for Fernando
              Torres but, unlike when Benitez signed Robbie Fowler, the Spaniard
              insists Owen is not set for an emotional reunion.</p>
              <p>“I think it’s a different situation to the Robbie Fowler one.
              Robbie knew it was a fantastic opportunity for him to come back,”
              Benitez was quoted as saying in The Sunday Star.</p>
              <p>“He had been injured and had not played games in a row. And we
              were looking for a striker of his quality. We were looking for this
              kind of player.</p>
              <p>“He understood clearly what his role was. Michael is younger
              and still has a lot of years to play, so it is a different situation.</p>
              <p>“Clearly he’s a top class striker so he will want to play every
              game. But as this moment we are really pleased with Fernando Torres.”</p>
