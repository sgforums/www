Had they been determined to stop the rot they would have done so even under David O'Leary. The fact that he failed to improve Villa's position points to a lack of motivation skills and the player's own low morale and lack of unity.<br><br>O'Neill has been known as an excellent motivator and his 'pied piper' acolyte is not unjustified. I've always held him in high regard and Villa made the best buy when they signed him.<br><br>When a club screws up, both sides - players and coach - share the blame. The coach is of course the convenient target since sacking one person is easier than sacking a starting XI.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>why issit when a club screw up, both sides, players and manager take the blame and when a club do well only the manager takes the credit??<br><br>the players deserves credit as well, there's got to be quality in the players to do well or else even the best motivator can't do anything if there's no quality in the team at all.</div>

This is precisely what O'neill has brought to the club, the fact that he can make not just 1, not just 2 but a number of players who have been there for the past few years suddenly play to their potential.<br><br>I belief a lot of effort was put into it to turn the club around. And for this, he deserve the most credit. But of course, the club on the whole will benefit the most.</div>
