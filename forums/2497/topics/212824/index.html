It is a known fact that most lesser teams playing away against teams like Pool, United, Gunners as well as Chelsea would naturally defend after they get an equalizer. Especially when they know they can get a point from a difficult away match.<br><br>Even big teams like the 4 mentioned would do the same thing when they play difficult away matches in Europe. So nothing to complain about, if you can't break them, its only the fault of your own strikers and team to blame.<br><br>OÂ’Neill has only added the Bulgarian Stiliyan Petrov to villa and how much they have changed compare to O' leary's time when players like Berry wanted to leave the club.</div>

Had they been determined to stop the rot they would have done so even under David O'Leary. The fact that he failed to improve Villa's position points to a lack of motivation skills and the player's own low morale and lack of unity.<br><br>O'Neill has been known as an excellent motivator and his 'pied piper' acolyte is not unjustified. I've always held him in high regard and Villa made the best buy when they signed him.<br><br>When a club screws up, both sides - players and coach - share the blame. The coach is of course the convenient target since sacking one person is easier than sacking a starting XI.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
