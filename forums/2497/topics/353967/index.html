              <p> </p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Arsenal's players are becoming fed-up with the attitude of captain Cesc Fabregas, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p>The <em>News of the World</em> says within the confines of the
              Emirates, insiders have detected a marked change in Fabregas's attitude
              since he returned victorious from Spain's success in last summer's
              European Championships.</p>
              <p>A Gunners insider said: "Fabregas has changed since he came
              back from the European Championships. It's as if he thinks he's made it
              because Spain won.</p>
              <p>"It was the same with Thierry Henry in his last season - but at
              least Henry had won everything and had a right to swagger around.
              People are scared to confront Fabregas in case they upset him and he
              decides to walk in the summer.</p>
              <p>"But as far as most of the players are concerned, he's going anyway and there is a real arrogance to him now."</p>
              <p>There is a growing belief amongst Arsenal players and officials that his swagger is threatening the dressing room harmony.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal source said: "Fabregas is almost a law unto himself.
              He walks around like he owns the place and that's put more than a few
              noses out of joint.</p>
              <p>"A lot of the players think he'll be off in the summer to
              Barcelona - or maybe even Real Madrid - and that he's just swaggering
              around until he goes.</p>
              <p>"The problem is, he gets away with it. There were a lot of
              people at the club who were surprised when he was allowed to go back to
              Spain for several weeks to do his injury rehabilitation because it's
              normally a strict policy that rehab is overseen by Arsenal medical
              staff."</p>

              <p>no pt to held a player if he think he is bigger than the club.</p>
              <p>that is what happen when you dont have a senior local english player who are tough enough to have a go at fab. players such as terry, lampard, gerrard etc.</p>
