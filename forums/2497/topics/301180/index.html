            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/67/285x214/30319_1.jpg"><br><br><strong>CRISTIANO Ronaldo is now valued at an astonishing Â£75million by Manchester United, who have already had an approach from Real Madrid for the January transfer window. That figure would eclipse the previous world-record fee of Â£49m that Real paid for Zinedine Zidane in 2001. A leading agent told me last night: Â“A few days ago, as the transfer window opened, Real Madrid made it plain they would pay 60m euros (Â£44.3m), but Manchester UnitedÂ’s response was emphatic.</strong><br><br>Â“They told Real not to come back with anything less than 100m euros (Â£73.9m) Â– and even then there is no guarantee that they would would take it.Â” Whether the initial Â‘offerÂ’ and the reply came from agents rather than directly from the clubs is debatable. But there is no doubt Real want Ronaldo Â– badly enough to break the record fee.<br><br>But Sir Alex Ferguson would not entertain losing Ronaldo Â– either now, or in the summer when Real are sure to come back with a renewed bid if their January probings fail. The wealthiest club in the world may balk at more than Â£70m for Ronaldo, but it is certain they are ready to offer in excess of Â£50m for the Portuguese wonder boy, as their first approach is merely an opening gambit.<br><br>Ronaldo, I believe, has made up his mind to go to Madrid, and Real have already been working on an agreement with his agent. A deal has already been hatched in outline before United get to the table. It is usual for agents to work out personal terms well in advance, and RealÂ’s conviction that they can get their man is helped by the knowledge the salary package can be resolved before the playerÂ’s present club are contacted.<br><br>Ferguson, though, is far from impressed with such tactics. He sanctioned the departure of David Beckham, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Gabriel Heinze to Real, but those players he really wants to keep will not be allowed an easy passage. Players tend to leave Old Trafford when the manager wants them out. It is going to be a fascinating power struggle between United and Real over Ronaldo in the coming weeks and, more likely, months. As for the authenticity of our New YearÂ’s Day exclusive, forecasting a bid by Real, it is now an open secret in Spain the club have targeted Ronaldo.<br><br>Usually reluctant to discuss their prime transfer targets, Real are unusually bullish. As president Ramon Calderon said: Â“Who would not want a player such as Ronaldo in their team? He is one of the best players in the world.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually stell does have a point... Cos apart from becoming the most famous footballer in the world, he is also arguably the world's best player... Entertainment value is priceless, and Real wants to play entertaining football. Even Kaka does not possess the dribbling skill to make the fans stand up and wow kind of way. And considering that he is 22, he still has a good 10 yrs ahead of him. And that is a very long time for a footballer's career at the top.<br><br>They paid $25m for Beck but i think they got every cent worth out of it and they even became the world's richest club while he was there and now it looks like they will lose that title very soon if without a new icon to generate interest in their club...</div>

R99, Mancini, Robinho...even your typical Schools A/B Division kid is doing them!!!<br><br>looks brilliant in the beginning, but wtf everyone is doing stepovers, not sian meh? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cristiano Ronaldo being the so-called king of them is like a clown performing tricks at the circus... maybe he can join the Moscow circus when he retires!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>anyway it will be a stupid move for him to join Real Madrid. if he should go anywhere in Spain, Barca should be his destination instead of Real. at least he is more or less guaranteed a first team place if Ronaldinho leaves.</div></blockquote>Yeah right...  "he is able to push the ball away from himself yet collect it back " I have seen a lot of defenders doing this as well... and to be honest, there is nothing wow about it... Honestly...<br><br>Stepovers, yeah maybe there are a few more doing it but are they doing it well? Attractive? And in an effective manner? Cos i know SWP also does quite alot of it or try to do it very often but is he effective? That is the question... And it don't look one bit sian at all each time he successfully execute it... cos it makes the match more exciting.<br><br>Kaka was pretty lucky that his AC Milan wasn't even challenging for the Serie A title last season... They could fully concentrate their energy and attention to the only trophy that they could get. And i won't be surprise again if they do the same thing before they meet the gunners next month by resting the whole squad the week before they play them... But the gunners can't do the same can they? As they are still challenging for a "bigger prize", The League Title. They have Blackburn then Aston Villa 3 days before they meet Milan in Italy... That can't be easy, if they rest players like Milan does, they will probably drop valuable points, and they can't afford that. Milan on the other hand don't have this problem... Cos they are currently on 12th place in the Serie A, tho they may have a few games in hand but it still isn't a good excuse to be so many points apart from Inter considering the players they have and were not deducted any points this season unlike the last right?<br><br>What could be the reason? One thought come to mind is... Because the players isn't performing? We have watch highlights of Kaka's play, watch AC Milan a bit last season and a bit this in their highlight games... But have we watch how they play in Serie A this season? I guess a lot of us haven't right... Play 14, won 4, lost 4, draw 6... They even lost 1 - 2 at home to a team called Catania Calcio recently. If Kaka is performing in these "smaller" matches, then i don't think AC would be in their current position wouldn't you agree... If as you have said, he "simple yet oh so effective dummies takes him off 5 seconds faster than C.R. and the way he is able to push the ball away from himself yet collect it back and still managing to throw off several opponents at one go" My take is if he does this more often perhaps AC wouldn't be 25 points from Inter right? I think they are the Tottenham of Italian football currently... And coincidentally, Tottenham is also 12th in the EPL...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I think the problem is he only wants to perform in "Big matches" and maybe disinterest with the smaller ones. Some players have this problem... Sometimes we all forget that we are not watching them weekly or very often and we only remember highlights of their "good performance" therefore we think they are really great... But if we were to watch AC's matches against Palermo, Empoli, Roma, Catania Calcio... we may get a better picture. Apart from the Palermo match, the other 3 lost were all at home ground... Where was Kaka? He probably look ordinary in those games... But it doesn't mean he won't perform against the Gunners, cos thats a big match afterall and i belief he will have enough rest before that match too.<br><br>Before Shevchenko came to Chelsea, a lot of us here felt that Wow, he was such a great player, top scorer in Italian Serie A, Footballer of the year all that... Then after watching him week in week out... All that mystery seem to have evaporated wouldn't you agree... Not saying Kaka isn't a good player, but just that different people have different preference thats all... And if you prefer exciting football, Ronaldo makes a better option...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Of course i know one man don't make the team! Otherwise i wouldn't have said "What could be the reason? One thought come to mind is... Because the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">players</span> isn't performing?" But one man can inspire the team and this is true.<br><br>No one is blaming an individual here... But since Deunamist and me are just discussing between 2 individuals styles here thats all, of his preference and mine... on players who anchors their team chances to greater heights.<br><br>But to be fair to Diego Maradona, he one man really did make a difference to the Napoli side... as he elevated the team to its most successful era. Napoli won their only Italian Championships to date (1986/87 and 1989/1990), a Coppa Italia (1987), a UEFA Cup (1989) and an Italian Supercup (1990) after he started playing for them and have not won any more Serie A titles after he left. It still remain their most successful era to this day...<br><br>And also the 1986 World Cup winning Argentina national team too... I think we are all aware how he single handedly won the match for them against England with what is still consider by most as the best individual goal ever scored at a world cup finals. And i don't mean the "Hand of God" goal.<br><br>This was one man that made the difference or one man who made the team...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
