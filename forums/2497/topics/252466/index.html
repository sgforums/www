Liverpool merely have a fixture. If you want to know why Rafael Benitez is the last manager standing in the PremiershipÂ’s great advance on Athens, this is your answer.</strong><br><br>AC Milan and BenitezÂ’s Liverpool have one thing in common as they prepare to meet in the European Cup final. Both gave up on their domestic league campaigns without a fight. For Milan, winning the Serie A title was a non-starter after they were deducted eight points for their part in the Tangentopoli scandal of last year. Liverpool have no such excuse.<br><br>But for years now, they have been incapable of mounting a serious assault on a prize they once used to wrap up before Easter. Two years ago, when they won the Champions League, this failure to engage with Chelsea, United and Arsenal in the nine-month dogfight did not infuriate as much as it does now.<br><br>Come May 23, this dissatisfaction with BenitezÂ’s team will be set aside again because Liverpool will be flying the national flag in Greece. But there is no denying that Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho were absolutely correct this week to point out that they booby-trapped their own campaigns in Europe by fighting on so many fronts.<br><br>It is hard to condemn Liverpool for reaching the European Cup final for the second time in three years. Who wants to anyway? A potentially epic night awaits. Yet it is undeniable that United and Chelsea have shown more spirit and courage than Liverpool simply by taking on so many challenges and keeping them going for so long.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now claim down, claim down allentyb... Don't look at it with such a narrow mind... No one is putting Pool's achievements down. This is basically said for the good of all English Teams in the future, including Pool. This is not something to defend United or Chelsea, it is just to highlight and hopefully the FA will realise it someday why is it so difficult for EPL clubs to do both in the same year. . .<br><br>You cannot deny this is a fact, there are 50 yrs of statistics to back this up... Stop whining man, everyone knows pool wants to win the EPL title more than anything... I bet they would even trade the CL for the EPL title if given a choice.<br><br>Every top team start out the season with the intent to win the league title but somewhere in the middle, they feel they cannot make it then they give up preferring to concentrate on one which is nothing wrong. And in a way, it has helped Pool's achieve great results in Europe. This has been Pool's experience over the last 4, 5 years isn't it?<br><br>I have no doubt about the agony of a liverpool fan like you and some others, and how much they would love to win the EPL title which they have made it theirs during the 70s and 80s... But lets face it, winning the EPL title takes far more than winning the CL.<br><br>On a personal note, i don't give a damn what you post, you can post whatever you wish, its a free forum where everyone can express their opinions. That i respect... If you wish to be 10 times, 100x or 1000x better than GP, its your choice... and i will also respect it. No one least of all me is going to stand in your way.<br><br>And fyi, in 1999 when united won the treble, SAF did complaint about the fixtures too. So don't assume he didn't just because he won...<br><br><strong>The end-of-season trilogy between Manchester United and Chelsea has been down-graded to a duology and those familiar with the history of English clubs on the Continent may not be surprised. Scaling twin peaks to become champions of England and Europe has generally proved a mountain too far and this week Sir Alex Ferguson and JosÃ© Mourinho have been thwarted in their attempts to plant flags on both summits.</strong><br><br>United and Chelsea, the only realistic challengers for the Barclays Premiership title since November, meet in a league match at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday and again on May 19 at Wembley in the FA Cup Final. But their hopes of a third showdown in the Champions League final collapsed and the match will feature instead a Liverpool side vastly inferior to both on the domestic front.<br><br>Of the 14 English teams to have reached the final of EuropeÂ’s senior club competition, only three have collected the league title that season. Of the remaining 11 instances, only United, in 1968, came close to winning the league. The other ten, the latest being Liverpool this season, have been well off the pace.<br><br>Even the three sides to have achieved this double hardly ran away with the domestic title. When United won the treble in 1999, they edged past Arsenal to win the Premiership crown with only 79 points, since when the average number of points recorded by champions has been 88. Liverpool, who recorded the other two such examples of triumph at home and in Europe, won the league by one point in 1977 and by three points in 1984.<br><br>There have been some dismal failures to add success at home to European Cup final appearances. In 1975, Leeds United lost to Bayern Munich but finished ninth in the table; in 1982, Aston Villa beat Bayern in the final but came eleventh in the league.<br><br>This is the third consecutive season when an English finalist has been hopelessly off the pace in the Premiership. Liverpool finished 37 points behind the champions in 2005, Arsenal 24 points behind last year and Liverpool are 18 points from the top now, having played one game more.<br><br>It has also proved hard to maintain a continental push while enjoying a good FA Cup run. Of the 14 English finalists in the European Cup, only two reached the FA Cup Final that season Â— Liverpool lost to Manchester United at Wembley in 1977 while United beat Newcastle United in 1999 en route to their treble. Of the past three English finalists in the Champions League, Liverpool exited the FA Cup at the first hurdle this year and in 2005, while Arsenal went out in the fourth round last season.<br><br>Challenging for trophies at home and abroad is perhaps tough psychologically as well as physically and, in the case of the latter, it has become no easier as the workload in Europe has increased. Liverpool have played 14 matches in the Champions League this season to reach the final, whereas they needed only either six or eight games to reach each of their five finals of the 1970s and 1980s.<br><br>Yet, while English sides have toiled to excel simultaneously at home and abroad, clubs from other countries have not experienced such great problems. Of the 90 non-English finalists in EuropeÂ’s leading club competition since it began in 1955-56, 40 won their domestic title that season.<br><br>How can this difference be explained? Until recent years, leading clubs in this country played far more than their counterparts abroad because of the 22-team top division, unlimited FA Cup replays and the presence of a second domestic knockout competition, the League Cup. Cutting the league to 20 clubs and scrapping FA Cup second replays and League Cup replays has largely removed that disadvantage but the English league is still considered by many to be more physically demanding than others in Europe.<br><br>Whatever the reasons, bookmakers who have avoided paying out fortunes on a United treble or Chelsea quadruple will be thankful for the continued difficulties faced by multitasking clubs in this country.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liverpool just not consistent enough to win the league.<br><br>Also depends on the manager.<br>Rafa is really better in European stage. He can beat Barca better than he can beat Bolton. Seriously don't think Liverpool will win the EPL under him. Actually winning the UCL is the only thing more or less keeping Stevie G from moving so they really need the UCL.<br><br>SAF is more of a local lad. At home and in England, he is pretty strong and solid. But once he go overseas, he will crumble one. Somehow, I feel he don't have the tatical ability of the Rafa or Mourinho to do well on UCL and usually fares badly against the stronger teams.<br><br>Mourinho is sort of the more balanced type. At home, he can get the job done, on European stage he can also do well. Something like the mix of Rafa and SAF. In fact, I think he made Chelsea pretty solid and with a little luck can win the quadruple. Just that his football abit boring and he tok too much.<br></div>
