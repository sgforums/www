            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Holland U21 4-1 Serbia U21</strong></span><br><br>Maceo Rigters picked up the golden boot as Holland Under-21s retained their European Championship crown by crushing 10-man Serbia in soggy Groningen.<br><br>Rigters scored his fourth goal of the tournament hosted by the Dutch but the damage had already been inflicted by Otman Bakkal and Ryan Babel before the NAC Breda forward edged ahead of Leroy Lita in the goalscoring charts.<br><br>After Rigters slotted in his goal, Aleksandar Kolarov was dismissed, Babel had a penalty saved and Dragan Mrdja pulled one back in a one-sided final which meant back-to-back titles for Foppe De Haan's youngsters. Substitute Luigi Bruins completed the scoring with a late tap-in.<br><br>Referee Damir Skomina was told to halt the final if there was a repeat of the racist chants that marred Serbia's clash with England earlier in the tournament. Although flares were lit just after the interval, play at Euroborg Stadion went on uninterrupted.<br><br>Skomina was kept busy early on with matters on the pitch as tackles flew in on the slick surface, with Roysten Drenthe given a ninth-minute yellow card for clipping Antonio Rukavina.<br><br>Drenthe, Holland's player of the tournament, missed a chance at the far post in the opening stages, but Jong Oranje were ahead in the 17th minute.<br><br>Daniel De Ridder dribbled in from the right flank and flicked the ball over the Serbia defence, with Bakkal holding off Rukavina and stabbing home.<br><br>Bakkal had a chance to double his tally but had an effort saved, while De Ridder sliced a glorious opportunity over when he was found at the far post.<br><br>Despite looking good value for their lead, the hosts were given a huge let-off nine minutes from the break when goalkeeper Boy Waterman totally mis-judged a tame free-kick from Kolarov, with the ball rebounding off the upright.<br><br>Waterman also missed a corner but Dusko Tosic could not direct his header in.<br><br>The Holland goalkeeper made saves after the interval from Dusan Basta and Bosko Jankovic, yet Babel doubled the lead on the hour mark. Serbia failed to clear De Ridder's low cross from the right and Babel steered the ball.<br><br>It got worse for Serbia as Kolarov was dismissed for two bookings, the second for sliding in on Babel just after he scored.<br><br>Babel set up Rigters to round Damir Kahriman in the 67th minute and finish for his goal, but Kahriman then clawed away Babel's spot-kick.<br><br>Mrdja's consolation came from a near-post header with 11 minutes remaining, and Bruins tapped in to complete the scoring.<br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>
