              <p><span><strong>Carlo Ancelotti was in the French capital on Wednesday night to take over as coach of mega-rich Paris Saint-Germain - and is expected to make Chelsea defender Alex his first signing.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The ex-Stamford Bridge boss is believed to have agreed a two-and-a-half-year deal worth £6million a season at PSG.</span></p>
              <p><span>The French club have joined Europe’s biggest spenders after being taken over by the Qatar Investment Authority in May.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti will replace Antoine Kombouare who, despite leading PSG to the top of Ligue 1 this season, was axed by the Arab owners as they try to rival the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Italian, who has been out of work since leaving Chelsea in May, is expected to fly out to the Middle East on Sunday to join PSG’s winter camp in Dubai, which finishes with a friendly against another of his former clubs, AC Milan, on January 4.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span>By then, Ancelotti will hope to have tied up a deal for Brazilian defender Alex, on the transfer list and banned from the training ground at Chelsea after falling out of favour with manager Andre Villas-Boas. </span></p>
              <p><span>Alex has made just three Barclays Premier League appearances this season. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti’s move has also sparked speculation that Didier Drogba and Florent Malouda could follow Alex to Paris, while the 52-year-old has also been linked with moves for his old Milan stars Alexandre Pato and Kaka, who is now at Real Madrid.</span></p>
              <p><span>Another Milan old boy, David Beckham, is understood to have agreed a lucrative deal at PSG once his LA Galaxy contract runs out at the turn of the year.</span></p>

              <p><span>Ancelotti, sacked by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich in May despite leading the Blues to a Barclays Premier League and FA Cup Double in his first season 12 months earlier, will team up with his former Milan colleague Leonardo, who is sporting director at PSG. </span></p>
              <p><span>Ancelotti, likely to be unveiled on Friday or Saturday, will be joined by coaches Giorgio Ciaschini and Giovanni Mauri, both of whom worked with him at Chelsea, along with the ex-France midfielder Sabri Lamouchi.</span></p>

              <p>The former England captain, 36, is on the verge of signing a £160,000-a- week deal for 18 months.</p>
              <p>While former Chelsea boss Ancelotti put pen to paper after French league leaders PSG ditched Antoine Kombouare yesterday.</p>
              <p>The Italian is expected to pick up £110,000 a week over 2½ years — a total of £14.3m — making him the highest paid boss in French football.</p>
              <p>Both men's bumper pay packets will be paid by the Qatar Investment Authority who run PSG.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti, 52, has been waiting for another top job in England after being axed by Chelsea in May.</p>
              <p>He will forego five months' cash from the Blues to move to Paris.</p>
              <p>Becks, whose five-year deal with LA Galaxy ends on Saturday, could be one of a number of signings.</p>
              <p>Chelsea forward Florent Malouda and Real Madrid's Kaka are other targets.</p>
              <p>Beckham's mega money has outraged French left-wing politicians.</p>

              <p>French league not that fast mah. And those players you mentioned won't make them an attraction also despite being there for a while already unlike the arrival of Beck. All the media circus will make them more noticeable within days or weeks.</p>
              <p>Just like who knew a club by the name of LA Galaxy existed prior to Beck's arrival... lol.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Beck can still play no too badly and the French league isn't too demanding for his 36 yrs old bones i guess...  </p>
