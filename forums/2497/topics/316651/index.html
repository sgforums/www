              <p><em>High flyer: Mathieu Flamini is reportedly doubling his wages after his free transfer to AC Milan</em></p>
              <h1>Mathieu Flamini's Milan move unsettles Arsenal</h1>
              <p>
              </p><p class="small"><a href="http://sgforums.j37.com/forums/2497/topics/#comments"></a></p>
              <strong>Arsenal are preparing for a summer of significant change both on and off the pitch after Mathieu Flamini yesterday completed his move to AC Milan on a free transfer. The departure of such a key member of this year's squad represents a big blow at the end of a third successive season without silverware and is likely to add to a period of considerable reflection at the Emirates Stadium.</strong><p></p>
              <p class="story">Arsenal do not have the reputation of being among the highest payers in European football and it is believed that AC Milan were willing to pay Flamini double the estimated £50,000-a-week that was on offer for him to stay at the Emirates.</p>
              <p class="story">Wenger has admitted to a feeling that money was a main factor in Flamini's departure, yet he remains adamant that the club must continue to follow a wage strategy in line with their "natural resources". He is mindful of the club's debt on the new stadium, though further funds should soon become available from the residential development at Highbury Square.</p>
              <p class="story">The risk of losing other important players is obvious but, having constructed a young squad with such skill and care, Wenger's caution is also understandable. He is planning to make selective additions this summer and it is understood that the board are willing to make around £30 million available. Wenger, though, is expected to stick to his philosophy of developing emerging young players and the 20-year-old Lyon winger, Hatem Ben Arfa, is among his targets. Wenger will also consider whether to promote the Spanish midfielder Fran Merida from the reserves.</p>
              <p class="story">As well as Flamini, Jens Lehmann will definitely depart, leaving a need for added experience in goal as well as at the centre of defence. T<span style="color: #000000;">he departure last week of managing director Keith Edelman also strongly </span>suggests a change of approach in the transfer market. While Wenger retains full control over football matters, the new managing director, who is expected to be in place by November, will play a far bigger role in transfer negotiations.</p>
              <p class="story"> </p>

              <p class="story">Flamini yesterday completed his medical at Milan after arriving in Italy on Sunday. He will join a hugely experienced midfield that already includes Clarence Seedorf and Massimo Ambrosini, while Milan have moved to reassure their supporters that Gennaro Gattuso is not poised to leave.</p>
              <p class="story">"Flamini is not here to replace Gattuso. He can play in any position in midfield," said Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani. Gattuso placed a question mark over his Serie A future by saying last week he would love to play in the Premier League.</p>

              <h1 class="heading"><strong>Mathieu Flamini yesterday dealt a significant blow to Arsène Wenger’s future plans by signing a four-year contract with AC Milan, as <em>The Times</em> reported he would last month, and the France midfield player is unlikely to be the only unwanted departure from Arsenal this summer.</strong></h1>
              <p class="heading"><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44194000/jpg/_44194391_arsenalgoalscorers203.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="152"></p>

              <div id="related-article-links">
              <p>Alexander Hleb, the Belarus midfield player, has confided in several of his team-mates that he is planning to join Inter Milan and his representatives are understood to have agreed a four-year deal with the Italian champions. With two years remaining on his contract, Arsenal will battle to keep hold of Hleb, with Wenger threatening to report Inter to Fifa allegedly for making an illegal approach that has yet to be made into a firm bid.</p>
              <p>Hleb, 27, is understood to be frustrated by Arsenal’s failure to win silverware, as well as concerned that the club’s pay structure will prevent him earning what he could pick up elsewhere, particularly given the policy of awarding only one-year extensions to players approaching 30.</p>
              <p>Arsenal’s pay policy has effectively cost them Flamini, who rejected two contract offers to sign a £50,000-a-week deal at Milan. The 24-year-old flew to Italy after attending Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Everton on Sunday, dining at the Giannino restaurant owned by Kaká, the Milan and Brazil forward, with club officials before having a three-hour medical at the club’s training ground yesterday.</p>
              <p>Arsenal’s failure to keep Flamini will raise serious questions about their ability to compete with Europe’s leading clubs, but the departure of Jens Lehmann is less significant. The Germany goalkeeper yesterday thanked Wenger for permitting him a tearful farewell to the fans for the final 20 minutes against Everton, ensuring a turbulent final season at the club ended on good terms.</p>
              <p>“It was quite emotional and I had one or two tears in my eyes, as it was a great farewell for me,” Lehmann said. “This farewell will always stay in my heart. In terms of life, in terms of learning something about football, in terms of being part of a team which is playing probably the most attractive football, Arsenal has been really good.”</p>

              <p><br>I do not blame Flamini. On the other hand, I feel that Arsenal have no ambition at all.  Nothing but a feeder club. Take in young players, train them and then let them sign for the bigger clubs.</p>
              <p>When Arsenal failed to win any trophy, excuses such as 'the squad is young and inexperienced', 'we will be better next season' can be heard.</p>
              <p>How many more seasons do we need to wait? 1? 5? 10!!?? And by the rate we are losing our core players, I fear for Arsenal's future on the pitch, especially next season.</p>
              <p>Go ahead and sign more 'young and talented' players if you want, Wenger. But you <strong>won't</strong> win any trophy with youngsters. You din show any ambition at all despite the fact you keep talking about it in the press.</p>

              <p>What i have all along said was the Arsenal board are just interested on their year end directors fee... These so called English directors are still there and have not sold out yet is because they know Arsenal FC continue to show good profits yearly...</p>
              <p>They are not there because they all love the club... They are only waiting for their big pay day before they cash in... and with the Tv money coming in from this year onwards... The bigger stadium and more expensive tickets... you can understand why they will want to hold on for another 2, 3 yrs... So right now, The lesser they spend, the more they get to share among themselves when it comes to dividend time...</p>
              <p>I belief in 2 to 3 yrs, when they do sell, they won't want to be the ones footing the huge transfer fee of the player or players as they will have to sell him or them along with the club as a fixed asset...</p>
