Although the Eastlands outfit have refused to name the player, it is thought Barton has been punished by manager Stuart Pearce for a training ground altercation with team-mate Ousmane Dabo.</strong><br><br>The midfielder, who is no stranger to controversy, will now miss Saturday's Manchester derby at Eastlands as well as the final game of the season against Tottenham, and there must be some doubt as to whether the Merseysider will ever play for the club again.<br><br>It is the latest in a string of recent problems Pearce has had to deal with during a difficult season in which many fans have called for his head. First skipper Richard Dunne then, much more forcefully, England midfielder Barton have criticised some of their team-mates in interviews.<br><br>Barton went so far as to claim he would not have paid to watch City in action this season such has been the lack of entertainment at Eastlands. Saturday's loss to Aston Villa means Pearce's men have still not scored a Premiership goal on home soil since New Year's Day, a sorry run that will be extended until August at least should they fail to find the net against United.<br><br>Boos have rung around Eastlands after almost every game this season, with Pearce's credibility among City fans not helped by the manner in which he pursued the job of coaching England's Under-21 side even though members of the Blues hierarchy made it plain they felt it would have a detrimental effect on his job.<br><br></div>

Dabo, 31, was left unconscious and with a bruised eye after Barton's attack. "I went to turn around, he hit me and knocked me out. He is a despicable coward, it wasn't a fair fight," Dabo told L'Equipe. "I am disfigured. "This is why I am in serious talks with my lawyers to see what I can do. This should not be allowed to happen."</strong><br><br>Dabo also accused the Professional Footballers' Association of trying to help Barton but not getting in touch with him, a claim chief executive Gordon Taylor denies. "We've been in touch with Manchester City and have been trying to make contact with both players," said Taylor. "As regards Dabo, [PFA executive] Richard Jobson is looking to make contact with him because he deals with his brother Moussa at Oldham on a regular basis."<br><br>Dabo had to be taken to hospital after Tuesday's incident, which has led to City banning Barton until the end of the season. But boss Stuart Pearce says the matter will not affect the club ahead of the Manchester derby against United on Saturday. "There will be no negative response," said Pearce. "The way the squad have handled everything has been a credit to themselves. I am sure they are galvanised by it.<br><br>"The matter is now the subject of an internal disciplinary hearing. "The board will be involved, as will myself, and we will deal with it after the season ends." Barton's agent Willie McKay said on Wednesday that he had been banned by City because he was "an easy target" and that he was acting "in self-defence". McKay also suggested he was Dabo's agent, a claim the Frenchman was quick to deny.<br><br>"Let's get one thing clear," added Dabo in the Daily Telegraph. "McKay has never been my agent. He only assisted my real agent with my transfer last summer. "Secondly, he should have checked his facts before saying I was the aggressor. "He has actually called me since to apologise for getting the story wrong, but it's too late because in the eyes of many I'm seen as the one who started the fight. "But that's absolutely not true and that is why I'm so keen to get my side of the story across."<br></div>
