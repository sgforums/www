              <p>The coach of Brazil is "Dunga." That's it, just Dunga. If there was
              ever the epitome of the Brazilian soccer culture, it's that even their
              coach goes by a single name.</p>
              <p>Carlos Caetano Bledorn "Dunga" Verri was first a player too, of course. He captained the 1994 World Cup winning Brazilian team.</p>
              <p>Past glory and one-name recognition isn't helping him much though as
              he continues to deal with one of the most unusual coaching criticism
              campaigns ever.</p>
              <p>Brazil is unbeaten and headed to the quarterfinals of the World Cup
              after taking Chile out behind the woodshed here 3-0 Monday night. Yet
              Dunga still faces an army of skeptics who are more interested in how
              Brazil wins, not just that it wins.</p>
              <p>Upon being named national coach in 2006, Dunga installed a
              defensive-minded, counter-attack style that ran counter to the
              Brazilians' famed flair, freedom and offensive fireworks. It hasn't
              been met with much enthusiasm among some fans, media and former
              players, even as the team keeps winning international tournaments (Copa
              America and Confederations Cup).</p>
              <p>"Today's Brazilian footballing style is an affront to our culture," said former star Socrates, a one-namer himself.</p>
              <p>That's just part of Dunga's popularity problems. While he captained
              that Cup champion in '94, he was never the flashy hero of other
              one-name stars such Pele, Garrincha, Zizinho, Ronaldinho and now Kaka.
              His style of play was tough and physical.</p>
              <p>Besides, Dunga is Portuguese for "dopey," a nickname he acquired as
              a kid in reference to the dwarf of Snow White fame. And "Dunga" doesn't
              really roll off the tongue like Ronaldo does.</p>
              <p>Leading into this World Cup, dopey was about the nicest thing Dunga
              was called. It may be time for the critics to go quiet because this
              so-called affront to the Brazilian culture is marching onto a
              heavyweight quarterfinal match with the Netherlands on Friday.</p>
              <p>Brazil dominated all over the field Monday. The Selecao suffocated
              the Chilean offense and made brilliant offensive plays when the time
              was right.</p>
              <p>Eighteen days into the World Cup and Brazil is still a favorite.</p>
              <p>"Everybody expresses their own preferences," Dunga said of the critics.</p>
              <p>"I like winning."</p>
