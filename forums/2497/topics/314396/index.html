              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>ARSENAL have turned the clock back to the mid-90s — to Kevin Keegan’s first Newcastle. Lovely to watch, tremendous ball retention, wonderful fluidity and yet nothing to show for it.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Arsene Wenger is even sounding like Kevin Keegan did in those “Love it, love it” years. No other team has played better at Old Trafford, Stamford Bridge and Anfield this season and come away with so little.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">They took the lead yesterday against Manchester United, just as they had against Chelsea in the Premier League and Liverpool in the Champions League. But like the old Newcastle entertainers, they can’t hang on to it. We have talked long enough about the lack of depth in the Arsenal squad and how it would find them out. Yet that, admirably, hasn’t stopped them playing the beautiful game.</p>
              <p class="article">Again yesterday there were sumptuous performances from Alex Hleb, Cesc Fabregas and Gael Clichy. Even Gilberto rose to the occasion and had his best game of the season. But, once again, they were let down by the problem that has stalked them for the last three years. A lack of discipline and cohesion at the back.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Sure, you could say William Gallas was unlucky to concede the penalty that led to the United equaliser just a minute after Alex Ferguson’s side could have been 2-0 down, but for a miraculous reaction save by Ed van der Sar from a ball that cannoned off Rio Ferdinand.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But it’s the same old story. How did Gallas get in the position where a nothing ball from Michael Carrick struck his arm? How did Kolo Toure get involved in a tangle with Ryan Babel at Anfield when there were other Arsenal defenders in a much better position to stop the Dutchman?</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">How did Gallas and Toure manage to become so undermined by Didier Drogba and substitute Nicolas Anelka after the Gunners took the lead at Stamford Bridge? It was a desperate lack of concentration.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Wenger has achieved many spectacular feats at Arsenal. Chief among them has been to make Arsenal, despite their woeful disciplinary record, the team everyone loves to watch. But such is his search for perfection in the way Arsenal moved forward, he has been sidetracked from the problems at the back. Sure, this is not where he gets his rocks off. If it was, his team would have been well aware that an Owen Hargreaves free-kick is clipped low over the wall and to the goalkeeper’s right.</p>
              <p class="article">The more pragmatic George Graham built on solid foundations. Get it right in defence and you at least start from the basis of a goalless draw. If the glorious potential of his attacking players is to get the reward it deserves, the team require a defender or two like Adams, Keown, Bould, Winterburn or Dixon. Players happy just to defend.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Wenger attempted to change the old Mount Rushmore back four early in his career but realised they were too good. After time, inevitably, caught up with them, only Sol Campbell has proved their equal. Arsenal have had just 12 clean sheets this season — United 20.</p>
              <p class="article">The goal Ferguson’s team surrendered to the effort Emmanuel Adebayor helped in with his left hand was only the sixth they had conceded in the league at Old Trafford. Yet, despite Arsenal’s overwhelming superiority in the first half, you still never doubted United’s bloody-minded determination to eventually win the match with Wayne Rooney and Patrice Evra, the best full-back in the Premier League, outstanding.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Equally, you never felt Arsenal had the resilience to close the game down. Ferdinand got it spot on when he said: “When we go a goal down we are not dead and buried — even when we go 2-1 down like at Boro. Today we showed true grit and determination.” That is the difference between United, for all their flair and fabulous attacking football, and Arsenal. And Chelsea and Arsenal. And it will remain so until Wenger accepts that grinding out a result isn’t necessarily Winning Ugly.</p>

              <h1>The reasons why Arsenal fell short this season</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/columnists/jamie_redknapp.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="108"> <strong>Jamie Redknapp</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal are an easy target right now, but there is so much we should praise them for. They've come so far this season but ultimately it's not far enough. Last year, they lost eight Barclays Premier League games — this time they have lost only three, but they have drawn too many and have been hit by a chronic loss of form at crucial times.</strong></p>
              <p>We all agree they play beautiful football, the way they work the ball through midfield is a joy to watch, but there are some key areas where they have fallen short and it's probably easier to analyse their failings by breaking them down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_03/gallas1404_468x565.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Unforgivable: the body language of Gallas sent out the wrong message</span></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Back four</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal were ahead against Chelsea and lost, they were through against Liverpool in the Champions League and went out and they were a goal ahead at Old Trafford. They have lost confidence as a defensive unit and individuals are playing poorly. It's hard to forgive the body language shown by William Gallas at Birmingham when it looked as if their captain wanted to give up.</p>
              <p>It's easy to use Philippe Senderos as a scapegoat, but look at Kolo Toure's form since the Africa Cup of Nations. He left as one of the best defenders in the country, had an indifferent tournament and hasn't been the same since. An anxiety has crept into their offensive play, too, because they know they will leak goals at the other end. Title-winning teams are built on strong defences: Arsenal haven't had that, Manchester United have.</p>
              <p><strong>More protection</strong></p>
              <p>The defence has been too exposed by Arsenal's desire to attack and commit midfielders forward. We saw it against Chelsea when they started to play long from back to front and Arsenal's centre-backs were exposed, without a Patrick Vieira type to stand guard in front.</p>
              <p>Mathieu Flamini is a chaser of lost causes, but they didn't once go for the belt-and-braces style often favoured by Liverpool, with two holding midfield players. It might have helped to give them stability.</p>
              <p>United attack, but they do not leave their defence unprotected.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Transfer policy</strong></p>
              <p>I can understand them not buying in January. For a start, who sells their best players in the January window? It's too easy to criticise Wenger for not using the chequebook. The injury to Eduardo was unfortunate, but that's not why they fell away. He was not even a regular in the starting line-up, although he had started to weigh in with some important goals. I hope they don't try to hide behind that.</p>
              <p>Wenger decided he did not wish to add to his squad — at the time, Arsenal were ahead of the pack and playing well. They had a nice blend off the pitch and good atmosphere in the training camp.</p>
              <p>One mistake was allowing Lassana Diarra to go to Portsmouth. The little midfielder is an exceptional player and he may now end the season with a medal while his old Arsenal team-mates will not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>What they need</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal are lacking a goalkeeper, a commanding powerhouse of a centrehalf and, possibly, a right-back. What is also important is that they keep their existing players. There is plenty of talk about Alexander Hleb wanting away and there will be no shortage of takers because he is outstanding.</p>
              <p>I wonder also if Cesc Fabregas will be happy with his existing deal. He has signed a long-term contract, but midfield contemporaries such as Steven Gerrard will be earning much more. This is an area where Arsenal must be wary of foreign predators and pay their best players accordingly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Oh yes... United are just too good</strong></p>
              <p>One final point to consider is how good Manchester United have been this season. It is no shame to finish just behind them because they have been exceptional. Quality all over—the best defence, the best attack and their power play and rapid movement in attack was too much for many teams.</p>
              <p>There is a pace and a strength about Manchester United and they have variation about their play, too. Arsenal haven't been able to mix it up enough. It has still been a terrific season for Arsenal: magical football and Emmanuel Adebayor has scored 20 Premier League goals so there is much for them to shout about. Not that they'll feel that way as they lick their wounds and look at the table.</p>
