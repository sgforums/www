              <p>Roberto Mancini has said he will offer Sir Alex Ferguson a special consolation prize should Manchester United fail to make the Carling Cup final. "Does Alex like pizza?" inquired Manchester City's
              new Italian manager as he prepared for the semi-final first leg against
              United at Eastlands. "If we win then, OK, I'll bring the pizza if he
              brings the wine – a really nice bottle."</p>
              <p>This promise was made in
              extremely jocular vein but it remained unclear whether Mancini – who
              just last week extolled the virtues of pizza accompanied by a glass of
              wine as a pre-match meal for players – knows that United's manager has
              a certain history with dough-based Italian creations.</p>
              <p>When
              someone mentioned "Pizza-Gate" – the notorious 2004 "battle of the
              buffet" when a tunnel scuffle between United and Arsenal's players and
              staff saw a slice of pizza hurled at Ferguson, hitting him on the mouth
              – Mancini merely smiled.</p>
              <p>Such disarmingly beatific beams
              punctuated the former Internazionale coach's media briefing and even
              greeted the inevitable questions about Robinho. "I have respect for
              Robinho," he insisted. "He is a good man and a good player. I would
              like Robinho to always play well but it's not always possible."</p>
              <p>If
              that was a diplomatic understatement the Brazilian could well be
              involved at some stage against United as Roque Santa Cruz will be
              sidelined for at least a month with recurring calf trouble. Slightly
              less worryingly Carlos Tevez – who should start and who Mancini,
              incidentally, once tried to buy for Inter – is nursing a slight
              hamstring strain.</p>
              <p>"I think Santa Cruz is out for one month
              maybe," said Mancini, who hopes to have a newly-fit Stephen Ireland on
              the bench. "It's the calf, the second time in 20 days and it's a big
              problem for me."</p>
              <p>Indeed the fitness doubts surrounding Santa Cruz
              and his co-strikers almost certaily dictate that Mancini will not be
              selling Robinho during this transfer window. Even if he wanted to
              offload him – or, perhaps more pertinently someone was willing to buy
              the out-of-sorts £32.5m forward – Mark Hughes's successor cannot afford
              to weaken his attacking department any further.</p>
              <p>The recent
              arrival of Patrick Vieira has bolstered the midfield but the former
              Arsenal and Internazionale enforcer is not ready to face his old foes
              from United. "It's better that we don't risk Patrick," said Mancini.
              "Because when Patrick comes back in a week or 10 days I want him to
              play 20 games."</p>
