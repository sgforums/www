              </div>
              <p>Chelsea are likely to be without Petr Cech as they try to overturn a narrow Champions League defeat to Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>The Czech goalkeeper was carried off with a torn calf muscle in the San
              Siro last night as Carlo Ancelotti's team were knocked out of their
              stride by Jose 
              Mourinho's Inter Milan in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie.</p>

              midway through the second half</em></p>
              <p>On a night when Mourinho outwitted Ancelotti by nullifying the
              threat of Didier Drogba through sheer force, Inter took the initiative
              with goals from Diego Milito and Esteban Cambiasso.</p>
              <p>Salomon
              Kalou gave Chelsea hope of turning the tie round at Stamford Bridge
              with a second half goal and he was unlucky not to be given a penalty in
              the first half when he was bundled over by Walter Samuel.</p>
              <p>Cech
              was injured landing heavily after collecting a cross and fell in a
              crumpled heap. Chelsea's medical staff immediately called for a
              stretcher and substitute keeper Hilario replaced him on the hour.</p>

              <p>Cech must be doubtful for the return leg in three weeks after leaving the field in obvious pain.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: 'Cech had an injury on his calf, we have to control his condition over the next few days.'</p>
              <p>Inter took the lead through Milito inside three minutes before Kalou's
              side-foot strike got Chelsea back on terms soon after the break. But
              the visitors were behind again less than five minutes later when
              Cambiasso's drive from the edge of the box flew into the bottom corner.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Ancelotti said of Kalou's penalty claim: 'I think it was a penalty
              but a penalty is when the referee blows the whistle. We can say that we
              were unlucky this evening and we hope it will be better in the future.
              Manuel Mejuto Gonzalez is a very good referee with a lot of experience.'</p>
              <p>Inter manager Jose Mourinho admitted the tie remains very in the
              balance ahead of his return to Stamford Bridge in three weeks time.</p>
              <p>'Of course I'm happy inside,' said Mourinho. 'I don't think the game
              was a question of tactics. It was a high level game, no surprise for
              me, with the quality they have.</p>

              <p>'It's the kind of result that keeps it in the balance. I told the
              players they are not better than us. Chelsea can play better - Inter
              can play better. Now it will be down to the team with the greatest
              ambition.'</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard felt Chelsea had done enough to at
              least come away from the San Siro with a draw. He said: 'Maybe we
              deserved better. On the balance of play we felt we were the stronger
              team.'</p>

              <h3>JOSE MOURINHO is the sort of guy who was always going to take centre stage at 
              the San Siro, no matter what happened.</h3>
              <p>The charismatic Inter Milan boss spent the second half shuffling his pack and 
              changing his tactics to such a degree that it must have sent his nemesis 
              Carlo Ancelotti's head into a spin.</p>
              <p>Mourinho may still have enormous affection for Chelsea but he wants to knock 
              them out with a passion.</p>
              <p>Derided in some quarters for his failure to bring the Blues the ultimate 
              prize, despite his incredible domestic success, and an under-achiever with 
              Inter in Europe, this was his big chance to show his side are capable of 
              going all the way to Madrid.</p>
              <p>The Italians, like city rivals AC Milan against Manchester United in the same 
              venue, scored with virtually their first attack as Diego Milito cracked in 
              the opener.</p>
              <p>Salomon Kalou equalised but Esteben Cambiasso soon restored Inter's lead to 
              turn up the volume inside the stadium.</p>
              <p>A serious-looking knee injury to Petr Cech only added to Chelsea's problems as 
              they trail going into the second leg at Stamford Bridge.</p>
