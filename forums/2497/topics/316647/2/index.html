              <h2>WIGAN WANT TO MAKE HISTORY</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/212645.jpg" alt=""><br><br></div>

              <p><strong>Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce says they are desperate to go down in history as the team that stopped ManYoo winning the title.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Far from lying down and handing United the victory that will win them in the Premier League, Boyce says the Latics are determined to make names for themselves as the team that stood in their way. "We would like to emulate West Ham," says Boyce in the Evening Standard. "People still talk about that team that cost Manchester United the title 13 years ago and I'd love people to remember us in 13 years' time.</p>
              <p>"We are loving the publicity. Everyone will be watching us across the world and it shows how far we've come as a club. We are going to enjoy being in the limelight. "People are talking about Wigan right now and that's a good thing. The fact we can have a say in the title race has given us extra motivation. I and the rest of the players want to show people what we can do against Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez and if we cost them the title everyone will talk about us. We are safe in the table. They are the ones with everything to lose."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He insists that boss Steve Bruce is determined to prove himself as a manager, even if that means denying his former side the title. "The manager has been very vocal in training and has told us he wants us to win the game," said Boyce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He has already set up the tactics and has organised us so we will be very hard to beat. He deserves to be in the running for manager of the season with the way he's come in mid-season and kept us up. When he took over we were second from bottom, one point above Derby, and now we have won many points and are safe."</p>

              <h1>Cole warns Chelsea: Let's just concentrate on beating Bolton and not winning the League</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/08_01/ColeRonaldoES_468x456.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Ashley Cole has told his Chelsea team-mates to forget about Manchester United and concentrate on beating Bolton on Sunday - or live to regret it.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea need to get a better result against Gary Megson's side than Manchester United manage at Wigan if they are to pip them to the title but Cole is concerned that events at the JJB Stadium could distract his side from their task at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>He said: "We have to have positive thoughts and make sure we win our game because it will be very disappointing if United did draw and we drew or lost. "We have to be strong mentally because it would be a killer if we drop points and they only drew, it would hurt us more.</p>
              <p>"Anything can happen in football. Wigan got a draw at our place but first we have to win our game because it won't be worth anything if we don't. "Bolton will be coming to us wanting to win the game even though they're safe. I know some of their players and they will definitely want to get a result against us.</p>
              <p>"We know how they play and it will be tough against Kevin Davies and El Hadji Diouf. If we win it's still not in our hands but at least then it will then be down to what United do." If both sides get the same result then Manchester United will only win the Premier League on goal difference, but Cole says they will be worthy champions.</p>
              <p>"If Manchester United do win, we will hold our hands up and say they won it fair and square," he told Chelsea TV. Assistant manager Henk Ten Cate is already preparing for Chelsea to finish as runners-up in the Premier League but feels it will give them added motivation to beat Manchester United in the Champions League Final in two weeks time.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman said: "We are still in it even though I don't think we can win it but Manchester United can lose it. We don't have it in our own hands. "If we don't then it will increase our determination to win the Champions League. The Final is massive but we are ready to win both things.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if we can speak of being more deserving in the league but we have struggled a lot with injuries. I think we battled, kept faith and our confidence. "Sunday is very important for us and we are up against a big opponent. Bolton aren't easy to beat and they deserve our respect."  </p>

              <p><strong>We'll stop United</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00482/Sharnerbig_280x390_482998a.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="390"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>WIGAN’S Paul Scharner has sensationally revealed he bet on Manchester United winning the title. But the Austrian defender insists it will not stop him trying to derail Alex Ferguson’s side on Sunday. United are level on points with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League ahead of the final day of the season.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But Avram Grant and his Blues need not worry for Scharner would be only too happy for United to come unstuck at the JJB Stadium. The eccentric Austrian had a sporting bet — one with no cash involved — back in August with his ‘mind coach’ Valentin Hobel that United would finish top of the tree.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Scharner, 28, said: “We want to end the season on a high. “We want to try everything to get a positive result because we are playing in front of our fans. “It is a special situation for me — I bet with my mind coach that Manchester United would win the league. “But we will try everything to get a result. I give my all every time I go out on the pitch and it will be no different on Sunday.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Fergie’s troops will seal their 17th top-flight crown if they win at Wigan — regardless of what Chelsea do at home to Bolton — courtesy of their superior goal difference. There is concern among Blues fans, however, that Wigan — having sealed their future in the top tier for a fourth season — could relax against United.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">But Wigan’s Player of the Year Scharner believes the Latics have the talent to ruin United’s Premier and Champions League double dream. Scharner, who lists Mozart, meditation and bungee jumping among his hobbies, insists the heat is on United to get a result — and he believes that expectancy could play into Wigan’s hands.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He added: “United are under pressure to win. “It is our last 90 minutes of the season and we will try everything to get a result.” It sounds like a tall order for Steve Bruce’s side, who have lost all five of their Premier League encounters with United since getting promoted in 2005. But they have held Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool to creditable draws since Bruce took charge last November.</p>
              <p class="article">And Scharner, a £2million signing from Norwegian side Brann Bergen in January 2006, reckons Wigan can cause an upset following last week’s impressive 2-0 win at Aston Villa. He added: “We have seven clean sheets in our last 11 league games — and we’re looking for one more.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">And that could be enough for Chelsea . . .</p>

              <h1>Fergie accuses Bolton stars of undermining title race with too much partying before their clash with Chelsea.</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_02/118ferguson_468x689.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has accused Bolton of doing too much celebrating this week as they prepare to face Chelsea in the title decider on Sunday. Ferguson compared Wigan's determined approach to their game against United with Bolton's mood ahead of their trip to Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>"People have questioned Wigan's integrity but when you look at it, the different attitudes are quite interesting. "The Wigan players are coming out and saying, 'We want to beat Manchester United'. That is fine, we are a big club. "But both teams are safe, relaxed and confident. Yet one can celebrate and the other is all keyed up to play against Manchester United."</p>
              <p>If Bolton were to win at the Bridge, Manchester United would be Premier League champions, no matter what the outcome of their trip to Wigan. Yet Ferguson has been staggered at talk of a party atmosphere developing at Bolton this week after the Trotters secured Premier League survival by beating Sunderland.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils chief observed Wigan secure their place in the top flight by overcoming Aston Villa on the same day. Yet, with Steve Bruce's men having vowed to do all in their power to overcome Ferguson's team, it is suggested Bolton will turn up to play and do little else against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson worked with Bolton assistant Archie Knox long enough at Aberdeen and United to know the Scot, and his manager Gary Megson, will have been irritated by talk of his players having been out so often this week.</p>
              <p>"The only thing that gives me confidence about Bolton is the manager and assistant manager. "I worked with Archie Knox for many years at Aberdeen and United. I wish he was playing because he will not enjoy having his players out celebrating and neither will Gary Megson. "It is an important game. I am confident in these two guys taking their team to Chelsea."</p>

              <h2>CARVALHO: PRESSURE IS ON UNITED</h2>
              <div><span id="intelliTXT"><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/04/240/Carvalho_817375.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></span></div>

              <div></div>
              <div><span><strong>Ricardo Carvalho believes the pressure is on Manchester United and Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of Sunday's Premier League title finale. The Red Devils travel to Wigan knowing victory would be enough to secure their 10th Premier League crown, while Carvalho and his Chelsea team-mates have a home date with Bolton in which they must better the result of their title rivals if they are to be crowned champions.</strong> </span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Portugal international centre-back knows the odds may be against the trophy being lifted at Stamford Bridge, but feels that could work in their favour. And with Ronaldo's 40-goal haul having carried United to the brink of Premier League and UEFA Champions League glory, the gifted winger will be under the spotlight once again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Carvalho told the <em>Daily Mirror</em>: "They will have more pressure on them this Sunday than us because nearly everyone believes the title is already United's. "Cristiano is their big star but he is human too and he could fail under all the expectation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Miracles do happen. I am just hoping Wigan take all three points and that leaves us to beat Bolton. I am convinced we will beat Bolton, so the key to the title will be at Wigan."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Carvalho has no concerns that the Latics, who are managed by United legend Steve Bruce, will not give 100 per cent in the JJB Stadium meeting. He added: "I feel certain we will see a proper match at Wigan and that Manchester United will suffer problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Even so, I would have preferred different opponents for United. Tougher ones. But you could not predict a last day situation like this. "Steve Bruce is a legend at Old Trafford. But he is a professional coach and I believe he will not want to lose at home on the final day."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Carvalho revealed the belief that exists in the Stamford Bridge dressing room that they can see off United in both the domestic title race and on 21st May in the Champions League final. He said: "It has been a sensational race and for us to go into the final day level on points is incredible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Many people wrote us off after two months and now we have the chance to win an amazing double. "The whole squad believes we can do it."</p>

              <p>i don't see whats wrong with a little mind games just before an very important match, as a matter of fact, its a game that could win Chelsea their 3rd EPL in a roll, the players and all those involved with Chelsea would have hope that Wigan helps them by drawing or winning against the team that stands in their way, what's the problem with that?</p>
              <p>let's just hope all four teams play to their best and may the best team wins the league..</p>
