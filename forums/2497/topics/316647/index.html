              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>JOHN TERRY has challenged Steve Bruce’s Wigan to pull off a final-day miracle against Manchester United. Michael Ballack and Florent Malouda scored to keep Chelsea level on points with United with one game to go. And Blues skipper Terry said: “Wigan are safe and hopefully with a great manager like Bruce they will go for it against Manchester United next Sunday.”</strong></p>
              <p class="article">A win at the JJB for Fergie’s men, who have a vastly superior goal difference, will seal it. But Terry is confident Bruce can inspire a shock — even though the Latics boss is an Old Trafford legend.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Terry added: “Wigan are on a great run at the minute. They came to the Bridge and put on a very good performance and since then they have done well. “They’ll do the Premier League justice and will go out there wanting to beat United. We’ve worked our socks off all year, so we’d be disappointed if they don’t.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“We have seen many teams this weekend put out full-strength teams and really go for it even though they have nothing to play for. “We still have a tough game with Bolton and if we win we’ve a good chance.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Grant’s side were sluggish in the first half against Newcastle but roared out of the blocks after the break to make it a week to remember for the Chelsea chief. He said: “I have been watching English football for more than 30 years.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“Sometimes I know I am too positive, but I believe in tradition. Steve Bruce won’t give the game to United, I know that, I don’t believe it. “Normally United would be champions by now but anything is possible. There is pressure on them too.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">“Kevin Keegan knows the beauty of English football. We believe we are in our best position since we lost at United. “Our target from day one was to be in the final of the Champions League and improve our game. We’ve done more than we expected. We want to believe it can happen.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Terry, whose central defensive partner Ricardo Carvalho was forced off with a back injury, added: “We’ve got a steely determination to fight United all the way.” Toon boss Keegan reckons the title is heading to Manchester. He said: “Chelsea would be worthy champions but I don’t think they will win it. I cannot see United losing at Wigan.”</p>

              <p><br>Its a good thing they don't have someone like Friedel... Always a man of the match performance against United... If United just bombed them like the way they did against Blackburn... Wigan don't stand a chance... Moreover, with one full week to prepare and rest this time... United have to get this, there is no two ways about it...</p>
              <p>To be fair, Wigan don't have much to play for anymore... its harder to motivate players with nothing to play for... and lets hope Bramble show us why his name has become a keyword for... clumsy defending...</p>

              <p>Wigan should just think about themselves... They shouldn't even be bother about Chelsea or what Terry said... Chelsea only have themselves to blame for where they are... If Wigan want to play whoever they want, give other team players a chance or try out younger players... Its their choice... Its their chance to try out who they want to keep and see who they should let go...</p>
              <p>All decisions should only be base on their own interest... Forget Chelsea and what others say... On the same token, Chelsea is not going to help Fulham or Reading in any way... Bolton's goal difference are better than them but If they were to concede more goals... they could have a problem... But if Chelsea score one goal, they are going to shut up shop and defend... They are not going to bother what happen to Reading and Fulham... So likewise Wigan should just think for themselves only.</p>

              <h1>Pressure is on Manchester United, insists Chelsea star Michael Ballack as he urges Wigan to do the Blues proud</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_02/BallackGoal0605_468x528.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Michael Ballack has turned up the heat on Manchester United and urged Wigan to help Chelsea steal the Premier League crown on the final day of the season. The Blues kept up the pressure on Sir Alex Ferguson's side with an impressive 2-0 win at Newcastle to draw level with them again at the top of the table with just one game to go. They still trail on goal difference.</strong></p>
              <p>United have been strong favourites to win the title for the past two months, but Chelsea can come out on top if their result at home to Bolton on Sunday is better than the champions' at Wigan. Ballack said: “I am sure everyone at United was watching on the television hoping Newcastle would get a result, but it didn't happen. The next six days could feel like a long or short time for them. The pressure is on and I hope Wigan are proud enough to give everything in the last game and we have to beat Bolton.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“United have everything in their hands, but we are relaxed now. We did our job. We will give everything to beat Bolton at home and we will see what they do.” Ballack believes the onus is on Wigan to do themselves justice and give United a hard game, having secured their top-flight status for another year.</p>
              <p>Wigan cost Chelsea a vital two points only three weeks ago when Emile Heskey equalised in injury time and Ballack insists they must play with similar spirit on Sunday. He added: “I remember when we played them at home they put four strikers in the last four or five minutes to try something and I hope they do the same against Manchester United. I hope they are not on their holidays. They have secured their place in the league but they have enough time to celebrate before preparing for this game.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sponsors Barclays will send the real Premier League trophy to the JJB Stadium with a replica at Stamford Bridge so both teams can celebrate after their matches should they clinch the title. Two sets of winners' medals will be made and John Terry is convinced his players will be wearing theirs. He said: “Wigan are on a great run at the moment. They came to the Bridge and put in a very good performance and since then, they've picked up. I think they'll do the Premier League justice and go out there wanting to beat Manchester United.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Terry's defensive partner Ricardo Carvalho has handed Chelsea a fitness scare after limping off with a back injury in the second half at Newcastle. He will have further tests on it today. Meanwhile, AC Milan have given up their hopes of signing Didier Drogba after being convinced the striker will stay at Chelsea.</p>

              <p>what a desperate attempt.Just look at other examples...other teams,all of their pre match shouts,rants,antics...what have they done to den united's challenge in europe and the league.Roma barca just to name a few.And what he said is just hilarious</p>
              <p>i quote terrry</p>
              <p>"Wigan are on a great run at the minute. They came to the Bridge and put on a very good performance and since then they have done well. “<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">They’ll do the Premier League justice</span></strong> and will go out there wanting to beat United. "</p>
              <p>I would say its injustice if they win it,with their brand of boring football and nv ending 1-0 victories.Chelsea are not worthy winners.United are,with their attacking exploits and defensive stability and all round performance for the season.In ronaldo we have probably the best player on the planet for this season.</p>

              <p>Its funny how only chelkis are the ones doing all the talking, while the united camp hasn;t said any word about asking bolton to do them proud by beating or drawing chelsea...on paper, it clearly shows who are the more desperate ...</p>
              <p>“United have everything in their hands, but we are relaxed now." a quote from Ballack..</p>
              <p>Funny, how the so called 'relax' are talking even more with the match day drawing ever nearer...LOL..</p>

              <p>i dont think chelsea is wrong in asking wigan to go for it.  i am sure if the position were reversed man u would do the same thing.  the same thing goes for teams fighting relegation.</p>
