              <h1>EXCLUSIVE: Everton next to fall into foreign hands but boss Moyes will sign a new contract<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/04/article-0-02E1D9C600000578-712_468x286.jpg" alt="David Moyes" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p><em>Manager David Moyes will soon have money to burn as well.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1068809" rel="1068809_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1068809/EXCLUSIVE-Everton-fall-foreign-hands-boss-Moyes-sign-new-contract.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Everton will become the latest Premier League club to move into foreign ownership when a £200million sale to bidders from the Far or Middle East is completed, possibly in a matter of weeks.</strong></p>
              <p>With Newcastle United also expected to end up in overseas ownership as Mike Ashley prepares a £250m escape from the troubled club he bought 17 months ago, the Premier League is fast approaching the day when the majority of clubs are in foreign hands.</p>
              <p>Deals for Everton and Newcastle are being brokered by investment banker Keith Harris and both are now on the verge of receiving formal offers, which the clubs hope will allow negotiations to be completed before the transfer window opens in January.</p>
              <p>In Everton's case there are two bidders, one from the Far East and one from the Middle East, believed to be a sovereign wealth fund similar to the Abu Dhabi United Group, who took over Manchester City last month in a £200m deal.</p>
              <p>Everton chairman Bill Kenwright admitted at the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders last month that he wanted to sell, sparking genuine interest from more than one overseas investor. Kenwright is keen for the deal to happen before January and will not ask to stay on in any significant capacity.</p>
              <p>All the major shareholders have now agreed to sell, with a formal offer expected within weeks.</p>
              <p>Manager David Moyes will sign a new contract with the club next week despite the impending change of ownership. 'I trust Bill to find the right person for this club,' said Moyes last night. 'He will make sure they are the right type, not just anyone throwing a few bob around.' In Newcastle's case, the farce of the withdrawal yesterday of a South African consortium from the bidding will not effect the ongoing sale.</p>
              <p>Harris's bank, Seymour Pierce, who are negotiating the sale of the club on behalf of Ashley, have received around seven expressions of interest, and expect three to materialise into serious bids.</p>
              <p>All parties have signed confidentiality agreements but the front-runners are believed to be foreign, coming from the United States, the Middle East and the Far East.</p>
              <p>Hopes of Kevin Keegan returning as boss are premature. His representatives reportedly spoke to several parties but not those most likely to succeed. But The Mail on Sunday understands that Alan Shearer, the ex-Newcastle captain, is seen as a strong alternative.</p>

              <p><br>Errr... I think during the 70s and 80s perhaps... But not anymore, Today its United that is probably the biggest club is England and maybe for almost the past 20 yrs too... And I am not saying this because I am a United fan...</p>
              <p>If I am being honest, I feel Liverpool are losing its huge fan base bit by bit... not that its small now but they are losing it at a rather fast rate these last 10 years... Their current huge base are attribute from their 70s and 80s good work.</p>
              <p>I see Chelsea and Arsenal growing... The young boys that took up Chelsea the last 5 yrs are coming of age... And I think more younger boys are picking Chelsea rather than Liverpool these last 5 yrs too... And if this keeps up, in another 5 to 10 yrs time... Chelsea could be as big as Pool in terms of fan base if not history...</p>
              <p>Pool need to start winning the title and play more attractive football to attract younger fans to its side otherwise, in 10 yrs time... most of the Liverpool fans will be in their mid 50s... and those in the mid 20s or 30s are other clubs supporters...</p>

              <p>There is a huge gap between the big four and the rest of the epl teams, i dont think there will be any break thru into the top4 anywhere in the near future. My huge gap refers to the quality of play and ability to play possesion football. If you look at liverpool or chelsea, even tho they cant play very attractive football they can hold the ball pretty good, and theres the difference btwn a top4 club and the rest of the pack</p>
              <p>Sure everton may become rich, but if you look at the quality of the current pack of players there, i dont think instant riches can buy them champions league any sooner.<br><br>On the other hand, i think man city already has the potential to play good football. b4 the foreign owners came in, they have a great youth academy and some really decent players such as micah richards, richard dunne and stephen ireland.</p>

              <p><br>You are not seriously taking that one match as a yardstick are you? The problem here is not now, present day but in 2, 3 or 5 yrs down the road...</p>
              <p>Another point is, City didn't became the richest club months or weeks ago at that time. They only became the richest club hours before the transfer window closed... Despite that, the signing of Robinho right under the noses of Chelsea, the former richest club in the would and breaking the premiership transfer record is a sign of their intent... I have no doubt that more quality players will arrive at City very soon when the window reopens... And once they have got all these in order, they could be the 2nd Chelsea in the making...</p>
