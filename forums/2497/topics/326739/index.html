              <h2><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/23869_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="237"></h2>
              <h2>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez admits that early success in his
              career in English football has led to increased pressure at the club.</h2>
              <p>Benitez replaced Gerard Houllier as Liverpool manager in the summer of
              2004, and went on to win the Champions League in his first season in
              charge, beating AC Milan in a historic final in Istanbul.<br><br>The
              next year, Liverpool succeeded in winning the FA Cup against West Ham
              United, however their title winning credentials have consistently been
              shrouded in doubt. <br><br>Benitez accepts that with success comes
              expectation, but suggests that Liverpool’s inability to win the league
              has more to do with the progress of the teams around them, than as a
              result of their own failings. <br><br>He told the Times: "In some ways
              it (Champions League success) made things more difficult because the
              expectations became so high. Then we won the European Super Cup and FA
              Cup the following season and so suddenly everyone was saying, 'OK, the
              next step will be the Premier League title.'<br><br>"But then, when you
              don't win it, people say, 'Oh, you can't go to that next step,' when,
              maybe, we were operating at the next level up, but because the other
              teams around us were progressing as well, it didn't seem that way.<br><br>"In
              some respects, we were maybe our own worst enemies, but, of course, I'd
              prefer to have that problem, to be talking as a Champions League
              winner. People are talking now about us not having won the league for
              18 years, but it was 21 years since this club had last won the European
              Cup."<br><br>The Spaniard regards the Premier League as the toughest
              competition in the world, and is under no illusions about the enormity
              of the task that Liverpool must undertake in order to break their near
              two decade duck.<br><br>"The key is not to say that we can win the
              title because it's clear that it's the most difficult league in the
              world to win,” he continued.<br><br>“Look at the final of the Champions
              League last season, it was between Chelsea and United, who are at the
              top of the table in England.<br><br>"It's clear that we are going in
              the right direction and progressing. We have got good young players
              coming through who will be important, while those with experience are
              settling down now so it could be a very good season for us.<br><br>"Everybody
              can see that the team and squad is improving every year and that now we
              are much better, but will that be enough to win the title? That's the
              big question because it depends on the other teams as well."</p>
