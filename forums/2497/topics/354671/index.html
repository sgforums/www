              <p><strong>Arsenal forward Andrey Arshavin says he was only ever going to join the Gunners, not Tottenham.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Russian international was linked with a summer move to both
                  Spurs and Barcelona after starring in his country's run to the Euro
                  2008 semi-finals.</p>
              <p>However, a move to either club never materialised - despite Spurs
                  lodging a £16 million bid that was rejected - with Arsene Wenger
                  eventually bagging the highly-rated Zenit St Petersburg playmaker at
                  the end of the winter transfer window for £15 million.</p>
              <p>And in an exclusive interview in the latest issue of <em>FourFourTwo</em> magazine, out now, the Russian reveals all about the long-running transfer saga.</p>
              <p>“I don’t want to make comparisons between these two teams [Spurs and
                  Arsenal] but clearly it was preordained from above that I should end up
                  at Arsenal,” he says.<br> <br> “It was a hard day [transfer deadline day] – physically and mentally. I
                  was on the go from 8am, and I only managed to grab something to eat at
                  10pm.</p>
              <p>"I only believed the deal was done at the moment I put my signature
                  on the contract. That was about 16.57 or 16.58 London time [minutes
                  before the window closed].”<br> <br> The 27-year-old Russian is hoping to succeed where many of his fellow countrymen have failed by joining a Premier League club.</p>
              <p>Until recently, English sides had been somewhat wary of buying
                  players from the former Soviet Union, with question marks hanging over
                  their ability to adapt to the English game. <br> <br> High profile arrivals Sergei Rebrov and Andriy Shevchenko, as well as
                  Alexei Smertin, have all failed to make a sufficient impact. </p>
              <p>And, arguably, the last player from that part of the world to truly
                  shine in England was Andrei Kanchelskis more than a decade ago.</p>
              <p>However, Arshavin is confident he can adapt his game. “I’m confident
                  I’ll adapt on the pitch," he says. "It’s a matter of fitness and
                  understanding the different demands of my coach and team-mates.</p>
              <p>"I'm starting a new life, which means plenty of new challenges. This
                  is my first time away from my native city. London will be unfamiliar
                  and take some getting used to. But I don't see anything bad in that."</p>
