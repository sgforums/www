They have a very selective view and I donÂ’t agree with the report of the linesman on Adebayor. For me, he lies. I feel that Adebayor didnÂ’t punch anybody. When the linesman says that he did, he lies.<br><br>Â“I would like someone to ask Lampard if he was punched by Adebayor. If Lampard says yes, then we accept it. I want him to tell the truth. But we have watched it under a microscope. And if you see Adebayor punching Lampard, I would like you to show me.Â”<br><br>However, having had Adebayor charged by the FA on Monday with Â“reacting aggressively and failing to leave the field of playÂ” after his red card and Emmanuel EbouÃ© charged with violent conduct after appearing to strike Wayne Bridge, SundayÂ’s Carling Cup final defeat was still hurting him. Both players have denied the charges.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s just a coincidence when you have 20 players in a brawl and only the Arsenal players are guilty,Â” Wenger said. Â“ItÂ’s unbelievable. Maybe thatÂ’s their [the FAÂ’s] way to do justice. ItÂ’s difficult to accept.Â”<br><br></div>

The Gunners crashed out of the FA Cup last night at Blackburn, where manager Wenger used his post-match press conference to launch a tirade over the fallout from the mass brawl which marred Sunday's Carling Cup final. </strong><br><br>His comments that the assistant referee who referee Howard Webb consulted before sending off Emmanuel Adebayor was a "liar" have seen the Arsenal manager once again fall foul of the game's governing body. Wenger will also be asked to explain his claim "the whole system is not honest", in reference to the disciplinary procedures of the FA.<br><br>"Questioning the integrity of a match official and accusing them of lying is a very serious claim to make as it questions the whole integrity of the game," said an FA spokesman in a statement released to PA Sport. "We also reject any accusations of bias or dishonesty within our disciplinary system. We will be asking Arsene Wenger to explain these comments."<br><br>Wenger is convinced striker Adebayor was the victim of mistaken identity over his dismissal for supposedly throwing a punch during the final at the Millennium Stadium. The Togo striker was given a straight red card just minutes after coming on as a substitute towards the end of the game after becoming embroiled in a melee which also involved Frank Lampard among others, and which was sparked by the fracas between Kolo Toure and Mikel John Obi.<br><br>The Togo striker failed with his appeal for wrongful dismissal and was further charged with reacting aggressively and failing to leave the field of play immediately after being sent off. Wenger said last night: "We know he [Adebayor] did not deserve a red card. The linesman lies when he says he [Adebayor] punched Lampard.<br><br>"What the linesman said is really lies. It is just not acceptable." The Arsenal manager also questioned why a second Arsenal player, Emmanuel Eboue, faces an FA charge of violent conduct, which is due to be heard later today, while opponents Chelsea escaped unscathed.<br><br>Wenger added: "It is just a coincidence that you have 20 men who have a brawl and only the Arsenal players were guilty. It is unbelievable but maybe they [the FA] have their own way to do justice."<br><br>Lampard has, through his agent, maintained today he was not punched by Adebayor. However, the FA moved to clarify the situation this morning. The statement continued: "Contrary to Wenger's allegations, the assistant referee's report does not claim that Adebayor punched Frank Lampard.<br><br>"The report states that Adebayor's attitude was aggressive, that he shoved into Ricardo Carvalho and that he aimed a punch at Lampard. It does not state that Adebayor struck Lampard. "Adebayor was sent off for violent conduct on Sunday. His claim for wrongful dismissal was rejected by a disciplinary commission on Tuesday."<br><br>"He was also charged with reacting aggressively and failing to leave the field of play immediately after being sent off. "He denied the charge and will have a personal hearing on Tuesday 6 March."<br><br>Referee Webb has also reviewed the whole of the incident again via video replays and from several different angles. The Yorkshire official has confirmed that, apart from the two sendings off and the subsequent charges issued, there were no other red card offences during the melee.<br><br>Gilberto, meanwhile, maintains togetherness will see Arsenal through the most testing part of their season so far. Having also seen their FA Cup hopes ended at Blackburn last night, the Gunners will return to Barclays Premiership action against Reading on Saturday when they will look to keep up the pressure on the top three, having played two less games than both Liverpool and leaders Manchester United.<br><br>Arsenal's European hopes are in the balance following a 1-0 defeat at PSV Eindhoven last week, with the return leg of the last-16 encounter at Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night. Whatever else may be happening, midfielder Gilberto knows focus on the pitch is now all that matters.<br><br>"The next few days will not be easy for us, especially because we have a few players out of the team - but we need to handle it," said the Brazilian, captain last night at Ewood Park. "We need to change our situation and start to win games again.<br><br>"We have to stick together as a group, this is an important time for everybody - the youngsters and the experienced players." Gilberto added on Arsenal TV Online: "It has been a frustrating few days with defeats in the two cup matches.<br><br>"But we all need to carry on because now we have another tough game against Reading in the Premiership at home and then next week there is the Champions League game with PSV. "We have to put our heads up, but it will be hard because we [only] have a few days to save the rest of our season."<br><br>Of the fall-out from the brawl in Cardiff, the 30-year-old said diplomatically: "At the moment, the players have made no comment about the FA decision. "When you lose a game, you need to control yourself. "It is important to keep our mental strength and not get involved."<br></div>

No doubt he has had his run-in's with FA as well, which means he all more is able to identify with Wenger.</div>

Arsenal boss Wenger claimed a linesman lied to the FA by stating in his match report Emmanuel Adebayor had punched Frank Lampard to earn his red card during the 2-1 defeat to Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium on Sunday.</strong><br><br>Angry Wenger rapped: Â“I donÂ’t agree at all with the match report, with what the linesman said. Â“This is a lie Â— a complete lie. The linesman said Adebayor punched Lampard.Â” But FA chiefs hit back yesterday, insisting the officialsÂ’ match reports made no reference to a punch landing on Lampard and are demanding an explanation from Wenger.<br><br>An FA statement read: Â“The report states AdebayorÂ’s attitude was aggressive, that he shoved into Ricardo Carvalho and that he aimed a punch at Lampard. It does not state that Adebayor struck Lampard.Â” Chelsea midfielder Lampard confirmed yesterday he was not punched by Adebayor.<br><br>The FA take a dim view when the integrity of their officials is questioned. Wenger has been ordered to provide a written explanation and could be heavily fined if charged and convicted.<br><br>The Arsenal boss still faces a charge of improper conduct from a clash with referee Steve Bennett in the match against Portsmouth last December. Adebayor will have a personal hearing next Tuesday on his additional charge of improper conduct.<br><br>Arsenal are expected to vigorously deny a charge of failing to control their players during the 20-man brawl and will point out Wenger raced on to the Millennium Stadium pitch along with Jose Mourinho to try to separate warring players.<br><br>But Wenger has now become personally implicated. The mass brawl was triggered by a clash between Arsenal defender Kolo Toure and Blues midfielder Mikel John Obi. They were both sent off and banned by the FA.<br><br></div>
