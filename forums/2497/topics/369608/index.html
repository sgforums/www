              <p><strong>BANGKOK
              - Competition to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be the fiercest
              ever but the home of the Premier League is the ideal venue for the
              tournament, according to the head of England's bid.</strong></p>
              <p>Andy Anson said the
              infrastructure and huge domestic passion for the game made England the
              perfect choice, but he warned against complacency with nine other
              countries bidding hard for the right to host the tournament.</p>
              <p>"We believe we can put on an
              incredibly exciting World Cup, and we strongly believe we can win this
              bid," Anson told Reuters on Thursday during a visit to Thailand.</p>
              <p>"We have a very compelling case
              to win but it's incredibly competitive, more than there has ever been
              for a World Cup. You can't afford to be complacent, we have a nine
              countries bidding very aggressively."</p>
              <p>Australia, Japan, Mexico,
              Russia and the United States have bid for both the 2018 and 2022
              tournaments, along with two joint proposals from Belgium and the
              Netherlands and Spain and Portugal.</p>
              <p>South Korea, Indonesia and
              Qatar have confirmed their interest in staging the 2022 finals. FIFA
              will decide on the hosts in December 2010.</p>
              <p><strong>BIGGEST RIVALS</strong></p>
              <p>England has only hosted the
              World Cup once, in 1966, and the former commercial director of
              Manchester United would not be drawn on who the biggest rivals were.</p>
              <p>"We can't talk about individual
              competitors, but that's helpful, because there's no point focusing on
              any one competitor," he said. "There are so many in the field, it makes
              you more determined to do a good job."</p>
              <p>Although England has bid for
              both the 2018 and 2022 finals, Anson said the target was to stage the
              tournament as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>"We want 2018 and are very
              focused on that, we feel we have the stadium, infrastructure and fans,
              we believe we can put on a great World Cup in 2018 so why would we want
              to wait until 2022?"</p>
              <p>England had learned from the
              unsuccessful "football's coming home" bid to stage the 2006 finals,
              Anson said, and was travelling the world to listen to the opinions of
              FIFA member countries.</p>
              <p><strong>POLITICAL INFIGHTING</strong></p>
              <p>Despite rumours of political
              infighting between different sectors of the lucrative English game,
              Anson said all parties involved had fully backed the bid.</p>
              <p>"We've made it our priority, we
              have to communicate heavily to everyone to make sure we're all in the
              loop and in the decision-making process," he said.</p>
              <p>"I've not met anyone who
              doesn't want to be on board or support this bid. It's hard to see why
              England shouldn't have it, we now have to convince the rest of the
              world."</p>
              <p>Fifteen cities are aiming to
              earn the right to stage matches, including lesser-known outposts like
              Hull, Bristol, Derby and Milton Keynes, alongside the traditional
              strongholds of London, Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle.</p>
              <p>There will be a shortlist of 64
              venues across the country, 32 of which will be selected as base camps
              for the teams. One aim is to spread the tournament to as many parts of
              the country as possible, he added.</p>
              <p>Plans to build new stadiums for
              Liverpool, Everton and Tottenham Hotspur, in addition to established
              arenas of clubs like Arsenal, Manchester United and Newcastle meant the
              bid had more capital to channel into strengthening other areas.</p>
              <p>"It's one of the attractions from this bid from an English point is we don't have to develop anything major," Anson said.</p>
              <p>Anson said he also believed the 2012 London Olympics would serve as a launchpad.</p>
              <p>"It's huge asset and the six years between is positive because of resources, skills and infrastructure," he said.</p>
              <p>"We have a great showcase in
              the Premier League, great stadiums and fans who are committed and
              passionate. We have such a fantastic base to build a bid on."</p>
