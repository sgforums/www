              <div><span><strong>Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has insisted the club's controversial signing of teenager Gael Kakuta was not "child trafficking".</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>The London club have been banned by FIFA from making any new signings for two transfer windows after being found guilty of inducing Kakuta to breach his contract with Lens in 2007, when the winger was 16.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, and Kenyon said there had been shock throughout the sport at the ban.</p>
              <p>FIFA and UEFA both want to outlaw international transfers of players aged under 18, and the bodies' presidents Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini have respectively referred to the practice as being akin to "child slavery" and "child trafficking".</p>
              <p>But Kenyon said: "It was something that happened two years ago that was in no way child trafficking.</p>
              <p>"I think you've also got to distinguish between the issues."</p>
              <p>The Chelsea chief executive added that Kakuta, now 18 and viewed as France's most promising young player, had also been stunned by FIFA's verdict.</p>
              <p>He added: "He wants to play his profession, which is football.</p>
              <p>"We need to take account for that and understand this is something that happened two years ago, and make sure we've got enough support around him to ensure he's fully supported at a difficult time."</p>
              <p>Kenyon, speaking after a meeting of the European Club Association (ECA) in Geneva, insisted Chelsea would support a ban on the international transfers of players aged under 18.</p>
              <p>He said: "This has been talked about for the last 12 months and we have signed up fully to the ECA and UEFA's position, along with FIFA's.</p>
              <p>"We need to separate our overall position with the specific case. The fact we are appealing tells you our position."</p>

              <h2>Blues battling FIFA punishment</h2>
              <div>
              <h3>CHELSEA will produce evidence from the FA which they claim can clear their 
              name in the Gael Kakuta 'tapping up' controversy.</h3>
              <p>The club are still waiting for FIFA to explain why they were given a double 
              transfer window ban before launching their appeal.</p>
              <p>And a major plank of Chelsea's defence is that the FA authorised international 
              clearance for Kakuta after consultation with the French authorities.</p>
              <p>Chelsea wrote to the FA two years ago asking for clarification of Kakuta's 
              position at Lens before making a move for the talented teenager. Lens claim 
              Kakuta had signed an 'aspirant' contract to agree professional terms at the 
              French club.</p>
              <p>But an investigation from the French FA could not confirm that was the case 
              and wrote to Football Association giving international clearance to sign 
              Kakuta.</p>
              <p>It is this authorisation which will form part of Chelsea's evidence in their 
              appeal.</p>
              <p>During last month's FIFA arbitration meeting which found against Chelsea, the 
              French FA claimed they HAD subsequently discovered evidence Kakuta had 
              signed a pre-contract.</p>
              <p>A Chelsea source said: "There is a vastly experienced administrative team at 
              the club who have dealt with these siuations over many years and to suggest 
              Chelsea would ride rough-shod over these regulations is ridiculous.</p>
              <p>"The club received international clearance from the French authorities which 
              gave them permission to approach Kakuta."</p>
              <p>Chelsea were also fined 130,000 but this is a set figure to cover Lens' 
              'training solidarity' losses after Kakuta left their academy.</p>
              <p>FIFA's explanation is due this week and Chelsea officials will study it 
              closely before deciding on their next move.</p>
