              <p>World football's governing body imposed the sanctons after
                  investigating a complaint from Ligue 1 Lens over the transfer of Gael
                  Kakuta in 2007.</p>
              <p>FIFA's Dispute Resolution Chamber passed the
                  decision on a contractual dispute between the French club and their
                  English counterparts.</p>
              <p>A statement from FIFA read: "The DRC found
                  that the player had indeed breached a contract signed with the French
                  club. Equally, the DRC deemed it to be established that the English
                  club induced the player to such a breach</p>
              <p>"As a result the player
                  was condemned to pay compensation in the amount of €780,000, for which
                  the club, Chelsea, are jointly and severally liable, and sporting
                  sanctions were imposed on both the player and Chelsea in accordance
                  with art. 17 par. 3 and 4 of the Regulations on the Status and Transfer
                  of Players.</p>
              <p>A restriction of four months on his eligibility to
                  play in official matches has been imposed on Kakuta. Chelsea are banned

                  for the two next entire and consecutive registration periods following
                  the notification of the present decision.</p>

              <p>Chelsea have
              been banned from registering any new players for the next two transfer
              windows in a shock move by FIFA after being found guilty of inducing a
              French teenager to breach his contract with another club.</p>
              <p>Gael Kakuta, 18, joined Chelsea from Lens two years ago after which the French club lodged a complaint with FIFA.</p>
              <p>Now FIFA's dispute resolution chamber (DRC) has ruled that
              Kakuta breached his contract with Lens and that Chelsea induced him to
              do so.</p>
              <p>FIFA said in a statement: "The French club had lodged a claim
              with FIFA seeking compensation for breach of contract from the player
              and requesting also sporting sanctions to be imposed on the player and
              the English club for breach of contract and inducement to breach of
              contract respectively.</p>
              <p>"The DRC found that the player had indeed breached a contract
              signed with the French club. Equally, the DRC deemed it to be
              established that the English club induced the player to such breach.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <div class="cT-storyDetails cfix"><cite>September 4, 2009 - 12:39AM</cite></div>
              <div class="articleBody">
              <p>English Premier League club
              Chelsea have been fined and hit with a ban on registering players until
              January 2011 by world football's ruling body FIFA as punishment for
              their role in a contractual dispute.</p>
              <p>The sanction
              follows a decision by FIFA's Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC), which
              met on August 27 to rule on a contractual dispute opposing French first
              division club Lens to French player Gael Kakuta and London giants
              Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The DRC found Kakuta guilty of breach of
              contract and also found Chelsea guilty of inducing the player to break
              his contract with the French club, which had lodged a claim with FIFA
              seeking compensation and demanding sporting sanctions both on the
              player and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>A statement from FIFA said the DRC "found that the player had indeed breached a contract signed with the French club".</p>
              <p>"Equally, the DRC deemed it to be established that the English club induced the player to such a breach."</p>
              <p>As
              well as paying 780,000 euros in compensation to Lens, for which Chelsea
              are jointly liable, Kakuta has been sanctioned in accordance with
              article 17, paragraph 3 and 4 of the Regulations on the Status and
              Transfer of Players.</p>
              <p>He has been effectively banned from playing in official matches for four months.</p>
              <p>The
              statement added: "Chelsea are banned from registering any new players,
              either nationally or internationally, for the two next entire and
              consecutive registration periods following the notification of the
              present decision.</p>
              <p>"Furthermore, the club, Chelsea, have to pay Lens training compensation in the amount of 130,000 euros."</p>
              <p>The
              next transfer window is on January 1-31, 2010 with the next opportunity
              to register new players after that coming at the end of the current
              season until August 31 (Europe) and Sept 1 (Britain) 2010.</p>
              <p>An
              offensive midfielder with Chelsea's reserve team, Kakuta is believed to
              be a future star of the London club's senior side and after the
              2007/2008 season was voted 'Scholar of the Year' by staff at the
              Chelsea Academy.</p>
              <p>Described by Chelsea as a
              "highly-skilled left footed player who likes taking players on", Kakuta
              was a part of the France under-17 side that were beaten finalists in
              the European Championships last May.</p>
              <p>Although no
              provision was made for such a move in FIFA's statement, Chelsea may be
              expected take any future appeal to the highest sports court in the
              world, the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</p>

              <p>I think that FiFa president whatever his name is trying hard to help put a stop to the English clubs strength... Cos Arsenal, Pool and United don't really can afford a $50m player anytime unlike Chelsea, So who else better than Chelsea who has the money and a top 4 placing finish to qualify for the CL football every year...</p>
              <p>I guess that Fifa (Real Madrid fan) president saw an area they could get at Chelsea and went for it... It is possible that Chelsea signed a player while he was still under contract to another club... But, still a bit weird... Maybe ban them from signing youth players for that duration rather than across the board...</p>
              <p>But the worse is that Frank Arnesen, he has been there for like years and he has brought them nothing but problems... Imagine him getting caught on camera tapping up a Boro player... What else can you say... This latest one is also one of his dealing...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Frank Arnesen was ready to crack open the champagne when he returned from Lens two years ago with Gael Kakuta's signature.</strong></p>
              <p>'I've just landed the best kid in France,' <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>'s academy chief told his employers in a meeting at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>A kid some observers were already calling the 'Black Zidane'. For Arnesen, it amounted to quite a coup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/09/03/article-1211073-0647D867000005DC-527_306x670.jpg" alt="chelsea been here before" width="306" height="670"></em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The capture of exactly the kind of player he was desperate to deliver. The Dane was under pressure, according to sources at the club. Not least because many of those he had recruited since joining in a controversial move from Tottenham in September 2005 were not deemed to be of the necessary standard.</strong></p>
              <p>They were not advancing through the ranks and into the senior squad, which was something Jose Mourinho spoke of after leaving Chelsea.</p>
              <p>In Kakuta, however, he had uncovered a precious gem. A gifted young winger who quickly emerged as the star of Chelsea's youth team and someone, while only 18, who has now been named in Carlo Ancelotti's Champions League squad. The boy has talent in abundance.</p>
              <p>Quick feet, great vision, blistering pace. 'Kakuta stands out for his ability,' said Frank Lampard when the youngster first joined.</p>
              <p>'His natural talent for someone who is just 16 is amazing.' 'Arnesen was so pleased with himself,' said one club insider. 'But it was a big relief for him to get the boy.'</p>
              <p>The question now, however, is to what lengths Arnesen went to get the boy to come to London, and what FIFA mean when they talk about inducements.</p>
              <p>According to reports in France, Kakuta's parents were not keen for their son to leave home so soon. His mother was against it until, say those same reports, somebody offered the family a million euros and the 16-year-old a salary of around £7,000 a week.</p>
              <p>The allegation has been denied by Roger Boli, the player's agent and former Lens legend who ended his career at Bournemouth.</p>
              <p>Chelsea claim Kakuta was not under contract at Lens and, therefore, deny any wrong-doing. Yet FIFA think they have done something wrong, and something pretty serious judging by the severity of the punishment. The announcement took Chelsea by surprise, given it usually takes FIFA's dispute resolution chamber two or three months to reach a decision.</p>
              <p>The hearing for this case only took place last week. According to one source, it is partly because the world governing body has lost patience with Chelsea for what is seen as arrogance over the way they sometimes conduct transfers. So much so that Sportsmail understands former employees have been approached in recent months to assist with their investigation.</p>
              <p>The evidence is fairly damning. The controversy that raged over their pursuit of Ashley Cole. The bizarre circumstances surrounding John Mikel Obi's capture.</p>
              <p>The 'tapping up' of Leeds youngsters Michael Woods and Tom Taiwo, for which they had to pay £5million in compensation. In a BBC documentary by their Panorama team in 2006, Arnesen was caught offering Nathan Porritt, a 15-year-old from Middlesbrough, £150,000 - paid over three years - to join Chelsea</p>
              <p>Arnesen was later warned by Lens of the potential consequences of a similar approach. Responding to reports linking Chelsea to Kakuta in April 2007, Lens administrative director Francis Collado said: 'The player is under contract for two more years and, if a club is attracted, they have to contact us.</p>
              <p>'If he is contacted when he's under contract and signs for another club, the risk is a six month suspension for the player and a year ban for signing players by the club. These are FIFA rules and there is no reason for them not to apply to Chelsea.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/09/03/article-1211073-01C08E0A0000044D-312_306x423.jpg" alt="Frank Arnesen" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Under pressure: Frank Arnesen</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The knives appear to be out for Arnesen, and not just at FIFA. He is at the centre of a power struggle that could seriously destabilise a club notorious for political in-fighting.</strong></p>
              <p>Promoted to the board in the summer, Arnesen was given a new title - Sporting Director - and put in charge of all transfer activity. 'Arnesen continues with his previous roles relating to the reserves and the academy but now also takes on responsibilities relating to the co-ordination of first-team activity and supporting the first team manager,' said a club website statement.</p>
              <p>For Peter Kenyon it amounted to another bloody nose. Roman Abramovich had sacked Luiz Felipe Scolari as manager while Kenyon was away last season and now he seemed to be taking more responsibility away from his chief executive.</p>
              <p>Arnesen's prominent position at the unveiling of manager Ancelotti in July told its own story but now, suddenly, he looks vulnerable. Now Kenyon might be in a position to hit back. Indeed, only last weekend the chief executive expressed his frustration over the academy's failure to produce talent.</p>
              <p>Arnesen secured the services of Kakuta and he had the authority to sign off the deal. If Chelsea fail in their appeal and Ancelotti has to plan for the future without buying another player for 16 months, it could get very messy.</p>
