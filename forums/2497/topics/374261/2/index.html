              <h1 class="titlestory">Lens warned Chelsea of potential ban</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>French club Lens have admitted to warning <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> of a potential transfer ban if they pursued the signing of Gaël Kakuta.</p>
              <p>Lens’ former general manager François Collado said he met with Blues
              officials in London and informed them that they risked a ban if they
              signed Kakuta as he had a pre-contract with Lens.</p>
              <p>The contract stated that Kakuta would sign a professional
              contract with Lens when he turned 17 but the Blues went against that,
              according to Collado.</p>
              <p>"The contract was rubber-stamped by the French league and French football federation," Collado claimed.</p>
              <p>"But <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> took him and played in a tournament with all their reserves, even
              without international clearance. When I met with (Peter) Kenyon and
              (Frank) Arnesen at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> I took the contract. I told Kenyon, 'You're risking a fine and a transfer ban'. I explained the Fifa rules to him.</p>
              <p>"Kenyon spoke with Arnesen and he said they were sure of their intentions. We said this is what we want and they said no way.</p>
              <p>“They proposed a ridiculous fee. I said I'll leave you and if you're
              sure then I'll go to Fifa and we'll see if you're not sanctioned. They
              said there would be no need for another meeting."</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> have now been slapped with a transfer embargo that will not allow them to make any signings for the entirety of 2010.</p>

              <p>FIFA are seriously gunning for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> after handing them a transfers ban to January 2011 for the signing of former Lens midfielder Gael Kakuta.</p>
              <p>According to one source, it is partly because the world governing body has lost patience with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> for what is seen as arrogance over the way they sometimes conduct transfers.</p>
              <p>So much so that the <em>Daily Mail</em> says former employees have been approached in recent months to assist with their investigation.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> chief Frank Arnesen celebrated the capture of Lens teen Gael Kakuta.</p>
              <p>"I've just landed the best kid in France," <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>'s academy boss told his employers in a meeting at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>The capture of exactly the kind of player he was desperate to deliver.
              The Dane was under pressure, according to sources at the club. Not
              least because many of those he had recruited since joining in a
              controversial move from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> in September 2005 were not deemed to be of the necessary standard, says the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p>
              <p>"Arnesen was so pleased with himself," said one club insider. "But it was a big relief for him to get the boy."</p>
              <p>Now <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> must appeal against the transfers ban handed down by FIFA yesterday over the manner of signing the French youngster.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fifa"><span style="color: #005689;">Fifa</span></a>'s stand should be applauded, not derided. The Gaël Kakuta case follows several episodes in which former clubs of talented young players, often in Italy, have howled with outrage that their teenagers have been "poached" or "robbed" by ruthless English clubs waving wads of money.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;">Chelsea</span></a> have figured in a few of those accusations, as did Manchester United for signing Federico Macheda at 16; Lazio's president, Claudio Lotito, described the environment then as "a proper cattle market".</p>
              <p>Yet the Italian clubs had no rights in those cases; they were vulnerable because of their own regulations, which prohibit young players from signing contracts until they are 18. With Kakuta, it was different. He was playing in France, for Lens, who say they had a contract with him. Fifa's Dispute Resolution Chamber moved in, to apply clear rules which enforce a solid principle: contracts in football must be honoured. Fifa's regulations set out that any club which signs a player who has a valid contract with another club is considered to have induced that breach of contract. The penalties – fines, suspensions and the one we had barely heard of until this: banning clubs from signing any more players for one or two transfer windows – all have precedents.</p>
              <p>While English football reeled in shock and Chelsea, although not denying that Kakuta had a contract, protested that the penalty was "without precedent to this level and totally disproportionate to the alleged offence", the Lens president, Gervais Martel, was taking it calmly.</p>
              <p>"We expected this kind of decision," he said. "The player was under contract with us, and they came and stole him away."</p>
              <p>Chelsea have said they will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but in recent cases the CAS has encouraged Fifa by upholding its rulings. In January the CAS upheld a Fifa penalty against the Al Kuwait sports club which was very similar to the one imposed on Chelsea. Al Kuwait were found to have sacked an Estonian player, Vjatseslav Zahovaiko, in breach of his valid contract. The club was fined $120,000 (£73,500) and, like Chelsea, banned from signing new players for two transfer windows.</p>
              <p>The case being cited to give Chelsea hope was in 2005, when the CAS reduced a Fifa sanction against Roma, who were found guilty of inducing the centre-half Philippe Mexès to breach his contract with Auxerre. Still, the CAS upheld the ban on Roma signing players, reducing the period from two transfer windows to one.</p>
              <p>There are several other cases in which the CAS has upheld Fifa rulings over players breaking their contracts, and FC Sion, of Switzerland, are currently appealing to the CAS against a two-transfer-window ban imposed in May.</p>
              <p>Fifa has publicly welcomed the CAS when it has backed the sanctions, saying the regulations are dedicated to "defending contractual stability in football".</p>
              <p>So Chelsea are on a stickier wicket, and Fifa surer of its ground, than some might have thought when the news first broke and the ban on signing players seemed, on these shores, unheard of.</p>
              <p>If Chelsea are to appeal, they may have to argue that they did not do what Fifa found they did – we have been given scant details so far – or that somehow Kakuta's contract with Lens was not valid. It might safely be assumed that the DRC members are not complete fools and will have considered the issues fully, knowing that Chelsea were certain to appeal to the CAS. If the facts are upheld, the appeal will be on the severity of the punishment, and there the Al Kuwait case could stand as a precedent. Where a club has been found guilty of inducing a player to breach a contract, the CAS has upheld a two-transfer-window ban.</p>
              <p>The case is not what it seemed at first, that Fifa had finally been able to get tough on rich clubs who poach young talent being nurtured by smaller clubs around Europe and elsewhere in the world. Nor does it have anything to do with that other stain on football's treatment of young people, the trafficking of fledgling talent across continents, by men who hope to make pots of money somewhere along the chain.</p>
              <p>This one is more straightforward: Chelsea wanted Kakuta. No great scouting insight was necessary because he was an outstanding young player at European youth level, known to all the clubs. Chelsea signed him at 16, presumably paying him very well to join the multinational hopefuls in Roman Abramovich's academy. Chelsea's only problem, Fifa have found, is that Kakuta already had a contract, and breaking that is not allowed.</p>
              <p>Those in English football inclined to a knee-jerk criticism of Fifa, or Sepp Blatter, for supposedly having it in for English football should perhaps think instead about applauding the world governing body for taking a stand.</p>

              <p class="first"><strong>Chelsea could be allowed to sign new players in the January 2010 transfer window despite a Fifa ban.</strong></p>
              <p>Football's governing body handed out a ban until 2011 after they found the Blues guilty of inducing Gael Kakuta to break his contract with Lens in 2007.</p>
              <p>But Chelsea could get a reprieve if they delay lodging any appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).</p>
              <p>Cas has indicated that if Chelsea take the full 21 days to appeal, their ban may be frozen while a decision is made.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>"It depends on the filing date of the appeal," Cas secretary general Matthieu Reeb told BBC Sport.</p>
              <p>"If we have an appeal within the next week, it seems realistic we will have a hearing in November and a decision in December.</p>
              <p>"If it goes a little longer, we'd have to wait until next year but then we'd have a problem with the January transfer period.</p>
              <p>"So there is a possibility of Chelsea requesting a stay of the Fifa decision so it is frozen until the final decision of Cas is rendered.</p>
              <p>"This means the enforcement of the Fifa decision would not be immediate. It could be postponed and then if the sanction was finally confirmed by Cas, the suspension would be postponed to the next transfer window."</p>
              <p>As it stands, Chelsea are barred from registering any new players, nationally, or internationally, during the January or summer 2010 transfer windows.</p>
              <p>The Blues have already confirmed that they will launch the "strongest possible appeal" and they have 21 days to do so from when they receive Fifa's full decision.</p>
              <p>The Cas decision can be appealed only before the Swiss Supreme Court.</p>
              <p>Manchester United could also face an investigation after it emerged that another French club, Le Havre, are going to ask Fifa to look into Paul Pogba's move to Old Trafford last month.</p>
              <p>Fifa say they are yet to receive any complaint over the transfer of the 16-year-old midfielder.</p>
              <p>United told BBC Sport last month that Le Havre's accusations that they had stolen the French youngster were "complete nonsense".</p>
              <p>A French football agent, who wishes to remain anonymous for professional reasons, told BBC Sport: "If Lens or Le Havre were legally able to sign the two players to contracts they would definitely have done it already.</p>
              <p>"But French law prevents players from signing contracts if they under 16 and haven't achieved the requisite level at school.</p>
              <p>"The clubs can make agreements with these players that say they will give them a contract when they have attained the right educational qualification of turned 16.</p>
              <p>"It is a pre-contract. It is called an 'accord de norm sollicitation' in French. It is a written agreement between club and player.</p>
              <p>"That is what Kakuta and Pogba had. Fifa is clearly now saying these accords are as good as contracts, while Chelsea and Manchester United are saying they are not."</p>
              <p>Fifa punished Switzerland's FC Sion for a similar offence to Chelsea's in April and the club was told it could not sign players until the 2010 off-season.</p>
              <p>Sion have appealed to Cas, which has frozen the sanctions while it considers the case, allowing the club to trade before the current season began. A ruling is expected later this year.</p>
              <p>Italian club Roma were banned from signing players for two transfer windows in 2004, over their move for Auxerre's Philippe Mexes, after they appealed to Cas and their suspension was reduced to one window.</p>
              <p>The arbitration panel will be made up by one judge selected by Chelsea, one by Lens and the chairman will be from Cas.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Chelsea risk having transfer ban INCREASED on appeal</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> face having their shocking transfer ban INCREASED!</p>
              <p>The Blues were stunned on Thursday when FIFA's Disputes Resolution
              Chamber imposed an embargo on the club signing players until January
              2011 for illegally poaching Gael Kakuta.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> were outraged at the decision and have vowed to mount the strongest
              possible appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in
              Switzerland.</p>
              <p>But Ian Blackshaw, an international sports lawyer who sits on the CAS, has warned <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> the court has the power to hit them even harder than FIFA did.</p>
              <p>He told <em>The Sun</em>: "While it is possible for the court to
              reduce the penalty, it is open to the CAS - if they take the view that
              the penalty imposed isn't severe enough - to impose a higher penalty.</p>
              <p>"This has happened in a number of doping cases where the CAS
              has said the body concerned was too lenient, a two-year ban was not
              sufficient and the punishment did not fit the crime.</p>
              <p>"They have then increased the punishment to three or even four years.</p>
              <p>"This is the risk <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> will take in this case even though the risk may be more theoretical than actual or practical."</p>
              <p>It had been assumed <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> had nothing to lose by appealing and at worst the FIFA ruling - banning
              them from buying players during the next two transfer windows - would
              be upheld.</p>
              <p>But now further danger has been exposed. Blackshaw, though, believes <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> have an advantage because they can bring more evidence to the table and could get Kakuta to give his side of the story.</p>
              <p>He said: "<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> have 21 days to give notice of their appeal to the CAS in Lausanne.</p>
              <p>"The CAS is the supreme court of world sport, you cannot go any
              higher than that. I don't want to prejudge the appeal but the advantage
              <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> have is that under CAS rules they can look at the case all over again from scratch.</p>
              <p>"They can accept new evidence and new information which perhaps wasn't in front of FIFA.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> can introduce Kakuta as a witness to say what the facts were as far as he was concerned.</p>
              <p>"They can appeal against every aspect of the ruling, the fine and the
              sanctions - which do seem rather harsh and swingeing - and there are
              precedents for the court to reduce the penalty."</p>

              <p>The England skipper said: "We've all done that. Didier's a world-class
              player and we love him to bits. He's a big strong lad and at times he
              can get a knock and go down like anybody.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes he stays down a little bit too long but sometimes slight knocks can keep players down.</p>
              <p>"He's a brilliant player and it's something we've addressed and Didier has definitely changed for the better - for him and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"He gets the respect he deserves now. Sometimes it went against
              him and people forgot just how good he was. He's a player who wants to
              win and does anything for that.</p>
              <p>"We're very proud of the image we have in England. We don't go
              into games with the manager saying let's get fouls around the box. It's
              not our mentality."</p>

              <p>Secretary general for the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Matthieu Reeb, has revealed <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> can expect a decision on their appeal over their transfer embargo by December.</p>
              <p>The Blues have confirmed that they will contest the decision that
              saw Fifa ban them from signing any new players until January 2011 after
              they were found guilty of inducing Gael Kakuta to break his contract
              with Lens in 2007.</p>
              <p>"If the appeal is fielded within the deadline of the next 21
              days we should have the appeal in the next two or three weeks. Then the
              CAS can proceed in an extradited manner depending on whether the party
              has agreed to extradite the procedure," Reeb told <em>Sky Sports News.</em></p>
              <p>"But at the least we will probably issue a decision at the end of November or mid-December.</p>
              <p>"We will have a panel of three arbitrators, so three judges. One will be selected by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> the other by FC Lens and Fifa and the chairman will be CAS.</p>
              <p>"It will be a final decision which would replace the Fifa decision if
              necessary. The CAS decision can be appealed only before the Swiss
              Supreme Court which is for the Swiss tribunal.</p>
              <p>"It could be a final ruling before Christmas."</p>
