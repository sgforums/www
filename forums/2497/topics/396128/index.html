              <p>England's opening World Cup match against the USA is being targeted 
              by a terror group linked to al-Qa'eda.</p>
              <p>An immediate review of 
              security was ordered last night for the showpiece game in South Africa 
              after an Algerian-based group posted an online threat to bring 'deaths' 
              in an explosion on the day of the game.</p>
              <p>Thousands of British 
              and American fans are expected to descend on the town of Rustenberg - 40
               miles north of Johannesburg on June 12 - for the Group C game.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/09/article-1264901-0779BB38000005DC-313_468x286.jpg" alt="Royal Bafokeng Stadium" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption" style="text-align: left;"><em>Terror: A group have 
              threatened to attack the Royal Bafokeng Stadium during the match between
               England and USA</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The fear of a terror attack is one of 
              the biggest concerns of tournament organisers with USA and Britain at 
              the top of the target list because of their leading role in the War on 
              Terror.</p>
              <p>The threats were made on a jihadist online magazine of
               the North Africa terror group 'al-Qa'eda in the Islamic Maghreb', a 
              militant organisation based in Algeria.</p>
              <p>The group said it 
              planned to use a form of 'undetectable' explosive that will be able to 
              evade security checkpoints. The article refers to an 'explosion causing 
              hundreds of deaths'.</p>
              <p>This incident put World Cup organisers 
              on a heightened state of alert for the forthcoming tournament and now 
              there will be further concerns about security at the 45,000 capacity 
              stadium hosting the game.</p>
              <p>The terror threat prompted a 
              response from FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke.</p>
              <p>He said: 
              'It does not mean that because we receive a threat, the World Cup should
               not be allowed to be contested in South Africa or any other country</p>
              <p>'We
               have freedom in the world to celebrate what we want. As the management 
              of the organisation that governs world football, we know there is a 
              threat. We will not stop the organisation of the World Cup because we 
              got the threat.'</p>
              <p>The Football Association would not comment 
              but insiders said that both the Association of Chief Police Officers, 
              the Home Office and Foreign Office were aware of the threat.</p>
              <p>More
               than 2.2 million tickets have already been sold for the month-long 
              tournament and South African police have insisted their World Cup 
              security plans are adequate despite the threats made ahead of England's 
              match against the USA.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/09/article-1264901-064DD56D000005DC-850_468x295.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney (left)" width="468" height="295">
              <p class="imageCaption" style="text-align: left;"><em>Hurdles to get over: 
              England's match with USA will have a high security presence</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>British anti-terror expert Professor Paul Wilkinson of St Andrews 
              University said yesterday that the threat should be taken seriously.</p>
              <p>He
               said: 'It is genuine and very similar to many other al-Qa'eda websites 
              That doesn't mean what is stated on such websites is to be believed.</p>
              <p>'On
               the other hand, the message may have the effect of mobilising an 
              individual or group to carry out an attack and it is essential for the 
              authorities to increase security. '</p>
              <p>The threat comes at a time
               of growing concern over the expansion of al-Qa'eda in Africa. While 
              Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria have all supplied fighters to Jihadist 
              groups - a hard-core of terrorist are now being trained in Somalia.</p>
              <p>Earlier
               this year the Togo team was ambushed as it travelled to the African Cup
               of Nations tournament in Angola - killing three and injuring a number 
              of others.</p>
              <p>A group called the Front for the Liberation of the 
              Enclave of Cabinda - which has no known links to al-Qa'eda - later 
              claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
              <p>Last night South 
              African police chief Vishnu Naidoo questioned the credibility of the 
              threat, but added: 'Interpol will be based in South Africa during the 
              duration of the tournament.</p>
              <p>'They have also established a 
              database of all persons involved in organised crime, from hooliganism to
               terrorism.</p>
              <p>'No one from that database will be allowed here. 
              We also have our own intelligence community here, the police, army, 
              secret service, working on a daily basis, monitoring potential threats.</p>
              <p>'Our
               police officers are being trained by the American police to combat 
              chemical, biological and nuclear attacks.'</p>
              <p>Terror experts said
               it was unusual for al-Qa'eda and linked organisations to give advance 
              warning of their precise target, tactics and plans.</p>
              <p>Professor 
              Paul Wilkinson added: 'It is unusual, to say the least, for al-Qa'eda 
              and affiliate organisations to give advance notice of their precise 
              target and the tactic they will use.</p>
              <p>'However, the 
              authorities can't afford to ignore it, because people reading this 
              message will include militants who mightÂ  think this is something they 
              want to do.</p>
              <p>'The deliberate pinpointing of this match 
              highlights the hatred al-Qa'eda has for our country and the United 
              States.'</p>
