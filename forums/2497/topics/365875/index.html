              <h1>CITY DOUBLE SWOOP</h1>

              <h2>Megabucks deals will be done this week</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>MANCHESTER CITY have completed a £25million swoop for Barcelona strike ace Samuel Eto'o.</h3>
              <p>And they will take their summer spending past the £90m mark by this week confirming they have also landed £30m hitman Carlos Tevez from Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Cameroon star Eto'o, 28, is expected to travel to Manchester in the next few days to finalise the deal. Argentine Tevez will sign a four-year deal worth around £140,000 a week on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Eto'o, who initially demanded £200,000 a week after tax, will put pen to paper on a five-year deal worth £180k a week after tax, with further bonuses tied to success.</p>
              <p>A source said: "The player could have earned similar money at Barca. But Eto'o and his people think City could be going places and is excited by the type of players they are attracting."</p>
              <p>Eto'o's path to City appears to have been cleared by Barca, who are negotiating a £13m deal for Palmeiras whizz Keirrison. Sources believe the Brazilian will then be loaned to Valencia, in return for them letting David Villa go to the Nou Camp for £37m.</p>
              <p>City have already spent £30m on Gareth Barry and Roque Santa Cruz.</p>

              Eto'o could be on his way to Eastlands after Barcelona revealed
              Manchester City had made the striker a "stratospheric offer".</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Speculation has been rife
              about where Eto'o will be next season as, with his contract set to
              expire next summer, Barca were keen to either tie him to a new deal or
              cash in on the Cameroon striker.</p>
              <p>Reports suggest the Catalan giants have accepted a 30 million
              euro bid from City and barca president Joan Laporta believes the
              temptation of a mega salary would prove too much for Eto'o.</p>
              <p>"Eto'o has a stratospheric offer from City, which would convert
              him into the best paid player in the world," told Catalan radio station
              iCat FM.</p>
              <p>"It's starting to become clear that he has this monster offer.</p>
              <p>"He wants to stay but an offer like this is very difficult to refuse.</p>
              <p>"If Eto'o accepts this stratospheric offer we will have to bring in someone."</p>
              <p>Eto'o contributed 36 goals last season as Barca claimed an
              unprecedented Primera Division, Copa del Rey and Champions League
              treble.</p>
              <p>Should the 28-year-old leave the Nou Camp, Barca would likely
              step up their efforts to land Spain and Valencia striker David Villa.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man City will make Eto'o England's first £200,000-a-week player</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> are ready to make <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Samuel Eto'o</span></abbr> the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premiership</span></abbr>'s first £200,000-a-week player.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says City will match Barcelona’s asking price of
              about £25 million for Eto’o and have agreed to pay the striker in the
              region of £200,000 a week, including bonuses, as the Barclays Premier
              League’s new financial superpower looks set to deliver the global
              superstar that Sheikh Mansour, the club’s billionaire owner, craves.</p>
              <p>Over the course of a four-year contract, the deal could be
              worth more than £66 million in total, with City hoping formally to
              conclude the extraordinary transfer coup before the squad flies to
              South Africa on July 15 for a pre-season tour.</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, the Portugal forward, will supersede Eto’o
              as the highest-paid player in the world once the annual 25 per cent
              increase on his £9.5 million-a-year salary at Real Madrid kicks in,
              but, for now, Eto’o would have no rival in the pay stakes.</p>
              <p>Barca president Joan Laporta confirmed last night: “Eto’o has a
              stratospheric offer from City, which would convert him into the
              best-paid player in the world.</p>
              <p>“It’s starting to become clear that he has this monster offer.
              He wants to stay but an offer like this is very difficult to refuse. If
              Eto’o accepts this stratospheric offer, we will have to bring someone
              in.”</p>

              <p>lol. SWP is safe is he is english and in the national team. his position is not threatened by Etoo and Tevez arrival, only bellamy is. Robinho will feel that his best position is striker, not sure if he is happy playing as a winger. if he is on the bench, then he sure is unhappy and time for him to move on as well.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Eto'o to say 'no' to Man City today</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Barcelona</span></abbr> ace <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Samuel Eto'o</span></abbr> is set to turn down the cash at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Barcelona</span></abbr> striker will hold a press conference today and announce that he has
              rejected the chance to become the world's best-paid player on £180,000
              a week net, after the clubs agreed a fee of £25million.</p>
              <p>His agent Josep Maria Mesalles confirmed that he had coolled on
              the idea, saying: "Unless there is a 180 degree turnaround, he will
              stay at Barcelona."</p>
              <p>But there could still be a glimmer of hope for City after it
              emerged Nou Camp president Joan Laporta will do his utmost to force the
              transfer through after being incensed by Eto'os stance.</p>
              <p>With just 12 months left on his current contract, it is
              understood the Cameroon front-runner is looking for a signing-on fee of
              around £13million, on top of a wage increase, to sign a new deal.</p>
              <p>Barcelona refuse to sanction such a package, and with Inter
              Milan also unable to meet his demands, he faces a battle of wills with
              Laporta, who wants to take City's money, rather than lose him for
              nothing next summer.</p>
