            <div class='col-md body'>Wigan have slashed ticket prices in a bid to get the fans flocking back to the JJB Stadium and roar the club on to Premiership survival.<br><br>Paul Jewell recently criticised the stay-away supporters who had turned their back on the club, creating a sterile atmosphere inside the ground.<br><br>As an apparent one-off, the Latics cut prices to just Â£15 for the last-gasp 3-2 defeat to Chelsea just before Christmas, sparking a virtual sell-out.<br><br>But the attendance dropped drastically by just over 7,000 for the crushing 3-0 loss to Blackburn on New Year's Day.<br><br>Now Wigan have responded again, with adult tickts Â£15 for the home games with Portsmouth, Fulham, West Ham and Middlesbrough, and Â£20 for the visits of Newcastle, Bolton and Spurs.<br><br>Jewell is now hoping the fans will respond and back the players, with the Latics are just one place and four points off the relegation zone.<br><br>'Everyone saw what a fantastic atmosphere we generated with a packed JJB Stadium against Chelsea,' said Jewell. 'It was absolutely rocking and it had a big impact on the performance of the players.<br><br>'The lads were buzzing in the dressing room to be playing in front of a noisy and passionate full house and we want to try and re-create that from now until the end of the season.<br><br>'To have a full stadium gives the players a massive lift and I'm behind any project which aims to get the people of Wigan in through the door and backing the team.<br><br>'We need the Wigan fans to be our 12th man. They will play a crucial role for the remaining matches of the season.<br><br>'These are crucial times for this club. I hope the supporters will join with us for the battle.'<br><br>Â• Jewell hopes to learn before the end of the week if a deal can be agreed to re-sign their former striker Nathan Ellington.<br><br>The Latics are in discussions with West Brom for the player they sold in July 2005, having made an offer in the region of Â£2million.<br><br>The Baggies are thought to be holding out for around Â£3million for the 25-year-old but negotiations will continue.<br><br>'We will see what happens in the next 48 hours, but I do expect some sort of outcome one way or another,'' the player's agent Tony Finnigan said.<br><br>Ellington scored 67 goals in three seasons with Wigan to help them into the Premiership but left after failing to agree a new contract.<br></div>
