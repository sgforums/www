              <p><strong>Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas has underlined his respect for Barcelona as they continue the pursuit for his signature - but suggested he remains committed to Arsenal.</strong></p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Arsenal boss <span style="color: #000000;">Arsene Wenger</span> again reiterated that Fabregas was not for sale at any price, but that message is unlikely to deter Barca as the transfer deadline draws nearer.</p>
              <p>Fabregas also spoke of his high regard for Wenger, but his comments about Barcelona will not put Gunners fans' minds at rest.</p>
              <p>Fabregas is due to fly back into Heathrow airport on Thursday as he returns to the club's London Colney training ground after an extended post-World Cup break.</p>
              <p>In an interview with Spanish lifestyle magazine <em>DIR Emotions</em>, Fabregas said: "I am from Barcelona. I am a club member, along with my grandfather, my uncle and my cousin. I feel those colours and have since I was young. I am Catalan, I am from Arenys, I have come through the Barca youth system.</p>
              <p>"Those players are my friends and have been for many years. They play stellar football and everything they have won they deserve 100%. [Carles] Puyol gives me confidence and has taken care of me like an older brother. Bojan inspires calm. [Sergio] Busquets is simple and authentic. Xavi is a maestro. [Andres] Iniesta has so much patience, especially given what has happened to him in terms of injuries. [Lionel] Messi is calm, shy, and very kind. [Victor] Valdes has a lot of personality.</p>
              <p>"However, I am Arsenal's captain. I am a Gunner and that is where I have made myself as a player and matured as a person. He [Arsene Wenger] is a second father to me, the most important person in my life after my father. He has been very supportive of me and has treated my like a son. I am part of his family.</p>
              <p>"He does not want me to leave. My last conversation with him in London was one of the most difficult moments I have had to live. I am left very touched.</p>
              <p>"I want to continue fighting for every title, especially the Champions League, because I am a winner."</p>

              <p><em>Puyol  "Anybody who tries to convince themselves Cesc wanted to stay at Arsenal is wrong."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER was told last night: You are keeping Cesc Fabregas against his will. Barcelona skipper Carles Puyol declared: "He is having to stay at a club where he no longer wants to be for another year. "I wonder how intelligent it is keeping a player who doesn't want to be there.</h2>
              <p>"After seven years of great service, I thought Arsenal could have granted him his dream move."</p>
              <p>Puyol accepts his fellow Spanish World Cup star will remain at the Emirates for another 12 months. But the Gunners will view these latest controversial comments as another shameless attempt by Barca to try to destabilise the situation and hasten Fabregas' departure for the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>Fabregas, who has been on holiday in Ibiza, is due to meet boss Wenger next week, report for the team photo and then start his pre-season.</p>
              <p>Yet Puyol added: "Cesc has given everything to Arsenal to try to win a trophy but they haven't matched his expectations. "I won't say he is in a prison, as we know how privileged we are as football players. "But after how clear Cesc made it that he wanted to be in Barcelona, I thought they would have granted him that."</p>
              <p>Wenger, whose team face AC Milan in the Emirates Cup tomorrow, has insisted this week that Fabregas is staying - despite the 'noises' coming from Spain.</p>
              <p>Even so, Puyol, who forced Fabregas to wear a Barcelona shirt during Spain's World Cup celebrations, insisted: "We all thought a deal would be done this summer. "But Arsenal have refused to talk and we are going to have to wait another year to get Cesc home.</p>
              <p>"He is far too classy a guy to say it but the truth is he doesn't want to be at Arsenal this season. His heart is already in Barcelona, even though we must wait another year for his body to be here.</p>
              <p>"We know he is arriving next season. Barcelona have a whole year to sort the deal out. "He is professional enough still to have a great season and also because he has a lot of respect for the Arsenal fans. "But anybody who tries to convince themselves he wanted to stay at Arsenal is wrong."</p>
              <p>Puyol's fellow Barca centre-back Gerard Pique, who has been holidaying with Fabregas, said: "I know Cesc wants to win titles with Barca and I want him here this summer. "I understand why Arsenal reject the sale. Cesc is a very difficult player to replace. "But I do not feel a club should keep a footballer who wants to leave. Especially in this case, where Cesc has done everything for Arsenal."</p>

              <p>once Barcelona offers 50 millions for Cesc, Arsenal would be more than happy to sell. but the fact is Barcelona does not want to pay that kind of money for Cesc. why? i deduce it in 2 ways. </p>
              <p>1) Barcelona is literally broke. but than again, i hear that they own a bank... so why not break the bank vault and raise the money? the fans at Barcelona would be more than happy to "donate" some money to raise money for the purchase. the population at Barcelona is said to be 1,621,537 number of people. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona</a>) </p>
              <p>as such, 50 million divide by 1.6 million = 31.25</p>
              <p>if each individual donate $31.25 to the Barcelona Football Club for the purchase of Cesc, the deal can go through very quickly. i don't think it's a big sum for such a big club and city.</p>
              <p>2) they don't really love Cesc that much to break the bank vault. okay, maybe we can look into another perspective. Arsenal is the kidnapper that holds Barcelona's son Cesc ransom. Arsenal demands 50 million for the release of Barcelona's DNA son and if you are able to afford that amount, won't the parents pay up immediately to secure the release of their son? i would pay up and even give up my life for the safety of my son, won't any good parents do that? so in view of this, Barcelona does not love Cesc as much as they claimed and thus, they only want Cesc back to make Arsenal look bad. </p>
