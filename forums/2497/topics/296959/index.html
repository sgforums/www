Capello, who flies in to London this morning to talk to the FA, could be installed by the weekend, and one of his first decisions will be whether to keep Terry as captain.</strong><br><br>One of the issues to be discussed is the captaincy, normal procedure when a new England manger is interviewed, but carrying particular sensitivity now. Leading FA mandarins have been unimpressed by Terry's behaviour on and off the pitch.<br><br>As well as being seen remonstrating with referees, the Chelsea captain has featured rather inelegantly on the front pages of some newspapers. Some within Soho Square feel that being England captain is an honour that bears certain responsibilities as a role model, not just for other players but for the millions who follow the national team.<br><br>Having an England captain who regularly shows dissent towards officials does not sit well with FA campaigns to promote discipline at all levels of the game. The call on the captaincy will be Capello's, but he will be made aware of the concerns about Terry among certain members of the FA hierarchy.<br><br>David Beckham is expected to captain the side in England's next game, the Feb 6 friendly against Switzerland at Wembley, on the occasion of his 100th international. After that, Capello's choice will be interesting.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42372000/jpg/_42372622_poll_terry203.jpg"><br><span class="small">Poll (left) sent off Terry at White Hart Lane</span><br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44142000/jpg/_44142031_redcard203.jpg"><br><span class="small">Chelsea's players surrounded Mike Dean after Obi's dismissal</span><br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/09_04/080chelsea_468x358.jpg"><br><span class="small">England captain John Terry escaped punishment after appearing to grab Dean's red card. </span></div>

All they seem to care about is getting drunk, driving fast cars and pulling women."<br><br>The film clearly captures Terry, wearing a striped blue and white polo shirt, jigging up and down on his bad leg with the scantily-clad girls. Another witness said: "The pole-dancing area is up a couple of steps so everyone saw what was going on. He's really going for it and you can see the girls, who were wearing tiny tops and hotpants, were loving it. He even appears to be pretending to rub his groin as he turns to face them at one point. "Certainly his movement is amazing. I'm surprised he was out so long with a knee injury because his dancing was pretty fast and furious."<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/25_england_strip.jpg"><br><span class="small">England captain Terry made a fool of himself</span><br><br>Terry's astonishing six-figure wage packet has brought him a fleet of cars, including a Â£120,000 Ferrari and a Â£130,000 Bentley.<br><br>Our witness confirmed: "I recognised John Terry who was very drunk. He was dancing about at his table in time to the music and lapping up the attention. "Obviously the girls knew who he was and they kept going up to sit with him. The lapdancers were taking it in turns to sit on his knee and they were in high spirits. "He went up to dance on stage with two lapdancers. He was wriggling his hips and trying to dance all sexy with the girls. "I thought he was meant to be injured but he didn't show any signs of that as he larked around with the scantily-clad girls.<br><br><a href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/videoplayer/index.php?videoid=http://del.interoute.com/?id=b1b0d191-7584-43f6-9620-8b553a886f3b&amp;delivery=stream" rel="nofollow">Watch John Terry went up to dance on stage with two lapdancers.</a><br><br>But Terry's dancing antics were mild compared to what happened next. The witness went on: "Later he was so drunk he peed onto the floor and someone had to clear it up. "He was trying to pee into a plastic cup. What sort of behaviour is that for an England captain? I think they have got too much too easily.<br></div>

One of former head coach Steve McClaren's first duties was the name the Chelsea defender his new captain in place of experienced midfielder David Beckham.</strong><br><br>However, with England closing in on a new head coach, believed to be Fabio Capello, Terry could lose the armband once the new regime is in place. "The new manager can change things completely," is quoted in the Sun. "That's his decision and I fully respect whatever he decides.<br><br>"Whoever the manager is he'll make the right decision for England - not for John Terry or Steven Gerrard or for anyone. "But I want to keep the armband and drive this thing forward. I want to make England successful."<br><br>The good news for Terry is that Capello has already stated he is against picking a striker as his captain, meaning he may opt for the Chelsea ace over the likes of Michael Owen or Wayne Rooney.<br><br>The former Real Madrid has gone with strikers and his team leader in the past, although he believes their selfish instincts often have a detrimental effect on the team. "A coach must create a team discipline and then leave room for the individual qualities of the best players within the team discipline," revealed Capello.<br><br>"In my team I've had many, many leaders but one three of them were ever strikers - Marco van Basten, Raul and Alex Del Piero. "It is difficult for a striker to become a leader because the selfish part of his soul must always come out."<br><br></div>
