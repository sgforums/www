              <p>Obafemi Martins and Peter Lovenkrands climbed off the substitutes'
                  bench to hand Alan Shearer a first victory and Newcastle a Barclays
                  Premier League lifeline with a 3-1 win over Middlesbrough.</p>
              <p>The
                  Nigeria international struck within seconds of replacing Michael Owen
                  with 20 minutes of a pulsating encounter remaining and the Dane secured
                  the points with four minutes left to drag the Magpies out of the
                  relegation zone and send Hull into the bottom three.</p>
              <p>• <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=244510&amp;league=ENG.1&amp;cc=4716#quotes">Shearer savours breakthrough win</a></p>
              <p>It
                  was Newcastle's first home win since December 21 and just their second
                  anywhere in 18 attempts in what Shearer had described as the biggest
                  match of his career, and he celebrated accordingly on the final whistle.</p>
              <p>But
                  opposite number Gareth Southgate could have few complaints about the
                  effort his players put in as they fought for their top-flight lives to
                  the death, although their plight now looks desperate after an 11th
                  successive away league defeat.</p>
              <p>They had taken a third-minute lead
                  when the unfortunate Habib Beye bundled the ball into his own net after
                  goalkeeper Steve Harper had blocked Tuncay Sanli's close-range shot.</p>
              <p>However,
                  defender Steven Taylor levelled within six with a bullet header after
                  Boro old boy Mark Viduka had hit the post on a night when both sides
                  enjoyed spells of control in front of a passionate crowd of 51,252.</p>
              <p>Owen,
                  who admitted his disappointment at being dropped for the trip to
                  Liverpool last time out in his programme notes, returned to the
                  starting line-up in one of five changes as Shearer went for broke.</p>
              <p>However,
                  with Boro also having reached the point of no return, Southgate too
                  adopted an attacking approach with record signing Afonso Alves
                  partnering Marvin Emnes in attack as the Dutchman was handed a first
                  league start, and Stewart Downing lined up on the right in an attempt
                  to test makeshift full-back Damien Duff.</p>
              <p>The first goal arrived
                  within three minutes of the kick-off, but for Shearer, it came at the
                  wrong end and with a good deal of misfortune.</p>
              <p>Tuncay turned well on Alves' pass, but looked to have overrun the ball.</p>
              <p>He
                  got there just ahead of the fast-advancing Harper, who blocked, only to
                  see the rebound ricochet back off Beye and into his own net.</p>
              <p>Newcastle's
                  luck did not improve at all three minutes later when Viduka blasted a
                  shot towards Brad Jones' top corner, but with the goalkeeper looking on
                  helplessly the ball cannoned back off the post.</p>
              <p>But if there was
                  any sense of despondency at St James' it disappeared with nine minutes
                  gone when Taylor rose to meet the first of a series of Danny Guthrie
                  corners and guided a header past Jones.</p>
              <p>The home side took the
                  game by the scruff of the neck and Jones had to pull off a vital
                  fingertip save to keep out Owen's flicked 27th-minute header.</p>
              <p>But
                  Boro gradually eased their way into the game and with Downing and
                  Tuncay prospering on the wings and Emnes causing all kinds of problems
                  to stretch the Magpies defence, they threatened to restore their lead.</p>
              <p>They
                  very nearly did just that when the Dutchman benefited from Mohamed
                  Shawky's tackle on Viduka deep inside his own half and blasted in a
                  shot which Harper blocked with his legs, and the striker wastefully
                  dragged the loose ball wide.</p>
              <p>Alves later departed on a stretcher
                  to be replaced by Marlon King, but the game was very much in the
                  melting pot as the players headed for the dressing room.</p>
              <p>Viduka
                  might have put the home side ahead with the cheekiest of efforts when
                  he back-heeled Beye's 46th-minute cross wide of the far post, and Nicky
                  Butt drilled a free-kick into the defensive wall as the Magpies started
                  brightly once again.</p>
              <p>But Boro's response was concerted and as the
                  home side completely lost both their shape and concentration, it took
                  an excellent save from Harper to keep out Gary O'Neil's goal-bound
                  57th-minute strike.</p>
              <p>The Teessiders were by now looking the more
                  likely to break the deadlock, and Shearer decided the time had come to
                  replace Jonas Gutierrez with Lovenkrands.</p>
              <p>But it was Martins' arrival as a 70th-minute substitute for Owen which proved the turning point.</p>
              <p>Viduka
                  headed on a high ball past Kevin Nolan and the Nigerian stepped inside
                  Matthew Bates before dispatching the ball past Jones despite slipping
                  as he shot.</p>
              <p>The noise inside St James' almost lifted the roof,
                  although the game was far from over as the home fans settled down for
                  an agonising finish.</p>
              <p>But Lovenkrands calmed the nerves with four
                  minutes remaining when he thumped home Nolan's cross to seal a win as
                  important as any in the club's recent history.</p>
              <p><strong>Shearer savours breakthrough win</strong> After the match Shearer ordered his players to enjoy their victory in the biggest match of his career - but not for too long.He
                  said: "I have just said to them, 'Enjoy this tonight, enjoy that
                  winning feeling. You have worked your socks off to get it, now it's in
                  our hands'."I said to them before, 'It's been a good weekend, let's go and make it a great one tonight with the right result'."It's been a great weekend for us - but there are another two weekends to
                  come."It's the first game of three. We asked them to go out and get three points,
                  they have done that."They were magnificent under difficult circumstances. They have got now to go
                  and do that again on Saturday, enjoy that winning feeling and hopefully, there's
                  another one there on Saturday."But it will be just as tough because Fulham are flying themselves."Shearer
                  added: "I have just said, 'Enjoy it, enjoy it lads because we have been
                  in that bottom three for a long time. Enjoy being out of it and let's
                  make sure we are not back in there again'."I really believe we will [stay up], but we have won one game."Let's enjoy this tonight, but we are back in tomorrow and preparing for
                  Saturday."There is still a long way to go. I don't want to sound negative, but it's one
                  win. We have got to get another two and make sure we are safe."Boro manager Gareth Southgate, who lost record signing Afonso Alves to a
                  suspected broken bone in his foot, was left to reflect on key decisions which
                  went against his side in the run-up to Martins' strike.He said: "For them to lose in manner we did having gone ahead is very
                  difficult for all of us to take. It's a tough evening for everyone associated
                  with our football club."The players gave everything, but unfortunately, key events on the night went
                  against us."The second goal, looking at the television pictures, I thought at the time it
                  was a foul on [Robert] Huth by Viduka, but it was also offside."It then dropped straight to their guy - they are key things and
                  unfortunately, they didn't go for us."</p>
