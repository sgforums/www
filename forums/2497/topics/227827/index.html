            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... one time Danny Mills was seen as the ideal guy to replace Neville after a great season but things started to change after he went to the WC in 2002... Today he is... not sure which club also and Neville is still there at 31...<br><br>In football when it comes to youngsters like Micah, there is really no guarantee, he does look good for city but is he going to be a hit is still anyone's guess cos he is no Messi, Ronaldo or Lukas Podolski... proven at the highest and consistent. Even Khalid Boulahrouz, a regular in the Dutch national team and played well during the WC, suddenly become prone to making mistakes.<br><br>It would be silly if City don't sell him. I guess they had the experience with swp and feel should they missed this chance, they probably won't get so much again. Maybe they do realise that had they not sold SWP for $21m... Today, they probably would only get half of what they got for him... So a good deal for a club like City, they can use the much needed money to strengthen the overall team.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Manchester City balk at Distin's demand for Â£50,000 a week</strong><br><br>Sylvain Distin has rejected a final contract offer from Manchester City because the club are refusing to meet his Â£50,000-a-week salary demand. City have offered to make him their highest-paid player, with a weekly wage of Â£40,000, but the 29-year-old defender believes he is worth more and unless he backs down he is almost certain to leave.<br><br>Distin's present deal expires at the end of the season and, anxious not to lose a player of his calibre on a free transfer, City will reluctantly sell him if they receive an acceptable offer in the January transfer window. The club anticipate there will be several prospective buyers, but Distin's requirements may complicate matters. Middlesbrough had agreed an undisclosed fee with City last summer, only to balk at the defender's insistence that they pay him Â£2.6m a year.<br><br>Stuart Pearce, the City manager, has been given about Â£1.5m to spend in January and his transfer fund will be increased if Distin leaves. City's priority is to bring in at least one wide player, although they have failed in their attempts to persuade Chelsea to allow Shaun Wright-Phillips to return to his former club on loan. Pearce was informed that the player was available but for a fee that was out of City's price range. Despite speculation that Chelsea have identified Micah Richards for a big-money transfer, his name was not brought up during the talks. Pearce has subsequently renewed his interest in Olivier Thomert of Lens, a 26-year-old who can play on either wing and who came close to moving to City last summer.<br><br>Pearce, who will be dismayed to learn that one bookmaker has installed him as 4-1 favourite to be the next Premiership manager to be sacked.</div>
