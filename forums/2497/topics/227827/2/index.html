But Pearce revealed he is in touch with Chelsea about potential signings, one of which is understood to be former City winger Shaun Wright-Phillips.<br><br>Defender Richards, 18, has been linked with a January move to Stamford Bridge. Pearce said: "There has been no contact from Chelsea, although I have rung them about players coming here."<br><br>And Pearce also warned Chelsea that City do not need to sell Richards for financial reasons. He added: "I am delighted we have interest in our players, if that is the case, because it means those players are doing well.<br><br>"But I must remind everyone that Manchester City are not in the situation they were two years ago, when we had to sell. "Players will only leave this club if it benefits the club - full stop.<br><br>"Micah is very happy here, wants to stay at the football club and we are on a very sound financial footing." Richards made his England debut in the 1-1 draw with Holland in November.<br><br><strong>Chelsea has second thoughts ? ? ? After all, $18m is a lot of an unknown new kid and a defender somemore not striker...</strong></div>

If and when they do, they will find City in a much stronger financial position than when the Wright-Phillips deal was concluded.<br><br>And that, Pearce argued, allows him a degree of flexibility over whether to let Richards leave.<br><br>"If you need to sell, maybe every player does have his price," said Pearce.<br><br>"But Manchester City is nice and set financially in that we are not worrying where the next pound is coming from.

Pearce said: Â“If I say Â‘NoÂ’ to any sale then I would hope it would mean the club says Â‘NoÂ’ otherwise someone else might as well manage the club.Â”<br><br>Pearce does not expect to be overruled by chairman John Wardle even if, as expected, an Â£18million bid comes in from Stamford Bridge for Richards. Pearce, who let winger Shaun Wright-Phillips join the Blues for Â£21m last year, added: Â“The chairman here has never turned round to me and said Â‘WeÂ’ve got to sell someoneÂ’.<br><br>Â“He wonÂ’t do so at this stage because the club is more financially sound than it was two years ago. Â“The bottom line is that I have never suggested for one minute that any of the key players in my squad, like Micah, are for sale. Â“I donÂ’t think it is prudent to sell your better players and I donÂ’t think any of them want to leave.<br><br>Â“Chelsea can come knocking at the door of any club because they have the financial clout to do anything they want to do. They could buy the whole club Â— let alone one player.  Â“The club have left it with me and said Â‘ItÂ’s your responsibility here, youÂ’re the one who makes the decisionsÂ’.Â”<br><br>The only way Pearce would budge over Richards is if he can be tempted by the return of Wright- Phillips plus about Â£8m.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Pearce and his boss could be playing a game of "Good cop &amp; Bad cop"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So the club can get more money out of this deal... Should chelsea come knocking, the city boss can say unless your price is... i can't convince our manager to let him go kind of stuff... and at the end, they both will be laughing all the way to the bank again after the swp case...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why don't they just get Ben Haim on the cheap? he is only 24 yrs old and he is a more experience defender than Micah and he will only cost them Â£3million cos his contract at Bolton expire in June ... I really don't understand how come one defender cost $18 and another $3 when they are about the same in quality...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
