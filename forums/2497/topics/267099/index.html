            <div class='col-md body'><strong>New Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster has confirmed his admiration for Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas.</strong><br><br>The young Spaniard has been heavily linked with a move to Real, despite recently stating he is happy to stay with the Gunners.<br><br>Real sporting director Predrag Mijatovic revealed over the weekend that the Primera Liga champions are still interested in signing the 20-year-old.<br><br>And Schuster, appointed as Real coach on Monday, has acknowledged that Fabregas would be the type of player capable of improving his new team.<br><br>"I like Cesc Fabregas, he plays in the same position as I did in my playing career," said Schuster at a press conference.<br><br>"He has improved a lot in England, and learnt a lot from Arsene Wenger, a coach who I admire and who has done over the years a very good job with young players.<br><br>"I believe he is one of the few players in his position that can carry a team on his back, and when I say teams, I mean quality teams."<br><br>Meanwhile, Schuster paid tribute to his predecessor Fabio Capello, who was sacked despite delivering a first title in four years.<br><br>The German, who has signed a three-year contract, added: "He achieved something very important by winning the league title last season.<br><br>"If you don't win trophies it creates a lot of tension and so the fact that the club has won the league title has taken a weight off my shoulders. It will make my job that much easier.<br><br>"We all knew how hard it was to take over the team last season. In the end he achieved a lot in terms of improving team spirit. That's what helped the side win the league title and I'm going to make the most of that spirit.<br><br>"It would have been a lot harder for me if the team had not won the title. There would have been more nerves and more pressure."</div>
