              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Liverpool look set to sign Gareth Barry after all
              as Aston Villa have agreed to give them until the end of August to
              finally wrap up the deal.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Villa had hoped the Barry saga was over on
              Wednesday when Liverpool missed an agreed deadline to make an
              acceptable offer for the England midfielder.</p>
              <p>But after a further meeting with the player and his agent,
              Martin O'Neill has reluctantly accepted that Barry's proposed switch to
              Anfield could now go ahead.</p>
              <p>O'Neill said: "We had a meeting last Monday with Gareth and his
              agent at which we all agreed we would have a 5pm deadline on Wednesday
              and if Liverpool had not proved they had the wherewithal to proceed
              with the transfer then we would all leave that aside and go on with it.</p>
              <p>"I was hoping that would be the case and this was not a matter
              of Liverpool missing a deadline by 15 minutes, as seems to have been
              reported.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool first showed their interest in signing Gareth Barry
              almost four months ago, so this is not a case of missing the deadline
              by 15 minutes - that's simply not true.</p>
              <p>"The following morning we were upbeat on the strength of what
              had happened on Wednesday evening. We were very buoyant and optimistic
              that everything could come back to normal again.</p>
              <p>"That wasn't to be though. On Thursday there was a meeting between Gareth's agent, myself and the player.</p>
              <p>"They still felt that even though the deadline had passed they still felt Liverpool were going to come in and do the deal.</p>
              <p>"Obviously I was disappointed to hear that. Gareth's head is a
              bit all over the place at the moment and they asked for some more
              time."</p>
              <p>He continued: "I listened to what they've said and I'll go with it - reluctantly but I'll go with it.</p>
              <p>"There will be no deadline and Liverpool have all the time in
              the world now to sign Gareth Barry. They've got up to the normal
              window, which is the 31st of this month."</p>
              <p>Barry, 27, had made it clear at the end of last season that he
              wanted to make the switch to Anfield to experience playing Champions
              League football and link up with his close friend Steven Gerrard, who
              was "desperate" for the move to materialise.</p>
              <p>The player was subsequently booed by a section of the Villa
              support in their pre-season friendly at Walsall but received a standing
              ovation in their Intertoto Cup match against Odense.</p>
              <p>O'Neill had hoped on Wednesday that after Liverpool failed to
              meet the deadline that the issue was "closed" but it appears Barry's
              camp have forced his hand.</p>
              <p>The Villa manager has accepted that he does not want a player
              at the club whose heart is elsewhere and has decided to let the saga
              come to a conclusion by allowing the transfer to proceed.</p>
              <p>"I have a football club to run and I really do want people who want to play for us," O'Neill told Villa's official website.</p>
              <p>"Really it is up to them, Gareth and his agent to sort it out. I've decided this is the only way forward for us really.</p>
              <p>"If Liverpool at their end of it all do not come up with the money, that's no-one else's fault but their own.</p>
              <p>"I'd be delighted if that was the case and Gareth stayed. But I
              would doubt that very much. The ball is very much in their court."</p>
              <p>O'Neill made it clear he was not intending to drop the price to
              speed up the deal, especially as Liverpool had managed to rustle up
              Â£18million to buy Robbie Keane from Spurs.</p>
              <p>He said: "It seems they can find money for another player who
              wasn't in the equation certainly four months ago and certainly two
              months ago."</p>
              <p>Barry refused to comment after spending all 90 minutes of Villa's 1-1 friendly draw at Reading on the bench.</p>
              <p>He said: "I have been told not to say anything."</p>
