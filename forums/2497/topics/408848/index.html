              <h1>Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish was promised £40m for new players...but will he ever see the money?</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Birmingham City are the latest Premier League club to reveal 
              potentially worrying financial problems as a report admits 'significant 
              doubt' over the viability of the club's holding company just eight 
              months after the much-vaunted takeover by Hong Kong businessman Carson 
              Yeung.</p>
              <p>Yeung claimed that manager Alex McLeish would have 
              £40million in each transfer window to spend on new players when he took 
              over the club last October.</p>
              <p>But the businessman has now been 
              asked to give a written assurance to the Premier League that he will 
              keep the club afloat this season with his own funds after an interim 
              financial report from the board for the period April 1, 2009 to March 
              31, 2010 revealed that the liabilities of the parent company, Birmingham
               International Holdings, exceeded the assets by £31.9m. </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/21/article-0-0ADEC4AF000005DC-417_468x286.jpg" alt="Alex McLeish" width="468" height="286"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><em>Sold short: Alex McLeish is still waiting to see the colour of Carson Yeung's money</em></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><br></div>
              <p>Yeung has become a high-profile figure in the Premier League with his
               bold promises of major investment in the team. But, so far, the club 
              have signed Ben Foster and Nikola Zigic for undisclosed fees, brought in
               Matt Derbyshire on loan and Enric Valles on a free transfer this summer
               and signed Michel for £3m last January.</p>
              <p>The Premier League 
              are aware of the potential shortfall highlighted by the interim report 
              and, under new rules designed to avoid another Portsmouth debacle, they 
              asked Yeung for a written guarantee that he will keep funding the club 
              throughout the season.</p>
              <p>The interim report says that the 
              'situation indicates the existence of a material uncertainty that may 
              cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going 
              concern and therefore the Group may not be able to realise its assets 
              and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business'. But the
               report adds that discussions with banks over the company's loans and 
              the continued support of Yeung mean that the company is considered to be
               sound.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/21/article-0-0ADEC6E1000005DC-957_306x364.jpg" alt="Yeung " width="306" height="364"></div>
              <div class="floatRHS"><em>Front man: Despite 
              the doubts over his financial position, Yeung was happy to parade 
              himself in front of Birmingham supporters before the opening home match 
              of the season</em></div>
              <div class="floatRHS"><br></div>
              <p>A spokeswoman for Birmingham City said: 'We cannot comment as the 
              club is only a subsidiary of Birmingham International Holdings but it 
              would be wrong to suggest the club is in financial trouble.' Birmingham 
              International Holdings could not be contacted for comment.</p>
              <p>The
               warning in Birmingham's interim report comes in the wake of Liverpool's
               accountants being forced to issue a similar statement last year, the 
              descent of Portsmouth into administration at the end of last season and 
              the financial meltdown of West Ham United under their Icelandic owners, 
              averted only by the purchase of a stake in the club by David Gold and 
              David Sullivan, ironically using money earned by selling Birmingham to 
              Yeung.</p>
              <p>Yeung has promised the parent company's board that he will
               not demand repayment of an interest-free £7.06m loan, a guarantee that 
              has satisfied his fellow directors that the company and club are not in 
              immediate danger.When Yeung took over at City in October, he said: 'The 
              £40m in the January transfer window is my commitment to the fans.</p>
              <p>'We
               have made that decision to spend the money to buy the players. The 
              money is in place and available. The priority for now is staying in the 
              Premier League. Next season we put [sic] more than £40m into the team, 
              making it much stronger.'</p>
              <p>Birmingham have also revealed that 
              the ongoing row between the taxman and leading clubs over their players'
               image-rights deals, which HM Revenue and Customs regard as an income 
              tax dodge, could cost City more than £5m. </p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/21/article-0-0AD8D511000005DC-198_468x286.jpg" alt="Matt Derbyshire" width="468" height="286"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><em>Temporary deal: McLeish signed Matt Derbyshire on loan this week</em></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><br></div>
              <p>The row is part of the taxman's war with football clubs, who, they 
              claim, have used image-rights deals, often paid to offshore companies or
               in the UK at a lower rate of tax, to disguise what is, in reality, part
               of the players' basic salaries. Manchester United have admitted that 
              HMRC are demanding £5.3m in tax owing to the club's use of image rights,
               while Portsmouth are being pursued for £13m. Rangers became the first 
              Scottish club to confirm that they were also subject to an investigation
               by HMRC regarding £5m of image rights earlier this year.</p>
              <p>All
               the clubs claim that image rights are legitimate and contest HMRC's 
              interpretation of the law. Final judgement on the matter will be made 
              later this year. But based on Birmingham, United and Portsmouth's 
              potential liabilities, Premier League clubs could face a collective bill
               of £100m.</p>
              <p>Birmingham also face a battle with the taxman over
               VAT they claimed back from agents and have set aside an additional 
              £1.07m to cover themselves if the case goes against them.</p>
