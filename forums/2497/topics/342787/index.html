              <h1>Chelsea’s first eleven of wasted talent</h1>
              <h2>Since the arrival of Roman Abramovich in 2003 Chelsea have been able to attract some of the world’s top playing talent, though not every transfer to Stamford Bridge has worked out. As Wayne Bridge prepares to join Manchester City, Telegraph Sport identifies an entire team whose talents were wasted or under-used in West London.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01215/carlo-cudicini-ret_1215154c.jpg" alt="Safe pair of hands: Carlo Cudicini has been happy to play second fiddle to Petr Cech at Chelsea" width="460" height="288"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Safe pair of hands: Carlo Cudicini has been happy to play second fiddle to Petr Cech at Chelsea</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Carlo Cudicini</strong><br>Chelsea career: 1999-present day<br>Signed: Castel Di Sangro, £160,000<br>League starts: 138</p>
              <p>Cudicini’s arrival at Chelsea came before anyone had even heard of Roman Abramovich but nonetheless he is symbol of Chelsea’s early policy of stockpiling talent and the detrimental affect on the careers of a number of players at the club in recent years. The Italian could walk in to most Premier League sides but instead has been Petr Cech’s understudy and a Carling Cup specialist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wayne Bridge</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2003-present day<br>Signed: Southampton, £7 million<br>League starts: 74</p>
              <p>When Bridge was signed from Southampton he became immediately a first-team regular at Stamford Bridge with a bright future at domestic and international level ahead of him. A series of injuries and the arrival of Ashley Cole, however, relegated him to understudy status for club and country and despite interest from a host of clubs he settled in to that role comfortably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Asier del Horno</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2005-2006<br>Signed: Athletic Bilbao, £8 million<br>Sold: Valencia, £4.8 million<br>League starts: 25</p>
              <p>The uncompromising Spaniard was part of Chelsea’s 2005-06 title-winning squad but his agricultural style often gave the impression of a player out of his depth. Best remembered for a dangerous challenge on Barcelona's Lionel Messi after the Argentine had twisted his blood in a last 16 Champions League first leg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Tal Ben Haim</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2007-2008<br>Signed: Bolton Wanderers, Free<br>Sold: Manchester City, £5 million<br>League starts: 10</p>
              <p>Brought in as defensive cover for John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho, the Israeli found the irresistible force of that partnership an immovable pair of objects. Just 10 league starts in a season tells its own story and Ben Haim moved on to Manchester City in search of first team football, though with City set to spend in January it looks like history may well repeat itself at Eastlands for Ben Haim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Khalid Boulahrouz</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2006-2008<br>Signed: Hamburg SV, £8.5 million<br>Sold: VfB Stuttgart, £4 million<br>League starts: 10</p>
              <p>In one sense a victim of his own versatility, Boulahrouz was brought into a small squad as cover across the entire back line by Jose Mourinho and, despite early promise, injury and ill-discipline restricted the number of first team appearances for a man nicknamed ‘Khalid the Cannibal’.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Shaun Wright-Phillips</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2005-2008<br>Signed: Manchester City, £21 million<br>Sold: Manchester City, £9 million<br>League starts: 43</p>
              <p>Wright-Phillips’ time at Chelsea cannot be characterised as a complete failure but he never truly managed to hold down a regular starting place and rarely showed the same bravura that made him a star at City and prompted a £21 million transfer. That he managed to survive his Chelsea experience with his reputation and enthusiasm intact – unlike, say, Damian Duff – speaks well of the diminutive winger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Scott Parker</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2004-2005<br>Signed: Charlton Athletic, £10 million<br>Sold: Newcastle United, £6.5 million<br>League starts: 8</p>
              <p>Charlton were fourth in the table when Parker was unable to turn down his "dream move” that became if not a nightmare then a waste of time and talent. Alan Curbishley voiced his displeasure at the time and though Charlton were rewarded financially the disruption to their season was great. Parker’s moved smacked of Chelsea cherry-picking for the sake of it, a view given credence by the limited time he found on the pitch at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Steve Sidwell</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2007-2008<br>Signed: Reading, Free<br>Sold: Aston Villa, £5 million<br>League starts: 7</p>
              <p>Two years on and Sidwell went down the same path as Parker. Seduced by the wages and possible medals on offer at Chelsea, the heartbeat of Reading’s midfield in their remarkably successful first season in the top flight went from being a big fish in a small pond to an incidental bottom feeder. At Reading, and now Villa, Sidwell married steel and bright passing - when called on at Chelsea it was in the role of hatchet man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Juan Sebastian Veron</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2003-2006<br>Signed: Manchester United, £15 million<br>Sold: Estudiantes, Free<br>League starts: 5</p>
              <p>Not content with tarnishing his reputation with one English club, Veron managed the double. After failure at Manchester United, Chelsea offered him redemption but he delivered more of the same. Seen as a Champions League specialist and uncomfortable in the hurly-burly of the Premier League, he never found a rhythm and was unable to stamp his passing creativity on a team in which he featured infrequently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Mateja Kezman</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2004-2005<br>Signed: PSV Eindhoven, £5 million<br>Sold: Atletico Madrid, £5.3 million<br>League starts: 6</p>
              <p>The walking proof that goals in the Dutch League are not always the most reliable guide that a player will succeed in England. Kezman scored 105 league goals in 125 appearances for PSV Eindhoven, averaging better than a goal a game in consecutive seasons, but inexplicably struggled to adapt to life in the Premier League. He did manage to score the winner in the 2005 Carling Cup final against Liverpool but 14 league starts betrays how quickly Mourinho lost confidence in him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Claudio Pizzaro</strong><br>Chelsea career: 2007-present day<br>Signed: Bayern Munich, Free<br>Sold: Currently on loan at Werder Bremen<br>League starts: 4</p>
              <p>Still technically a Chelsea player, Pizarro was further proof that Mourinho, for all his merits and with the exception of Didier Drogba, had trouble identifying goalscorers. The Peruvian scored on his debut but after the departure of the Portuguese coach and the January signing of Nicolas Anelka, he was deemed surplus to requirements and loaned out to Werder Bremen, where he had made his name at the start of the decade, having found the net just once more.</p>

              <p>Or we should say he has wasted his time at Chelsea... Cos since the time he arrived, he was just a 26 yrs old but now he is already 35 and still playing 2nd choice... Wasted almost 10 yrs of his playing career...</p>
