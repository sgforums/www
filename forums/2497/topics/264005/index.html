The board seem to believe that the two were scapegoated for Madrid's, and in fact Capello's failures.<br><br>Also, contrary to Capello's claims yesterday, he will receive compensation for only one of his remaining two years.<br><br>The meeting will also decide on how much time Bernd Schuster will be allowed to find his way out of Getafe. It is understood that he will hasten his exit the moment Capello is sacked, but Madrid do not want to wait for long.</div>
