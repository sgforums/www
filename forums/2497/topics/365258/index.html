              <h1>Xabi Alonso sacrificed to Real Madrid as £17m Glen Johnson arrival kickstarts Kop rebuild <br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/06/22/article-0-00C6C2A800000578-608_468x427.jpg" alt="Xabi Alonso" width="468" height="427"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Sacrificed: Xabi Alonso is set to join Real Madrid in a £30m deal to part-fund Liverpool's £17m signing of Portsmouth and England defender Glen Johnson</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid have made a renewed bid for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> midfielder Xabi Alonso and expect to sign him in a £30million deal. The move comes just hours after Liverpool agreed a £17m deal for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/portsmouth.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Portsmouth</strong></span></a><strong> full-back Glen Johnson ahead of competition from </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong>. And that will signal the £8million departure of Alvaro Arbeloa to Real Madrid too.</strong></p>
              <p>Real's pursuit of Alonso has been dogged. They made an approach for the Spain midfielder last month and tabled a £20m offer but Liverpool were reluctant to sell.</p>
              <p>Yet, despite his new Galacticos era, Florentino Perez has been put under pressure by fans to bring in Spanish players and Alonso and Arbeloa will go a long way to appease them.</p>
              <p>Chelsea had also inquired about the 27-year-old Alonso but Rafa Benitez did not want to sell to his Premier League rivals. Alonso has made it clear he was not entirely happy working with Benitez and a move to Madrid will suit both parties.</p>
              <p>Benitez will now concentrate on trying to keep Javier Mascherano, despite Barcelona's interest, and will use the funds from Alonso's transfer to continue re-building his team.</p>
              <p>The signing of Johnson, as exclusively revealed by <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><span style="color: #003580;">Sportsmail</span></span>, will help persuade new recruits that Liverpool still mean business. </p>
              <p>Liverpool, who have also made a £2m offer for Portsmouth defender Sylvain Distin, have also recruited two promising 16-year-olds - Aaron King a striker from Blue Square Premier club Rushden &amp; Diamonds and midfielder Jesus Fernandez Saez, known as Suso, from Cadiz. Suso was also a target for Barcelona and Real Madrid.</p>

              <p>I am an arsenal fan and I must say that liverpool played very well last season. Alonso was outstanding throughout thewhole season. I still remember him causing cesc fabregas to be sidelined for months.</p>
              <p>Now Benitez is going to sell their best player of the season to real madrid? This is indeed crazy. If liverpool has no money then dont buy so expensive players. Now no money must sell players and sell their best player.</p>
              <p>Without alonso, Gerrard and Torres can never be as formidable as what they were last season. And with the possiblity that mascherano is leaving for barcelona, liverpool is really going from bad to worst. It took them so many years to reach 2nd place and now benitez is trying to destroy that.</p>
              <p>I must say that selling alonso does not show other players that you are serious in fighting for the EPL title next season.</p>
              <p>And this sentence "The signing of Johnson, as exclusively revealed by <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: #003580;">Sportsmail</span></span>, will help persuade new recruits that Liverpool still mean business" is totally rubbish. Who the hell is johnson? Is he just a one season wonder. Does he really command 17 million pounds? I dont think so. Benitez sucks at buying fullbacks, and I think that johnson would just be another one that sucks. And also making an offer of 2 million for Sylvain Distin, is not gonna attract other top stars to liverpool. Who the hell is sylvain distin?</p>
              <p>I reckon that liverpool would not do as well as this season, especially if alonso is sold.</p>

              <p>no screw up , just speculations about Xabi Alonso .... Speculations .</p>
              <p>Arbeloa i dunno , most probably he will go if price is right .</p>
              <p>I would say @ £8 for Arbeloa , definitely , clear profit .</p>
