The reason why it relates to the clones is obvious, fans carrying it too far. I never said you or the clonemaster are exactly like the Valencia fans, just that the clonemaster would be first thought. You come into the picture because you're always part of the ever ongoing conflict here in sgforums. So you are in mind next after the clonemaster.<br><br>If it distress you that much to see your name being mentioned, I can edit my post if you want. But you would want to edit yours too.</div>

I'm chilled, thank you very much. I did not make that post in a moment of anger or something like that. Still, thanks for the suggestion.<br><br>You can have your own opinion of me, as Ghimpheng or some other people do. Personally, if ghimpheng makes a post and links it to me, it's his choice. I may reply but I don't think I'd be angry about it.<br><br>Quite honestly, if I were Ghimpheng, there's a lot of his things that I wouldn't have posted. And his reputation comes because of things he posted, no matter how much he blames other people for their responses to him. I hadn't planned on going so long about him in this thread, but since we're at it, this suggestion to put yourself in other people's shoes shouldn't apply to just one individual. It should also apply to those who make certain threads about Frank Lamapard,  to clonemasters who go on and on about other people's clubs, to people who keep trying to stir up conflict between Man U fans and Liverpool fans.<br><br>Since you have taken your chance to make a statement, I have made mine as well. It is not directed at you, but I stand by what I've just said.<br><br>One thing I can say is the reasons you think may be behind the post of others may not really be. Be it me or somebody else.<br><br>My first post in this thread was just a casual remark, but if you really want to view it as something sinister, then I suggest you go back to some of the other posts as well. Like ghimpheng's continual rant about the Liverpool-related post in the Man U forum. To the extent of using specific pictures and links. Quite clear there what his intention is. If you really want to speak out against what you've mentioned, then that would be a more effective place to start and not with me. Even not counting that, there's a lot more areas you could start with, my post like that would not be the first.<br><br>There's a lot of other posts/comments that really add to the tension instead of my casual remark.<br><br>Again let me just offer the same thing, I can edit my initial post, but it'd be pointless if my initial post is still quoted in the posts of others. I do not agree with your sentiments regarding my first post, but I am really to reach a comprimise on this.</div>
