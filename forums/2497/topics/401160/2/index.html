              <p>walcott should leave arsenal for first team football.  he is not playing enough.  hence he is not improving at all.</p>

              <p class="ms-text-bold"><strong>Theo Walcott is said to be in a state of 
              shock after being informed of his omission from England's World Cup 
              squad.</strong></p>
              <p>Walcott was by far the most surprising exclusion from Fabio 
              Capello's 23-man party, who fly out to South Africa on Wednesday 
              evening, and the man himself seems to have been one of the most shocked.</p>
              <p>The
               Arsenal winger was reportedly on the golf course when Capello called to
               tell him the bad news, and The Daily Express reports that he was so 
              surprised, he initially thought the call was a hoax.</p>
              <p>Most morning 
              papers agree that Capello had doubts about Walcott's place after subdued
               performances in training, but was given chances to impress in both 
              warm-up games against Mexico and Japan.</p>
              <p>The former seems to have 
              played a crucial role in Capello's decision, with the Italian reportedly
               annoyed that Walcott didn't follow his instructions at Wembley.</p>
              <p>The
               Guardian reports that 'frustration has been welling within the 
              management set-up at a perceived lack of discipline on the pitch in 
              recent England games, with Walcott singled out for particular criticism 
              in Capello's post-match analysis of the Mexico game last week.</p>
              <p>'The
               player, it is understood, had strayed too often from a position on the 
              by-line, veering from the Italian's instructions, with his delivery 
              erratic from the wing.'</p>
              <p>Other papers claim that Walcott was given a
               dressing down in front of the rest of the squad for his perceived 
              indiscipline against Mexico. Despite this, he was given another chance, 
              which he failed to take.</p>
              <p>Publically at least, Walcott reacted with
               great dignity.</p>
              <p>In a statement released as the squad was 
              officially announced, Walcott said: "I am very disappointed not to be 
              included in the squad going out to South Africa, but completely respect 
              Mr Capello's decision.</p>
              <p>"I would like to wish the team the best of 
              luck and hope they have a really successful tournament."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>ya wasted giving it to SWP. probably SWP gotten in is due to his experience, age and he can play on the left flank, another option for capello to explore. walcott, although known for his pace and speed, is rather a one dimensional player on the right flank. his crosses also arent good. so the right flank now belongs to aaron lennon I suppose, with SWP as back-up. Joe Cole can also play on both flanks.</p></div>
