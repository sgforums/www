              <h1>Gunners 'must brace for takeover'</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/45484000/jpg/_45484862_usmanov.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="170"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal must prepare itself for a takeover bid from Russian
              billionaire Alisher Usmanov, according to football consultant Alex Fynn.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fynn has advised several Premier League clubs including Arsenal.</p>
              <p>He told BBC London 94.9: "If you're an Arsenal fan you should be
              concerned, but you should be more concerned if (director) Danny Fiszman
              waivers.</p>
              <p>"He's been the rock around which the new stadium was built and if he waivers then there's a problem."
              </p>
              <p>Fynn continued: "He's the man who has only a slightly less share than Mr Usmanov - he has about 24%.</p>
              <p>"If he stays firm then I think then it would be a problem for
              anybody else to run a hostile bid, not withstanding the fact that the
              board now have a minority of the shares."</p>
              <p>Red and White Holdings, of which Usmanov is a co-owner, increased its stake in Arsenal to 25% on Monday.</p>
              <p>A formal takeover bid could be launched by Usmanov if the group's stake was to reach 30%.</p>
              <p>Fynn said: "It's significant because it make him (Usmanov) the largest shareholder.</p>
              <p>"The other reading is that Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith left the board in December and her 16% holding is in the balance.</p>
              <p>"She is therefore freed from the lockdown agreement, which meant that no director can sell their holding before April.</p>
              <p>"Then they must give a first option to one another before they
              can sell anything, so Arsenal are in a state of flux at the moment.</p>
              <p>"It's a dangerous situation when you own less than 40% of the
              company and that is the situation since Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith left
              the board. Arsenal are in a very vulnerable state.</p>
              <p>"If any determined predator wishes to throw money, and they'd have
              to throw an awful lot of money, then they could take over the company."</p>
              <p>Fynn, who is also author of the book Arsenal: The Making of a Modern Superclub, says he would be opposed to a takeover.</p>
              <p>He said: "Its a bad thing because the current board are custodians of the club, they've always run the club (without) any ego.</p>
              <p>"They're most unusual, they're the old-style partition
              directors, they believe they've been fortunate to inherit their stake
              on the board and as such they regard themselves not as owners but as
              custodians.</p>
              <p>"They have masterminded the move from Highbury and if you take
              into account their property turnover, the group turnover is way over
              £200m and it is the third largest football enterprise in the world.</p>
              <p>"It's much higher than the recent Deloitte rich-list has shown simply because they have done so well in property.</p>
              <p>"They have a billionaire who's come in, Stan Kroenke is on the
              board. Moreover he is not a hostile newcomer to the board and he has
              the sort of experience that Arsenal were lacking before his arrival.</p>
              <p>"When you add the new chief executive Ivan Kazidis, who has
              exactly the right experience in marketing terms that they've also been
              missing for a long time, then the Arsenal board is much stronger in
              terms of personality, experience and loyalty than it has been for a
              long time.</p>
              <p>"The great danger though is they own less than 50% of the club now."
