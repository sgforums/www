              <div class="content">
              <p>Slovenia players have accused <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> striker Wayne Rooney of diving in England's 2-1 friendly win last night.</p>
              <p>Slovenia captain Robert Koren believes the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> star made a meal of a tussle for possession with defender Bostjan Cesar and earned England a penalty with a dive.</p>
              <p>Koren, who earns his keep with West Brom, said: “This week there has been a lot of talk about diving, about Arsenal’s Eduardo.</p>
              <p>“Today I think Rooney went down a bit too easy and let’s see if someone will say something against him.</p>
              <p>“My personal opinion is the referee was under a little bit of pressure
              because of the crowd and the England team. That penalty was a bit too
              easy.”</p>
              <p>Cesar damaged his ankle in his clash with Rooney as the England talisman hit the deck.</p>
              <p>The centre-back will now miss their vital World Cup qualifier against Poland on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Slovenia keeper Samir Handanovic said: “It was no penalty. Both players were fighting for the ball.</p>
              <p>“In the end Rooney literally fell into Cesar and I think it was a clear foul against our player.</p>
              <p>“Maybe Rooney should have been yellow-carded.”</p>

              <p>well, while reading this article, I do believe Media seems to paint the English Players in a different light apart from the many imports into the EPL.</p>
              <p>And I do believe english players are just as guilty as the counterparts in this dept.</p>
              <p>I don't believe a manager will ask the players to go dive and get a penalty to get a win, but the players react at the mini-seconds when they anticipate they will get a tug/touch/tackle and they will go down. Whether there are any subconscious thoughts of previous injuries, this is subjective.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I do believe for Rooney, he tries to play the game as honest as he can.</p>
