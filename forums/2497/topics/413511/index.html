              <p>The Tottenham chief - who celebrates two years in charge on Monday - led the North Londoners to fourth last term.</p>
              <p>But he reckons Spurs could do even better if chairman Daniel Levy gives him the cash to buy a top-drawer centre-half and a striker.</p>
              <p>He said: "We may be one or two big signings away from being a team that could win the title. One or two players in the right positions - and I'm talking about top, top players.</p>
              <p>"If we could do that I think Tottenham are a team that could win the championship in a couple of years.</p>
              <p>"This squad is just so full of talent, anyway. Daniel has done a great job backing my judgment and improving the squad that I really believe we're not far away from that level."</p>
              <p>Redknapp revealed Spurs had wanted him four years ago when Martin Jol was sacked.</p>
              <p>But he said: "I didn't want to leave Portsmouth for anywhere at that time. But I've no regrets, I stayed and won the FA Cup."</p>

              <p>This Bale is a very good player man... He can play in a left-back position, do well as a left winger, and now looking at his finish, hell the guy can even play as a striker now man... lol.</p>
              <p>And for a moment last night, I guess Rafa was sweating like a pig... From up 4-0 to 4-3 against 10 men and less first choice keeper... lol.</p>

              <p><strong>Gareth Bale may have claimed the match ball with his hat-trick for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Tottenham </strong></span></a><strong>but his side's 4-3 Champions League defeat to Inter made his treble somewhat pointless.</strong></p>
              <p>The attacking left-sided defender/midfielder /striker/Welshman almost rescued an unlikely draw for the Londoners following a first-half that will sell well on DVD at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>But it all counted for nothing. Bale's heroics simply clawed back goal difference which may help especially as Twente and Werder Bremen only managed a draw to leave Spurs still in with a great chance of qualifying for the knockout stages.</p>
              <p>The 21-year-old, however, has joined an elite club - players to score hat-tricks and end up on the losing side.</p>
              <p>It may be a regular thing in non-league football but it's rare in the pro game ... but Sportsmail discovered it's not as rare as you might think.</p>

              <h2>Denis Law (Manchester United v Leicester April 1963)</h2>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/21/article-1322451-01D0521C00000578-486_306x423.jpg" alt="Double loser: Denis Law of United and City" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Double loser: Denis Law of United and City</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Back in the days when men were men and black and white football was played on mud, </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> finished 19th in the top flight, missing relegation by just two places.</strong></p>
              <p>Even Matt Busby's stars could have an off season as this one proved and Denis Law's hat-trick for United at Filbert Street - 24 hours after the sides had drawn 2-2 at Old Trafford - was in vain as Leicester won 4-3.</p>
              <p>Law also scored six times for <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City </span></a>in an FA Cup tie at Luton in 1961 but the game was called off with his side 6-2 up with 20 minutes to go because of heavy rain. Law also scored when the teams met again but City lost 3-1 so the Scot can claim to have scored seven goals in a tie and still ended up on the losing side.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Roque Santa Cruz (Blackburn v Wigan December  2007)</h2>
              <p>The match of two hat-tricks. Marcus Bent's for the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wigan-athletic.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Latics </span></a>meant three Premier League points but Roque Santa Cruz's meant his only claim to fame is making this list.</p>
              <p>To make matters worse for <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/blackburn-rovers.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Rovers</span></a>, Santa Cruz drew his side level after they had trailed 3-0 and then had a player sent off.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/21/article-1322451-027FBF53000004B0-119_468x399.jpg" alt="On target: But Santa Cruz's hat-trick counted for nothing" width="468" height="399">

              </div>
              <p>To make matters even worse for Santa Cruz he attracted the attention of Manchester City where he now spends his days remembering this match with fondness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Ferenc Puskas (Real Madrid v Benfica May 1962)</h2>
              <p>A European Cup final packed with goals and a vain three-strike from one of the game's true greats. Puskas, the 'little fat man' who had helped destroy England nine years earlier at Wembley,  could not inspire Real to the ultimate club prize in Amsterdam  on this occasion though.</p>
              <p>He was outflanked by a certain Eusebio who netted twice for Benfica.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Milinko Pantic (Atletico Madrid v Barcelona 1997)</h2>
              <p>In the Spanish Cup semi-finals, Atletico Madrid were not so delighted with their 2-2 first leg home draw .</p>
              <p>But when they stormed into a 3-0 first-half lead in the return leg at the Nou Camp, a place in the final was as good as theirs...at least that's what Milinko Pantic thought until a certain Brazilian Ronaldo (yes him again) and manager Bobby Robson started to weave their magic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Christian Vieri (Atletico Madrid v Salamanca 1998)</h2>
              <p>Italy hit-man Christian Vieri netted 24 goals in 24 games for Atletico but was an unhappy man after this La Liga defeat to Salamanca.</p>
              <p>He scored all four goals in a 5-4 defeat...</p>
              <p>In fact, so furious was the great man that he allegedly changed in the corridor, refused to speak to his team-mates and left on his own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>Kerry Dixon (Reading v Doncaster 1982)</h2>
              <p>Big Kerry Dixon was on his way to bigger and better things with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea </span></a>and England but he made his name as a goal machine with the Royals. However, the coach trip back to Berkshire would have been a quiet one - even with Dixon having netted four times - after a stunning 7-5 defeat at Belle Vue.</p>

              <p>This Bale is a very good player man... He can play in a left-back position, do well as a left winger, and now looking at his finish, hell the guy can even play as a striker now man... lol.</p>
