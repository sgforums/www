              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Serie A giants Juventus have decided to dismiss coach Ciro Ferrara after the Bianconeri stumbled to their third straight league defeat last night.<br><br>The revelation comes from Turin-based daily<em> La Stampa</em>, which is managed by a holding company of the Fiat Group whose president is Juve patron John Elkann.<br><br>The
              newspaper claims that Ferrara is on borrowed time after last night’s
              2-1 reverse at the hands of Roma and the club directors will hand him
              the pink slip in the next 48 hours.<br><br>Juve president Jean-Claude
              Blanc is reportedly still hoping to grant Ferrara yet another stay of
              execution, but the owners appear to have made up their mind.<br><br>It is only a matter of picking Ferrara’s successor, and Russia boss Guus Hiddink remains in pole position to take over the Stadio Olimpico hot seat.<br><br>Hiddink
              was approached by the Old Lady two weeks ago and allegedly demanded
              wages of €3.5 million to commit to the club for the next six months.<br><br>A decision is expected shortly as Juve will be back in action on Thursday when they face Inter in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia at San Siro.<br></span></p>

              <p><em>Italian job: Benitez is in the frame for the Juve job</em></p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1246061/Liverpool-boss-Rafa-Benitezs-agent-stirs-link-prospective-Juventus-job.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez's agent left the door open for an approach by Juventus.</strong></p>
              <p>Under-fire Juve coach Ciro Ferrera is on the verge of being sacked after a third straight defeat, and the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Liverpool</span></span></a> manager is the preferred choice to revive their flagging fortunes.</p>
              <p>Manuel Garcia Quilon, Benitez’s agent, refused to rule out a switch, saying: ‘Benitez to Juventus? In football, you never know. I do not know what will happen in four to five months. In football, everything changes quickly, but the basic principle is that Rafa still has a four-year contract with Liverpool.’</p>
              <p>Though Benitez has repeatedly expressed his loyalty to Liverpool, and particularly appreciates continued backing from fans, he could be tempted by a move to Serie A.</p>
              <p>He is a close friend of recently-appointed director Roberto Bettega, an influential figure in the Juventus boardroom, and sees the job as one of the biggest in Europe.</p>
              <p>Liverpool co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett recently voiced their support for Benitez but continue to deny him funds.</p>
              <p>Even Monday’s £310million sale of Hicks’s Texas Rangers baseball team failed to improve matters, with Benitez admitting he still had to sell before he could buy.</p>

              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Serie A giants Juventus have taken yet another decisive step towards dismissing coach Ciro Ferrara after tax attorney Michele Briamonte attended yesterday’s board meeting at Vinovo, according to <em>Sportmediaset.it.</em><br><br>Briamonte joined President Jean-Claude Blanc, vice director general Roberto Bettega and sporting director Alessio Secco.<br><br>And
              the former’s presence is said to be a definite signal that the Old Lady
              has decided to part company with Ferrara and are willing to have a
              clear picture of the Neapolitan’s contractual situation.<br><br>Juve have lost six of their last eight games and last weekend’s home defeat to Roma proved to be the final straw.<br><br>Ferrara
              is now expected to be shown the door later this week, presumably after
              the Coppa Italia quarter-final tie away to Inter and regardless of the
              outcome of that clash.<br><br>But the club’s powers that be have yet to
              agree on a successor. Gianluca Vialli, Dino Zoff and Giovanni
              Trapattoni have all reportedly rejected the opportunity to take over on
              a caretaker basis, while Russia boss Guus Hiddink is believed to be
              holding out for a lavish salary of €6 million for the next six months.  <br></span></p>

              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr> have put together a legal team to examine the prospect of prising <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> away from his <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> contract.</p>
              <p>The <em>Telegraph</em> says <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr> have instructed their lawyers to examine Benítez's <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> contract as the Italian side attempt to put together a package to tempt him to Serve A in the summer.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr>'s
              power brokers met the club's lawyers on Tuesday to assess the
              likelihood of Benítez being convinced to end his six-year reign at
              Anfield in the summer. The club had considered attempting to lure
              Benítez to Italy this month but believed the Spaniard would not
              contemplate leaving <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> in the middle of the season.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard earns £4.8 million a year before tax under the terms of his <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> contract, agreed until 2014 after protracted negotiations just 10 months ago. It is a salary <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr> would not be able to match, though more relaxed tax laws would allow
              the Italian side to offer Benítez a net salary of £2.5 million a year.</p>
              <p>The prospect of Benítez demanding his substantial coaching staff accompany him to Italy presents a further obstacle, though <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr> have been informed the Spaniard would only wish to bring three or four key lieutenants with him.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr> believe Benítez would be willing to appoint an Italian assistant
              manager, an important nod to the club's tradition and identified as a
              key negotiating point when <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Jose Mourinho</span></abbr> joined Inter in 2008.</p>

              <p><em>La Stampa</em> says Juve have settled on either Claudio Gentile or
              Alberto Zaccheroni as a firefighter to the end of the season before
              moving for Benitez in the summer.</p>
              <p>Zacc has moved ahead of Gentile in Juve's planning. Gentile
              held talks with directors yesterday, but they were unimpressed by his
              demands.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Juve president Jean-Claude Blanc will meet with
              Benitez's lawyers this morning. He hopes to convince Benitez about an
              immediate move to Turin, but is prepared to wait until the summer to
              land the Spaniard.</p>

              <div><br></div>
              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez remains a target for Juventus,
              who are prepared to offer the Spaniard a €3 million (£2.6m) annual
              salary in order to tempt him to Italy, according to a report from <em>The Independent</em>.<br><br>Benitez
              reportedly earns £4.6m a year gross at Anfield, but Juve apparently
              feel that they can use the Italian tax system to their advantage and
              pay the tax on Benitez's proposed salary themselves.<br><br>That would mean that the Spaniard's net earnings would be higher than they are at Liverpool.<br><br>One
              potential stumbling block to any deal reportedly remains the high
              number of  coaching staff Benitez might want to take with him to Juve.<br><br>However, the Serie A
              side are believed to have been assured that Benitez would only want to
              bring two of his sizeable Anfield staff with him in the shape of
              Mauricio Pellegrino and his goalkeeping coach Xavi Valero.<br><br>He would also apparently accept an Italian assistant manager, a matter of principle to the club.<br><br>Benitez's
              agent has not distanced his client from the speculation, which is
              viewed in some quarters as a means by which the Spaniard can reinforce
              his position at Anfield, where his future as Liverpool boss is likely
              to be reviewed in the summer. </span></p>
