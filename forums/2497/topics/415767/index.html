              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Goalkeeper Ben Foster returned from </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> duty an inspired man at St Andrew’s yesterday to darken the gloom unexpectedly settling over </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">. As darkness fell, and a swirling mist rolled across </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> had suddenly become a club who have lost their way.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">A second defeat in six days, and their third loss in four matches, has decimated the dominance Carlo Ancelotti’s team had on the Premier League. Only goal difference keeps them above Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">But this is a distortion of </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">’s state of health. It overlooks how comprehensively they overran </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and ignores the possibilities that on a more fair afternoon, they might have been celebrating a win that would have placed fear into the hearts of rivals.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Michael Essien will be back from suspension to reclaim control of the midfield one match from now; and in a fortnight Ancelotti will again have Frank Lampard. John Terry’s back injury sidelined him after he missed the defeat by </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sunderland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> at </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Stamford</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Bridge</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, but he is expected to be back sooner than first thought. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">‘We will watch </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">John day</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> by day, while Frank should be ready in two more weeks,’ said Ancelotti. ‘They are important players but, if you look at the performance, we didn’t miss them today.’ </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">’s only misfortune was to meet Foster playing with such conviction, composure and maturity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Birmingham</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> boss Alex McLeish, proud of not just his keeper but the work-rate of a team orchestrated by Barry Ferguson’s enthusiasm, said: ‘I’ve always stressed the importance of having a good goalkeeper. They can win you a championship but they can also help keep you in this division.’</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was not much wrong with </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">’s football or their spirit. But they came up against Foster, who showed no side-effects after being criticised for being beaten at his near post by Karim Benzema in </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">’s defeat by </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">France</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> in midweek.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Salomon Kalou should have capitalised on Foster’s secondminute indecision when he failed to gather the ball in his six-yard box but, once he had survived that indiscretion, he proved to be a colossus. An early five-pass move involving Branislav Ivanovic, Ashley Cole, Florent Malouda and Kalou set Didier Drogba clear but, as the striker opened his body to place his shot, Foster smartly dived to his left to brilliantly deny him.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/11/20/article-1331564-0C2931B4000005DC-267_634x445.jpg" alt="Ramires of Chelsea is tackled by Roger Johnson of Birmingham City " width="634" height="445"> </span>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">The importance of Foster’s work was enhanced when Birmingham went ahead. There was an unaccountable sloppiness about </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> when Sebastian Larsson delivered a cross from the right. Cameron Jerome won his aerial duel with Ivanovic and unmarked Lee Bowyer hooked the ball past Petr </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Czech.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Worse was to follow as Foster continued his master-class. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">A Nicolas Anelka cross was met with a powerful header by Drogba, but Foster deflected the ball around his near post. It was a save of exceptional quality. He then denied Drogba by diving to flick the striker’s 30-yard free-kick around the same post. And on the one occasion when Drogba got the better of Foster with another magnificent header, the crossbar denied him.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">McLeish’s team withdrew into a compact shape to shield their lead after the interval. Yet Foster’s day was not quite over. Kalou appeared to have wriggled past him but, without the ball under full control, he was dispossessed by the keeper. Usually, strikers win games. Not yesterday. That honour went to Foster.</span></p>
