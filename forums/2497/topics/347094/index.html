              <p>Â </p>
              <p><strong>LONDON - Brief reports of Premier League matches played on Saturday:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>BLACKBURN ROVERS 0 ASTON VILLA 2</strong></p>
              <p>James Milner put Villa on the
                                  road to a club record seventh successive away league victory with a
                                  tremendous angled shot after 27 minutes.</p>
              <p>Villa missed a host of chances
                                  to increase their lead and were nearly made to pay when Roque Santa
                                  Cruz swivelled late on and lashed a shot just past the post.</p>
              <p>Gabriel Agbonlahor sealed victory with a deflected near-post shot in the 90th minute.</p>
              <p><strong>CHELSEA 0 HULL CITY 0</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea's tally of dropped home points rose to 16 as their title hopes took another battering.</p>
              <p>Ricardo Quaresma made his debut after signing on loan from Inter Milan but was largely ineffective.</p>
              <p>Hull, without a league win for
                                  two months, were well worth a point and could have taken all three had
                                  Dean Marney converted a chance instead of shooting across the face of
                                  goal.</p>
              <p><strong>EVERTON 3 BOLTON WANDERERS 0</strong></p>
              <p>Brazilian Jo marked his debut
                                  in style, earning a penalty that Mikel Arteta converted to put Everton
                                  ahead and then scoring twice after the interval.</p>
              <p>Everton dominated from start to
                                  finish as they consolidated sixth place with Jo, signed from Manchester
                                  City last week, looking to have solved the club's problem of a lack of
                                  strikers.</p>
              <p>His first goal was a well-struck volley and his second a penalty in stoppage time.</p>
              <p><strong>MANCHESTER CITY 1 MIDDLESBROUGH 0</strong></p>
              <p>City eased further away from
                                  the wrong end of the table as Craig Bellamy showed again why manager
                                  Mark Hughes spent most of January trying to sign him.</p>
              <p>The impish Welsh striker cut in
                                  from the right after 52 minutes and planted a shot past keeper Brad
                                  Jones to register his second goal for the club.</p>
              <p>Shay Given played well in goal
                                  on his City debut, making three saves to deny Afonso Alves. Boro have
                                  now gone 13 matches without a win.</p>
              <p><strong>PORTSMOUTH 2 LIVERPOOL 3</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez
                                  started with strikers Fernando Torres and Dirk Kuyt on the bench but
                                  they both came on late in the game to spark a superb fightback that put
                                  their team back on top of the table.</p>
              <p>David Nugent shot Portsmouth in
                                  front just past the hour before Fabio Aurelio equalised following an
                                  indirect free kick in the box.</p>
              <p>Hermann Hreidarsson headed
                                  Pompey back in front and they seemed set for a priceless victory until
                                  Kuyt shot past David James from a tight angle after 85 minutes and
                                  Torres won it in stoppage time with a header from Yossi Benayoun's
                                  cross.</p>
              <p><strong>SUNDERLAND 2 STOKE CITY 0</strong></p>
              <p>Stoke remain just outside the
                                  relegation zone after losing and having Matthew Etherington sent off in
                                  the second half for a straight red card.</p>
              <p>Henri Camara was denied by the
                                  woodwork for Stoke just after Etherington's dismissal and Kenwyne Jones
                                  headed Sunderland in front with 12 minutes left. David Healy then
                                  scored the second.</p>
              <p><strong>WEST BROMWICH ALBION 2 NEWCASTLE UNITED 3</strong></p>
              <p>Newcastle won at bottom club
                                  West Brom despite manager Joe Kinnear being taken to hospital on the
                                  morning of the match after feeling unwell.</p>
              <p>Damien Duff put United ahead only for Marc-Antoine Fortune to level, both goals coming in the opening four minutes.</p>
              <p>New signing Peter Lovenkrands
                                  made it 2-1 and Steven Taylor added a third before halftime. Fortune
                                  struck again with 17 minutes to go but Newcastle hung on.</p>
              <p><strong>WIGAN ATHLETIC 0 FULHAM 0</strong></p>
              <p>Egyptian striker Mido wasted the best chance for Wigan when he headed off target from an inviting position.</p>
              <p>Bobby Zamora was also wasteful for Fulham as the game petered out to a dull draw between two mid-table sides.</p>
