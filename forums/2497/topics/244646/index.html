            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Roy Keane has spoken of his admiration for Cristiano Ronaldo and admits he would pay to watch him play.<br><br>The Manchester United winger has been dubbed 'the best in the world' by numerous pundits, and his former captain feels that statement is deserved.<br><br>Sunderland chief Keane told the Sunday Mirror: "I think Ronaldo is outstanding.<br><br>"If you had asked me two or three years ago I would have told you he could go on to be the best player in the world.<br><br>"I thought that would happen after he had been playing over a longer period of time, but his form this season has been a different class.<br><br>"The skills Ronaldo has are frightening," he added. "He is an entertainer and fans at United love that.<br><br>"It is great to see and they are the type of players you would pay to watch."<br><br>United are still in line to land an historic Treble and Ronaldo has played a massive part in that standing.<br><br>He has scored an impressive 16 goals so far this season making him the leading scorer at the club ahead of the likes of Wayne Rooney and Louis Saha.<br><br>Keane, who was part of the Treble-winning side in 1999, believes United can go on and land that feat again.<br><br>"I am sure the Treble win of 1999 could be emulated," he said. "They are in good form - but they need luck, though."<br><br>The Sunderland boss, who has been enjoying a good run of form with his club in the Championship in his first managerial role, is looking forward to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League.<br><br>He believes United have a good chance of being the second English club in three years to land the European trophy.<br><br>He said: "It'll be hard but I think an English team has a good chance this year."</span></div>
