              <p><strong>Former Arsenal midfielder Lassana Diarra has delivered a withering
              assessment of Arsene Wenger’s managerial qualities, claiming he learnt
              nothing from working under his fellow Frenchman and that the Arsenal
              boss hardly spoke to him during his five-month stay in North London.</strong></p>
              <p>Diarra may have carved out a key role at Real Madrid following his
              £20 million January move from Portsmouth but he clearly still harbours
              resentment at the way his Arsenal career came to such a premature end.</p>
              <p>The France international joined The Gunners in a shock transfer from
              Chelsea in August 2007 but made only four Premier League starts before
              departing to join Portsmouth, where he won the FA Cup during a happy
              time working under Harry Redknapp.</p>
              <p>Such was his anonymity at Emirates Stadium, the midfielder admits he
              has almost forgotten his time at Arsenal, even if some aspects of
              Wenger’s guidance remain imprinted on his memory.</p>
              <p>When asked by El Pais if he learnt anything from the Arsenal boss,
              Diarra replied: “Me? Nothing. I did not learn anything from Wenger.
              Pfff... I was just taught to doubt everything.</p>
              <p>“I played 15 games, the relationship I had with him was not good.</p>
              <p>“You cannot understand why. I respect the way he trains but I learnt more with [Jose] Mourinho.</p>
              <p>“Mourinho taught me to fight. I spoke looking into his eyes. If you had a problem, you discussed it.</p>
              <p>“Wenger never addressed me until I told him I was going. He talked to others but not me.</p>
              <p>“I feel like I never played for Arsenal. If I do not think about it, I forget. I have cleared it from my head.”</p>
