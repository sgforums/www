              <div id="teaserText" class="teaserText">The Premier League's Dubious Goals Panel has viewed all dubious goals this season up to 21st October 2008.Â </div>
              <p>The Dubious Goals Committee has ruled on the following:</p>
              <p>1) Liverpool's first goal against Middlesbrough on 23rd August was
              in fact an own goal (Emanuel Pogatetz) and has therefore not been
              credited to Jamie Carragher.</p>
              <p>2) Manchester United's goal against Portsmouth on 25th August has been confirmed as a Darren Fletcher goal.</p>
              <p>3) Arsenal's third goal against Newcastle United on 30th August has been confirmed as a Denilson goal.</p>
              <p>4) Wigan Athletic's first goal against Hull City on 30th August has been confirmed as an own goal (Sam Ricketts).</p>
              <p>5) West Ham United's second goal against Blackburn Rovers on 30th August has been confirmed as an own goal (Christopher Samba).</p>
              <p>6) Arsenal's first goal against Blackburn Rovers on 13th September 2008 has been confirmed as a Robin van Persie goal.</p>
              <p>7) Manchester City's goal against Chelsea on 13th September 2008 has been confirmed as a Robinho goal.</p>
              <p>8) West Ham United's second goal against West Bromwich Albion on 13th September 2008 has been confirmed as a Lucas Neill goal.</p>
              <p>9) West Ham United's first goal against Newcastle United on 20th September has been confirmed as a David Di Michele goal.</p>
              <p>10) Arsenal's goal against Hull City on 27th September was in fact
              an own goal (Paul McShane) and has therefore not been credited to Cesc
              Fabregas.</p>
              <p>11) Arsenal's first goal against Everton on 18th October has been confirmed as a Samir Nasri goal.</p>
              <p>12) Chelsea's third goal against Middlesbrough on 18th October was
              in fact an own goal (David Wheater) and has therefore not been credited
              to Salomon Kalou.</p>
