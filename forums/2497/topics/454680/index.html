              <p>I don't think Pool can't outbid Spurs. They are both offering the same fee of $8m which Hoffenehim is happy to accept while Swansea had an agreement earlier at $6.8m with Hoffenehim... Spurs are not known to pay high salaries to their players as compare to Pool that's why they lost Joe Cole to Pool previously.</p>
              <p>It seems this deal is all down to Gylfi Sigurdsson himself of where he wants to go. Earlier he choose Pool as his choices was compare to Swansea only. Having held discussion with <span>Rodgers when he made it known he wanted him, things seemed to point to Sigurdsson going to Pool very soon. </span>Then suddenly a new avenue appear. I don't know who is the one that wants him as Harry isn't there anymore... Maybe Levy is buying the players at Spurs... But it seems that didn't matter as long as they were able to match Pool's offer, he seems to be more interested with the Spurs offer at the moment. Until the deal is seal, we shell wait and see where he ends up, Anfield or WHL...</p>

              its crazy signing players without a manager in place.

              <p>Spurs seemed to be more of an European style where the president or DOF does the choosing and buying while the manager just manage together with his coach.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's always good to have the numbers in the midfield as Sigurdsson has shown he can manage in the PL. And to be fair, at $8m... He seems to be rather cheap in today's market value to keep around...</p>
              <p>If he choose Spurs over Pool, i think it's just his personal preference like when he choose Pool over Swansea... I think if suddenly Chelsea or City became interested in him, he will tell Spurs goodbye as well kind.</p>
              <p>But Pool are still in with a chance as they are known to be willing to pay more in terms of salary as compare to Spurs.</p>

              <p>Spurs, who are without a manager, hope to complete a deal for the coveted 22-year-old by the end of this week, but they have still to agree personal terms with the player. Their approach to Hoffenheim comes amid serious doubts over the future of Luka Modric at White Hart Lane, with Real Madrid linked with the Croatian.</p>
              <p>Liverpool had been confident of signing Sigurdsson following the appointment of Brendan Rodgers as manager. The midfielder flourished under Rodgers on loan at Swansea last season and the pair have spoken several times since a proposed £6.8m transfer to the Liberty Stadium collapsed as a result of the manager's departure for Anfield.</p>

              <p class="body ">The London club stole a reach march in the race to land the highly rated striker, after agreeing an £8million fee with his club Hoffenheim.</p>
              <p class="body ">But the Iceland international has yet to agree personal terms with Tottenham, and that has left an opening for new Reds boss Brendan Rodgers to exploit.</p>
              <p class="body ">Sigurdsson has a close relationship with Rodgers after enjoying a lengthy loan spell under the Irishman at Swansea.</p>
              <p class="body ">And Liverpool will hope to use that connection to persuade him to ignore Spurs' advances. </p>

              <p class="body "><strong>The 22 year old has originally agreed to sign on a permanent basis for Swansea, but that deal fell through when Rodgers took the Anfield job.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">Liverpool have one other weapon in their armoury. The German club's manager is former Reds favourite Marcus Babbel, and he would be happy to see his striker switch to Anfield.</p>
              <p>Rodgers is also in the running to sign Chelsea striker Daniel Sturridge, but again, the player's salary demands are a stumbling block given the desire to bring a spiraling wage bill under control at Anfield.</p>
              <p class="body ">Spurs are also hoping to pursue talks with the England striker's agents, and if they land Sturridge it could pave the way for the Merseyside club to snap up Sigurdsson.</p>

              <p><span><strong>'There is clearly great ambition at Tottenham and the club intends to do big things. It is a pleasure to see that Gareth Bale has signed a new contract.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'There are top players in the team and the club is getting a new training ground.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Sigurdsson joined Swansea on loan from Hoffenheim last season and netted seven times in 19 appearances for the Welsh side.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Swansea had agreed a £6.8million fee, and personal terms with the player, but Rodgers' departure to Liverpool scuppered the deal.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The midfielder has already spoken to Andre Villas-Boas, who was named as Harry Redknapp's replacement, and is looking forward to working under the Portuguese.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I like him and the ideas he has,' Sigurdsson added. 'He has faith in me and I'm looking forward to working under his leadership.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Sigurdsson's arrival has raised questions about the future of Luka Modric.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Spurs playmaker, who last year was the subject of a £40million bid from Chelsea, has made it clear he wants to leave White Hart Lane, and Sigurdsson is being viewed by some as a like-for-like replacement.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has vowed not to sell any of the club's top stars but his resolve could be tested if Chelsea, Real Madrid or either of the Manchester clubs bid for the Croatian this summer.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Tottenham hope to wrap up a deal for Ajax captain Jan Vertonghen in the near future and the club have also been linked with a move for Russian midfielder Alan Dzagoev. <br></span></p>
