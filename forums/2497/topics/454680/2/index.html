              <p><span><strong>Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has claimed midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson's increased wage demands scuppered his move to Anfield.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>A deal had been struck with the Iceland international for him to return to Swansea - where he had spent the latter half of last season on loan - but when Rodgers moved to Anfield that move hit the rocks.</span> </p>
              <p><span>The Reds then appeared to be in pole position because of the player's relationship with the manager but when discussions began over finances Rodgers discovered the 22-year-old was asking for more money than he had agreed at Swansea.</span></p>
              <p><span>Rodgers did not feel that was justified and, as a result, Sigurdsson signed for Tottenham - because of the club's ambition and quality squad according to the player.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He wasn't playing at Hoffenheim, I brought him to Swansea and he did very well for me there, scoring seven goals in 19 games and was very good,' said the Reds boss, who succeeded Kenny Dalglish just over a month ago.</span></p>
              <p><span>'He and I both sat and spoke and believed that playing football was going to be the most important aspect for him.</span></p>
              <p><span>'But obviously it was important financially so we agreed a deal for him to go to Swansea and that was wrapped up.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I then became the Liverpool manager and that then wasn't something that was going to happen at Swansea so he then had a choice of where he wanted to go.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I knew what the market was and I wasn't prepared to pay anything over what I had known was agreed before.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Liverpool would have provided Gylfi with a wonderful opportunity to perform with a manager that he knows and at a club which is a real footballing institution.</span></p>
              <p><span>'But he's decided to go to Tottenham, for whatever reason.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I wish him the best, he's a good kid and there's no ill feeling. We've got other targets and we'll move on.'</span></p>

              <p>Sigi, who joined from German outfit Hoffenheim for £8million, was widely expected to follow new Kop boss Rodgers to Anfield after starring on loan for him at Swansea last season. </p>
              <p>But the goalscoring midfielder said: “Everything about Tottenham just felt right for me. Liverpool are also a fantastic club but if you look at where Tottenham have finished in the last few years, they finished above Liverpool. </p>
              <p>“With a new manager, a new training ground and plans for a new stadium, I believe there are exciting times are ahead.” </p>
              <p>Sigurdsson spoke as he modelled the new Tottenham kit, which is made by Under Armour and available at <span style="color: #000000;">tottenhamhotspur.com</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span> </p>
              <p>Last season, he scored seven goals in 18 Prem appearances after joining Rodgers’ Swans in January. </p>
              <p>The Welsh club’s attempts to sign the player on a permanent deal collapsed when Rodgers’ quit the club to take over at Liverpool last month.</p>
              <p>Rodgers’ then tried to take him to Anfield and Sigurdsson said: “I think everyone expected me to follow Brendan. </p>
              <p>“But I had made my mind up to come to Tottenham and I’m happy with my decision. </p>
              <p>“Brendan’s a fantastic manager, I enjoyed my time at Swansea with him and hopefully he will do well at Liverpool. I spoke to him briefly after I had made my decision. </p>
              <p>“What I said to him after I told him I wasn’t going to Liverpool is between me and him. Obviously I owe him a lot. But in that sense it’s a new era for me.” </p>
              <p>It is also a new era for his boss AVB, who replaced Harry Redknapp at White Hart Lane this summer after lasting just 256 days as manager at Chelsea. </p>
              <p>Sigi said: “If you look at his record at Porto, it was unbelievable. He won the Double and Europa League. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>“Obviously it didn’t work out at Chelsea but he’s still a fantastic manager. </strong> </p>
              <p>“All of the boys in the first week in training have been very happy with him and his sessions and his ambitions. Training has been very lively and he gets involved a lot. </p>
              <p>“There have been many great managers who have gone to Chelsea and it hasn’t worked out for them. </p>
              <p>“It’s probably one of the hardest jobs in the world to go to Chelsea. When things don’t go right, you are in trouble but he’s more than determined to do well with Tottenham. You can see that in training. </p>
              <p>“He’s young, he’s got a great future ahead of him. he’s a fantastic manager and that’s why Tottenham brought him in. Everything’s here for him to do well.” </p>
              <p>But forget AVB, Sigi is more excited about working with coaches Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand. He said: “I’ve been watching the Premier League since I was about eight. I’ve always known about Tottenham. </p>
              <p>“They have a good history. I remember a few of the old boys like David Ginola, Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand. </p>
              <p>“Tim and Les are still at the club now. They won’t be too happy I’ve called them old boys. I’ve met them and it was quite exciting for me. I’m still only 22. </p>
              <p>“I haven’t told them I used to watch them play — I’m hoping they read this!” </p>
              <p>Spurs also unveiled £10m centre-half Jan Vertonghen yesterday after his switch from Ajax was confirmed. </p>
              <p>The 25-year-old, who captained the Amsterdam club, agreed terms with Spurs at the weekend and has now completed the formalities after passing a medical. </p>
              <p>Spurs had been tracking the Belgium international for months, with Vertonghen winning last season’s Eredivisie player of the season award as Ajax won the league. </p>
              <p>Vertonghen said: “I am very relieved. It went on for a long time but I’m glad I’m a Tottenham player right now and I’m looking forward to playing for the club. </p>
              <p>“I am 25 years old now and I feel ready to play in the Premier League. I heard that Harry Redknapp really wanted me to play for Tottenham, but now it’s Andre Villas-Boas. To me, that doesn’t matter. </p>
              <p>“I just want to play for the club and I hope I can please the fans at the club.”</p>
