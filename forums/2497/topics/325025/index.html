              <p><em>Barry : was forced to face the wrath of fans</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MARTIN O’NEILL left Gareth Barry to suffer a barrage of hate, abuse and chants of Judas last night.</h2>
              <p class="article">The wantaway England midfielder was targeted by angry Aston Villa fans during a 60-minute appearance at Walsall. Barry, fined £80,000 after a blast at O’Neill over his stalled move to Liverpool, probably never expected to pull on a Villa shirt again.</p>
              <p class="article">But after a club ban from the first two weeks of pre-season training, he was forced to face the wrath of fans from the moment he emerged out of the tunnel.</p>
              <p class="article">Barry, 27, had gone from wearing the England captain’s armband in his last game — when he scored in the 3-0 win over Trinidad &amp; Tobago on June 1 — to a “punishment” place in a second-string Villa line-up last night.</p>
              <p class="article">None of the likely starting XI for Saturday’s Intertoto Cup second-leg tie with Danes Odense were on parade in the 3-2 friendly win against their League One neighbours.</p>
              <p class="article">Barry was loudly jeered after he followed captain Marlon Harewood’s lead in clapping the away supporters. And he received the same treatment whenever he touched the ball with chants of ‘Judas’, ‘Barry Who?’ and ‘You’re Not Fit To Wear The Shirt’ echoing around the ground.</p>
              <p class="article">There were even cackles of delight when Barry was sent sprawling under a challenge from Georges Ba. The only respite came when Walsall fans responded with ‘There’s Only One Gareth Barry — Sign Him On!’</p>
              <p class="article">He was finally put out of his misery, making way for Barry Bannan in the 60th minute before beating a hasty exit from the ground just 10 minutes later. Boss O’Neill was left seething by Barry’s accusation he had made little effort during the summer to convince him to stay.</p>
              <p class="article">The player said: “He’s found time to be a BBC pundit at Euro 2008 but hasn’t found time to speak to me.” But Liverpool’s continued refusal to match Villa’s £18million valuation has left him in limbo. And when O’Neill met Barry and his agent, Alex Black, last Wednesday it was only to again hear his desire to join the Reds.</p>
              <p class="article">O’Neill is set to beat Portsmouth to land Shaun Wright-Phillips from Chelsea <strong>AND</strong> Younes Kaboul from Spurs. Villa are ready with an offer of around £8m for SWP after Pompey cooled their interest in the England winger, 26, who has little chance of a starting place at Stamford Bridge.</p>
