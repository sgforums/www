              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester City</strong></span></a><strong> will give the first sign in the next 48 hours of their summer transfer spending power with an offer for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span></a><strong> midfielder James Milner, thought to be £24million.</strong></p>
              <p>Mindful of Fabio Capello's rule that England players must not negotiate transfers during World Cup duty, City have moved quickly.</p>
              <p>They expect Chelsea to compete for Milner and want to declare their interest first. Villa are expecting Chelsea to match City's offer this week.</p>
              <p>Sources close to the player believe Villa will demand closer to £30m to even consider selling Milner, 24, which would make him one of the most expensive signings in English football history.</p>
              <p>The England midfielder has had an excellent season with Aston Villa, but City believe Randy Lerner is ready to cash in on the former Leeds and Newcastle star. Lerner has told manager Martin O'Neill he must sell before he can buy.</p>
              <p>O'Neill is likely to resist the transfer, but it would enable him to add to his squad this summer. Selling the popular Milner for £24m would represent a 100 per cent profit for Villa, who signed him from Newcastle for £12m in 2008.</p>
              <p>Milner, who has represented England at under 16. under 17, under 19, under 20 and under 21 level, as well as senior level, has been destined for great things since bursting on to the scene as a 16-year-old at Leeds.</p>
              <p>Milner last night found himself embroiled in disrupted preparations for next month's World Cup due to the ash cloud flight chaos and the weather at the training camp for Fabio Capello's England squad in the Austrian Alps.</p>
              <p>The England boss will reluctantly start the team's training in Hertfordshire if Iceland's volcanic ash cloud prevents him from taking them to their high-altitude base in Irdning as planned today.</p>

              <p><em>Star of David: Benfica defender David Luiz is poised for a big money move to Manchester City</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1279228" rel="1279228|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1279228/Buy-buy-Manchester-City-Money-men-swoop-David-Luiz-Villa-fight-Milner.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Manchester City flexed their muscles again on Monday when they opened negotiations to take brilliant Brazilian David Luiz from under the noses of Real Madrid in a £25million swoop.</strong></p>
              <p>The left-sided Benfica defender - who can also play as a defensive midfielder - had been expected to move to Spain until City moved swiftly with an ambush bid to beat Real to his signature. </p>
              <p>It comes 24 hours after they began their £24m raid for James Milner - although AstonVilla's American owner Randy Lerner is determined to resist any attempts by City tolure his highly rated player.</p>
              <p>The billionaire said: 'I'm not worried about losing James Milner. I think James will play for Aston Villa and should play for Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>'I'm not dismissive of the realities that a player that has received the attention and acclaim of James is going to spark discussion and debate about a move and so on. The answer is "No", I don't worry about him leaving because he is wanted at this club.'</p>
              <p>It could be that Manchester City include England Under 21 defender Nedum Onuoha in their proposed offer for Milner.</p>
              <p>As they look to wheel and deal in the market this summer, Luiz is among their top targets.</p>
              <p>Manager Roberto Mancini has watched him several times this season - notably when he impressed at left back for Benfica against Liverpool in the Europa League quarter-finals - and believes the all-action player is worth the investment.</p>
              <p>Luiz, 23, has also been watched by Chelsea and Manchester United, but City are the first to come close to Benfica's valuation and the player is keen on the move.</p>
              <p>The 6ft 2in defender was a pivotal figure in his side's resurgence last season and helped them to the Portuguese title.</p>
              <p>Benfica still hope to drive the figure close to his buy-out clause of £43m but the player and his representatives are confident a reasonable compromise can be reached and City's £25m will be sufficient.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA will fight Manchester City for England midfield star James Milner.</h2>
              <p class="article">City have tabled a £30million offer after Aston Villa rejected their initial £25m bid. But now Chelsea have joined the race and Blues boss Carlo Ancelotti believes the lure of Champions League football will prove a trump card.</p>
              <p class="article">Both City and Villa missed out on a top-four finish as Tottenham clinched the final Champions League spot ahead of them. And Chelsea believe an opportunity for Milner to play at the highest level in Europe will see them win the day.</p>
              <p class="article">Milner, 24, refused to commit his future to Villa when tackled about the subject and is known to be fiercely ambitious after breaking into the England side this term.</p>
              <p class="article">So the chance to team up with international colleagues John Terry, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole could prove irresistible.</p>
              <p class="article">Milner, who can also play at right-back, has two years left on his £40,000-a-week contract and Villa boss Martin O'Neill wants to open talks on a new deal after the World Cup.</p>
              <p class="article">But Chelsea will dwarf any new deal Villa could put on the table as O'Neill battles to keep one of his key men.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea say they are ready to go the distance for Milner after missing out to City on Brazilian striker Robinho two summers ago.</p>
              <p class="article">A Chelsea insider said: "Losing out to City for Robinho was embarrassing at the time, even if it did turn out to be a lucky escape.</p>
              <p class="article">"But we are determined to get our man this time and we are very confident it will happen."</p>
              <p class="article">Milner, speaking at England's training camp in Austria, hinted he would be willing to move.</p>
              <p class="article">When asked if he would like to stay at Villa, Milner replied pointedly: "I've enjoyed my time at Aston Villa, it's a great club to be at. But all I am thinking about is England."</p>
              <p class="article">Villa owner Randy Lerner insists Villa will fight to keep Milner. He said: "We're going to do everything we can to keep him."</p>

              <p>A mildfielder is kinda necessary now, since Ballack will most probably be leaving. But what if Essien and Mikel returns? Is Millner guaranteed first team football?</p>

              <p>And don't forget, Uefa rule will come into effect too by then where clubs must have at least 6 or 7 players that comes from that country or foreign players who spent 3 yrs or more from that country's youth academy...

In the final three months of the season, he made just one start and a single substitute appearance.<br><br>A part-exchange involving the Republic of Ireland international would appear to represent good value for Villa. Ireland was rated at more than £15m last season when he gained a reputation as one of the most dynamic central midfielders in the Premier League.<br><br>The deal would also save O’Neill the necessity of finding a replacement for Milner at a time when owner Randy Lerner is looking to reduce Villa’s transfer budget.<br><br>Villa firmly rejected City’s initial offer of £20m for Milner last Wednesday and said they are keen to tie the 24-year-old to an improved contract, which currently has two years to run and is worth a reported £45,000-a-week.<br><br>City and Mancini have not been put off and will step up their bid this week to make Milner the club’s first signing of what is expected to be another major summer spending spree.<br><br>Micah Richards, who is valued at £6m, has also been mentioned at Eastlands as a possible makeweight in the Milner deal. Furthermore, fellow defender Nedum Onuoha could also be an option but has not yet been discussed. <br><br>Tottenham are expected to make a move for Richards while Sunderland have emerged as possible suitors for Onuoha’s signature.<br><br>Chelsea and Manchester United are continuing to monitor developments in the tug of war for Milner’s services.<br><br>England manager Fabio Capello has made it clear that he will not allow any of his players to negotiate transfers during the World Cup and Milner is likely to want his future resolved before the start of the tournament on June 11.<br><br>Milner was named the PFA Young Player of the Year after an outstanding season that has thrust him firmly into contention for a starting position in England’s opening World Cup game.<br><br>Although a winger by trade, who is also capable of operating in either full-back position, he has been shifted inside to a central midfield position this season by O’Neill, a move that has paid great dividends.<br></div>
