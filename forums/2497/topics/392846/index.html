              hotel at 
              nearly 2am - begging the question: "What WAS he up to?"</h2>
              <p class="article">The married France defender, 28, was captured by CCTV cameras 15 miles

              him on 
              the cheek as they waited by the hotel lifts.</p>
              <p class="article">The dad of one, who skippered the Red Devils to victory in Sunday's 
              Carling 
              Cup Final at Wembley, was seen with the mystery woman at 1.43am.</p>
              <p class="article">He parked his car outside the hotel as the beauty paid for her room with
               a 
              credit card.</p>
              <p class="article">She then walked back out into the car park before re-emerging through 
              the 
              revolving hotel doors with the millionaire footballer following behind 
              in a 
              hoodie-style top.</p>
              <p class="article">Twelve seconds later church-goer Evra, wed to wife Sandra and dad to 
              four-year-old son Lenny, was seen at the lifts with the girl, with whom 
              he 
              had laughed and joked.</p>
              <p class="article"><em>As they waited by the 
              elevator, the blonde leaned in and planted a kiss on 
              grinning Evra's cheek - unaware she was being filmed by CCTV.</em></p>

              walks through foyer with Evra pictured behind</div>
              </div>
              <p class="article">Yesterday France international Evra admitted it was him in the pictures -
               but 
              declined to say why he was visiting the hotel 15 miles from his mansion 
              in 
              Alderley Edge, Cheshire, in the early hours.</p>
              <p class="article">Wearing a purple hoodie-style top, he spoke through the window of his 
              4x4 as 
              he set off for training ahead of United's game at Wolves today.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="article">Looking perplexed, Evra studied the CCTV pictures and said: "Yes, that's
               me, I 
              can talk to this woman. We were just at the same hotel."</p>
              <p class="article"><em>Asked why the blonde 
              had kissed him, the 28-year-old replied: "I have never 
              met her before" - then he wound up his window and sped off.</em></p>

              <p class="article">But the soccer star's mysterious middle-of-the-night visit baffled hotel
               
              guests who recognised him.</p>
              <p class="article">One said last night: "We couldn't believe it. There was hardly anyone 
              about at 
              that time of the night and we looked up when we saw this pretty girl 
              checking in.</p>
              <p class="article">"Then this bloke followed her and there was no mistaking who he was - 
              even 
              with the hoodie.</p>
              <p class="article">"I was going to ask him for an autograph, but he was straight over to 
              the 
              lifts.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's not the flashest of hotels by any stretch of the imagination, so 
              it was 
              weird to see a Man United player bowl in at that time of the night.</p>
              <p class="article">"We couldn't work out what he would be doing there in the early hours of
               a 
              Monday - especially as United had a match two days later. It didn't seem
               the 
              best way to prepare for a game. We saw the girl. She was a real babe - 
              she 
              dressed well and looked like a model."</p>
              <div class="margin-top-5 margin-left-10 padding-bottom-5 float-right" style="width: 180px;"><img title="With phone ... star

              <div class="img-cap">With phone ... star yesterday</div>
              </div>
              <p class="article">Evra, snapped checking his mobile phone before travelling to Wolves 
              yesterday, 
              visited the hotel on February 8. It is a 25-minute drive from the home 
              he 
              shares with 28-year-old Sandra, his high school sweetheart and partner 
              for 
              more than 15 years.</p>
              <p class="article">The star has always insisted he is devoted to his wife and said in a 
              recent 
              interview: "She's my first girlfriend, and I hope my last!" Discussing 
              his responsibilities as a role model, he said: "As a footballer, I need 
              to be 
              mindful of the example I am setting.</p>
              <p class="article">"Sometimes I react badly on the pitch and the first thing I think of is 
              what 
              impact my behaviour might have on youngsters watching."</p>
              <p class="article">Evra has also spoken at length about his religious ties and revealed he 
              has 
              more time to attend church playing in England than abroad.</p>
              <div class="margin-top-5 margin-right-10 padding-bottom-5 float-left" style="width: 180px;"><img title="Evra ... with the Carling 
              Cup" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00999/SNN0605_6__999656a.jpg" border="0" alt="Evra ... with the Carling Cup">
              <div class="img-cap">Evra ... with the Carling Cup</div>
              </div>
              <p class="article">He said: "In France training is in the afternoon. I like to sleep in the
               
              morning and I didn't go. Here I've more time to go to church.</p>
              <p class="article">"I just say thanks to God that I don't have a lot of injury, just to 
              keep my 
              feet on the ground and don't try to be somebody I'm not."</p>
              <p class="article">Evra also dotes on his son and told a club fanzine three years ago: "I 
              have 
              always loved children and find their innocence irresistible.</p>
              <p class="article">"I can't describe the joy my son has brought me. Even when I get home a 
              bit 
              uptight, all it takes is one look from him and everything is forgotten."
               
              Evra's hotel visit could land him in hot water with his superiors at Old
               
              Trafford - as just two days later he turned out for United in their 1-1 
              draw 
              with Aston Villa.</p>
              <p class="article">His manager Sir Alex Ferguson is a huge advocate of seeing his players 
              settled 
              and married.</p>
              <p class="article">Last September he spoke about Wayne Rooney's growing maturity, saying: 
              "Marriage helps footballers. It helps them settle down - you know where 
              are 
              they are too! It's good for the stability of a footballer."</p>

              <p>Well, I guess this story isn't as big as Terry's cos I didn't even see this reported on NOTW this morning... But then again, i guess it isn't as big a deal when it's a nobody compare to banging your good friend / team-mate's wife right?</p>
              <p>Even as it is, it's quite difficult to search for it too. I entered your thread title and it came up with Tiger Woods, John Terry and Ashley Cole... lol. Serious, no joke you can check it out...</p>
              <p>Honestly, I am very glad you have took the trouble to post it here... Like I have always said, everyone is free to post news stories here... Therefore, I like to say thank you very much for your trouble, we appreciate it, I personally appreciate it very much.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you can't expect zocoss to do everything right? Everyone can share the workload...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>

              <p>in the case like brad pitt, nobody bother to say about him. obviously, he screw around first before divorce angelina jolie and married a new wife.</p>
