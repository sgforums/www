            <div class='col-md body'>ETO'O: I'D LOVE TO PLAY AT ANFIELD<br><br>SAMUEL ETO'O has reopened speculation that he will move to the Premiership by talking to the Sunday Mirror about his great admiration for Liverpool.<br><br>As Anfield boss Rafa Benitez pledged a drastic overhaul of his beaten Champions League finalists, Eto'o made a point of praising the Reds' team spirit, style of play and passionate support.<br><br>In an exclusive one-toone the star Barcelona striker revealed his desire to play in front of the Kop at some point.<br><br>Advertisement<br>Aware of the politics surrounding his position at the Nou Camp - and the fact that he has a contract at Barcelona until 2010 - the Cameroon superstar stressed that he would be in Spain next season.<br><br>But Benitez will be delighted to hear Eto'o's rapturous appreciation of the Anfield outfit - especially as the Spanish coach is lobbying new American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett for the sort of funds needed to land a world-class goalscorer.<br><br>The African is top of a list that also includes Fernando Torres and David Villa.<br><br>Eto'o, 26, said: "The great thing about Liverpool is their team spirit. It is very strong.<br><br>"But, for me, it is their fans who win matches for Liverpool because they have so much power. They are fantastic. Any player would love to have those types of fans behind him. I have played at Anfield in the Champions League quarter-final so I know all about their fantastic supporters.<br><br>"It would be wonderful to have that kind of support as a Liverpool player but I really don't know what will happen in the next two years.<br><br>"Every time I turn around so many things have happened and changed. So I can't think about it yet.<br><br>"But you never know.<br><br>"If I play in the Premiership I will be the first to say. It won't be in the newspapers - I will be the one to break the news!"<br><br>The Cameroon international fell out with Barcelona boss Frank Rijkaard earlier this season after refusing to come on as a late sub against Racing Santander - and his relationship with teammate Ronaldinho has been strained.<br><br>He added: "I have not heard anything from Liverpool or anyone else. These things don't come through to me.<br><br>"I'm only thinking about next season and I will be here next season. But every year that passes things become a bit more difficult.<br><br>"English football has changed a lot for the better over the past few years. I've seen English teams playing matches which have been very exciting.<br><br>"It's been like watching a dream team. Chelsea have been spectacular at times - they have played real football.<br><br>"And when I saw Liverpool play Chelsea in the Champions League semi-final I was impressed by the way Liverpool played a more strategic, attacking game.<br><br>"There was dribbling and great skill in that match. And when we played them I thought, 'Are we playing against Liverpool or a Spanish team?'<br><br>"I love the way the fans in England get behind their team. I respect their mentality. They are so positive in supporting their own team rather than, as happens in Spain, being against the opposition.<br><br>"That's the big difference between England and Spain."<br><br>The three-time African Footballer of the Year also went out of his way to praise his bitter rival Didier Drogba.<br><br>The two strikers have been involved in a feud since the Africa Cup of Nations last year - but Eto'o is now prepared to bury the hatchet with the Chelsea star.<br><br>"I am a fan of Drogba," he said. "He is an excellent player and a good defender of the African continent.<br><br>"There are so few African players playing at the moment that we all need to come together to defend our continent. I wasn't aware that we were involved in a feud - the press made something out of nothing.<br><br>"I saw some of the FA Cup Final in England and Drogba won the game for Chelsea. He has been doing that all season and is a very important player for them."<br></div>
