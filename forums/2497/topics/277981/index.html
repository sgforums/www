Peter Crouch against Paraguay at the World Cup last year</span><br><br><strong>Peter Crouch has been branded a cheat by FIFA. And football's world governing body even instructed its referees to punish him for fouling. The amazing revelation has come from England's former top official Graham Poll. Poll claimed that, before last summer's World Cup finals in Germany, FIFA refereeing chiefs singled out England's 6ft 7in striker and told officials to crack down on him. Crouch is suspended for Saturday's crunch Euro 2008 qualifier with Israel, having picked up two cautions in just five international matches this season. </strong><br><br>The difference between that figure and his record for Liverpool is marked Â— he received only two yellow cards in 49 appearances last term Â— and Poll may have provided a reason why. He said: "At the World Cup last year, we were shown videos of England games. "The head of refereeing at FIFA said, 'Look at this big fella Crouch. He's a real pain and getting away with too much. We need to mark him as a player we need to look out for'. "We watched England's warm-up games and it was pointed out the way he used his arms. I tried to defend him, being English."<br><br>But Poll's words went unheeded as Crouch was booked against Paraguay and consistently cited for fouling during the tournament. Poll's revelation will stun the FA, who may now believe referees were instructed to penalise the England team before a ball was even kicked. The ex-Premier League ref from Tring admitted officials can be influenced by the guidelines given to them by their bosses.<br><br>Speaking on Radio Five Live, Poll added: "You have to ask yourself as a ref if you are looking out for him all the time or only when he has done something that draws your attention. "To prepare is fine but to pre-judge is not. And, low and behold, Crouch did get booked in Germany. "He has been picking up cautions since and is out of Saturday's match. "Players need to be aware that referees individually, or as a referee's team, can be tactical as well."<br><br></div>
