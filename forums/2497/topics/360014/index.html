              <p><strong>Wolfsburg hit-man Edin Dzeko has claimed that Chelsea are on his tail.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/germany/Wolfsburg/dzeko.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>The Bosnian is enjoying a promising season with the Bundesliga title
              contenders and he has already bagged 40 goals in 48 games in all
              competitions.</strong></p>
              <p>The 23-year-old’s fine record has attracted a host of European
              clubs, and he has declared that The Blues, as well as other Premier
              League and Spanish league clubs, have contacted his agent.</p>
              <p>Dzeko is under contract until 2010 and planned to respect his deal,
              but Felix Magath’s unexpected move to Schalke has made him change his
              mind.</p>
              <p>“I am aware of Chelsea’s interest,” he told Avaz. “There have been
              concrete talks with my agent and the club. Nevertheless, we should not
              talk about it yet.</p>
              <p>“Other clubs are also interested in me in England and Spain, but I will only think about it when the season concludes.</p>
              <p>“Nobody at the club is happy with Magath’s departure to Schalke, but
              there is not much we can do. We have to remain focused on the title
              race.</p>
              <p>“His departure changed everything for me. Staying with Wolfsburg was
              my intention for him if we win the league, but right now I am not sure
              anymore.” </p>

              <p><strong>Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko is not interested in Manchester City but would consider a move to Arsenal, according to his agent. </strong></p>
              <p>The 23-year-old Bosnia and Herzegovina international, who has been
              named the Bundesliga’s footballer of the year by German journalists, is
              currently attracting attention from a wide range of clubs across
              Europe.</p>
              <p>And, after confirming that City and Arsenal are interested, agent
              Irfan Redzepagic has revealed that Dzeko would be open to a move to
              Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">“It is not possible for Dzeko, who is a leading player in Germany
              and has the chance to play in the Champions League, to go to a
              mid-table club like Manchester City,” he told Onet. </span></strong></p>
              <p>“Arsenal would be a different matter.</p>
              <p>“The Londoners’ offer is one we treat very seriously.”</p>
              <p>However, German newspaper Bild claimed on Tuesday that Milan vice
              president Adriano Galliani held talks with Redzepagic at the weekend in
              Sarajevo about a potential €30 million (£26.1m) move, and Inter are
              also said to be interested.</p>
              <p>It appears Milan have the edge, though, as Dzeko has revealed he is a long-term supporter of the Rossoneri.</p>
              <p>“They have always been my favourite club, right back to my days as a
              small boy, growing up in Sarajevo,” he said in the Daily Mail.</p>
