              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>IAN WRIGHT believes Didier Drogba would be mad to leave Chelsea. Drogba, 29, is likely to quit Stamford Bridge this summer to team up again with former Blues boss Jose Mourinho at Inter Milan. But Wright has warned the Ivory Coast hitman not to expect the grass to be any greener in Italy.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Arsenal legend said: "Drogba always plays for Chelsea when he's fit. "He's scoring goals, he gets paid a fortune and the fans love him. "But he comes out with some unbelievable rants at times for no apparent reason.</p>
              <p class="article">"Does he think he's going to go to Inter, AC Milan, Real Madrid or Barcelona and find it any easier than it is at Chelsea? "I don't know what his problem is and I'm really confused by his behaviour. "He's not going to get it any better than he's got it right now at Chelsea."</p>
              <p class="article">Wrighty also believes Avram Grant was destined to fail from his first day as Chelsea boss. Grant replaced Mourinho in September but was sacked after the Blues finished two points behind Premier League champs Manchester United and lost to Sir Alex Ferguson's side in the Champions League final.</p>
              <p class="article">Wright said: "Grant was definitely doomed from day one but only because of who he replaced. "Mourinho left unceremoniously. He had his problems with Roman Abramovich and there was only ever going to be one winner. "He was such a favourite but Grant came in and no one knew who he was. Everyone wanted to know what he'd done.</p>
              <p class="article">"The way the Chelsea fans unloaded on him after the Carling Cup final defeat proved he was on a hiding to nothing. "In many ways he was treated like a player. "If he played well the fans would turn round and say 'well he gets paid enough, so he should perform like that'. Then when he plays badly they all boo him. "That's what Avram Grant's position was so maybe it's a good thing for him not to be there. "He was never going to be a favourite at Chelsea."</p>
