              <h3>LIVERPOOL are the subject of a possible £200million investment from a Saudi billionaire - and that has re-ignited the bitter war between Tom Hicks and George Gillett. </h3>
              <p>The Anfield co-owners are still both trying to sell each other's half of the club. </p>
              <p>Prince Faisal bin fahad bin Abdullah al Saud attended yesterday's 6-1 thrashing of Hull as a guest of Gillett and was even taken into the dressing room to meet the team. </p>
              <p>Although he was aware of the Saudis' attendance, Hicks was not part of any of the discussions with or invitations to the Prince, who claims he will negotiate for as much as 50 per cent of the club.</p>
              <p>Sources close to Gillett insist the Prince's visit was primarily about setting up Liverpool FC Academies in the Middle East, playing down the guest's investment talk. </p>
              <p>But Sport of the World understands the invitation is part of ongoing efforts by the co-owners to oust the other from the Anfield boardroom. The pair are pursuing new co-investors separately. Prince Faisal, who was flanked by three bodyguards in the Directors' Box, is chief executive of F6, a marketing and investment company in Saudi Arabia. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="image-holder"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00058/kop2_280x476_58714a.jpg" alt="George Gillett (left) and Tom Hicks" width="280" height="476"></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>He is the latest in a series of potential investors invited to Anfield. His primary interest is in sports such as powerboat racing. He is president of Saudi Water Sports Federation and has shown little previous interest in football.</strong> </p>
              <p>Ironically, Hicks has appointed financial advisors Merrill Lynch to seek millions from Saudi Arabia and across the Middle East. Again, he has acted independently from Gillett. </p>
              <p>Gillett is currently in a stronger financial position than his co-owner, having sold the Montreal Canadians ice hockey side for around £360m. Hicks has consistently flexed more muscle in his boardroom power struggles. </p>
              <p>He has overseen the appointment of managing director Christian Purslow, forced through the five-year extension to Rafa Benitez's contract and the departure of ex-chief executive Rick Parry. </p>
              <p>Last year, owners of the Delhi Daredevils Indian Premier League club were wined and dined by Hicks. </p>
              <p>Leaked documents compiled by Merrill Lynch and sent to potential investors last March underline why Liverpool are still desperate for investment. </p>
              <p>Until they raise the funds to build the new stadium on Stanley Park, the club will continue to lose as much as £55m per year in matchday income. </p>
              <p>Despite this, manager Benitez has been assured a £100m kitty over the next five years, providing Liverpool consistently reach the last 16 of the Champions League. </p>
              <p>Qualifying for the group stages of the competition has long been Benitez's minimum requirement to raise funds. </p>
              <p>But he must ensure Liverpool are in the knockout stages every season until 2014 to preserve his current £20m-a-year net spend. The club's ambitious budgeting is a consequence of Benitez achieving this goal in every season since his arrival. </p>
              <p>Liverpool have failed to progress into the quarter-finals just once since his move to Merseyside in 2004. </p>
              <p>And a win over Fiorentina in Italy in midweek would go a long way to securing a safe passage this season, too, preserving his spending power next summer. </p>
              <p>The transfer vow, although heavily incentivised through on-field performance, is partially reassuring to Kop fans, especially as this figure will grow if Liverpool reach the later stages or win the competition. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>The co-owners insist they have outspent Arsenal and Manchester United since taking over Liverpool.</em> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Both Hicks and Gillett are increasingly hitting back at claims they have failed to invest in the team since their controversial takeover three years ago.</strong> </p>
              <p>Sources close to the duo say they are baffled at the unfavourable financial comparisons with Arsenal and Manchester United, who they insist they have outspent since taking over Liverpool. </p>
              <p>The club's own study into transfer activity revealed how, up until the end of last season, the Merseysiders had splashed out £205.3m on players since 2004, recouping £98.75m from sales. </p>
              <p>That figure does not take into account an estimated £10m invested on youth players over the same period. </p>
              <p>Fans desperate for the Americans to sell their stake have warned about the club becoming the next Leeds United, but club insiders dismiss those fears. </p>
              <p>Gillett was confronted by angry fans at Liverpool's Academy yesterday morning, when he launched a stern defence of his role at the club and refuted claims of financial instability. </p>
              <p>A Kop source told Sport of the World: "It's nonsense to suggest Liverpool is going the same way as Leeds. </p>
              <p>"The documents leaked are out of date. They were written last November and don't take into account the refinancing last summer or the record sponsorship deal we've just completed, but you can see how prudent the club is being. </p>
              <p>"We are not spending above our means and the targets set were based on the last five years' income. </p>
              <p>"A net spend of £20m per season compares favourably with our top four rivals. You only have to look at what Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United have spent over the same period to see that." </p>
              <p>However, the latest developments underline how fragile the recent truces are. And there could be further divisions ahead over the appointment of a new chief executive.</p>
              <p>Gillett is anticipating a shortlist for Parry's replacement to be drawn up as early as next week and sees Purslow's role as merely transitional. </p>
              <p>The managing director has been commuting from London twice a week since joining the club, although his exceptional performance so far means he is likely to take a broader, long-term role.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Gillett in Liverpool sale talks with Saudi Royal family</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> co-owner George Gillett is in talks about selling a significant portion of his stake.</p>
              <p>The <em>Sunday Mirror</em> says Gillett was in talks on Saturday
              night about selling a 25 per cent stake in the Anfield club to an Arab
              prince in a deal worth £125million.</p>
              <p>He has met with Prince Khalid al-Faisal and members of the Saudi royal family about investment opportunities at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Discussions initially began about various commercial projects
              but quickly progressed into talks aimed at bringing the prince in as a
              co-owner to work alongside Gillett and his fellow American Tom Hicks.</p>
              <p>Any share deal would require the blessing of Hicks before it
              could be rubber-stamped. And although Hicks is yet to meet personally
              with Prince Khalid, it is understood that the Texan is ready to welcome
              a new partner if the terms of the deal are right.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">A SAUDI prince claims he is close to buying a 50 per cent stake in Liverpool - for up to £350million.</h2>
              <p class="article">Prince Faisal bin Fahd bin Abdullah al-Saud told a Saudi newspaper that an agreement has been reached with the club's American owners.</p>
              <p class="article">The tycoon - who chairs the F6 sport investment firm - was quoted as saying: "We are seeking to own a 50 per cent stake in the club.</p>
              <p class="article">"The value of the transaction, which is nearing resolution, will be between £200m and £350m."</p>
              <p class="article">But a source close to Tom Hicks, who co-owns Liverpool with fellow US tycoon George Gillett, said he is only prepared to sell a 25 per cent stake in order to raise £100m and is unaware of Prince Faisal's so-called deal.</p>
              <p class="article">Reports claimed that the deal would include plans for football academies in Europe and the Middle East to give Liverpool a larger pool of talent.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool are reported to be £245m in debt but the Americans have been working hard to reduce that while still keeping the club competitive in the Premier League.</p>
              <p class="article">The pair paid £60m when the loan they used to buy the club expired last year and manager Rafa Benitez has been heavily backed in the transfer market.</p>
              <p class="article">Prince Faisal was seen at Anfield on Saturday for Liverpool's 6-1 win over Hull as prize asset Fernando Torres netted a hat-trick.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool are third on goal difference in the Premier League.</p>
              <p class="article">If a deal with Prince Faisal goes through it would follow Sheikh Mansour's Manchester City takeover as the latest Prem buy-up by Middle Eastern businessmen.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Liverpool play down talk of Prince Faisal buying into club</h1>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>'s American owners do not expect Prince Faisal bin Fahd bin Abdullah to buy into the club, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p>The <em>Guardian</em> says Tom Hicks and George Gillett do not
              expect a major investment in the club from Prince Faisal, despite the
              Saudi's claims he is close to paying up to £350m for a 50% stake.</p>
              <p>Sources close to the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> owners, plus Anfield officials, insist the Saudi's interest amounts to
              no more than an agreement with Gillett to sponsor the club's intended
              youth academies in the Middle East.</p>
              <p>The Americans are continuing to pursue their own plans for the future.</p>
              <p>Hicks has employed Merrill Lynch to entice a minority shareholder to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> and values a 25% stake at £100m. Gillett has instructed Rothschild to pursue a similar goal.</p>

              <p>F6 chairman Prince Faisal bin Fahad bin Abdulla Al Saud has confirmed the Saudi investment firm is closing in on a 50% share of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> for a price of between £200m and £350m.</p>
              <p>"At the moment we are looking forward to acquiring 50 per cent of the
              club's stake," said the Prince, who is also an honorary member of Saudi
              football giants Al Hilal.</p>
              <p>"The deal will be concluded soon and its value will be between £200m and £350m.</p>
              <p>"If we finalise the deal, it will be something marvellous because <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> is one of the best and most famous clubs in England and the whole world."</p>
              <p>If the Saudi prince does indeed manage to acquire half the club,
              it will undoubtedly bolster manager Rafael Benitez's spending power
              during the January transfer window.</p>

              <p>Saudi Arabian sports investment company F6 has confirmed they've struck agreement with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> to establish academies in the Middle East.</p>
              <p>The deal signed with Reds co-owner George Gillett will seek to set up

              Petty Motorsports.</p>
              <p>"The memorandum of understanding with George Gillett group will establish an exclusive partnership between F6 group, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> FC and Richard Petty Motorsports team," a statement released by the company read.</p>
              <p>"His Highness Prince Faisal stated that the partnership with
              George Gillett's group will be a good addition to F6. This partnership
              will provide a lot of investments in football, racing and sports media
              in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East."</p>
              <p>F6 chairman Prince Faisal bin Fahad bin Abdulla Al Saud also told <em>Al Riyadh</em>: "We have signed several contracts with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> after visiting the club and attending the match with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Hull City</span></abbr> in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"The contracts are basically sports investments, which also

              <h1 class="titlestory">F6: Liverpool takeover talk premature</h1>
              <p>Saudi investment F6 insist they're a long way off from buying into <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>F6 director Barry Didato confirmed the due diligence process taking
              place relates to other commercial opportunities and "does not involve
              the possibility of an immediate investment in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>", with any possible transaction being "several months away".</p>
              <p>Didato said: "As far as investment in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> is concerned, that would be a long way off. A lot of people have jumped
              the gun and any possible investment would be several months away.</p>
              <p>"The agreement signed (at the weekend) leaves the door open for it (possible future investment in <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>), but that was certainly not the focus of it."</p>
              <p>Didato added that no talks have been staged between F6 and Hicks, who, like Gillett, owns 50 per cent of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>"George has a partner there and has his own issues to work
              through," Didato added. "Mr Hicks will also have his own issues and we
              are not sure what he wants to do.</p>
              <p>"Another issue is the club's debt (of around £245million).
              Prince Faisal will not put forward investment capital to just clean up
              a balance sheet. He would only want to use money to take the club
              forward. It would be long-term money."</p>
              <p>Didato said that Prince Faisal would have an open mind regarding the ultimate stake he could hold in the club.</p>
              <p>"His Highness is open to anything and is open to being a
              minority shareholder, but he has tremendous favourability towards the
              brand and institution of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>," Didato added.</p>
              <p>"His Highness would need to be invited by George and it would have to
              be at the right time for George. There would need to be a shared vision
              between all of the parties."</p>

              <p>Widespread reports suggested Prince Faisal bin Fahd bin Abdullah
              al-Saud's F6 investment vehicle had been given the go-ahead to carry
              out exclusive due diligence with a view to buying into the club after

              <p>Gillett said: "We had a marvellous meeting with them on Saturday and
              they were impressed with the club, but the academies in Saudi Arabia
              and North Africa and their possible involvement in NASCAR-type racing
              in the Middle East were the only items on the agenda.</p>
              <p>"We have entered into a period of exclusive discussions
              regarding the possibility of introducing NASCAR-type racing to the
              Middle East, but the memorandum of understanding does not cover
