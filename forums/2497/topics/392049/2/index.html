              <p>OMG did anyone see the full extent of Ramsey's injury? It was like, his ankle was totally twisted at an angle with respect to the leg... It is so horrifying and the injury is so reminiscent of the injury that Eduardo suffered 2 years ago.</p>
              <p>It's deja vu again for Arsenal.</p>
              <p>2 years ago: <span style="color: #ff0000;">23/02/2008</span> Birmingham 2-2 Arsenal-Martin Taylor was sent off for a horrific challenge on Eduardo. This was the day when Arsenal's season started to unravel and Arsenal ended up finishing third after leading the Premier League for almost 2/3 of the season.</p>
              <p>Now: <span style="color: #ff0000;">27/02/2010 </span><span style="color: #000000;">Stoke 1-3 Arsenal-Again, Ryan Shawcross get sent off for a horrific tackle on Aaron Ramsey, leaving Shawcross in tears.</span></p>
              <p>The date in which they suffered their injuries is so similar lol... Anyway I do wish Aaron Ramsey a speedy recovery. It's a shame because Ramsey is a possible future star for Arsenal, and it would be a shame if Ramsey would not be able to get back to his current level again, much like what we see for Eduardo after the injury. Eduardo was never the same player again after the injury; before that he was superb.</p>

              <p>From what I can see, I don't think Shawcross meant any real malice..... it was really more of bad timing and momentum. And he was truly shattered when he learnt that he had badly injured Ramsey.</p>
              <p>That said, a straight red card for Shawcross was the only possible outcome. What he should do now is to personally visit Ramsey in hospital to apologize.</p>

              <p>its seems that ramsey's foot is still " attached" only because of the sock that he is wearing, otherwise, it might just "dropped off"...</p>
              <p>It was a bad challenge, the moment he went down he signalled to the bench. Damn, not ramsey!!!!</p>
              <p>Now with diaby out, that joker denilson would be playing... shit.. arsenal needs abou diaby back as soon as possible to partner song in midfield. We need the best players for that last 10 games!!!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, ramsey broke his leg at stoke city yesterday, 2 years ago it was eduardo that broke his leg at birmingham, and 4 years ago it was abou diaby's leg at sunderland.</p>
              <p>Therefore every 2 years, an arsenal player seems to have their legs broken by some mediocre team like those mention.</p>
              <p>Hopefully arsenal can last the distance esp with chelsea dropping points...</p>

              <p>Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross insists there
              was "absolutely no malice" in the challenge on Aaron Ramsey which led
              to the Arsenal player suffering a badly broken leg during the Barclays
              Premier League clash at the Britannia Stadium today.</p>
              <p>The 19-year-old Wales midfielder was taken to hospital after a
              tackle by Shawcross, who was later called up to the England squad to
              play Egypt next week, as the Gunners came from behind to win 3-1.</p>
              <p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was enraged by the tackle, which
              he described as "horrendous", but in a statement issued by Shawcross,
              the player is adamant there was no intent.</p>
              <p>The statement read: "There was absolutely no malice in the challenge.</p>
              <p>"I would never, ever go out to hurt a fellow professional.</p>
              <p>"I am deeply upset that Aaron has suffered such a bad injury and my thoughts are with him.</p>
              <p>"I would like to send him my best wishes too for a speedy recovery."</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old's sentiments were echoed by his club, who
              added in the statement: "Stoke City would like to send their best
              wishes to Aaron Ramsey and Arsenal Football Club."</p>
              <p>They added: "The club do, however, wish to make it quite clear
              that there was absolutely no malice in the challenge from Ryan
              Shawcross which caused the injury."</p>
              <p>Potters manager Tony Pulis added: "On behalf of everyone at
              Stoke City, we would like to express our deepest sympathy to Aaron and
              Arsenal at what has happened today.</p>
              <p>"Our thoughts are with him and his family. We hope he makes a
              speedy recovery and everyone here wishes to see him back on the
              football field as soon as possible."</p>
              <p>Pulis also defended Shawcross, adding: "Ryan Shawcross has no bad blood in him whatsoever.</p>
              <p>"There is no way in a million years he would ever go out and try and hurt someone.</p>
              <p>"The lad was heartbroken at what has happened, you could see as
              he came off the pitch that he was in tears and he feels devastated that
              Aaron has been so badly injured."</p>

              <p>Yeah... looking at the replay, it was more of negligence than malice. It was due more to bad timing and momentum, and not an all-out strike to hurt Ramsey....</p>
              <p>That said, Shawcross deserved the straight red card. He also deserves an FA inquiry leading to a tribunal and a ban, because negligent tackles have been known to end careers.</p>
              <p>What Shawcross should really do right now is to visit Ramsey in hospital. Really.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>dun think there was anything wrong with the challenge except that it came at a very fast momentum and Shawcross right foot must have caught Aaron's right shin at a very fast speed. If Shawcross came in with studs showing, it has to be more than just a STRONG tackle, he should be taken to task, but from replays, it seems to be just a strong tackle, nothing close to the malicious tackles of Matty taylor on Eduardo or the infamous Roy Keane's tackle which was knee high with studs showing. Of cos, it is unfortunate that Aaron broke his leg but to be fair to shawcross, he too is a young talent that needs to get over this incident and fulfil his potential and not let this incident play in his mind.</p></div>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> have confirmed midfielder Aaron Ramsey will miss the rest of the season
              after suffering fractures to the tibia and fibula of his right leg.</p>
              <p>The 19-year-old Wales midfielder was injured in a horror tackle from Stoke midfielder Ryan Shawcross in Saturday's 3-1 Barclays <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> victory at the Britannia Stadium.</p>
              <p>A club statement read: "During yesterday's match against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Stoke City</span></abbr>, Aaron Ramsey sustained fractures to the tibia and fibula in his right leg. Yesterday evening he underwent surgery.</p>
              <p>"The operation successfully reduced the fractures and whilst it is too
              soon to state an exact timescale for recovery, Aaron will certainly
              miss the remainder of this season.</p>
              <p>"Our thoughts are with Aaron at this time and everyone at the
              club wishes him all the best in making as speedy a return to action as
              possible."</p>
              <p>Ramsey was rushed to a local hospital after the incident in the
              65th minute of the game and was expected to be transferred to London
              today.</p>

              <p>after much pondering i think that soccer players legs are bound to get broken once in a while. It is inevitable. If you soccer fans want to prevent this accidents... the only way is to introduce speed limit for soccer players. THat is the only way.</p>
              <p>As for why arsenal seems to kanna leg broken, i think that it is due to people bias perception. Arsenal do not get players leg broken much more than others. If you want to talk about suay players, i would say it is ex liverpool player who kanna his leg broken twice. I think his name is cilic (C say), something like that.</p>
              <p>There bound to have some teams who has , by chance, got more players break their leg more times than other. I am quite disgusted by breaking leg also, but it seems like broken leg can still fully recover. It may end his soccer career but on the bigger scheme of things, he can always do other things.</p>
              <p>I repeat my main point, there are many vicious and pathetic, brainless challenge made by soocer players everywhere in the world which could have caused broken legs, but mostly, it did not happen. However, considering that there are so many tackling done each day, there is surely bound to be broken leg one.</p>
              <p>If fans do not want to see broken legs, then i think you all should challenge football body to change the FUCKING soccer rules. Personally, i would not want to satisfy my personal excitment in exchange to see someone in the danger of facing a broken leg. It is too cruel , so i would hope that soccer introduce speed limit, for the sake of protecting the safety of players...</p>
              <p>Please, dun be so sadistic and money minded. However, i think the soccer players themselves would object to my suggestion maybe because they want to make big bucks also. In that case, i have no choice.</p>

              <p>notice is mostly arsenal ppl who suffer broken legs. probably is due to the young age of arsenal players. all the bones so brittle. also probably drink too much booze and not enough milk.</p>
              <p>cant be just coincidence. fabregas, v persie also suffered long term injuries this season.</p>
              <p>worst thing is even if ramsey can salvage something his career cld still be over like edurado. even after a broken ankle heals nothing is the same again.</p>
              <p>some people after recovering from fractures or breaks when they play soccer they hear knocking sounds in their legs. like the bones still abit loose, it will never go back to normal. they will never play the same again.</p>
              <p>same goes for torn ligaments. when it heals which is years you still feel it becomes more spongey</p>
