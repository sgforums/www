              <h1 class="titlestory">Arsenal’s Bendtner: We will win the title for Ramsey</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> will go and win the title for injured Aaron Ramsery according to striker Nicklas Bendtner.</p>
              <p>After the young Welshman’s leg was injured in a horrific incident
              involving Stoke’s Ryan Shawcross, Bendtner said the club would now
              strive to clinch the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> title for their injured youngster.</p>
              <p>He also said the challenge by Shawcross was ‘out of control’.</p>
              <p>“To be honest, I don’t care about my goal and the win. Aaron is one of
              my best friends and all my thoughts go to him. It is a totally
              horrifying injury,” the Dane said.</p>
              <p>“I was standing right next to Aaron, when it happened, and
              immediately there was no doubt at all, that he broke his leg. It was a
              terrible, totally mad tackle from Ryan Shawcross, and he is really
              smashing hard into Aaron.</p>
              <p>“I don’t believe, that anybody would try to intentionally to
              make an injury on another player, a fellow professional, but the way he
              is going into the tackle is out of control, and that doesn’t belong
              anywhere.</p>
              <p>“As far as I saw on the pitch, all the players from both teams
              were shocked, and so was I, because everyone could see, how awful it
              was. Thomas (Sorensen) came up to me, and we were both really shocked.</p>
              <p>“Afterwards we were told, that Aaron will be out for at least
              6-9 months, and I feel, that it is just so sad for him. Aaron is so
              young.</p>
              <p>“I think about, how bad I felt, when I was out for three months with my groin injury, and this is just so much worse for Aaron.</p>
              <p>“But now we will go and win the title for Aaron.”</p>

High chance that the kid would never be the same again and would fear challenges &amp; tackles coming in next time if he were to recover fully. Then again, if he is strong mentally, hopefully he would come back stronger than before. But what a waste of talent... =(</p></div>

              well above the ankle. Medics hope he will play again in between six to
