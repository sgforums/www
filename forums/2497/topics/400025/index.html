              <h1>James Milner hints at Manchester City move by declaring: 'I don't 
              know if I'll be at Aston Villa next season'<br></h1>

              </div>
              <p>James Milner moved closer to joining Manchester
               City last night
              after declaring he was uncertain of his future at Aston
               Villa and
              driven by a desire to win trophies.</p>
              <p>On a day when Villa rejected a £20million bid for Milner from
              big-spending City, the 24-year-old declined the invitation to commit
              his future to his current club.</p>
              <p>Asked if he would still be a Villa player next season, he said: ‘I
              don’t know.’ He then gave further encouragement to City — believed to
              be preparing an increased offer — when he said his chief ambition was
              to end his career with a room full of silverware.</p>

              England squad " width="468" height="319">

              </div>
              <p>‘That’s what I’m in football to do,’ he said. ‘To win trophies.
              That’s my No 1 aim for club and country. When I finish my career, I
              want to be able to go into my trophy room and see winner’s medals. I
              want to be as successful as I can be. We came close twice with Villa
              this season.’</p>
              <p>Villa are willing to bring forward talks with Milner over a
              potential new contract, in a bid to ward off City’s interest. Owner
              Randy Lerner insisted only last week that the club would wait until
              after the World Cup in South Africa before opening negotiations. </p>

              <p>But now they are prepared to speak to the midfielder before he jets 
              off with England.</p>
              <p>Villa have a two-day window of opportunity after England’s friendly
              in Graz against Japan on May 30 in which to discuss an improved deal.</p>
              <p>However, speaking at England’s training camp in Austria, Milner said
              the situation might not be resolved until after the World Cup.</p>

              </div>
              <p>‘I was concentrating on Villa and I am now concentrating on
              England,’ he said. ‘I’m here to stake as good a claim as I can to get
              on the plane to the World Cup.</p>
              <p>‘When I finished the season at 
              Villa, I said we’d discuss it after
              the World Cup. I have enjoyed my time at Villa. It’s a great club to be
              at. We are moving forward in the right direction. We’ve had a good
              season. We finished with a higher points total than last year in the
              League.’</p>
              <p>City midfielder Gareth Barry, meanwhile, insists 
              treatment on his
              ankle is going well and he is hopeful of making the cut for South
              Africa.</p>
              <p>Barry said: ‘I’ve been having regular sessions with the medical
              staff at Carrington and they are pleased with how things are going.</p>
              <p>‘I’m feeling positive still and the medical staff are being brilliant
               — they are doing everything they can to help me.’</p>
