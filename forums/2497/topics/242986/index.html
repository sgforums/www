Aston Villa skipper Barry, 26, was excluded from the Three Lions party for the upcoming Euro 2008 Group E qualifiers with Israel and Andorra. And his club boss OÂ’Neill fears national coach McClaren is suffering from Â‘big-clubÂ’ syndrome.<br><br>OÂ’Neill said: Â“You have to ask Â‘If Gareth was playing for Manchester United would that make any difference?Â’ Â“I donÂ’t know the answer. All I know is heÂ’s had a fantastic season for Villa and IÂ’m not sure what else he could have done. Â“Could he have played any better for anyone else? Again, I canÂ’t answer that question. Â“But what I would say is that it wouldÂ’ve been exceptionally difficult for him to have done so.Â”<br><br>OÂ’Neill is even more stunned at BarryÂ’s snub, considering both our first-choice left-backs Â— Ashley Cole (suspended) and Wayne Bridge (injured) will miss out against Israel. The Villa boss added: Â“Perhaps it should instil a greater desire for Aston Villa as a football club to improve our position in the Premiership and be classed as a really good team. Â“The fact of the matter at the moment is that we are not. The reality is weÂ’re a really good club but weÂ’re not a great side. Â“And weÂ’ve not been a great side for a considerable time.<br><br>OÂ’NeillÂ’s main fear is the negative effect McClarenÂ’s brush-off could have on his versatile captain ahead of tomorrowÂ’s home Premiership clash with Liverpool. He added: Â“ItÂ’s very disappointing for him, especially after being brought back into the squad for the last game.<br><br>Â“I assume he was recalled for how well he had been playing for Aston Villa Â— but that form has continued. Â“So if you are asking me Â‘WhatÂ’s changed?Â’ youÂ’re asking the wrong person, because I have no idea. Â“HeÂ’s had a fantastic season and puts his heart and soul into every game, every week.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s why heÂ’ll be very disappointed and frustrated at the moment.Â”<br><br></div>
