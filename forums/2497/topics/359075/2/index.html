              <p>Oh relax mate. I wont be celebrating if MU only took home the worthless cup...but the fact is that they are still in the running for the double! That's an achievement. It's not a irony that Liverpool beat the likes of MU and Chelski but are still second... its just that Pool didn't perform consistently against the weaker teams. Maybe when you are balancing so many leagues and competitions, you have to sacrifice the big games and win the small ones. At the end of the day, its the strategies and trophies that count.</p>
              <p>Pool still has a great chance, but if MU wins it at the end - you can't say they didn't deserve it. They were just the best team over 38 games, even if Pool was the better team over the two games against MU and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>If Pool were such giant killers in one-off games, then surely they would have been in the UCL final? I mean, you can't explain away these things.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, manutd is pretty strong this season and are as strong as last season. Its obvious that they got tired after a while.</p>

              <p>They probably would have beaten everton if there werent so many matches. Fatigue has taken its toll on the players and manutd players probably feel fa cup is not as impt...</p>

              <p>Dude, MU are already out of the FA cup.</p>
              <p>They only have BPL games and the champions league final which will be after the BPL has concluded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm neither a MU nor liverpool fan, but i have to be honest that pool has performed way above expectation this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You really got to take your hat off to Benitez for transforming a team that is usually out of title contention by Xmas to become genuine title contenders this season. He is the man that pool need to hang on for their lives if they're going to repeat this 'success' next season, not Gerard or Torres. Benitez and his crew has done wonders to turn formerly underrated and underperforming players like Kuyt, Riera and Benayoun into match winners. He is the man. Period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regardless of whether pool wins anything this season, he's got to be the PFA manager of the year.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry if the above comment is slightly out of point.</p>

              <p>I have to agree. Benitez is the real special one. Of course he is only human.</p>
              <p>Liverpool has a remarkable season. If manutd manage to slip in a few more games, liverpool would have been champions this season.</p>
