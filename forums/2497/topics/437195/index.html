              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA hit Liverpool with another last-ditch raid as they landed Raul Meireles for £12million.</h2>
              <p>The move echoed the Blues' swoop for Fernando Torres just minutes before the close of the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>Portuguese midfielder Meireles slammed in a written transfer request yesterday evening, opening the door for Chelsea to make their move.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old star briefly played under Blues boss Andre Villas-Boas at Porto.</p>
              <p>The Stamford Bridge club had hoped Meireles, who signed a four-year deal, would be joined by left-back Alvaro Pereira.</p>
              <p>But Chelsea were unable to reach an agreement with Porto before the 11pm deadline.</p>
              <p>Chelsea reportedly had a bid rejected for Meireles yesterday. But, having seen numerous mega-money offers turned down for Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric, they appeared to meet Liverpool's asking price.</p>
              <p>Meireles was named the PFA Fans' Player of the Year after an impressive maiden season at Anfield last term but was deemed surplus to requirements by manager Kenny Dalglish.</p>

              <p>Meireles was bought by Roy and well used by Ken.</p>
              <p>But, Raul know the direction of Ken in building a all british team for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>So, his chances to play will be limited.</p>
              <p>He is a good player to unlock stubborn defence and his situation awareness to create goal and assist is excellent.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have only him for this creative streak and the approach of the rest of the players are more direct.</p>
              <p>Hope he will not end up like Benny in warming the bench.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A shock written transfer request submitted in the final hour before Wednesday night's deadline paved the way for the Portugal midfielder to make the switch to Stamford Bridge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It also brought criticism from sections of the Liverpool support, but 28-year-old Meireles has defended his conduct and stressed the move was not motivated by money.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'These are things that happen in football. I can only say good things about Liverpool. It was a fantastic year,' Meireles told Radio e Televisao de Portugal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'People think I am a Judas and that it was because of the money. It was not because of that. I will explain it later. Things are still fresh.'<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Meireles had fallen down the pecking order at Anfield after manager Kenny Dalglish's summer recruitment drive saw Charlie Adam and Jordan Henderson added at great expense to an already-congested central midfield area.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It all happened very fast,' he continued. 'I am not the only one to blame for my exit from Liverpool, but I will never stop loving the club and I have great friends there.</span></p>

              <p>The Brazilian himself only recently arrived at the club, and he believes the arrival of Meireles will have a big impact on the team.</p>
              <p>“We have made good signings and I think Raul Meireles can be a big player for us,” the defender told reporters.</p>
              <p>“We played against each other in Portugal and he was difficult to stop. It is sensational he can increase our level on the pitch.</p>
              <p>“Every day we are getting better and I bet we will have success this season.”</p>
              <p>Meireles joins a Portuguese-speaking legion of players and staff at Stamford Bridge, led by new boss Andre Villas-Boas.</p>
              <p>“It is easy when the manager also speaks my language," David Luiz continued.</p>
              <p>“During training sometimes he speaks Portuguese to the Portuguese speakers and it's easier to understand. Maybe we could use it as a secret tactic in matches.”</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old may only be nine years his manager’s junior, but he is sure Villas-Boas has what it takes succeed.</p>
              <p>“Villas-Boas deserves to be in charge at Chelsea and I am convinced he will succeed in England,<em>"</em> he said.</p>
              <p>“Every coach has a different style of work. Andre is different to [Carlo] Ancelotti and I am hoping for more success than last season.”</p>

              <p>The Portugal midfielder completed a £12million switch to Chelsea minutes before the transfer window shut last week, reuniting him with former Porto boss Andre Villas-Boas.</p>
              <p>There were eerie similarities with Fernando Torres' January transfer between the clubs, with Liverpool reporting in both cases that a transfer request had been received.</p>
              <p>That is normally read as a sign that a player is trying to force a move.</p>
              <p>But Meireles, 28, said: "When I was in Porto, I knew I wanted to go and the club wanted to sell me — and I made the right choice last year to come to Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"This year, though, was different because I knew I didn't want to go.</p>
              <p>"I felt Liverpool's new owners didn't want to sell me but when I knew that Chelsea and Andre wanted me, it convinced me."</p>

              <p>Oh well, at least it's working out well for him now over at Chelsea... He has became a creative spark that they were lacking previously... He has made the missing out on Modric not so bad...</p>
              <p>His pass to Daniel Sturridge yesterday was just a classic man... A through ball cut out the whole Sunderland defence for Sturridge to score the winner... These 2 players earned Chelsea the 3 points or it could have ended in a draw...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Raul Meireles has accused Liverpool of a broken promise and claimed he was forced to submit a transfer request once they had decided to sell him to Chelsea.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Meireles completed his £12million move to Stamford Bridge in the final minutes of transfer deadline day almost two weeks ago, a switch that angered many Reds supporters.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 28-year-old revealed upon signing for Chelsea that he had never wanted to leave Anfield and that he would eventually explain why he had done so.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He attempted to set the record straight this afternoon after being officially unveiled as a Blues player, appearing to give credence that he was promised a 100 per cent pay rise at Liverpool if he impressed during what was his debut season.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'All I have to say is that I had one promise at Liverpool which wasn't fulfilled,' said the midfielder, who certainly lived up to his side of the bargain after joining the Reds from Porto.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'It's not the only thing to blame. But that's why the Liverpool fans are unsure why I left.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He added: 'Liverpool asked me to hand in a transfer request, so that's normal.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Meireles admitted he was stunned to discover he had been made available for transfer.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I was aware that Liverpool wanted to sell me in the summer, which was a bit surprising to me,' said Meireles, who was reluctant to discuss his relationship with Reds boss Kenny Dalglish.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'There's no point touching this subject any more.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I was a bit surprised, but now I'm just concentrating on my present and future, and that's with Chelsea.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Indeed, Meireles was delighted to have ended up at Stamford Bridge.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'When Chelsea showed interest, it was like a golden opportunity,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I'm here now, it's a new adventure, and I want to do well here.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Meireles' move reunited him with Andre Villas-Boas, who he worked under during pre-season a year ago before joining Liverpool.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He said: 'I worked under Andre for one month at Porto, so I felt that there's the same mentality here as there was at Porto - the desire to win competitions and trophies. With Andre, we can do that.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'In one month, it was enough to see how he works and his desire to win things. So it wasn't hard to make the decision to come to Chelsea.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Meireles made an instant impact on his Chelsea debut on Saturday, a brilliant through ball setting up Daniel Sturridge's outrageous backheeled goal at Sunderland.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Portugal international Meireles was coy on whether his year in England had made him better prepared for the rigours of a Barclays Premier League title challenge.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I had one year to adapt to the Premier League, but it's two different clubs and different styles,' said Meireles, who was hoping to make his Champions League bow for Chelsea in tomorrow night's Group E opener against Bayer Leverkusen.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'We chase different competitions, and I just hope I can achieve things here at Chelsea.'</span></p>
