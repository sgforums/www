              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Guus Hiddink is contemplating a return to Chelsea in move that could unsettle new boss Andre Villa-Boas after the one-time FA Cup winning Blues manager revealed he would like to come back to England.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Dutchman has had his contract terminated by the Turkish Football Federation after he failed to guide Turkey to a play-off win over Croatia, missing out on qualification for next summer's European Championship.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Turkey held Slaven Bilic's side to a 0-0 draw in Zagreb on Tuesday night but their 3-0 defeat at home in Istanbul last Friday proved costly - particularly for Hiddink.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A statement on the official TFF website read: 'Following the meeting between Turkish Football Federation Executive Committee and Turkey head coach Guus Hiddink, the Dutch coach's contract has been terminated by mutual consent.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'We would like to thank Mr Guus Hiddink for his services during his working period, and wish him all the best in his future career.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 65-year-old had been linked with return to his homeland Holland in a director of football capacity at Ajax before the Amsterdam giants turned to Louis van Gaal. But it is a similar role at Stamford Bridge that Hiddink could turn to instead.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hiddink insists he will not rush his decision but hinted a reunion with the likes of John Terry and Frank Lampard could be on the cards.</span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I’ve not made up my mind about the future yet,' he said. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I’m going to take some time off and then we will see what happens, but I had a wonderful time in England.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'It was great at Chelsea, a terrific time, but that doesn’t mean I am ready to start tomorrow. I need some time to reflect.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hiddink was popular figure at Chelsea when he took over from Luiz Felipe Scolari on a caretaker basis in 2009 and guided the club to FA Cup glory.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The players did not want him to leave before he opted to resume his full-time role at the time with Russia and it is understood he remains a close friend and confidant to owner Roman Abramovich.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>His possible return, however, could put pressure on young Portuguese boss Villas-Boas who has seen his side lose three league games so far this season, putting them nine points behind leaders Manchester City in fourth place.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I’m not ready to retire, I like to be involved with a team on a daily basis,' Hiddink added.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'But maybe I am ready to step out of the limelight a little bit, away from the cameras. Hopefully I will still be involved but perhaps it will be as an adviser or a consultant.'</span></p>

              <p>chelsea decision making damn is incoherent.</p>
              <p>they should have appointed him as manager after that ex portugal coach was sacked, offer to pay to terminate contract with Russia national team and gave him the job permanently. if chelsea results stilll lousy by Jan, expect a sack from Roman and then the job will be given to Hiddink. by then chelsea will be out of the title race, maybe got chance to win fa cup or CL, just as he won them the fa cup that year and nearly qualify for CL finals if not for last min equaliser by Barcelona that knocked  them out.</p>
