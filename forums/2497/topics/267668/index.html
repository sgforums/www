            <div class='col-md body'>Premiership - Boulahrouz joins Sevilla on loan<br><br>Chelsea have agreed to a loan deal for Khalid Boulahrouz to join Sevilla for one year.<br><br>The 25-year-old Holland defender was brought to Stamford Bridge last summer for around Â£7million from Hamburg but has been out of favour and made just four appearances after the turn of the year.<br><br>While Chelsea's squad travelled to America at the start of the week as they step up their pre-season preparations, Boulahrouz stayed behind while negotiations continued with the La Liga club who have won the UEFA Cup in the past two years.<br><br>"Chelsea and Sevilla have reached an agreement for the one-year loan," read a statement from the Premier League club.<br><br>Boulahrouz was expected to provide cover across the Chelsea defence but manager Jose Mourinho often fielded Geremi or Lassana Diarra, both midfielders by trade, at right-back.<br><br>Mourinho also has Glen Johnson returning from last season's loan at Portsmouth to bolster numbers in defence, while Tal Ben Haim has also arrived and Alex could join from PSV Eindhoven before the start of the campaign.<br><br>In Ben Haim, Mourinho feels he has a versatile defender who could "save his skin" over the coming season.<br><br>Injuries harmed the Blues as they surrendered the Premier League to Manchester United last season, and Israel international Ben Haim will offer extra cover next term after moving from Bolton on a free transfer.<br><br>"We tried to have him last January because we were in big trouble at the time but it was not possible," said Mourinho.<br><br>"He was an important player for Bolton and they wanted to keep him until the end of the season.<br><br>"But now we have him and we have him because we like him. He's a good central defender but also a good multi-functional defender.<br><br>"He can play right-back and left-back in case we have the need and during the season, so we're very happy to have him.<br><br>"I'm sure about his qualities but after three training sessions together it's even easier to know the player and after six hours training together I like him even more."<br><br>Mourinho believes his squad is in better shape than a year ago, with only Michael Ballack staying in London to recover from surgery and new signing Claudio Pizarro, of Peru, being given extra time off following the Copa America.<br><br>"Last year was a disaster because we started the season with half a team," he said. "And after that, every two to three days, some players arrived depending on their performance at the World Cup.<br><br>"We had players who were out in the last 16, out in the quarter-finals and then finally the Portuguese and the French guys because they had reached the semi-final stage. It was a disaster.<br><br>"This season we are starting with everybody. Only Pizarro is not here and Ballack with injury.<br><br>"Everybody here is working very hard, the motivation is there. Everyone is training like they play, almost, with their attitude, intensity, concentration and strength. The training is becoming very real."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think Seville does not want to pay the price Chelski is asking.  Obviously Chelski is desperate to offload him for one reason or another and rather than not being able to sell him and incur his salary - the nxt best alternative will be to loan him out with option for Seville to buy him after one season.<br><br></div>
