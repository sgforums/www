              <p><strong>Milan are ready to make a January swoop for underfire Arsenal defender William Gallas. The Frenchman's recent troubles after his sensational claims regarding the club have worsened and losing the captaincy has led to rife speculation that he wants nothing to do with the club.<br></strong><br><em>Gazzetta Dello Sport</em> claims the former Olympique Marseille man is on the brink and Milan are ready to rescue him and his stuttering career.<br><br>Arsene Wenger has stated the player still has a future at the Emirates but that may not be for too much longer if the Italians move and shake.<br><br>Gallas earns around €4 million at the north London club and his contract runs until 2011. The Rossoneri would have no problem in meeting the players wage demands and their good relationship with Arsenal following the deals for Mathieu Flamini and Philippe Senderos could get the ball rolling.<br><br>A team of Milan officials have been sent to London and it is believed they are already locked in talks to try and speed up the deal.<br><br>The Italian club need a strong defender at the back. The growing uncertainty with Alessandro Nesta's injury has caused some concern, but on Monday club vice president Adriano Galliani denied that any player would come in or go out during the winter transfer window.<br><br>"There will be no transfers, incoming or outgoing," insisted Galliani. Nevertheless, sporting director Ariedo Braida is trying to find a way so  Gallas jumps ship and follow his former teammates to San Siro.</p>

              <h2>WENGER: WITCH-HUNT AGAINST GALLAS</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline">
              <div><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/08/11/240/William-Gallas-Arsenal-Dynamo-Kiev-Champions-_1534482.jpg" border="0" alt="Gallas - axed as Arsenal captain."></div>
              </div>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has claimed that William Gallas was the subject of a "witch hunt" having axed the Frenchman as Arsenal captain last week.</strong></p>
              <p>Gallas was stripped of the armband on Friday in the wake of his outspoken attack - made to French journalists ahead of the publication of his autobiography - against his team-mates at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>Speaking after the 1-0 win over Dynamo Kiev in which Cesc Fabregas captained the Gunners for the first time, Wenger paid tribute to Gallas after his return to the starting line-up and blamed outside influences for his demise.</p>
              <p>"It was based neither on the man himself nor his quality as a player but more on his blunder," Wenger reportedly told French television station Canal+, for whom he works on a part-time basis as a pundit.</p>
              <p>"It was a witch-hunt and everything that he did, even when it was good, was bad.</p>
              <p>"In these conditions, the player had no chance. He didn't intend to be malicious but it put his team under enormous pressure. He will remain himself and it can free him as a player if there is less pressure."</p>
              <p>According to Wenger, Gallas proved his commitment to the Arsenal cause in Tuesday night's win that guarantees the Gunners a place in the next round.</p>
              <p>He said: "You could see that he was completely committed at the back and it was not an easy performance for the defence. Overall I feel he did well.</p>
              <p>"The crowd responded very well and that means that they acknowledge that he was a committed captain. I was very happy that the crowd responded in a positive way to him."</p>

              <p>gallas seem like different player at arsenal compare to chelsea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i believe he need a tall defender to partner him in defence.because toure, gallas, djourou are too similar and lack authority for high ball clearance.</p>

Nevertheless, sporting director Ariedo Braida is trying to find a way so  Gallas jumps ship and follow his former teammates to San Siro.</p>

              <h2>WENGER: WITCH-HUNT AGAINST GALLAS</h2>
              <div>
              <div><img src="http://images.football365.com/08/11/240/William-Gallas-Arsenal-Dynamo-Kiev-Champions-_1534482.jpg" alt="Gallas - axed as Arsenal captain."></div>
              </div>
              <div>
              <p><span><strong>Arsene Wenger has claimed that William Gallas was the subject of a "witch hunt" having axed the Frenchman as Arsenal captain last week.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Gallas was stripped of the armband on Friday in the wake of his outspoken attack - made to French journalists ahead of the publication of his autobiography - against his team-mates at the Emirates.</p>
              <p>Speaking after the 1-0 win over Dynamo Kiev in which Cesc Fabregas captained the Gunners for the first time, Wenger paid tribute to Gallas after his return to the starting line-up and blamed outside influences for his demise.</p>
              <p>"It was based neither on the man himself nor his quality as a player but more on his blunder," Wenger reportedly told French television station Canal+, for whom he works on a part-time basis as a pundit.</p>
              <p>"It was a witch-hunt and everything that he did, even when it was good, was bad.</p>
              <p>"In these conditions, the player had no chance. He didn't intend to be malicious but it put his team under enormous pressure. He will remain himself and it can free him as a player if there is less pressure."</p>
              <p>According to Wenger, Gallas proved his commitment to the Arsenal cause in Tuesday night's win that guarantees the Gunners a place in the next round.</p>
              <p>He said: "You could see that he was completely committed at the back and it was not an easy performance for the defence. Overall I feel he did well.</p>
              <p>"The crowd responded very well and that means that they acknowledge that he was a committed captain. I was very happy that the crowd responded in a positive way to him."</p>
