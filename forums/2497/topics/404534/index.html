              <p>Let's talk about some of the managers you've played for at World Cups for England. You've played for a few managers.</p>
              <p><strong>Did the method in which they prepared for the opposition change significantly? </strong></p>
              <p>DB:
              As everyone knows, each manager's different and their preparation is
              different for games. Some are more relaxed, some are more intense, some
              are more excitable. So the managers I've played under for the World
              Cups - everyone's been an experience because each one's been different
              and I liked all of them, because sometimes it's good to have that
              relaxed approach to a game because it relaxes the team. But then
              sometimes it's great to have a really intense manager that wants your
              focus, wants you concentrating and that works for the team.</p>
              <p><strong>Did you have many meetings?  And how did different managers debrief you on the opposition and their strengths and weaknesses?</strong></p>
              <p>DB:
              Once you reach a certain level - especially when you're playing for
              your country and you're playing for some of the top teams in Europe -
              meetings are a necessity because it's so important to be prepared for
              the players that you're playing against because they're such great
              players, and the teams that you're playing against because they're such
              difficult teams. So preparation has become a huge thing now in
              football. With England, we'll always have two or three meetings during
              the week.  Sometimes less, sometimes - more likely - it's more, because
              it's important to go through everything, whether watching what we've
              done in training during the week, or whether it's the day before the
              game, or whether it's the day of the game.  There are always quite a
              few meetings leading up to the game. Players are used to that, players
              don't have problems with that, players are ready for the meetings and
              appreciate the knowledge of the coaching staff and manager.</p>

              <p><strong id="yui-tmp-3">How did the team talks of the different managers vary?</strong></p>
              <p>DB:
              When you come away with a national team, obviously it's a manager that
              you don't work with day in and day out, so there's a lot of passion
              there. There are managers that are sometimes more relaxed than others,
              but each one's been amazing.</p>
              <p><strong>Can you tell us about some of the motivational methods?</strong></p>
              <p id="yui-tmp-4">DB:
              Motivation for players these days, and for players that are playing for
              their country, and players that are playing in World Cups - they don't
              need much motivating because you're playing at the top level, you're
              playing at the biggest station in the world and in sport. But managers
              are well aware that, sometimes, they need to motivate the players. Some
              do it by shouting, some do it by taking the personal approach by
              talking to players - individuals - and giving them confidence. I've
              found either works for me. Sometimes you like to be shouted at, it gets
              you going, and sometimes you like an arm around you and to be told
              you're doing well.</p>
              <p><strong id="yui-tmp-6">Can you tell us what happens at half-time? 
              How much information can you take in, or is it basically physical
              recovery at that point?</strong></p>
              <p>DB: I think players these days,
              they don't need much physical recovering because they look after
              themselves so well, and they're prepared for the game. You get your
              drink in; you get your water in, and what else individuals need. The
              information that's obviously told to you by the manager, you have to
              listen to it and you have to take it in because things might be going
              wrong in the first half and you've seen how games can change in one
              minute or 30 seconds. So that information at half-time is so important.</p>
              <p><strong>When you were a captain, did you try to assist the manager in sort of motivating at half-time as well?</strong></p>
              <p>DB:
              I was lucky as captain because we had a lot inspirational people and
              players in the team and in the squad, so my approach as a captain has
              been to talk to players. Every now and again I was shouting on the
              field, but in the changing room we had a lot of motivated players and
              that was good for me. It's always important to have that in a team.</p>
