              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Joe Cole is not the type of player to intentionally hurt an opponent - that’s why he had never been sent off before yesterday.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">However, his challenge on Laurent Koscielny was made at pace, which endangered the safety of the Arsenal centre half, so a red card was the right decision.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Unusually, this tackle did not look so bad when shown in slow motion. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Observers might have thought Martin Atkinson was influenced by the Arsenal crowd - who have seen Eduardo and Aaron Ramsey have legs broken by reckless tackles.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The extent of a player’s injury should not affect a referee’s judgment and Atkinson wisely showed his card before Koscielny was carried off.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Thankfully, the Arsenal man returned, and Cole was left to reflect on a three-match ban. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Koscielny’s sending-off, on the other hand, was harsh. It is questionable whether it was even deliberate handball - let alone a booking.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Yellow cards are only supposed to be given for deliberate handballs which break down attacking moves.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has seemingly suggested that Laurent Koscielny over-reacted to Joe Cole's tackle during Sunday's 1-1 draw with Arsenal and blamed the debutant's dismissal on the reaction of the away fans to his lunge.</strong> </p>
              <p>After being carried off on a stretcher following Cole's challenge, Koscielny returned to the fray at the start of the second half - with his recovery prompting Gerrard to tell <em>Match of the Day Two</em>: </p>
              <p>"When you see the player's reaction after the tackle you think that might be the end of his game but he sprinted back onto the pitch for the second half - but there you go." </p>
              <p>Having described Cole as "a bit unlucky to get a red card" to Liverpool's official website, who themselves claim that 'most observers throught the straight red was harsh', Gerrard also went on to observe: </p>
              <p>"A yellow would have been sensible. But if you make those tackles in front of the away supporters, it influences the referee and that's what happened." </p>
              <p>Manager Roy Hodgson has confirmed that the club are considering making an appeal against Cole's sending off. </p>
              <p>"I have seen the TV replays and they suggest Joe is a little bit unlucky," Hodgson declared. "He didn't dive at the player; he dived in front of the ball. Their player got hit in the leg. We are pleased to see it wasn't a serious injury to him because he was able to come out and play in the second half. </p>
              <p>"He will be a big loss if he is suspended and maybe we will try and see if there is some way for the referee to have a look at it again, but I don't want to make a frivolous appeal, that's for sure. Joe has a great disciplinary record. He has never been sent off before and had only a few yellow cards. Anyone who watches Joe play knows he is not the sort of guy who goes in for bloodcurdling tackles."</p>
