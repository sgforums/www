              <p><strong>LONDON - Brief reports of Premier League
              matches played at the weekend:</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong> Played Sunday:</strong></p>
              <p><strong> TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR 0 ARSENAL 0</strong></p>
              <p>A draw did little for either side's ambitions although
              Arsenal will be happier after playing for nearly an hour with 10
              men after Emmanuel Eboue was sent off.</p>
              <p>Eboue, who had a goal disallowed, was shown a first yellow
              card for dissent and then kicked out at Luca Modric for his
              second. Modric should have won the game game for Spurs in
              stoppage time when he went through on goal but could not beat
              Manuel Almunia. Robbie Keane also headed a good chance over on
              his return to struggling Tottenham.</p>
              <p><strong>WEST HAM UNITED 0 MANCHESTER UNITED 1</strong></p>
              <p>Veteran winger Ryan Giggs sent United back to the top of the
              table with a classy 61st-minute goal as the champions racked up
              an eighth successive league win.</p>
              <p>United were rock-solid at the back without posing much
              threat up front but Giggs broke the deadlock when he weaved past
              two West Ham players and fired a low shot past Robert Green.</p>
              <p>Carlton Cole wasted West Ham's best chance as they lost for
              the first time this year.</p>
              <p><strong>Played on Saturday:</strong></p>
              <p><strong> BLACKBURN ROVERS 0 ASTON VILLA 2</strong></p>
              <p>James Milner put Villa on the road to a club record seventh
              successive away league victory with a tremendous angled shot
              after 27 minutes.</p>
              <p>Villa missed a host of chances to increase their lead and
              were nearly made to pay when Roque Santa Cruz swivelled late on
              and lashed a shot just past the post.</p>
              <p>Gabriel Agbonlahor sealed victory with a deflected near-post
              shot in the 90th minute.</p>
              <p><strong>CHELSEA 0 HULL CITY 0</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea's tally of dropped home points rose to 16 as their
              title hopes took another battering.</p>
              <p>Ricardo Quaresma made his debut after signing on loan from
              Inter Milan but was largely ineffective.</p>
              <p>Hull, without a league win for two months, were well worth a
              point and could have taken all three had Dean Marney converted a
              chance instead of shooting across the face of goal.</p>
              <p><strong>EVERTON 3 BOLTON WANDERERS 0</strong></p>
              <p>Brazilian Jo marked his debut in style, earning a penalty
              that Mikel Arteta converted to put Everton ahead and then
              scoring twice after the interval.</p>
              <p>Everton dominated from start to finish as they consolidated
              sixth place with Jo, signed from Manchester City last week,
              looking to have solved the club's problem of a lack of strikers.</p>
              <p>His first goal was a well-struck volley and his second a
              penalty in stoppage time.</p>
              <p><strong>MANCHESTER CITY 1 MIDDLESBROUGH 0</strong></p>
              <p>City eased further away from the wrong end of the table as
              Craig Bellamy showed again why manager Mark Hughes spent most of
              January trying to sign him.</p>
              <p>The impish Welsh striker cut in from the right after 52
              minutes and planted a shot past keeper Brad Jones to register
              his second goal for the club.</p>
              <p>Shay Given played well in goal on his City debut, making
              three saves to deny Afonso Alves. Boro have now gone 13 matches
              without a win.</p>
              <p><strong>PORTSMOUTH 2 LIVERPOOL 3</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez started with strikers
              Fernando Torres and Dirk Kuyt on the bench but they both came on
              late in the game to spark a superb fightback and keep the
              pressure on leaders Manchester United.</p>
              <p>David Nugent shot Portsmouth in front just past the hour
              before Fabio Aurelio equalised following an indirect free kick
              in the box.</p>
              <p>Hermann Hreidarsson headed Pompey back in front and they
              seemed set for a priceless victory until Kuyt shot past David
              James from a tight angle after 85 minutes and Torres won it in
              stoppage time with a header from Yossi Benayoun's cross.</p>
              <p><strong>SUNDERLAND 2 STOKE CITY 0</strong></p>
              <p>Stoke remain just outside the relegation zone after losing
              and having Matthew Etherington sent off in the second half for a
              straight red card.</p>
              <p>Henri Camara was denied by the woodwork for Stoke just after
              Etherington's dismissal and Kenwyne Jones headed Sunderland in
              front with 12 minutes left. David Healy then scored the second.</p>
              <p><strong>WEST BROMWICH ALBION 2 NEWCASTLE UNITED 3</strong></p>
              <p>Newcastle won at bottom club West Brom despite manager Joe
              Kinnear being taken to hospital on the morning of the match
              after feeling unwell.</p>
              <p>Damien Duff put United ahead only for Marc-Antoine Fortune
              to level, both goals coming in the opening four minutes.</p>
              <p>New signing Peter Lovenkrands made it 2-1 and Steven Taylor
              added a third before halftime. Fortune struck again with 17
              minutes to go but Newcastle hung on.</p>
              <p><strong>WIGAN ATHLETIC 0 FULHAM 0</strong></p>
              <p>Egyptian striker Mido wasted the best chance for Wigan when
              he headed off target from an inviting position.</p>
              <p>Bobby Zamora was also wasteful for Fulham as the game
              petered out to a dull draw between two mid-table sides.</p>
