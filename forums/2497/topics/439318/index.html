              <p>Referee Wolfgang Stark believes <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/21046/Wayne-Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> may escape a prolonged Euro 2012 ban as he declined to protest his 
              dismissal on Friday, but Gary Neville says the talk of his suspension is
               merely a distraction from the fact England are "not good enough".</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>• <strong><a href="http://preview-soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/967169/harry-redknapp-fears-wayne-rooney%27s-red-card-could-cost-england">Redknapp: Ban could be costly </a></strong><br> • <strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/967406/ray-wilkins-urges-fa-to-consider-glenn-hoddle-for-england">Wilkins urges FA to consider Hoddle</a></strong></p>
              <p>Stark issued Rooney with a straight red for kicking out as England played out a <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/308550">2-2 draw</a> in Montenegro in their final competitive game before the finals and, 
              given his status as Fabio Capello's star player, there are concerns that
               it could severely hamper the country's chances.</p>
              <p>UEFA is likely to
               make a ruling on the length of the suspension next month, and Stark 
              feels it is possible that Rooney's reaction will spare him an extension 
              to the obligatory one-match ban.</p>
              <p>"He accepted it without dissent,"
               Stark said. "Maybe it will help Rooney the way he acted by accepting my
               decision. It was a straight red card. I had no hesitation.</p>
              <p>"You 
              saw what happened and Rooney knew by his reaction. He just walked off. I
               have no more input into the process. I will submit my report and it is 
              up to UEFA what they will do."</p>
              <p>However, former England defender 
              Neville feels the focus on Rooney's unavailability means the country is 
              not looking at the real problems.</p>
              <p>"The most disappointing thing about his red card is that it distracts from the major issue," he wrote in the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>. "With England, we're always looking for an excuse; we're always caught up in the minor rather than the major.</p>
              <p>"The
               real issue is that the spine of the team is not good enough, as it 
              stands, to take on Spain, Italy, France or Germany at Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>"Going
               into major tournaments we always put all our pressure and hopes on one 
              man. I've seen it before with Rooney in 2006 and 2010 or <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8880/David-Beckham">David Beckham</a> in 2002. Even before them, it was Kevin Keegan or Bryan Robson in the '70s and '80s.</p>
              <p>"It's
               as though we think that one world-class player might be able to propel 
              us to a major trophy, and now we're talking about Rooney possibly 
              missing two games of Euro 2012 when what we should be talking about is 
              the spine of a team that has no mobility and can't keep the ball.</p>
              <p>"When I look at it coldly, a team that has <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8931/John-Terry">John Terry</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/40509/Gary-Cahill">Gary Cahill</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7685/Scott-Parker">Scott Parker</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8185/Gareth-Barry">Gareth Barry</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8111/Darren-Bent">Darren Bent</a> and Rooney in its central positions is nowhere near good enough to take on the major nations such as Spain.</p>
              <p>"I'm
               not having a go at individuals - there are some very good players among
               those names. Collectively, Rooney aside, there is hardly any pace, very
               little invention and hardly any rotation of positions. Compare that 
              with the spine of Spain: <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/12905/Carles-Puyol">Carles Puyol</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/45931/Gerard-Piqu%C3%A9">Gerard Pique</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/13842/Xabi-Alonso">Xabi Alonso</a>, Xavi, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/28600/David-Villa">David Villa</a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/46912/Fernando-Llorente">Fernando Llorente</a>."</p>
              <p>Neville
               believes that, even if they are inferior, it is essential England find a
               way to stop world and European champions Spain in their friendly at 
              Wembley in November if they are to find the belief needed to provide a 
              challenge next summer.</p>
              <p>"Never has a friendly been more important,"
               he wrote. "It's like a cup final. Somehow, Capello has to do something 
              that no England manager has done in 15 years, and that is make the 
              England players believe that this next match could be the most important
               of their life.</p>
              <p>"Let's be clear, England are not as good as Spain.
               But you can't just accept they're better. You have to find a way to 
              stop them, to disrupt the rhythm and to hurt them going forward - 
              because England need to believe that, in a one-off, they can beat Spain.</p>
              <p>"The rest of Europe is watching and if Spain do what most people
               think they will do and destroy us, just like France did in February 
              1999 at Wembley when they were world champions, then England will go 
              into Euro 2012 thinking they have no chance."</p>

              <p>I watched the match. If scott parker and barry continue in those positions, England are gone. Q-final at most. Parker works very hard but he has no flair and cannot hold onto the ball at times. Barry's little better.</p>
              <p>Funny....these so called EPL stars are actually very mediocre. A stunning goal or deft touch that propels them into the next morning's headlines gets their heads all swelling up. Neville neville, never more right.</p>
