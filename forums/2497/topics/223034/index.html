But it is clear that if Juventus donÂ’t reach certain targets, seeing as there is a good relationship between himself and the club, that he may ask to leave. If that happened there wouldnÂ’t be that many sides in Italy who could sign him. We have a meeting scheduled with the club in February.Â”<br><br>The Turin giants want the Â‘keeper to remain and took the amazing step of thanking the World Cup winner for his efforts by taking out an advert in the national sports papers.<br><br>Â“It was a surprise for him,Â” noted club President Giovanni Cobolli Gigli. Â“To demonstrate our friendship and gratitude. He is a great champion and a great man for his decision to remain in a moment of difficulty. It is logical therefore that myself and the club speak to him soon about the future.Â”<br><br>Turning to the January transfer market, Cobolli Gigli insisted that the Old Lady would not be shopping after Christmas.<br><br>Â“There will be no new arrivals and nobody will leave,Â” he added. Â“There will be no buys or sales. We will return to Serie A with our present squad. We should also remember that we have a lot of good youngsters in the set-up. Let us hope that they give us great satisfaction.Â”</div>
