              season.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Spanish giants will sack Manuel 
              Pellegrini in the summer, after their Champions League defeat by Lyon.</p>
              <p class="article">Real president Florentino Perez has under-fire 
              Liverpool chief Benitez as the front-runner on a shortlist that also 
              includes Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p class="article">A top 
              Real source said: "Rafa is the preferred choice. He is a Madrid man and 
              his agent, Manuel Garcia Quillon, has an excellent relationship with the
               club.</p>
              <p class="article">"Above all, though, his record in Europe is
               exceptional. The club want to return where they believe they belong - 
              to be the No 1 team in Europe again. They believe Rafa is the man to 
              make that happen."</p>
              <p class="article">Polls show Mourinho would be a 
              hugely unpopular appointment among four out of five fans.</p>
              <p class="article">Perez rates Ancelotti very highly but knows it would be 
              impossible to prise him away from Chelsea. Benitez was a coach at Real's
               academy at the start of his career and has not hidden the fact he would
               love to coach them at some point.</p>
              <p class="article">One problem 
              could be he does not see eye to eye with Real technical director Jorge 
              Valdano. But that is not deemed to be an obstacle.</p>
              <p class="article">Real
               have now failed for six years to go past the Champions League's last 
              16.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool crashed out at the group stage this 
              season. But previously Benitez has won the trophy, reached a second 
              final, a third semi-final and twice made the last eight.</p>

              <p>Real Madrid always like that want lah... They put out the rumour then now hope Rafa will make himself get the sack then they can take him without compensation to Pool...</p>
              <p>I think if Rafa still got a job they won't try too hard for him... For them, the manager post isn't really important, they can give almost anyone a try and see how it goes. If don't work out, they sack you just like Ramos and find another one again... And the thing is they don't give long contracts too... so very little or no compensation for sacking their manager...</p>

              <p>RM has themselves to blame really, for sacking de bosco (current spain manager)when he won the double in 2002. since then, RM has appointed a series of poor appointments. Capello was considered not bad, considering he won the spanish title and yet he was sacked for playing defensive football.</p>
              <p>even if fergie is appointed the RM coach, dun think he can lasts for more than 1 season if he did not deliver either the CL or the spanish liga title.</p>
