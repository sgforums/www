              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JAVIER HERNANDEZ is a shock £30million target for Real Madrid.</h2>
              <p>The Spanish giants have put the Manchester United striker top of their wanted list.</p>
              <p>But boss Alex Ferguson is desperate to keep the 23-year-old Mexican at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>United want him to sign a new five-year deal, tripling his wages from £25,000 to £75,000.</p>
              <p>But Real would be prepared to double that again and pay a transfer fee which represents five times what United bought the striker for when they took him from Chivas for £6m just 18 months ago.</p>
              <p>Real boss Jose Mourinho could make his move in the January transfer window but believes his best chance of getting the player will come next summer.</p>
              <p>Fergie will hope that, unlike Cristiano Ronaldo, Hernandez does not have his heart set on the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>The Little Pea scored 20 goals in an amazing debut season for United as he struck up a great understanding with Wayne Rooney in the second half of the campaign.</p>
              <p>That brought a record 19th title to Old Trafford and Hernandez followed that with more glory for Mexico in this summer's Gold Cup.</p>
              <p>United yesterday secured the future of another of their young stars when midfielder Tom Cleverley, 22, signed a new four-year deal.</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "Tom is one of the brightest prospects in the English game with a fine future ahead of him."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Javier Hernandez has signed a new five-year contract at Manchester United worth in the region of £80,000 a week, his agent has revealed. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Eduardo Hernandez said: ‘We have renegotiated Javier’s contract and he is committed for five years to Manchester United. The initial contract was good for both Javier and the club because it enabled both to see if they could fit together and if he could achieve what was expected of him. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘Both sides have met their expectations and United were happy to reward Javier after his very good performances last season. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘United came up with a very good offer and I have nothing but praise for the way they have recognised Javier’s performances. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘I will not talk about numbers (wages), but it is a five-year contract.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The fact that United were so keen to renegotiate Hernandez’s contract says everything for the impact the 23-year-old Mexico striker has had since he was signed as a virtual unknown prior to the 2010 World Cup. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Hernandez, known as Chicharito, or Little Pea, scored 20 goals in his debut season at United and has scored twice this term, even though injury has restricted his appearances.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Having arrived on a basic contract of £25,000 a week, the player has moved up the pay scale to join senior professionals such as Ryan Giggs, Patrice Evra and captain Nemanja Vidic.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>His agent added: ‘This is a fixed salary with incentives based on the team’s success in each of the tournaments. We are very happy to reach an agreement with United.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘Javier was not badly paid with his initial contract, but it was his first one and, with respect, not comparable with the likes of Wayne Rooney and Nani. But today I can say that the contract was just signed and everyone is satisfied. It was never likely that Javier would leave.’</span></p>
