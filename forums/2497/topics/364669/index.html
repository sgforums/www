              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>In-demand Valencia striker David Villa has stated that he has already made a decision on where his future lies. </strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona and Real Madrid are leading the chase for
                      the Spanish striker, who is also reportedly wanted by Premier League
                      giants Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Villa has
                      previously stated his desire to remain in Spain and after scoring the
                      winner in his country's 1-0 Confederations Cup win over Iraq, he
                      revealed that he had already decided where his future lies.</p>
              <p>Valencia do not want to sell, but their precarious financial position means a transfer seems inevitable.</p>
              <p>"I have made my decision," Villa told the press following the game in Bloemfontein after again being quizzed about his future.</p>
              <p>"My agent knows my wishes, and he is now working on that - so I am relaxed.</p>
              <p>"There
                      is no deadline on the subject, and I really do not have any more
                      details as this whole thing is not totally dependent on me."</p>

              <h1>Real hold key for expensive Villa</h1>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/06/330/David-Villa_2318738.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Florentino Perez claims it is
              only "a question of time" before Real Madrid sign David Villa - as the
              capture of Cristiano Ronaldo edges closer.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>With the services of
              £56million playmaker Kaka already secured and an agreement in place
              with Manchester United for the £80million signing of Ronaldo, Madrid
              now appear to be closing in on Villa.</p>
              <p>Madrid are one of a number of clubs being linked to the vaunted
              striker, but talks between them and cash-strapped Valencia broke down
              last weekend and Los Che president Manuel Llorente revealed on Tuesday
              that there were no existing bids on the table for the 27-year-old.</p>
              <p>However, Perez was quoted as telling Canal Nou on Thursday:
              "Manuel Llorente knows what he wants to do. Us as well. For that the
              operation is a question of time.</p>
              <p>"Everything must be done in a friendly and co-operative way and
              we have very good relations with Valencia. Things need to be done
              calmly, be explained well and so that everybody is happy.</p>
              <p>"We have the whole of the summer ahead of us."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Perez insists, however, the fee they are willing to pay for
              Villa will not be in the same bracket as the ones they agreed for Kaka
              and Ronaldo. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka, who are Ballon d'Or
              or FIFA World Player of the Year winners, are players that are called
              investment players," he said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Real Madrid cannot pay these quantities of money for every player. This is not to put down Villa. </span></p>
              <p>"Players who have won these awards have an international impact.</p>
              <p>"I think Villa is an excellent player, but he is a footballer who we have to accommodate into our project."</p>
              <p>Perez's comments come just a day after Villa confirmed he had
              made up his mind about where he wants to be playing his club football
              next season.</p>
              <p>Villa revealed after starring for Spain in the Confederations
              Cup that he had already taken a decision about his future and said that
              his agent was working on achieving that aim.</p>
              <p>The striker, who has also reportedly attracted the interest of
              Barcelona, Manchester United and Chelsea, did not reveal what his
              decision was, but Spanish sports newspapers Marca and AS both believe
              it is Madrid who are his top choice.</p>
              <p>While it remains to be seen when Madrid can complete their
              chase for the Euro 2008 winner, Ronaldo's world-record switch from
              United could have moved a step closer with Spanish media reporting that
              his agent Jorge Mendes was at the Bernabeu on Wednesday to finalise
              contract details.</p>
              <p>The reports also suggest that Ronaldo could undergo his medical
              with Madrid next week before being presented at the end of the month,
              although there is nothing official from the club yet regarding the
              Portugal international.</p>

              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Valencia have now announced that striker David Villa is not for sale at any price, according to the player’s agent. </strong></p>
              <p>The 27-year-old Spain international had been expected to move to
              Real Madrid or Barcelona this summer, while Chelsea, Manchester United
              and Liverpool have also been linked.</p>
              <p>However, his agent, Jose Luis Tamargo, has now issued a statement saying Valencia are no longer willing to allow him to leave.</p>
              <p>"Valencia CF, through [chief executive] Javier Gomez and later [club
              president] Manuel Llorente, allowed me to work in putting David Villa
              on the market as his representative,” he said.</p>
              <p>“They had to sell him to help their difficult economic situation and
              gave me the conditions they required to complete the transfer.</p>
              <p>“David has always been wholly committed to the club despite the poor
              economic situation at Valencia but, because David is a world-class
              player, we have received offers from the four best teams in the world.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"I am upset because Valencia have changed their position and said
              that they do not want to sell the player despite, as you all know,
              having held negotiations with three of the four major clubs. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>“This is a very unpleasant situation and is not good for anyone. It
              should be remembered that David has always said that he is very happy
              at Valencia.</strong></span></p>
              <p>“We went into the market and now arrive at a sad situation, leaving with our tails between our legs.</p>
              <p>“It was not worth the damage that could have been done to both
              Valencia CF and David Villa and we have to take into account the fact
              that situation is more frustrating given that he is currently playing
              in the Confederations Cup with the Spanish team in South Africa.</p>
              <p>“It is very sad.”</p>
              <p>Villa had said in his post-match comments after Spain's victory over
              Iraq that he knew where he would be playing next season, and Tamargo
              added in As: "He didn't say anything about playing for Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>"That was something between me and him. We won't go into that."</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>David Villa is not expecting a speedy resolution to the uncertainty surrounding his Valencia future. </strong></p>
              <p>The Spaniard has been strongly linked with a transfer
              to Real Madrid this summer, with Los Che open to a move as they
              continue to struggle financially.</p>
              <p>A transfer was expected to be
              nearing completion only for Villa's agent, Jose Luis Tamargo, to claim

              the forward.</p>
              <p>Villa, who is currently on international duty at the
              Confederations Cup, has admitted that the past week has been a
              difficult period of his career.</p>
              <p>"I don't believe that my future will be settled quickly," said Villa.</p>
              <p>"The
              past week hasn't been easy, nobody can imagine what I've been through.
              It has been a really bad time. I must just put it out of my mind."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile,
              Liverpool striker Fernando Torres feels that his compatriot Villa will
              remain in Primera Division, despite reported interest from Chelsea.</p>
              <h4>Torres</h4>
              <p>"Listen, I think Villa will play in Spain next year," said Torres in the <em>Daily Star</em>.</p>
              <p>"It's his decision - but I think Barcelona and Real Madrid are trying to sign him and he will be in Spain.</p>
              <p>"I
              don't think Chelsea's money will tempt him, or United. I think with his
              abilities and qualities he is better for the Spanish league - he scores
              over 25 goals every season there.</p>
              <p>"I would like him to come to Liverpool of course but I think he is too expensive for us.</p>
              <p>"I would prefer it if he played in Spain than signed for Chelsea or United. That's what I'll tell him!"</p>
