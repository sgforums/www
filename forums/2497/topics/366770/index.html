              <p><img style="vertical-align: top;" src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/05/330/Cristiano-Ronaldo2_2268414.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Cristiano Ronaldo claims the £80million Real Madrid paid for him is a "fair price" and he is delighted to be the world's most expensive player.</span><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Ronaldo will put the finishing touches on his move from Manchester United on Monday night when he is officially unveiled as the Spanish giants' latest signing.</p>
              <p>Kaka and Raul Albiol have already been presented following their respective moves from AC Milan and Valencia, while Lyon striker Karim Benzema is close to completing his switch to Madrid as the Primera Division outfit's spending spree rapidly approaches the £200million mark.</p>
              <p>It is the signing of Ronaldo that has captured everyone's attention and imagination, though, as Madrid finally got their man this summer to end a transfer saga that has lasted more than two years.</p>
              <p>It took an astronomical fee to persuade United to part with the FIFA World Player of the Year, and Madrid have come in for a fair amount of criticism from both inside and outside the footballing community for spending so much money in the current global financial crisis.</p>
              <p>However, Ronaldo believes Madrid are justified in paying the fee - and also feels he can live up to the price tag.</p>
              <p>"I think that it's a fair figure. If Manchester United and Real Madrid agree this amount, then there is nothing more to say," he told Marca.</p>
              <p>"The great players cost a lot of money, and if you want them you have to pay it. I'm happy to be the most expensive player in the world."</p>
              <p>In response to those who have qualms about so much money being spent on one footballer, he added: "I respect everyone's opinions, but I don't agree with these people.</p>
              <p>"If Real Madrid have paid so much money, it's because they wanted me and have considered it a fair price.</p>
              <p>"I'm going to try to do everything in my hands to play very well and I will show that the money they are paying for me has been a good decision."</p>
              <p>Ronaldo is the centrepiece of Florentino Perez's Madrid revolution, as the returning president looks to take the fallen giants back to the top of the footballing tree.</p>
              <p>Last season Madrid had to watch on in envy as arch rivals Barcelona won an unprecedented treble of Primera Division, Copa del Rey and Champions League - and it has been a long time since the Whites made any waves in Europe.</p>
              <p>Not once in the last five years have nine-time European champions Madrid managed to get past the last 16 in the Champions League - and with next season's final being held at the Bernabeu, they will be desperate to go all the way.</p>
              <p>Much will be demanded of Ronaldo, but the Portugal international is confident he can deal with the expectations.</p>
              <p>"I've been used to having pressure for a long time. In this sense I'm calm," he said.</p>
              <p>"This (price tag) isn't something I'm going to think about when I go out on to the pitch, so it's not going to affect me.</p>
              <p>"I know that they are going to demand a lot of me to be successful at the club and I know that I'm going to have much more pressure than at Manchester United, because I was there for many years. But it means a new challenge and is going to help me be the best footballer.</p>
              <p>"As well as that, Spain is a different league - with different players, a different club - and this is going to motivate me to continue working hard and winning things."</p>

              <p>Well, the guy is full of confidence which is a good thing... We see some player signing for big money then get nervous and flop at their new club... Ronaldo I believed won't... simply because he is the best all round player in the world currently...</p>
