              <h3>EDEN HAZARD piled on the misery for Liverpool on a terrible surface in 
              this 
              Europa League tie.</h3>
              <p>The promising winger saw his free-kick fly straight into the net past 
              Jose 
              Reina with only five minutes left as the Merseysiders struggled to find 
              any 
              rhythm on a sandy pitch.</p>
              <p>Crucially, Lille take a lead to Anfield for the second leg and the 
              hard-working French hopefuls denied the visitors any away goals with a 
              solid 
              defensive showing.</p>
              <p>The home side started well in a frenetic opening spell with Yohan Cabaye
               
              testing Reina inside the very first minute.</p>
              <p>Hazard showed what all the fuss is about regarding his potential with a 
              great 
              turn and dribble that led to a centre across the face of goal before 
              Liverpool finally showed some threat when Fernando Torres almost 
              released 
              Ryan Babel.</p>
              <p>Both sides were losing possession with alarming regularity but Babel 
              should 
              have scored when playing a one-two with Torres but firing against the 
              legs 
              of Mickael Landreau.</p>
              <p>Although Lille had the majority of the play and Pierre-Alain Frau shot 
              over on 
              one occasion, the visitors carried the greater menace. Steven Gerrard 
              fired 
              just too high and then forced a smart stop out of Landreau, the keeper 
              reacting even more impressively when Glen Johnson picked up the rebound 
              and 
              crossed for Torres to head goalwards.</p>
              <p>Hazard displayed more neat tricks before aiming a tame shot at Reina 
              and, when 
              he did have the ball in the net soon after half-time, he was the victim 
              of a 
              marginal offside decision.</p>
              <p>Lucas hooked wide from a Torres flick-on before both sides attempted to 
              win 
              penalties - Frau tumbling after a clash with Jamie Carragher and Johnson
               
              going flying at the other end. Referee Claus Bo Larsen was right to look
               the 
              other way on both occasions.</p>
              <p>After Babel's thumping effort was beaten out by Landreau, Liverpool's 
              tempers 
              began to flare. Emiliano Insua was booked for protesting about a tackle 
              from 
              behind on the slippery Hazard and Torres got involved in a flare-up with
               
              Ludovic Obraniak.</p>
              <p>Torres, enduring the most frustrating of evenings, ended up being booked
               for 
              dissent after one complaint too many.</p>
              <p>Lille continued to press in search of a lead to take to Merseyside and 
              Reina 
              saw oner Frau shot rap off his knuckles and fly wide before Daniel Agger
               
              hacked away a Florent Balmont cross.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-280"><img title="BLOCKED: Torres is shut 
              out again" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00098/rami_280x420_98493a.jpg" alt="BLOCKED: Torres is shut out again">
              <div class="caption"><em>BLOCKED: Torres is shut out again</em></div>
              <div class="caption"><br></div>
              </div>
              <p>Cabaye managed the most eye-catching shot, however, clipping the bar 
              with a 
              thunderous strike that beat Reina all ends up.</p>
              <p>Reina saved a Hazard shot with his face before the deadlock was finally 
              broken 
              with five minutes left.</p>
              <p>Hazard's right-footed free-kick from the left wing went straight in with
               Reina 
              stranded to bring the house down at the Stade Metropole.</p>
              <p>A vital deflection off Agger diverted a shot from sub Pierre-Emerick 
              Aubameyang onto the outside of a post but Liverpool had a couple of 
              chances 
              to rescue it at the death.</p>
              <p>Torres and Lucas had shots blocked in a goalmouth scramble and Gerrard 
              forced 
              a diving save out of Landreau in stoppage time.</p>
              <p>But Liverpool's season of woe continues and, if Lille get an away goal 
              at 
              Anfield, it'll need a Herculean effort from the Merseysiders to get 
              through.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LIVERPOOL crashed to a second shocking defeat in four days last night.</h2>
              <p class="article">But boss Rafa Benitez insisted it was a huge improvement on Monday's loss at Wigan.</p>
              <p class="article">And he is sure his side can turn things round in next Thursday's second leg to make the Europa League's last eight.</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez said: "You must look at the positives. The attitude of the players here was fantastic.</p>
              <p class="article">"After Wigan, we were talking about our fans, saying we couldn't let them down again.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">"And the effort and spirit were excellent this time."</p>
              <p class="article">An 85th-minute free-kick from Lille's Eden Hazard decided the outcome.</p>
              <p class="article">It sailed into the visitors' net with keeper Jose Reina rooted to his line.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet Benitez added: "This was a big improvement on the last game.</p>
              <p class="article">"The reaction from the players was very good and I'm disappointed for them to lose to a late goal, especially when we had a few chances of our own.</p>
              <p class="article">"When you are playing away from home, and you get two or three good chances, you have to score to make it more comfortable.</p>
              <p class="article">"It was against a good team on a difficult pitch.</p>
              <p class="article">"I think Lille started really well. We knew they had pace.</p>
              <p class="article">"You can watch videos but until you see them on the pitch you don't see the pace they have.</p>
              <p class="article">"It was difficult to stop them but little by little we had more control.</p>
              <p class="article">"I think the players worked very hard and, if we show the same mentality and continue to work that hard, then we can beat anyone.</p>
              <p class="article">"The fans will see the effort that the players put in. And with them behind us, we know that we can beat Lille at Anfield next week.</p>
              <p class="article">"Now we have to be ready for Portsmouth and then 90 more minutes in the Europa League."</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez singled out striker Fernando Torres for praise, claiming he was almost back to his best after his catalogue of injury problems.</p>
              <p class="article">He declared: "I think he was working particularly hard and you could see that his patience is coming back.</p>
              <p class="article">"He was performing at the level we expect from him and that is very good for the team as a whole."</p>

              <h1>Lille 1 Liverpool 0: It goes from bad to worse for Rafa Benitez as 
              Eden Hazard makes mincemeat of Reds in Europa League</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool are facing a Europa League demise to go with their 
              Champions League torment after a late winner from midfielder Eden Hazard
               left their hopes of a quarter-final place hanging by a thread here at 
              the Metropole on Thursday night.</p>
              <p>The lesser of UEFA’s club 
              competitions is supposed to provide some compensation for those sides 
              who narrowly fail to make it beyond the Champions League group stage, 
              but there was no consoling Liverpool’s sorry-looking players as they 
              dragged themselves off Lille’s heavy, churned-up pitch.</p>
              <p>Just when 
              Rafa Benitez felt his side’s fortunes could not plummet any lower — 
              after a bedraggled, shapeless performance in losing to Wigan earlier in 
              the week — they did, as their French hosts claimed a deserved advantage 
              to take to Anfield on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Benitez saw it differently, 
              though, saying: ‘It is a pity we could not manage an away goal, but if 
              we score early at Anfield we can manage the return leg. The players’ 
              attitude was fantastic. They knew they could not let the fans down and 
              they didn’t. I saw enough positives to believe we will win the tie.’</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/11/article-1257281-08AE9770000005DC-438_468x286.jpg" alt="Lille's Eden Hazard " width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>On target: Lille's Eden Hazard scored the only 
              goal of the game </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But there was very little positive about the performance of
              fit-again right back Glen Johnson, who struggled to cope whenever
              Emerson went on one of his attacking sorties. And Emiliano Insua fared
              little better on the other side. The Argentinian youngster was given a
              torrid time at Wigan and again looked ill-at-ease when put to the test
              by Hazard.</p>
              <p>Lille’s right-sided star had such a success rate in one-on-ones with
              Insua that Florent Balmont increasingly drifted over from the centre to
              try his luck, both players reaching the by-line and whipping in crosses
              with alarming regularity.</p>
              <p>There was a Hazard warning for Liverpool after only 40 seconds, as
              the Lille danger man unleashed a drive which flew straight into Pepe
              Reina’s midriff.</p>
              <p>Striker Pierre-Alain Frau was a fraction away from applying a
              decisive touch to another right-flank delivery from Hazard in the 11th
              minute, before Liverpool finally showed signs of imposing themselves on
              a side with just one defeat — by Manchester United — in their last 16
              home games in Europe.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Fernando Torres had already set up Ryan Babel for a chance that was
              ushered to safety by Adil Rami’s outstretched boot when the Spain
              striker combined with his team-mate in even more impressive style in
              the 26th minute.</p>
              <p>The pace and accuracy of the passes exchanged between them belied
              the uneven surface and left Babel with a clear run on goal. The Holland
              forward has fallen short in several areas since his £12million move
              from Ajax, and finishing is one of them, especially when he has time to
              think through his options.</p>
              <p>Here, he set himself on the edge of the area before firing a shot at 
              keeper Mickael Landreau’s knees.</p>
              <p>There were more encouraging signs as Steven Gerrard saw a 35-yard
              effort sail narrowly over, then applied even more pressure on the Lille
              goal in the 42nd minute. A fierce drive by the Liverpool skipper was
              parried by Landreau, who then had to react sharply to keep out Torres’s
              header.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Liverpool were starting to sense a 
              first-leg lead might be theirs
              for the taking. Torres certainly did in the 59th minute when, after
              being fouled midway inside the Lille half, he gave no thought to eating
              up a few valuable seconds and, instead, rolled a quick free-kick to
              Gerrard.</p>
              <p>The ball was switched to Dirk Kuyt, then nudged into the path of
              Johnson, whose charge into the area was halted by what looked — but not
              to referee Claus Bo Larsen — like an unfair challenge.</p>
              <p>Babel forced a diving save with a ferocious drive on the hour, but
              it was a measure of Liverpool’s lingering frustration that Torres
              talked his way into Larsen’s book with his protests about not being
              awarded a free-kick in the 67th minute.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Reina would at least have had grounds for complaint had Stephane
              Dumont’s 76th-minute shot found a way past him. The keeper was about to
              gather it up when the ball bobbled off a divot and hit him flush in the
              face.</p>
              <p>The pitch could hardly be blamed for Lille’s 84th-minute
              breakthrough, though. Hazard’s free-kick sailed towards the six-yard
              box, evading attackers and defenders alike and nestling in the far
              corner of the net, with Reina rooted.</p>
              <p>It could have been worse — Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hitting the
              post soon after — but not much. This was another dispiriting result and
              display to match from a side desperately low on confidence.</p>

              <h1>Benitez: 'We will go through'</h1>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Defiant Rafa Benitez insisted last night Liverpool will reach the Europa League quarter-finals, despite another disastrous defeat here in France.</strong></p>
              <p>The English side slumped to their second loss in four days thanks to a goal from the appropriately named Lille forward, Eden Hazard.</p>
              <p>It was a cruel blow because the midfielder scored direct from a free-kick that deceived everyone and sneaked in at the far post, and it leaves the Reds facing the very real prospect of their second humiliating European exit this season.</p>
              <p>But Benitez remained positive after the game, insisting that his side had shown a massive improvement in attitude on Monday night's defeat at Wigan.</p>
              <p>And he insisted there are signs that Fernando Torres is returning to his peak form, which will give Liverpool a massive edge in the return leg next week.</p>
              <p>"I am confident we will progress, I am really pleased with the reaction of the players in terms of effort and I am confident we can beat anyone at Anfield with the fans behind us," Benitez said.</p>
              <p>"I would be worried if the effort wasn't there, but we put it in, and if we repeat that next week then we will go through.</p>
              <p>"They are a good team, but we are confident now we will beat them on what we have seen. This was a big improvement from the last game, and so we are disappointed by the result because the players' reaction was positive, and we can take that into the next leg."</p>
              <p>Liverpool had their chances in France, but again they spurned the opportunities to make the tie safe, and Benitez recognises it is a big problem for his side.</p>
              <p>But he believes that with Torres now back from injury and getting fitter by the game, his side can turn this tie around in the return leg.</p>
              <p>"You need to be clinical when you play away in Europe. When you have chances you have to score, because away goals are so important, and we had two or three great chances, and really, we have to start taking them," he said.</p>
              <p>"It is clear in any competition you have to score and in this, especially, because you need to score away, and so yes, it's frustrating that we didn't score because we had the chances.</p>
              <p>"But I'm pleased there are some signs Fernando is coming back, and that will make a big difference. You could see that he is getting to the level we expect, and there were signs about his pace. He is looking sharp.</p>
              <p>"The second leg will depend on how we start. If we score early we can manage the game, and I believe that we can win if we play like this."</p>
