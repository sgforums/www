              <p><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has told his players to tackle their Europa League last-16 first-leg tie against Lille as if it was their "most important game of the season''.</strong> </span></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Considering the state of the current campaign, the Spaniard's comments have more than a ring of truth to them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">After Monday's diabolical performance in the 1-0 defeat to Wigan - described by Benitez as "a blip'' - the Reds' hopes of securing a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League have diminished considerably. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">As a result the Europa League - a consolation prize for an early exit from this season's Champions League - represents the club's only realistic chance of success. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Benitez said: "A game right now will be a chance for the players to show their character. </span><span style="color: #000000;">"The last 10 games we have been all right. We had character, everyone was working hard, helping each other and working together. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"It was a surprise and hopefully this result (Wigan) is just a blip and we will see the real Liverpool on Thursday.'' </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">With defender Fabio Aurelio still sidelined with a thigh strain midfielder Yossi Benayoun is Liverpool's only injury doubt as he missed training yesterday with an ankle injury sustained at Wigan. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Lille coach Rudi Garcia is not reading too much into Liverpool's latest defeat. He said: "Liverpool are a big team and big teams are always there,'' said Garcia. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">"We cannot under-estimate them but we'll see if they perform again like they did against Wigan. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Lille will be without defenders Nicolas Plestan and Mathieu Debuchy, and forwards Tulio de Melo and Gervinho - all out injured - for the tie.</span></p>

              promise of 
              making the Champions League.</h2>
              <p class="article">The furious Liverpool boss blasted his team's shocking body language in 
              the 
              final minutes of Monday's 1-0 defeat at lowly Wigan.</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez also criticised his sixth-placed Reds for:</p>

              <p class="article">And that is after Spaniard Benitez guaranteed in mid-December that they 
              would 
              make the Champions League for next season.</p>

               you 
              are making too many mistakes.</p>
              <p class="article">"I don't remember too many games when I was that disappointed. We needed
               to do 
              things well - we didn't."</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez insists his fury has nothing to do with the V-sign rumpus that 
              erupted 
              around Steven Gerrard.</p>
              <p class="article">The skipper appeared to show two fingers to ref Andre Marriner after 
              being 
              booked.</p>

              <p class="article">"We spoke about committing fouls. We must be calm and play better 
              football 
              instead of fouling."</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez admits it is crunch time as Liverpool start a run-in that will 
              decide 
              whether he and the likes of Gerrard and Fernando Torres have a future at

              <p class="article">The Reds boss accepts breathing life into his flagging team's bid for a 
              top-four place is one of his toughest challenges.</p>

              <p class="article">He said: "This could be a crucial period for the future of the club.The 
              main 
              thing for me is to concentrate on football and get the best out of the 
              players. I have confidence we will progress in both competitions."</p>
              <p class="article">The Reds boss was tight-lipped when asked directly whether he feared for
               his 
              future - and that of his star players - if Liverpool fail to turn things
               
              around.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "When I decided to stay I decided to fight. The best thing for
               the 
              club is for me to concentrate on getting the best from the players.</p>
              <p class="article">"That's something I must do for the fans and the club."</p>
              <p class="article">The previously supportive Kop fans have become dis-illusioned in recent 
              weeks.</p>
              <p class="article">But Benitez said: "All clubs have a bad season. You see clubs who 
              haven't won 
              anything in the last 20 years.</p>
              <p class="article">"The first thing to do is win the next game, then everyone will be 
              happier."</p>
