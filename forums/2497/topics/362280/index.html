              <h1 class="heading">Roman Abramovich fails in attempt to lure Kaká to Chelsea</h1>
              <p class="heading"><img src="http://debalisnietrond.web-log.nl/debalisnietrond/images/kaka1.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p class="heading"><em>Kaka would prefer to join Real Madrid.</em></p>
              <p class="heading"><em></em></p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>Roman Abramovich has made a personal attempt to bring Kaká to Chelsea as Carlo Ancelotti’s first signing. The Times understands that Abramovich met Kaká’s father and agent, Bosco Leite, in Milan last week after sealing the capture of Ancelotti, who will be announced as the club’s new manager.</strong></p>
              <p>Abramovich is prepared to shatter the world transfer record to secure Kaká and would have no problem concluding a deal with AC Milan, who are resigned to his departure this summer, but coming to an agreement with the player’s representatives is proving more difficult.</p>
              <p>The Chelsea owner was told by Leite that Kaká would prefer to join Real Madrid, who confirmed last night that Florentino Pérez has returned to the club as president after the three other candidates for the post pulled out. Real could announce the Brazilian’s £60 million transfer this week, breaking the world record fee of £45.6 million that they paid for Zinédine Zidane eight years ago.</p>
              <p>Abramovich has been courting Kaká for several seasons so such a rejection represents a considerable blow, but he will continue his attempts to refashion the squad. The Russian has become far more involved at Chelsea in the past three months, taking personal charge of the managerial hunt and making regular visits to the training ground.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti has recommended that Chelsea try to bring Andrea Pirlo, the Italy midfield player, with him to Stamford Bridge, but it is unclear whether Milan would be willing to sell. Chelsea are already in discussions with CSKA Moscow over the purchase of Yuri Zhirkov, the versatile Russia player, while Sergio Agüero is top of their list of potential strikers.</p>
              <p>Abramovich has told Chelsea’s executives that the majority of their business this summer must be self-funding, but is prepared to underwrite the signing of a so-called marquee player. Kaká would certainly have fallen into that category, but with the Brazilian seemingly heading to Madrid, John Terry has urged Chelsea to sign Franck Ribéry or David Villa. Ribéry, the Bayern Munich winger, is also likely to join Real, but Villa, the striker, is definitely available because Valencia are suffering from severe financial problems.</p>
              <p>“I think we’ll see Chelsea back and competing for the top players,” Terry said. “I think there’ll be many players we’ll be in for in the summer, but when big players come up . . . we need to show people and let them know that, yes, Chelsea are back.”</p>
              <p>Andriy Shevchenko will return to Chelsea with Ancelotti this summer because Milan have no interest in taking up the option to sign the striker permanently after a year on loan. The Ukrainian made little impact as a player in his first two years at Chelsea, but could have a crucial role to play as an interpreter while Ancelotti improves his command of English.</p>
              <p>“I think a few of the backroom staff have worked with him before, and Sheva as well,” Terry said. “He speaks very highly of him. If he’s the man to come in, he’s got a great bunch of lads to work with. Knowing him and knowing us, it could be the start of something very good.”</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Chelsea captain John Terry has revealed club owner Roman Abramovich is working overtime to improve the squad for next season.</p>
              <p>"Over the last six months, he's been busy," said Terry. "The
              previous six months after the Champions League, he was away quite a
              lot.</p>
              <p>"But, of late, he's been here wanting to know what's happening
              at the training ground again. I think we'll see Chelsea back and
              competing for the top players who are out there at the moment like
              Franck Ribery and David Villa.</p>
              <p>"These are the kind of players we want to attract to Chelsea.
              If we can do that, with successes like this and pushing for the
              Premiership again next season, we're going to attract those kind of
              players.</p>
              <p>"We need those kind of players to strengthen the side and, at
              the same time, we need to keep hold of lads like Didier Drogba, Ashley
              and Joe Cole who are up for contract talks.</p>
              <p>"They're great people at the football club. People like Ash, Didier and Frank Lampard have been fantastic this year.</p>
              <p>"I think there'll be many players we'll be in for in the summer,
              but when big players come up like those kind of players, we need to
              show people and let them know that Chelsea are back."</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Kaka
              was pleased to send away AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti and teammate
              Paolo Maldini with a victory after their 2-0 win over Fiorentina.</p>
              <p>“It has been a very emotional day with the last games for Paolo Maldini and Ancelotti,” said Kaka.</p>
              <p>“Ancelotti is someone I am very close to after these six years together
              at Milan. I am grateful for all he has done for me and all the lessons
              I learned.</p>
              <p>“He gave me the opportunity to be known as a player on the
              world stage and I won so much with his guidance. I wish him all the
              best for everything.”</p>
              <p>It has already been confirmed that the new Coach for next season is current technical director and talent scout Leonardo.</p>
              <p>“Tomorrow there will be this Press conference to present a person who’ll lead Milan to many victories,” concluded Kaka.</p>

              <p>Hmm..sould 'Big Man' JT (cringe) be making these talks of who to buy etc? C'mon, who does he think he is? and not one mention of a defender to buy?</p>
              <p>I thinks he feels he's untouchable. If you asked me, Chelsea midifield is already good, Just that they missed Essien for large part of the season. They just need proper wingers and Joe Cole will be back. They don't have good defensive covers imho. They should go and buy another striker and a central defender.</p>
