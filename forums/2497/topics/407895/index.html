              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano's race is well and truly run at </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>after the Merseysiders swooped for a ready-made replacement.</strong></p>
              <p>Christian Poulsen has moved to Anfield in a deal worth £4.5m from Italian giants Juventus, becoming Roy Hodgson's third summer signing.</p>
              <p>The Denmark international has spent the last two years in Serie A having moved there from Sevilla in Spain. </p>
              <p>History tells us the 30-year-old never shirks a challenge. He is well versed in the dark arts and has been known to get into a fair share of scraps. He's even riled Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti during a Champions League match at the San Siro.</p>
              <p><strong>Things you need to know about Liverpool's new enforcer, Christian Poulsen...</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Was originally an attacking midfielder until he left Denmark to join Schalke in 2002. He had scored 10 goals in 45 games for FC Copenhagen<br></li>
              <li>His transfer fees total £14m<br></li>
              <li>Was the first player to be named Danish Player of the Year for two consecutive years after winning the award in both 2005 and 2006. Also won the Danish Under-21 award in 2001.<br></li>
              <li>Won the UEFA Cup with Sevilla in 2007, after they beat Espanyol on penalties in the Final after a 2-2 draw.<br></li>
              <li style="font-weight: bold;">In the 2004 European Championships, television replays showed that Italian forward Francesco Totti had spat on Poulsen during a match. Totti received a three-match ban and was forced to issue a public apology, though he claimed he was provoked repeatedly by the Dane during the match.<br></li>
              </ul>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong>After Schalke drew 2-2 against AC Milan in the 2005/06 Champions League, Carlo Ancelotti branded Poulsen 'a coward', alleging that the midfielder had kicked out at star man Kaka off the ball.</strong></p>
              <p>A further spat ensued at the end of the second leg with Milan. With Milan victorious, Gennaro Gattuso confronted and taunted Poulsen about the result. The Dane responded by saying that he found Gattuso childish and hoped he felt embarrassed for himself.</p>
              <p>In June 2007 during a Euro 2008 qualifier Poulsen was again involved in cotroversy after he punched Swedish striker Markus Rosenberg in the stomach with the game locked a 3-3 in the last minute. Poulsen's was red carded and a penalty was given. However after an angry Danish fan ran on the pitch and attempted to kick referee Herbert Fandel, the game was abandoned and Sweden awarded a 3-0 victory. Poulsen made a public apology for his actions and was suspended for three matches.</p>
              <p>Following the Sweden match charges were pressed against Poulsen for the punch on Rosenberg. Danish Minister of Justice Lene Espersen called for Poulsen's exclusion from the national team, though the case was eventually dismissed and Poulsen was free to be called up again.</p>
