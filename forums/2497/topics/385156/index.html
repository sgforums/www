              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Harry Redknapp" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/harry-redknapp"><strong>Harry Redknapp</strong></a><strong> has 
              proclaimed the end of the </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Premier League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><strong>Premier League</strong></a><strong>'s big 
              four by declaring that only Chelsea and Manchester United are certainties to 
              finish in the Champions League places this season and that the other pair of 
              prized berths for Europe's elite tournament could be filled by any two of 
              several teams – including </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Tottenham Hotspur" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur"><strong>Tottenham 
              Hotspur</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool's wobbles so far this season had convinced 
              many observers that one member of the customary top four could be about to 
              surrender their place but after watching his team intensify the pressure on Mark 
              Hughes by trouncing <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester City" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity">Manchester City</a> 3-0 
              to end a run of three matches without a win and hoist themselves up to fifth in 
              the table, Redknapp suggested Arsenal may also fall from grace.</p>
              <p>"I've said since the start of the season that the champions will come from 
              Chelsea or Manchester United but after that it's up for grabs," he said. 
              "Anything is possible this season. Look at Arsenal, you would have expected them 
              to go up and win at Burnley after beating Liverpool, but they didn't so that 
              shows you how hard it's going to be."</p>
              <p>Spurs' chances of fulfilling their pre-season ambitions had been ridiculed 
              after Saturday's home defeat by Wolves, but Redknapp railed against the 
              detractors. "People over-react to one result," he said. "One defeat and you're 
              finished, out of the race. People say 'same old Tottenham, they're going to fall 
              flat on their face.' Players who are great one day are useless the next – it's 
              unbelievable, but that's how the game has gone unfortunately.</p>
              <p>"We've been consistent. People go on about no win in three matches but in the 
              draws at Everton and Villa our performances were very good. A lot of teams would 
              be happy with a point away at Everton and Villa. It's possible for us this year, 
              we just have to keep picking up results."</p>
              <p>In keeping with his conviction that too much should not be read into one 
              result, Redknapp refused to rule Manchester City out of the battle for the 
              Champions League places, despite the fact that their feeble showing at White 
              Hart Lane meant Hughes's expensively assembled team have won just one of their 
              last 10 league matches. "I certainly wouldn't write them off," said Redknapp. 
              "They're a good team. I expect them to be bang up there."</p>
              <p>Whereas Redknapp has been told he must sell some of his peripheral squad 
              members in order to fund any new recruits in January, City have the advantage of 
              being wealthy enough to make offers for any player they want. City's 
              shortcomings last night, however, helped allay any anxiety Redknapp may have 
              felt that superior financial resources could be decisive. For all the money they 
              have pumped in, City have not been able to inject their side with an 
              unquenchable spirit.</p>
              <p>"It's about getting the right players," said Redknapp. "Sometimes you can 
              have stars who don't perform. You see the game tonight and you probably think 
              they need … well … they missed [Craig] Bellamy."</p>
              <p>The prospect of Hughes being the man to whom any January expenditure is 
              entrusted must have been dented by last night's disjointed performance. The 
              manager, however, ignored any concerns that he may pay for City's unconvincing 
              form with his job, instead declaring that he intends using the January transfer 
              window to address one of the problems that he cannot hide: shambolic defending. 
              "At the moment we are having a bit of difficulty when balls come into our box," 
              said Hughes. "It seems that every opportunity that presents itself to the 
              opposition, they score from."</p>
              <p>That is tantamount to an admission that his extravagantly priced central 
              defensive pairing of Joleon Lescott and Kolo Touré has not worked out, though 
              the injury to Lescott, missing last night after undergoing surgery yesterday to 
              repair a floating bone in his knee, and Touré's imminent departure for the 
              African Nations Cup, meant he would probably strengthen anyway. "We're 
              struggling at the back," said Hughes. "We've lost Joleon for six to eight weeks 
              and lose Kolo to the African Nations Cup soon so it's not hard to guess what are 
              as we'll be looking to strengthen."</p>

              I understand that you are upset because he is dissing Arsenal (which you support). No one knows who will be top four this season. In my opinion, there is relevance to what Harry Redknapp mentioned in the article, that only Man Utd and Chelsea will secure top four placing. In my opinion, till now only they and aston vila have been playing at top four form and quality. Many including you and poignant would expect LFC and Arsenal to be performaing better. 
              
              <br>
              <br>
              Well we won't know how the season will progress. Man Utd and Chelsea may perform below expectations for the rest of the season and drop out of top four. Liverpool and Arsenal may start firing up and become serious title contenders. Man City, Aston Villa and Tottenham may cause serious upsets this year. We won't  know. Thats where the excitment in watching football comes from.
