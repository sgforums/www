              <p class="imageCaption" style="text-align: left;"><em>Allegations: One of 
              the British men arrested as part of a drugs and money-laundering gang 
              bust has claimed the money came from professional football transfers in 
              England</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>A vast drug and money-laundering operation run by British gangsters 
              which may have links to Premier League football transfers has been 
              smashed by police in France's Dordogne region.</p>
              <p>Officers from both 
              sides of the Channel raided a number of upmarket homes in two isolated 
              villages favoured by British expatriates.</p>
              <p>There they found 
              drugs and thousands of pounds worth of used notes, along with luxury 
              cars including Aston Martin DB9s and Mercedes SLKs.</p>
              <p>There have 
              been at least four arrests in connection with the enquiry, all of 
              British nationals who claimed to have moved to France 'for the good 
              life', said an investigating officer.</p>
              <p>One claims he was regularly 
              receiving cash payments for his work with UK-based football agents.</p>
              <p>The
               enquiry began in May 2009 when one of the accused - named only as 
              Stephen C - was arrested in a car travelling from Narbonne, on the south
               coast, to the city of Toulouse, in the south west.</p>
              <p>Police found 
              half-a-million pounds worth of used notes in a hidden compartment in the
               boot of his Mercedes, along with traces of cocaine.</p>
              <p>The 
              Englishman had been put under surveillance, and the police established 
              that he had made at least 20 'suspicious' journeys delivering money 
              around Europe.</p>
              <p>Cocaine is thought to have been delivered 
              from Spain, after arriving in boats from Africa, said police.</p>
              <p>But 
              there is also an allegation that some of the cash was linked to agents 
              or other parties involved in the lucrative - and notoriously unregulated
               - trade in footballers.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/22/article-1259774-023E55CF0000044D-380_468x313.jpg" alt="dordogne" width="468" height="313">
              <p class="imageCaption" style="text-align: left;"><em>'Dordogneshire': 
              Police raided the gang in the Dordogne region of France, above, where 
              they were living as British ex-pats who moved 'for a better life'</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'He told us that all the money came from professional footballer 
              transfers in England,' added the investigating officer.</p>
              <p>'Those 
              arrested say they had links with big names in the world of Premiership 
              football.'</p>
              <p>Stephen C was placed in custody under suspicion 
              of laundering money associated with Britain's cocaine trade.</p>
              <p>During
               many months of questioning he led detectives to the pretty villages of 
              Augignac and Champniers-et-Reilhac, close to Perigueux, in the Dordogne.</p>
              <p>All
               of those involved were blending in with the thousands of Britons who 
              have set up homes in one of the most unspoiled regions of Europe - one 
              which is frequently referred to as 'Dordogneshire' because of its 
              popularity with what the French call 'Anglo Saxons'.</p>
              <p>It was in 
              Augignac, which has a population of just 850, that two suspects named as
               Mickael K and Sophie S were arrested on February 24th this year.</p>
              <p>'They
               owned a villa estimated to be worth around 175,000 euros, and a second 
              home in Charente, as well as agricultural land worth around 150,000 
              euros,' said another police source.</p>
              <p>'They'd also invested in three
               plots of land in another part of the Dordogne,' he added.</p>
              <p>Mark B,
               another local resident, is considered to be a 'mastermind' behind the 
              operation, and was arrested during a visit to a London clinic on 
              February 14th.</p>
              <p>When police raided his parents' home at 
              Champniers-et-Reilhac, which has a population of just 500, they found a 
              sky blue DB7, and a Mercedes with a hidden compartment identical to the 
              one found in the car in which Stephen C was arrested.</p>
              <p>'The cars 
              were typical of the kind of flash, luxury goods these suspects have been
               using,' said the police source. 'They had stacks of money and were 
              regularly investing in land and luxury properties. They are also 
              believed to have been investing in Cyprus'.</p>
              <p>The officer said Mark 
              B's parents had already offered Â£50,000 in cash to pay for their son's 
              defence.</p>
              <p>He added: 'All those arrested are being questing pending 
              court appearances.'</p>
              <p>The investigation is being coordinated 
              by Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and the Toulouse 
              judicial police.</p>
