              <p><br>Yeah lah, but i think this week's match so fresh after that Spurs game... Somehow it effected the young players minds... Rumours has it that they were blaming each other and all that in the dressing room... That can't be good. How can you go into a match at this level and play well if you are angry with each other? Fab didn't have a good game according to what I have read... Wenger will put them right soon starting with a win against Fenerbahce on Wed.</p>

              <h2>Despite being warned, Arsenal fall foul of Rory Delap's long-throws in defeat at Stoke</h2>

              <div class="imageExtras" style="width: 460px;"><span class="caption">Seeing red: Robin van Persie receives his <em>marching</em> orders</span> </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rob Styles this joker again!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Stoke City (1) 2 Arsenal (0) 1</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal’s chances of staying in the title race took an almighty blow as the prodigious throws of Rory Delap propelled Stoke City to a memorable victory.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger’s afternoon was further soured with the late dismissal of substitute Robin van Persie as the visitors were out fought at the Britannia Stadium, undone by exactly the tactics the manager had warned his side against during the week.</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott both picked up injuries on a bruising afternoon for Arsenal that played in to the hands of the hosts.</p>
              <p>Ricardo Fuller was the first to benefit from Delap’s huge throw-in after ten minutes when he beat Kolo Toure to the ball to nick a smart header to the far corner of the goal.</p>
              <p>Despite Arsenal’s labours Stoke stood firm to the pressure and in truth never let Arsenal settle and play the football that could have brought them parity.</p>
              <p>Late on in the second half another Delap throw caused blind panic in the Arsenal box. Ryan Shawcross flicked the ball on and, in a crowded area, Seyi Olofinjana somehow managed to take the ball down on his chest before heading it home.</p>
              <p>Gael Clichy scored a stoppage time consolation but it was too little, too late for Arsenal.</p>
              <p>The tactics are not to everyone’s liking but there is no doubting the effectiveness of Stoke’s game plan, nor the damage this result has done to Arsenal’s already stuttering domestic season.</p>

              <h1>Theo Walcott adds to Arsene Wenger's woes after Arsenal's dismal defeat to Stoke City</h1>
              <h2>Doubts over Arsenal have swelled into a serious problem.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01097/theo-walcott_1097384d.jpg" border="0" alt="Theo Walcott adds to Arsene Wenger's woes after Arsenal's dismal defeat to Stoke City" width="380" height="237"></p>
              <p><strong><em>Walcott being carried off with what appeared to be a dislocated shoulder.</em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Not only did they lose 2-1 at Stoke, rather confirming Abdoulaye Faye’s claim that they do not relish a physical battle, but they lost Robin van Persie to a red card and forwards Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott to injuries. Walcott is a particular concern, after being carried off with what appeared to be a dislocated shoulder.</strong></p>
              <p>Their lack of height at the back has become a glaring flaw, and was predictably exposed by the long throws of Rory Delap. Ricardo Fuller and Seyi Olofinjana both capitalised from the Republic of Ireland international’s deliveries. Gael Clichy pulled one back in injury-time.</p>
              <p>“People who love the traditional English game must be very happy because they got what they like,” said the Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. “It was a traditional English game with a lot of fight and commitment on one side and Stoke deserved to win.”</p>
