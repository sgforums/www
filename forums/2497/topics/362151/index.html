              <div class="content">
              <p>Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink was delighted to win the FA Cup in his final game in charge.</p>
              <p>"We were very tough and the team has showed after a setback they react always, which is what I like," he told <em>ITV1</em>.</p>
              <p>"I loved it so much, I enjoyed it so much working with big stars but
              they knew what it's all about. They showed in the Premier League and
              Champions League and today, a lot of character."</p>
              <p>Asked to compare the win with his other successes, Hiddink
              added: "It was one of the biggest, a big achievement, winning in the
              Mecca of world football, the FA Cup is something you cannot believe."</p>
              <p>Hiddink understandably described the triumph as the highlight of his short stint in England.</p>
              <p>"We have worked so hard since February and I respect these guys very much," said the Dutchman.</p>
              <p>"We had some wonderful performances in the Premier League and
              also in the Champion League and this is the highlight, to win the FA
              Cup."</p>
              <p>Everton boss David Moyes had no complaints about the result. He told ITV1: "Chelsea were the better team on the day.</p>
              <p>"I thought we were having our best spell when they got their
              goal from Frank Lampard. He's a big player and he scores goals, and
              that's what he did.</p>
              <p>"The margins were very narrow in terms of the result but there were bigger margins on the field."</p>
              <p>Moyes praised the efforts of his players saying: "I've got to give them credit."</p>
              <p>He added: "Last year was a semi-final, this year a final. Whether we won today or whether we hadn't it was progress for us."</p>
