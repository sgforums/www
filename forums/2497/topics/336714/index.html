              <h2><img src="http://www.soccerfiesta.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/real_madrid_logo.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="310"></h2>
              <h2>Marca reports that Real Madrid have completed the signing of
              Brazilian sensation Alipio Duarte Brandano from Portuguese minnows Rio
              Ave this afternoon, beating English rivals Chelsea in the race for his
              signature.</h2>
              <p>Los Meringues had been keeping tabs on the young striker for over a
              year now, and have finally been able to offer him a contract after his
              16th birthday this summer. The Brazilian born hit-man, dubbed “Little
              Ronaldo” by the Portuguese press on account of his pace with the ball,
              will join the Real Madrid Castilla, hoping to rise through the ranks
              and one day make it to the first team.<br><br>Brandano had the
              difficult decision of choosing between Chelsea or Real Madrid, both of
              whom were front runners for his signature, but he opted a move to the
              Spanish giants, after weighing up his chances of rising to prominence.
              Another factor that influenced the forward’s decision was culture,
              choosing a move to Spain in order to avoid any major shifts in his
              lifestyle.<br><br>Real Madrid scouts Juan Castro and Manu Sianz
              confirmed today that they would meet with Alipio and his father to
              discuss what was expected of him at his new club. Rio Ave, Alipio’s
              previous club, were not happy about losing their number 9, but felt
              that they could no longer nurture his growing talents and knew the best
              option was to let him go.<br><br>Los Blancos have been linked with
              Europe’s top strikers of late, namely Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Karim
              Benzema, but seem to have made the right move, investing their money in
              youth players rather than multi-million dollar contracts, especially
              after the success of signing Gonzalo Higuain from River Plate two years
              ago.<br><br>Brandano is expected to fly into the Spanish capital later
              this week to finalise the deal, joining Real Madrid as early as next
              Wednesday.</p>
