              <h3>LIVERPOOL are planning a £50million spending spree to knock Manchester 
              United 
              off their perch next season.</h3>
              <p>But it will need another summer squad cull to raise all the funds.</p>
              <p>That is unlikely to be enough to satisfy worried striker Fernando 
              Torres' 
              demands for 'four or five' world-class signings.</p>
              <p>The Merseysiders' will have an initial £25m to splash on recruits once 
              they 
              have secured new investment.</p>
              <p>The rest of the transfer kitty must be drummed up through player sales, 
              with 
              Albert Riera and Yossi Benayoun the first high-profile departures.</p>
              <p>Riera will be sold for £8m, with CSKA Moscow trying to secure a deal 
              this 
              week.</p>
              <p>Benayoun has wanted out since the start of the season and will raise 
              another 
              £9m.</p>
              <p>Liverpool already brought in another £8m through the January sale of 
              Andrea 
              Dossena and Andriy Voronin.</p>
              <p>What is clear is the bid for 40 per cent of Liverpool from The Rhone 
              Group 
              will not herald the start of a vastly different era of investment in the
               
              squad.</p>
              <p>The only way the Liverpool manager will be able secure the kind of 
              fantasy 
              football figures the fans crave is to ponder the unthinkable - by 
              selling 
              Torres for £80m.</p>
              <p>Such a decision would create hysteria on the Kop, but it is not without 
              precedent in Anfield history. Liverpool sold their record goalscorer Ian
               
              Rush in 1987 and used the money to buy John Barnes, John Aldridge, Peter
               
              Beardsley and Ray Houghton. These four world-class players formed the 
              core 
              of the most attractive team ever seen at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Liverpool insist selling Torres (right) is not an option they are 
              willing to 
              discuss, even though they are well aware agents on behalf of Chelsea and
               
              Manchester City are making regular contact with the player's advisors.</p>
              <p>Benitez still believes the striker, who turned 26 yesterday, will be 
              loyal to 
              Anfield. He has tried to play down fears of a superstar exodus from the 
              club.</p>
              <p>Asked if Liverpool fans should fear Torres will go, Benitez said: "I 
              don't 
              think so.</p>
              <p>We don't want to sell Fernando to anybody. I can talk with him and we 
              can go 
              forward. He makes his own decisions but Fernando is a professional who 
              plays 
              hard and is really happy here.</p>
              <p>"He knows we have a lot of good players at the club. If everything is 
              fine on 
              Sunday he will be very happy.</p>
              <p>"The priority now is to concentrate on this year and if we can improve 
              and 
              stay in the top four it will be easier to talk about this. If we can't, 
              we 
              have to keep working and have the belief we will have good players and 
              they 
              will be good enough."</p>
              <p>Benitez has been seeking talks with his board to assure him the proceeds
               of 
              all transfers will be available to reinvest.</p>
              <p>It is the lack of such guarantees which is leading the Spanish coach to 
              believe his future is away from Anfield.</p>
              <p>For their part, Liverpool have not quelled last weekend's claims 
              Benitez's 
              boardroom support is evaporating.</p>
              <p>Publicly, the club insists everything is still to play for with fourth 
              place 
              and a Europa Cup triumph potentially redeeming a miserable campaign.</p>
              <p>But there is a distinct eye on the future in both the manager's office 
              and 
              boardroom, with acknowledgement a decent climax will merely paper over 
              the 
              cracks of deep-rooted problems. Victory at Old Trafford today would 
              prolong 
              a rare, upbeat week on Merseyside, but will not disguise the drastic dip
               in 
              Liverpool's fortunes since their 4-1 win at United a year ago.</p>
              <p>A summer rebuild is a necessity, but where the money will come from to 
              satisfy 
              Torres is key to Liverpool's survival as part of the Euro elite.</p>
              <p>A decision on the Rhone offer for 40 per cent of the club, revealed 
              first in 
              last week's Sport of the World, will be made within the next two weeks.</p>
              <p>The Premier League need to know by March 31 how Liverpool intend to 
              operate 
              their business for the forthcoming financial year.</p>
              <p>Failure to provide details will jeopardise the application for their 
              UEFA 
              license, as it did 12 months ago.</p>
              <p>If they get the green light, the Rhone investors will not turn up at 
              Anfield 
              wearing Liverpool scarves, proclaiming Kevin Keegan a boyhood hero or 
              making 
              grand promises about £100m signings.</p>
              <p>They are merely a bridge to appease the bank, reduce the boardroom power
               of 
              Tom Hicks and George Gillett, make stadium funding feasible and for 
              managing 
              director Christian Purslow to ensure the club is run in a different way.</p>
              <p>Benitez heads to Old Trafford today making familiar observations about 
              the 
              relative spending power of himself and Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>He believes his efforts to topple United have been ultimately sabotaged 
              by 
              lack of transfer funds.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-280"><img title="BENITEZ: Proud of history" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00100/benitez_hill_280x42_100084a.jpg" alt="BENITEZ: Proud of history">
              <div class="caption"><em>BENITEZ: Proud of history</em></div>
              <div class="caption"><br></div>
              </div>
              <p>Benitez said: "In the past Liverpool were breaking all the records and 
              making 
              all the signings but over the last 13 years that is different.</p>
              <p>"We have to be proud of the history but now we have to manage in a 
              different 
              way.</p>
              <p>"I could read Sir Alex Ferguson's words about what he wanted to do when 
              he 
              became their manager but it is different now.</p>
              <p>"If you talk about what they have and what we have, it is different, 
              especially with money. We have to reduce this gap in the transfer market
               and 
              on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"If a rivalry is positive it can help. Not just in football but in life.
               But 
              if it's negative it is a problem. The fans know it is a very important 
              rivalry but we are talking about a game. We will try and do our best but
               the 
              fans have to respect each other.</p>
              <p>"This is a massive game. I know what the rivalry means but I am a 
              professional 
              and I try to concentrate on each game. But this is a big one."</p>
