              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">FULHAM owner Mohamed Fayed last night claimed Roy Hodgson will take Liverpool 'downhill'.</h2>
              <p>The Craven Cottage chief also labelled him a 'bugger' for joining the Reds. Fayed, 77, said: "Roy disappointed the fans and the players.</p>
              <p>"I'm sure he'll take Liverpool downhill. He was just a bugger. I did everything to help him. But that's his character, he can't help it.</p>
              <p>"After we put him where he is now, he took advantage but good luck to him.</p>
              <p>"We gave him all the support, we believed in him and he let us down. I forgive him, anyhow."</p>
              <p>Fayed made his comments as Mark Hughes was officially unveiled as Fulham's new boss.</p>
              <p>The Egyptian added: "Mark's much better than the previous one. He knows what he's doing.</p>
              <p>"We have a nice guy now. Don't mention Roy Hodgson any more.</p>
              <p>"Fulham's a wonderful club and I'm sure Mark will do a great job.</p>

              <h2>AL FAYED TAKES POP AT HODGSON</h2>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Mohamed Al Fayed has accused Roy Hodgson of "taking advantage" of Fulham.</p>
              <p>But the Cottagers chairman insisted he forgave the new Liverpool boss for leaving for Anfield this summer.</p>
              <p>Hodgson quit Fulham after two and a half years in charge last 
              month, having been hailed as the greatest manager in their history.</p>
              <p>He was succeeded last week by Mark Hughes, who was officially unveiled this afternoon.</p>
              <p>Al Fayed unexpectedly interrupted today's press conference, 
              saying of the new appointment: "He inherited a great team which had 
              fantastic results but unfortunately this guy (Hodgson), after we put him
               where he is now, he took advantage and left us.</p>
              <p>"But good luck to him, good luck to Liverpool."</p>
              <p>Al Fayed added of Hughes: "He is a nice guy. He is much better looking and I am sure that he will do a great job.</p>
              <p>"I am sure that there will be no complications. We have a great 
              managing director and chief executive and we're happy to have someone 
              like Mark in place.</p>
              <p>And in what Hughes will hope was tongue in cheek, Al Fayed said: "I'm sure this guy can get us to the championship."</p>

              <p><br>How can you blame him when liverpool has such a bad squad. It is no more the squad that can challenge title already. Even you put Mourinho, I think Liverpool will still end up out of CL slot.</p>
              <p>Roy has proved himself at quite a number of clubs.</p>
              <p>Mascherano and Benayoun left put a huge hole in liverpool but I think it is wrong to let Aquilani go back to Italy especially they already lack of depth.</p>

              <p>Err... I think man for man, it's still a lot more better than the Fulham side he left behind overall, i think you would agree right?</p>
              <p>Fulham also got a new manager, so comparable in this area. But their players, despite not as talented or highly paid, are showing more fighting spirit during matches, this is the difference...</p>
              <p>Masc may have left already but as you mentioned yourself, he allowed a $20m Masch replacement to leave on loan... That was his call and he made it...</p>
              <p>On Benny, didn't they replaced him with what many belief is a better player in Cole? Or at least he is like for like to some... They even got some additional Danish and Portuguese internationals in Poulsen and Meireles... And have the luxury of taking one of his old boys Konchesky with him... So, no lack of options there for him and a poor excuse to make...</p>
              <p>So you said Roy have proved himself at quite a number of clubs over the years... But seriously, what has he proven? That he is great as a mid table manager? Cos a quick look at his CV and you could ask, has he won any league titles in a major league before? The answer is No...</p>
              <p>Even McClown (The former England manager) got a Dutch league title to his credit now. And he even did it the hard way breaking the Dutch league stronghold of Ajax, PSV &amp; Ferenoord and won it with an almost unknown club called Twente... Their first in club history... Roy's only league titles came in the Swedish and Danish leagues... Now that can't be too impressive right?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I think you are expecting to much from Liverpool, pls lower yr expectation. They are no more Man Utd, Chelsea or Arsenal level. In fact, the harsh reality is this year squad is even worst than Gerard Houllier times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Joe Cole? Just a money grabber with no mood to play football. If you think he is really that good. Chelsea will have match his demand,right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Poulsen? He was bought in due to limited budget. So you shall know his standard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, if I put it bluntly, Liverpool can just make it into next season EPL will be consider good. Top 10 finished? I think you are expecting too much. Unless some Chinese man or Arab king bought over the club and inject billions. No magic is going to happen.</p>

              <p>Is Liverpool squad of players less superior to Fulham?</p>
              <p>So is it too much to ask for just to match Mark Hughes at Fulham? Cos I am not suggesting they match Man Utd, Chelsea or Arsenal's level, just Fulham's would be good for a start !</p>

              <p><br>The manager plays a very big part in any team... If Chelsea is the example, than they clearly show what happened to them when Luiz Felipe Scolari was in charge...  And the change in their fortunes as soon as Hiddink took over.</p>
              <p>I am not saying Hodgson is totally bad, just that I am beginning to doubt his abilities thats all... And looking at his CV, it's doesn't helps cos it's not even impressive let alone quite...</p>
              <p>I would say it again, I don't think Pool will do any worse than 8 position with the squad they have. Not counting any points deduction of course...</p>

              <p><br>Indeed they have, indeed they have... But well, what can we say, the guy's CV suggest he is more of a cup specialist... He seems to have a better CV than Roy Hodgson also... That's why it matters who's in charge of a team I guess... lol.</p>

              <p>to be fair to roy, he did not actually come into a club that is "RICH", yes, Rich is history, but pits in the bank.</p>
              <p>So with the big expectations and to assure his biggest stars, he did what he can with the best he got. remember, he still has to undo what the previous managers have bought/implement and start his own ideas/squad.</p>
              <p>wasn't Roy even considered for the english job a few mths back? So he is quality. but it takes time.</p>
              <p>I think seriously, the pool players may play with half their mind on what the owners (KNS) are doing and the other half, on what/how the biggest stars (gerrard/torres) are.</p>
              <p>So it is a torrid time, but i think unless the owners go, they may be struck in neutral for a long time..</p>

              <p>aiya...this is like a employment contract ma. ppl have ambition.</p>
              <p>i wouldnt say whether liverpool is a better team than fulham. but liverpool is definitely a bigger team than fulham ma.</p>
              <p>liverpool problems is without good play maker, average central defender.</p>
              <p>carragher is error prone. ditch him.</p>
              <p>lucas can play for mid table team but not liverpool la.</p>
              <p>joe cole? well..the reason is leave chelsea is not footballing reason but financial one.</p>
              <p>torres, is half hearted.</p>
              <p>gerrard is demoralise at alonso leaving.</p>
              <p>johnson is fast and good ona  good day, but on another day, he can give you error that give away goals.</p>
