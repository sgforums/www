And the FA has rejected appeals for wrongful dismissal from Chelsea's Mikel Jon Obi and Gunner Emmanuel Adebayor. Mikel will serve a four-match ban and Adebayor will sit out three games.</strong><br><br>Arsenal right-back Emmanuel Eboue has been charged with violent conduct for striking Wayne Bridge in the same melee at the end of Chelsea's 2-1 victory. Midfielder Mikel's suspension is a game longer than Adebayor's as it was his second sending-off of the season.<br><br>Adebayor has also been charged with reacting aggressively and failing to leave the field of play immediately after being dismissed. The brawl was sparked by Kolo Toure's reaction to having his shirt tugged by Mikel and the Arsenal defender, who was also sent off, will miss three matches with immediate effect. The clubs have until 14 March to respond, but rival bosses Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho have not been charged, despite coming on to the pitch during the brawl.<br><br>The full FA charge alleges that Chelsea and Arsenal failed to ensure that their "players and/or officials conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from provocative and/or violent behaviour." Eboue has until 6pm on Wednesday to respond, and the case will be heard by an FA disciplinary commission on Thursday - and Adebayor also has the right to a personal hearing.<br><br>Referees' chief Keith Hackett has called on the FA to take action and praised the way referee Howard Webb dealt with the incident. Hackett also criticised the two managers for getting involved. "This will be looked at by the FA. It was done with all good intentions but what we need is for those other than players to stay off the field, apart from security."<br><br>Gunners striker Adebayor said: "My reaction after the card did not mean I wanted to hit the referee - I just wanted to know why he gave me the red card. "I do not think I did anything wrong."<br></div>

Detailed analysis of the incident at the Millennium Stadium on Sunday suggests both Didier Drogba, the country's leading goalscorer, and Michael Essien, their versatile midfielder, struck opponents as Arsenal and Chelsea players grappled.<br><br>Neither incident was seen by the referee Howard Webb, but both should be spotted by the Football Association's football regulation unit as it studies tapes of the fracas. Broadcast material indicates that Essien cuffed Denilson on the face, and Drogba slapped the back of Cesc Fabregas' head. The FA also has access to film that was not broadcast on the day. If the FA is prepared to follow the letter of the law, and risk the wrath of Chelsea and their lawyers, Drogba and Essien should be suspended for three games, the penalty for "violent conduct".<br><br>The unit's first task is to consider appeals against the dismissals of Emmanuel Adebayor and John Obi Mikel, who were sent off along with Kolo TourÃ© as the final exploded in injury-time. Arsenal yesterday appealed against Adebayor's red card on the grounds of mistaken identity. But while video evidence confirms it was Emmanuel EbouÃ©, his team-mate, who struck Wayne Bridge, it does not fully exonerate Adebayor. Adebayor is seen aggressively wading into the fracas, though it is not certain, on the evidence available to The Independent, that he struck anyone.<br></div>

He called on Lampard to come clean and say whether or not he was punched.<br><br>Ref Howard Webb was seen consulting with assistant David Babski before sending off Adebayor, who was involved in angry exchanges with the linesman. ArsenalÂ’s Emmanuel Eboue, Kolo Toure and Adebayor are all in the dock for their part in the 20-man brawl at the Millennium Stadium as Chelsea won 2-1.<br><br>But Wenger said: Â“We lost players on Sunday for three or four games Â— players like Adebayor who would have played tonight. Â“I donÂ’t agree at all with the match report, with what the linesman said. This is a lie Â— a complete lie. Â“The linesman said Adebayor punched Lampard. If Lampard says yes then we accept it. Â“I want him to say the truth. I would like to ask Lampard if he has been punched by Adebayor.<br><br>Â“I feel Adebayor didnÂ’t punch anybody. When the linesman says that he did, he lies. Â“We have watched it under a microscope and if you see Adebayor punching Lampard, IÂ’d like you to show me.<br><br>Adebayor's appeal against a three-match ban for his red card was rejected on Tuesday and he was unable to play against Blackburn in Wednesday's FA Cup fifth-round replay, which Rovers won 1-0.<br><br>And the striker also faces a separate charge of reacting aggressively and failing to leave the pitch after being sent off.<br><br>A hearing has been set for Tuesday 6 March.<br><br>Wenger said: "The whole decision from the FA is wrong. There's a lot of things in there that are not true.<br><br>"I don't want to prove anything. I'm just giving my opinion."<br><br></div>
