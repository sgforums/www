              <p><strong>Paul Robinson has claimed his career could have spiralled down a
              slippery slope had he not left Tottenham for Blackburn in the summer. </strong></p>
              <p>The England international swapped White Hart
              Lane for Ewood Park in the summer, having lost the faith of Juande
              Ramos, and his career is on an upward curve once again.</p>
              <p>Robinson’s form last term was patchy, but the keeper was unhappy with the way Ramos handled his omission from the team.</p>
              <p>“You can’t have peace and quiet in football,
              no matter where you go but the time was right for me to move,” the
              former Leeds keeper told The Sun ahead of his return to North London at
              the weekend.</p>
              <p>“I look back now at the way things have gone and with the manager who was still in charge at the time.</p>
              <p>“If I had still been at Spurs the first three or four months of this season it could have been very bad for me.</p>
              <p>“But it’s worked out well for us both. Tottenham are moving in the right direction and things are going well for me here.”</p>
              <p>Robinson lost has place for the Carling Cup
              semi-final, being replaced by Radek Cerny, but it was the manner in
              which he was axed which hurt the keeper.</p>
              <p>“You could say that night was the turning point for me at Tottenham,” he added.</p>
              <p>“I was disappointed with the way the manager handled the situation.</p>
              <p>“We had a team meeting, he turned his chart over and the team was there on the board.</p>
              <p>“That was it - I wasn’t on it. I wasn’t pulled beforehand, no word in my ear, no explanation, nothing.</p>
              <p>“I haven’t known anything like that before. It was probably only an hour or two before the game.</p>
              <p>“When you are in difficult times as a player,
              have a dip in confidence, you need people around you supporting you and
              believing in you, giving you confidence.</p>
              <p>“I didn’t have that at the time. You just
              get a feeling if you’re not part of a manager’s plans. The manager had
              his opinions but there was no great communication from him.”</p>
              <p>Robinson is back in the England fold and has his eyes trained on a place at the 2010 World Cup.</p>
              <p>He said: “I’ve enjoyed being involved in the last couple of squads and it’s a reward for the performances I’ve been putting in.</p>
              <p>“There’s a big tournament coming up in 2010 and I think everyone wants to be involved in that - but there’s a long way to go.</p>
