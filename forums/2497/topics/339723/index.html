              <p><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claims football is "living in fear" of a ruling which could throw the transfer market into turmoil. Andy Webster triggered a loophole in employment laws when he was allowed to cancel his contract with Hearts in the third year of his four-year stay, provided he gave enough notice and moved to a club in a foreign country.</strong></p>
              <p>Webster won his case after taking it to the European Court of Human Rights, and Wenger has major concerns on what the eventual implications will be.</p>
              <p>The Gunners have star players like Cesc Fabregas in talks over extending their current deals, and the Frenchman admits it is imperative that the Spain international puts pen to paper.</p>
              <p>He told the <em>Sunday Express</em>: "There is a wind of change blowing through football. It could affect many clubs. We must all be wary. "We are living in fear at the moment. Who knows what the future might hold?</p>
              <p>"Cesc could leave under the ruling. But I know he loves it here. It is important also we get him to sign the new deal offered."</p>
              <p>The Gunners boss believes that clubs below the Premier League could be hit harder by players looking to move on for nothing after three years. He added: "Many in football forget that the 'Webster Rule' exists. After three years a player can either sign a deal or go.</p>
              <p>"Top clubs might handle this but, at a lower level, it could ruin them. "Agents at the moment have been reluctant to go into the Webster ruling. "But it will happen in the same way as the Bosman ruling. Football is in fear at the moment."</p>

              current contract expires.</h2>
              <p class="article">The 21-year-old Spanish international was linked with a move to Real Madrid 
              last summer before pledging his future to the Gunners.</p>
              <p class="article">He signed an eight-year contract with Arsene Wenger's side two years ago and 
              is tied to the club until 2014.</p>
              <p class="article">But the newly-installed Arsenal captain admits he will seek a move back to his 
              homeland when his existing deal ends.</p>
              <p class="article">Fabregas said: "Everybody knows that one day I will return to Spanish 
              football.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's an experience I want to live. I want to play in Spain as a 
              professional before I retire.</p>
              <p class="article">"The idea has always been the same. That's why I signed such a long 
              contract."</p>
              <p class="article">Despite his admission, the former Barcelona prodigy insists he has no 
              intentions of leaving the Emirates — for now.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "Nobody in football has a guaranteed place anywhere.</p>
              <p class="article">“Today everything is so changeable, so complicated that you never know.</p>
              <p class="article">“But the truth is that I'm very happy, very motivated and being captain is an 
              extra incentive.”</p>
