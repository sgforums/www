              <p class="imageCaption">Game for a laugh: Jose Mourinho jokes with his Inter Milan players</p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1202451" rel="1202451|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1202451/Inter-Milan-boss-Jose-Mourinho-eyes-Manchester-United-post-Sir-Alex-Ferguson-departs.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho has admitted that he would consider the </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> job when Sir Alex Ferguson eventually retires.</strong></p>
              <p>The former <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> boss is entering his second season with Italian giants Inter Milan, where he won the Serie A crown in May.</p>
              <p>Mourinho is highly rated in this country after winning two titles with the Blues, although his reputation at United was tarnished last season when he was alleged to have punched a fan after Inter's Champions League defeat at Old Trafford. No action was taken against the Portuguese.</p>
              <p>Yet, with Ferguson likely to step down at some point in the next two or three years, Mourinho could head the list of potential candidates.</p>
              <p>'I would consider going to Manchester United but United have to consider if their want me to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson, he said. 'If they do, then of course. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/27/article-1202451-05D0026D000005DC-629_306x423.jpg" alt="Sir Alex Ferguson" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Legend: Sir Alex Ferguson will one day wave goodbye to Manchester United</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>'I like England where the fans are very passionate and make a game a beautiful occasion with an incredible atmosphere.</strong></p>
              <p>'I had many conversations before Chelsea and I decided on a divorce. It was difficult because we loved each other but the relationship went in one direction and it was best for everyopne.</p>
              <p>'Since I left I became champion again but they have not been champions again. I keep winning and they don't.' </p>
              <p>Mourinho led Inter to another Serie A title last season and wants to bring the Champions League to the club 54 years after their last European Cup success.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I have a project in hand and I am very excited. When I went to Chelsea the big obsession was to win the Premier League after half a century. At Inter winning the Italian League is very important but we have something else on our minds.'</p>
              <p>Mourinho will use Samuel Eto'o to spearhead his attack this season after star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic moved to Barcelona in the opposite direction.</p>

              <p>he likes to create war w every other managers and then he can create something out of nothing by accusing the ref bias etc. remember the ref who was forced to quit the game few years ago lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he like his team to play well defensively and like to play 2 defensive midfielders to protect the back 4. when his team is leading, he likes to kill the game off by parking the bus in front of the goalpost. his football philosophy is different from fergie and wenger. sure he can win you titles no doubt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>these are the questions the owner and the board would need to discuss. you want trophies, and at the same time, playing sexy football, or win trophies while playing stale football?</p>

              <p>on a neutral stand, i think that jose will suit utd. afterall
              he's alr proven in epl, and he showed that he can bring back
              titles. he's a good fighter, both on and off the field. but maybe
              his tactics abit not so likening to everyone, i find it ok though,
              my friends doesnt really like the way jose manage chelsea, saying
              that they find him too defensive, but to me, i think ok lar. i nvr
              really paid attention on how jose actually play his starting 11
              back then, but i do heard of that he likes to play 2 defensive
              midfielder is it? although so, i still think that that's a balance
              in his ways of attack and defending, as normally his wingers are
              being played wide apart on the two sides of the field.</p>

              <p>imho, I think Jose made Chelsea more mechanical, not sure whether it is same as defensive with his players. (Not taking Ballack and Shev into equation). He made the game efficient and points gathering a sprint. These change EPL, and MUFC adapted well.</p>
              <p>Well, for one, if he come to MUFC, he can't buy much players as per in Chelsea, so he has to make with what he got.</p>
              <p>second, his way of dealing with press/managers is unique, and I do believe in a way, suits MUFC.</p>
              <p>so don't be surprised if he comes in.. but pls, no deco, drogba, lampard or etc..</p>
