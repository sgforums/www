Spurs chief Juande Ramos offered Â£10m for the England star plus Â£2m-rated Finnish utility midfielder Teemu Tainio. </strong><br><br>Downing, 23, is unsettled at The Riverside and told boss Gareth Southgate this week he was considering his future. A product of the famed Boro youth academy, Downing is ready for a fresh challenge and would welcome a move down south to White Hart Lane.<br><br>Former Spurs chief Martin Jol targeted Downing during his time in North London. And chairman Daniel Levy has now given Spaniard Ramos the nod to make his move. Downing is very highly thought of by Southgate. But doubts began to surface over his future after he admitted earlier this season that being booed by sections of the Riverside faithful had been hard to deal with.<br><br>Tainio, 28, has been in and out of the side under Ramos Â— who also considered using out of favour England keeper Paul Robinson as bait to land Downing. It is a major blow to Southgate who was desperate to keep hold of the talented wide man. But the Boro boss will use the cash to land strike targets Afonso Alves of Heerenveen and LyonÂ’s Brazilian ace Fred.<br><br>Boro host Liverpool today and ROBERT HUTH could be forgiven for having sleepless nights at the prospect of facing Fernando Torres. But the defender is just happy to be playing after an injury nightmare.<br><br>Huth, who has started the last three games, said: Â“It does your head in every day you canÂ’t get on the pitch. I thank everyone who has helped me to get back.Â”<br><br></div>
