              <div><span><strong>William Gallas admits he has had to reassert his authority as Arsenal captain after conceding he 'flipped his lid' against Birmingham City last season. French defender Gallas was given the armband by Arsene Wenger ahead of the 2007/08 campaign, but blotted his copybook in a 2-2 draw at St Andrews in February.</strong> </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Birmingham were awarded a last-minute penalty and, in protest at the decision, Gallas retreated to the halfway line and sat down sulking. </p>
              <p>The result was seen as a pivotal moment in Arsenal's faltering title bid and Gallas acknowledged he made a mistake with his actions. He believes some of the criticism aimed in his direction was unfair, but is confident he still has the backing of his team-mates to be Gunners skipper. </p>
              <p>Gallas told <em>L'Equipe Magazine</em>: "The controversy about my captaincy? People had to find a scapegoat as we didn't win any trophies last season. "So, they talked and talked again about the Birmingham match. Indeed I made a mistake. I must admit I flipped my lid. We should have won that game easily. </p>
              <p>"Before Arsenal, I spent six years at Chelsea. That team was capable of getting ugly wins. If we had an opportunity to win a cup, we would never miss it. "There I became imbued with the winning culture, which doesn't exist yet at Arsenal. </p>
              <p>"Of course, some of my Arsenal team-mates could not have appreciated my behaviour against Birmingham. "I had to state my authority again and today when I motivate them before a match, they say; 'Capi, we need you, we are following you'. "If I would have been an unworthy captain, they would have banned me. </p>
              <p>"The critics went much too far. Maybe I put myself under too much pressure, like Arsene Wenger said. "I believed I had a message to give to my team-mates and I could not find the right words. </p>
              <p>"Our game made people dream, but we had empty hands. We have to show a more clinical state of mind. At the end of last season there was such a frustration inside me!"</p>
