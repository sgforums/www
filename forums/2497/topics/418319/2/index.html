              <p><span><strong>The decision to postpone the eagerly-awaited clash between Chelsea and Manchester United was taken by the Metropolitan Police and Hammersmith and Fulham Council. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Health and safety concerns meant the Barclays Premier League fixture was postponed more than 27 hours before Sunday's scheduled 4pm kick-off. </span></p>
              <p><span>A Chelsea spokesman said: 'The match was postponed on health and safety grounds. The decision was taken between the local authority, the club and the police. </span></p>
              <p><span>'With the downpour of snow on Saturday morning, it wasn't just conditions around the stadium but the whole Fulham area. There were concerns about people getting to the ground, as well as staffing at the game and police staffing.' </span></p>
              <p><span>United defender Rio Ferdinand was less than impressed. Ferdinand wrote on Twitter: 'Did any1 see the Ipswich game yesterday? Pitch covered in snow... so how was that game played and ours (premier league) is postponed? </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/12/19/article-1340059-0C89A4C3000005DC-484_634x316.jpg" alt="Game on: Wasps game at Adams Park went ahead despite the snowy conditions " width="634" height="316">

              <p><span><strong>'It's our country's fault - we can't deal with snow. How did we not prepare ourselves though? It's not like it crept up on us, we knew it was coming.' </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Ferdinand then commented 'Wow' on a post from a fan on Saturday, which read: 'No Heineken Cup rugby games have been called off - do rugby fans travel on different roads to football fans?'</span></p>
              <p><span>A deluge of snow hit west London on Saturday morning. Snow was also forecast between 3-6pm yesterday, with temperatures dipping to -2ËšC. </span></p>
              <p><span>Some train services between Manchester and Euston were cancelled yesterday afternoon but the District Line on the London Underground, which serves Stamford Bridge, reported a 'good service'.</span></p>
              <p><span>There would have been no problems with the pitch. Stamford Bridge has a water pipe system, which acts like a radiator as hot water is pumped under the pitch. </span></p>
              <p><span>A police spokesman said: 'There were concerns over public safety. Clubs generally do a very good job of getting the stadium fit for use, but travel to and from the game would have been difficult.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Clubs liaise with the police in the run-up to a game and are in regular contact. <strong>The final decision is made by the club.'</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span>In fact, this is not the case. Under Premier League rule E13, a match can be postponed or abandoned only if it clashes with a Champions League, Europa League or FA Cup fixture; by 'order of the police or any other authority exercising its statutory powers', with the approval or on the instruction of the referee or with the 'prior written consent' of the Premier League board. </span></p>
              <p><span>The home club cannot make the decision. The Premier League was satisfied the match should be postponed, but United were happy to travel. They planned to take the 2.34pm train from Manchester Piccadilly on Saturday. But at 12.50pm, manager Sir Alex Ferguson learned the game was off.</span></p>

              <p>I wouldn't call it a sure chance as you put it but it was an opportunity without a doubt...</p>
              <p>Cos with Alex and Essien out, Lampard not fully fit and might not even last 60 mins or much lesser... Along with Drogba and Malouda no form and the whole team having a lack of confidence issue, I believed many saw it as a great opportunity...</p>
              <p>The postponement was naturally seen by many United fans and some honest neutrals as an escape route until they get their act together...  Cos United are presently an on form side while Chelsea isn't... So who would you rather meet? A Chelsea at the beginning of the season picking up 15 out of 15 points and scoring 21 goals in 5 matches or A Chelsea who have only pick up 3 points out of a possible 15 and having only scored 3 in their last 5 matches including getting thrashed at home during that time? I think just ask Sunderland and I believe the answer is clear.</p>
              <p>But to be honest, if the reverse was in play... I would understand if the United people would scramble and tried their best or beg the Manchester police or in this case the London ones to have the match cancelled too... But to make an excuse, they should find something more believable since rugby during that week or to be more precise, that day went on without reports of fans safety being a concern at all... Right?</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, Chelsea will be a stronger side come March, thats the difference and probably the reason for this postponement... That's my belief...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I am quite surprise people are still keeping this thread going... But I am happy to join in... lol.</p>
