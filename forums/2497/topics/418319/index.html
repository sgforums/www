              <p><span><strong>Chelsea invited fresh controversy by postponing today’s titanic Premier League match with Manchester United more than 24 hours before kick off. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>While clubs across the country, from Sunderland to Exeter, managed to stage matches in the Premier League and Championship on Saturday afternoon, Chelsea informed United officials before lunchtime yesterday that the most eagerly-anticipated game of the season would not be played. </span></p>
              <p><span>Incredibly, Chelsea justified their decision, delivered with unusual haste, by claiming the game had to be called off ‘following consultation with police and the local authority’.</span></p>
              <p><span>A brief statement on the club’s website read: ‘There has been heavy snow in London on Saturday.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>United fear the postponement will present both clubs with an unwanted fixture pile-up as their expected rivalry for the title enters the critical post-Christmas period. </span></p>
              <p><span>‘This could give us a real problem,’ said United spokesman Phil Townsend yesterday.</span></p>
              <p><span>Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp perhaps captured the mood of most football fans when he expressed his astonishment that Chelsea had acted so swiftly to halt the game with United.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘Tomorrow’s another day and who knows what the weather will be like in the morning?’ said Redknapp, who learned that Tottenham’s match at Blackpool at lunchtime today had been postponed while he waited with his players for a flight north from Stanstead Airport yesterday. </span></p>
              <p><span>‘I have to say, I couldn’t believe it when I heard Chelsea against United was already off. You’d have thought the Stamford Bridge pitch, which has under-soil heating, would have been playable, so there must be other reasons for the game to be postponed that we don’t know about. </span></p>
              <p><span>'At Blackpool, the pitch was frozen because they don’t have under-soil heating and that was always going to be a problem. At Chelsea, they must be worried about the surrounding areas to the ground. Even so, it is still a surprise that the game was called off so early.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p>Chelsea’s rush to postpone the match has come when the club are dealing with the fall-out from a poor sequence of results. It also follows a rash of bad publicity and speculation over the future of manager, Carlo Ancelotti. </p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea have won only one of their last seven matches and while Frank Lampard was supposed to start his first match in five months against United this afternoon, there remain concerns over his fitness. Star striker Didier Drogba is another doubt after a bout of malaria. </strong></p>
              <p>As well as attracting criticism for sacking coach Ray Wilkins against the wishes of Ancelotti, the club have also received the resignation of director of football Frank Arnesen.</p>
              <p>Critics of the club will be keen to point these out as they consider Chelsea’s willingness to get the game with United postponed early, rather than waiting until late morning today to inspect the weather and conditions at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Only a fortnight ago, Chelsea publicly argued on their own website: ‘In this day and age, with all the modern technology, it is very rare you get a game called off. The pitch would have to be frozen solid or completely under water to be called off, which shouldn’t happen at Stamford Bridge.’ </p>
              <p>Head groundsman Jason Griffin said: ‘At Stamford Bridge, we have a water pipe system. It’s like a big radiator pumping hot water under the pitch to keep it warm. You set the temperature to go up and down, depending on the weather forecast. It’s usually between 15 and 20 degrees Centigrade. If the temperature ever gets too high, I get an alert on my phone and I would know there was a problem.’
              </p><p>Across London, Arsenal did not postpone yesterday’s match with Stoke until less than three hours before the game. </p>
              <p>An Arsenal statement read: ‘Further to a huge deluge of snow in North London, starting over the Emirates Stadium at 11.38am, match referee Lee Mason made the decision at 12.07pm to postpone today’s match. Approximately three inches of snow fell over this half-hour period and there continues to be heavy snowfall with no apparent let-up.’</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>In contrast, Manchester United secretary John Alexander informed Sir Alex Ferguson at 12.50pm yesterday that Chelsea had declared the game could not be played today.</p>
              <p>Ferguson and his players were at United’s Carrington training ground and had seats booked on the 2.34pm train from Manchester Piccadilly to London.</p>
              <p>United and Chelsea must now unravel heavy fixture congestion to try to arrive at a mutually convenient day to rearrange the match ahead of the London club’s visit to Old Trafford on May 7. </p>
              <p>Townsend explained the difficulties when he said: ‘We have rearranged our recently postponed match with Blackpool for January 25, but it’s hard to see a new date for Chelsea. Although we have a Carling Cup semi-final date free, on January 11 or 12, I don’t think we will want to play then as we have Liverpool in the FA Cup third round on January 9; and Tottenham away on January 16. </p>
              <p>‘Then, in February and March, we play our Champions League matches against Marseille in weeks two and four, while Chelsea play theirs against FC Copenhagen in weeks one and three. Of course, the longer both teams are in the FA Cup, the more difficult it will be to rearrange the match.’ </p>
              
              <p>Yesterday, Premier League matches at Sunderland and Blackburn were played without incident, while games in the Championship at Leeds, Sheffield United, Hull, Nottingham Forest, Coventry, Derby and Ipswich all went ahead as planned, as did Exeter's League One fixture against Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Sheffield United, relying on the under-soil heating at Bramall Lane, won three vital points with a 1-0 win over Swansea to ease themselves away from the relegation zone.</p>
              <p>Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers was unable to explain how more Championship matches than in the Premier League had survived the snowy conditions.</p>
              <p>‘I don’t know why more Championship matches have gone ahead maybe we think there are fewer dates that we can fit them back in,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you look at the pitch here, the groundstaff have done a fantastic job.’ </p>
              <p>Chelsea’s groundstaff were denied the chance to receive any such tributes from Ferguson today, thanks to a decision taken before lunchtime yesterday. </p>

              <hr>
              <div id="post_message_51368914"><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/855910?cc=4716">http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/st...855910?cc=4716</a><br> <br> In-form Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri will not be getting a Christmas 
              card from Manchester United after claiming they would not have beaten 
              Chelsea in their postponed match.<br> <br> Just a week after losing to United at Old Trafford, Nasri said the 
              Premier League frontrunners are still well within range of Arsenal in 
              the title race, saying they could also struggle to win their precious 
              game in hand against Blackpool.<br> <br> "I think the title is definitely within our reach," Nasri said in The 
              Sun. "For a start, United were supposed to play against Chelsea and I 
              couldn't see them winning that. I also think their game in hand isn't a 
              foregone conclusion because winning at Blackpool is not easy. <br> I really think we have quality and we've got the maturity now that we 
              were lacking before. We'll see how we cope with all the matches over 
              Christmas and we will get a clearer idea after that - but I'm full of 
              confidence."<br> <br> Nasri has arguably been Arsenal's best player this season, filling the 
              creative void with captain Cesc Fabregas injured for long periods. He 
              credits his form with the fact he was overlooked for France's doomed 
              World Cup campaign.<br> <br> "I'm just trying to give back all my coach and my team-mates have given 
              me. I had a proper pre-season so I can keep going and I've been spared 
              injuries, so that means I can keep getting better every game. Especially
               after everything that went on [at the World Cup], when you see the end 
              result, it's a mal pour un bien - evil for good. It meant I could take a
               look at myself and I got it in my head that I had to come back even 
              stronger and show I was good enough for the French team."</div>

              Christmas card from Manchester United after claiming they would not
              have beaten Chelsea in their postponed match.<br> <br> Just a week after losing to United at Old Trafford, Nasri said the
              Premier League frontrunners are still well within range of Arsenal
              in the title race, saying they could also struggle to win their
              precious game in hand against Blackpool.<br> <br> "I think the title is definitely within our reach," Nasri said in
              The Sun. "For a start, United were supposed to play against Chelsea
              and I couldn't see them winning that. I also think their game in
              hand isn't a foregone conclusion because winning at Blackpool is
              not easy.<br> I really think we have quality and we've got the maturity now that

              over Christmas and we will get a clearer idea after that - but I'm

              the creative void with captain Cesc Fabregas injured for long
              periods. He credits his form with the fact he was overlooked for
              France's doomed World Cup campaign.<br> <br> "I'm just trying to give back all my coach and my team-mates have
              given me. I had a proper pre-season so I can keep going and I've
              been spared injuries, so that means I can keep getting better every

              <div><strong>The Premier League have declared themselves 'satisfied' that the decision taken to postpone Chelsea v Manchester United was correct, amid mounting bewilderment that the game was called off more than 24 hours before the scheduled kick-off.</strong></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p> </p>
              <p>The club have cited 'the conditions around the stadium and the whole Fulham area' as the reason why the top-of-the-table clash was postponed. But the decision has been questioned in some quarters, with <span style="color: #000000;">Rio Ferdinand</span> asking on twitter: "Did any1 see the ipswich game??? Pitch covered in SNOW....so how was that game played and ours(premier league) is postponed??"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guardian journalist Daniel Taylor has also voiced his bafflement on the website, remarking: "All sorts of reports from Chelsea/Fulham of conditions outside SB 'not bad at all' 'only slushy' 'pavements well gritted'. Is it really postponed because someone might slip outside? Would they cancel a gig at Earls Court?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The decision taken to postpone the match was taken early on Saturday afternoon, approximately 26 hours before the game was due to kick-off. With no further snow falling in West London, it has led The Daily Mail to enquire: "The main roads were clear, the Tube was running, and the pitch perfect... so why was Chelsea's game with United postponed?'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The answer according to a Chelsea spokesman is that the decision was made on "health and safety grounds" following consultation "between the local authority, the club and the police. With the downpour of snow on Saturday morning, it wasn't just conditions around the stadium but the whole Fulham area. There were concerns about people getting to the ground, as well as staffing at the game and police staffing."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, the <span style="color: #000000;">republikofmancunia website</span> has continued to question whether 'Chelsea can justify the postponement' by publishing pictures of empty and clear roads around Stamford Bridge at the time the game was scheduled to be play.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'The trains from Manchester to London were running on Saturday, they are still running today [Sunday]. The only Tube line which is closed is Waterloo and City (Stamford Bridge is on the District line),' the website notes. 'If this morning CFC felt the conditions were too dangerous after their consultation with the police, then fair enough. But as the pictures show and the public transport confirm, there is no reason why the game couldn't have been played.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'The majority of the stadium would be filled with Londoners, who didn't need any advance warning. The vast majority of those coming from Manchester wouldn't have set off until this morning anyway, so where is the logic in making such an early decision?'</p>

              <p>true la.. ur pts are valid, but it is just the matter of timing that drew so much talk. if U see the timeline, it seems chelsea was too eager to call off the game as compared to others. and given their poor form, this drew suspicision.but, of course, we all know that MUFC has problems winning @ the bridge for the last few years. so even if the game went ahead, chelsea will trounce MUFC, 101% confirmed, chopped, stamped.</p>

              <p>true la.. ur pts are valid, but it is just the matter of timing
              that drew so much talk. if U see the timeline, it seems chelsea was
              too eager to call off the game as compared to others. and given
              their poor form, this drew suspicision.but, of course, we all know
              that MUFC has problems winning @ the bridge for the last few years.
              so even if the game went ahead, chelsea will trounce MUFC, 101%
              confirmed, chopped, stamped.</p>
