              <p><strong>SEOUL - South Korea has
              rejected claims by North Korea that it poisoned its players before last
              week's 2010 World Cup qualifier in Seoul, as tensions mounted over the
              North's long-range rocket launch on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A statement carried by North
              Korea's official news agency KCNA on Sunday called the alleged
              poisoning "a product of (South Korean President) Lee Myung-bak group's
              moves for confrontation with the DPRK (North Korea) and a deliberate
              behaviour bred by the unsavoury forces instigated by it."</p>
              <p>It also accused the match's
              Omani referee of bias, adding: "The match thus turned into a theatre of
              plot-breeding and swindling."</p>
              <p>In Wednesday's Group Two
              qualifier, South Korea scored with three minutes remaining to beat the
              North 1-0, with the visitors furious that Jong Tae-se's second-half
              header, which appeared to have crossed the line, was ruled out by the
              referee.</p>
              <p>Kim Joo-sung, (South) Korean
              Football Association (KFA) international affairs chief, said the
              accusations were politically motivated and baseless.</p>
              <p>"The statement sets a high
              political tone, not about the sport itself. There's no need to respond
              to it," Kim was quoted as saying by South Korean news agency Yonhap on
              Monday.</p>
              <p>"If an accident happens during
              training or transit, and it affects the match, the host country should
              take responsibility for the accident.</p>
              <p>"But matters related to hotels or the food are the responsibility of the visiting team."</p>
              <p>The North Korean statement came
              amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula surrounding Sunday's
              launch of a long-range rocket, which triggered international outrage
              and prompted the U.N. security Council to call an emergency meeting.</p>
              <p>South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Myung-hwan said the launch was a "provocative act" that threatened peace and stability.</p>
              <p>KFA president Cho Chung-yun,
              who is also a vice-president for soccer's world governing body FIFA,
              rejected the North's demands for an apology over the alleged poisoning
              and said no further action was needed.</p>
              <p>"North Korea decided on
              everything, including accommodation, and we were never involved in the
              process," local media quoted him as saying. "It's not a matter to
              investigate."</p>
              <p>South Korea lead World Cup
              qualifying Group Two on 11 points, followed by North Korea and Saudi
              Arabia on 10 points. The top two automatically qualify for South Africa
              2010.</p>
