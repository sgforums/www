              <p><em>Saha scored Everton's third but not that he knew much about it.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LOUIS SAHA had the last laugh as Chelsea's winless streak was extended to FOUR games. The French striker had a hand in Petr Cech's own goal opener and also levelled the clash with Everton's third — not that he knew much about it.</h2>
              <p class="article">Didier Drogba did his best to seal a first win since the Blues victory over Arsenal two weeks ago by netting twice. But he was to blame as his headed clearance comically deflected off Saha and into the Blues net.</p>
              <p class="article">Nicolas Anelka also got on the scoresheet but Cech's blunder, Yakubu's first league goal of the season and Saha's late equaliser sealed a point for the Toffees.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea had the first chance of the match when Michael Ballack put Drogba clear but the striker's effort was just wide. Everton hit back when Jo unleashed a 25-yard drive that Cech did well to turn away for a corner. And the Toffees went in front in the 12th minute when the home side were again caught out from a set-piece.</p>
              <p class="article">Leighton Baines sent the free-kick into the penalty area, Saha headed the ball on to the post, and it rebounded off the back of Cech and into the net. Not since the opening day when Hull's Stephen Hunt scored, had any opposing domestic side found the net at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea's response needed to be swift — and it certainly was. The home side were level just fives minutes later as Ricardo Carvalho broke forward before supplying a superb pass for Frank Lampard to find Drogba.</p>
              <p class="article">The Ivorian hit a first-time shot into the roof of the net for his 17th goal this season. Anelka then put Chelsea in front in the 23rd minute when Everton failed to clear Lampard's corner. The Frenchman collected Carvalho's neat pass and fired into the roof of the net from close range.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea were now the dominant force but Everton still posed the home side problems from set-pieces. The Blues' defence looked suspect in the air as Baines free-kicks continuted to threaten.</p>
              <p class="article">Lampard hit the wall with a 36th-minute free-kick and Drogba's volley from the rebound was well wide. A shot from Anelka a minute before the break forced Tim Howard to save at the second attempt.</p>
              <p class="article">Everton, already ravaged by injuries, then had to replace Jo with Yakubu after the Brazilian collided with Carvalho. And the sub striker shocked the Blues with an equaliser when Terry's clearance bounced off Carvalho and Yakubu pounced.</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>Carlo Ancelotti resisted making any changes at half-time and his side began the second period in a positive fashion. And in the 58th minute their pressure paid off when Branislav Ivanovic crossed for Drogba to score his 18th of the season.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">He fired home from six yards at the far post after Everton's defence failed to intercept the cross from the Serbian. But astonishingly Chelsea again committed defensive suicide in the 63rd minute with yet another set-piece blunder. It was a comical affair as Johnny Heitinga sent over a free-kick into the Chelsea penalty area.</p>
              <p class="article">Drogba, helping out in a defensive role, headed the ball into the back of the leaping Saha and it bounced back over Cech and into the empty net.</p>
              <p class="article">Lampard had the chance to win it in injury time but he screwed his shot wide.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>For all the stars Chelsea had, they could not overcome the spirit of the injury ravaged Everton. As much as I am a liverpool fan, I must say that Everton has a spirit that never gives up. CHelsea has only conceded once at home this whole season and in just one game, they conceded 3 to a injury ravaged Everton. Not because Chelsea sucked, simply because Everton never knew when to give up.</p></div>

              <p>The goals Chelsea gave away were rather weird... From the first to the third all were preventable...</p>
              <p>And its true that Chelsea have not concede a goal since the opening day and even then, only 1... So to let in 3 in that fashion was quite unthinkable. I thought they would have gone on to win the match once Drogba equalised then Anelka gave them the lead... At that point, i thought that's it... its over... Now its just a matter of how many they will win by only... Then the weird goals came...</p>
              <p>The strangest of the 3 must be the third one... I think Saha didn't even know he scored until he turn around...</p>

They make the set pieces count and like the commentator said, tonight Everton found Chelsea's Achilles Heels. When JO went out injured, I was like, WOW Everton must have offended the footballing gods, they have an no ending list of injuries but guess what, Yakabu came in to score an equaliser and that equaliser came because they keep harassing for every ball. Wonderful spirit I must say and perhaps that is something that  Chelsea did not have for the night</p></div>

              <p class="article">The keeper is furious with home fans who jeered after the 3-3 draw with Everton.</p>
              <p class="article">Cech said: "I was very surprised to hear the boos from the crowd because this was our first Premier League draw at home all season.</p>
