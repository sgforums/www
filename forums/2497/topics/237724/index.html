            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/mourkeny.jpg"><br><br><strong>CHELSEA have told supporters to forget cheaper tickets Â— because the clubÂ’s millionaire players are demanding massive pay rises. </strong><br><br>Chief executive Peter Kenyon revealed everyone is queueing up to get their hands on the revenue from the new Â£625million TV deal. And, despite The SunÂ’s Â‘Cut the cost of footballÂ’ campaign, Kenyon made it clear to a Blues fansÂ’ forum that their sky-high wage bill means they cannot afford to cut prices next season.<br><br>Kenyon claimed: Â“A reduction in prices is a difficult topic because other sectors of the business want their share of the TV cash and the players also want a slice.Â” The bombshell came as Frank Lampard and John Terry are demanding Â£6.3million-a-year contracts to put them on a par with top earners Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko.<br><br>SupportersÂ’ representatives had calculated that slashing Â£5 off every Premiership ticket next season would cost Chelsea just Â£4m. They argued that could be funded by the massive increase in TV money which the club will receive next term.<br><br>Every club in the Premiership is guaranteed a minimum of Â£30m a season when the new deal kicks in, with the champions getting Â£50m. But those hopes were quickly kicked into touch by Kenyon at a meeting with a group of 15 fans before last Saturday's home game against Middlesbrough.<br><br>Kenyon, accompanied by operations director Ron Gourlay and ticket manager Graham Smith, spent 2Â½ hours with fansÂ’ forum representatives. Chelsea are currently the second most expensive club in the country for supporters, with only Arsenal charging more.<br><br>The cheapest tickets for a match at Stamford Bridge start at Â£35 and season tickets cost up to a staggering Â£1,150 a year. Yet the club bankrolled by Roman AbramovichÂ’s billions are still set to announce a massive loss when the financial figures for 2005-06 are revealed next Monday.<br><br>Kenyon is under increasing pressure to start balancing the books after announcing record losses of Â£88m in 2005 and a further Â£140m last year. That task has been made virtually impossible by an annual wage bill which has soared beyond Â£125m over the past season.<br><br>But Chelsea fan Paul Fletcher, from Woking, countered: Â“The players donÂ’t seem to have any understanding of the costs involved in following the team. Â“I know some Chelsea fans who pay more than Â£1,000 a year. But I simply canÂ’t afford that sort of money.Â”<br><br>A Chelsea spokesman insisted: "No decision has yet been made on ticket prices for next season. We have consulted the fans and their comments will be taken into consideration.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have to agree with the Chelsea fan Paul Fletcher. The players are really a selfish lot thinking only about themselves, neglecting the fans' pocket. Most humans are selfish anyway, just that for this case it's way too much in my opinion.</div>

Unlike Arsenal whose is charging more but their "season tickets holders" demand exceed that of chelsea. That is why they don't have a problem filling their 60,000 stadium.<br><br>In chelsea's case, its completely different, They can't even fill their stadium every week unless its a "big" match. So where do you go and find these Extra fans who wants to buy these season tickets?<br><br>Season tickets holders are like for those who wants to watch every week regardless its a big match or a average team coming... and from the looks that they have problems filling their stadium whenever a not so attractive fixture is on the cards, i would say they probably don't have enough...<br><br>And increasing ticket price doesn't necessarily makes crowd troubles goes away, If anything, the present crowd are already very well behave.</div>
