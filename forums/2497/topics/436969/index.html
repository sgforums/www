              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>French champions Lille were convinced they had all but wrapped up a deal for the 26-year-old before Gunners boss Arsene Wenger swooped.</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Park, who had previously been linked with Fulham, would become Wenger's fifth summer signing and help offset the loss of Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri. </span></p>

And the decision had to be what I want and won't regret."<br><br>Park's move to Arsenal, which will cost an initial fee of around £3 million, has been endorsed by Cho Kwang Rae, the national team manager.<br><br>He said: "He [Park] will playing many games in the EPL, he will be able to grow into a better player. It might be helpful for the national team."<br><br>It is understood that Arsenal made bigger fee and contract offers than Lille, which was enough to seal the transfer. Park did not show for the second part of his medical on Saturday morning after undergoing the first part on Friday afternoon. Lille officials discovered that his hotel room was empty, with not a word about where he had gone, and tracked him down at the Eurostar terminal, where Park told them he was heading for London to sign for Arsenal.<br><br>Park's u-turn has left a sour taste at the French club, who had fully expected to unveil him at the weekend after all but finalising the player's move back to Ligue 1 from Ligue 2, where Monaco were relegated last season.<br><br>How long Park will be at Arsenal is unclear, as all able-bodied men in South Korea must begin military service for the country's armed forces before the age of 28. Unless the darling of the national team is excused service, he will have to leave Arsenal in 2013.<br><br></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Only Sir Alex Ferguson has won more than Wenger’s three Premier League trophies as manager and if it wasn’t for Manchester United, Arsenal would have dominated the English game between 1997 and 2004 – and that’s before you mention the 'Invincibles.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Add to that four FA Cups as well as a couple of European finals and you have a manager who has proven time and again the Gunners can compete at the top with him at the helm.</span></p>
              <p><span><strong>Talent spotter</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Vieira, Henry, Fabregas - and that’s just the big hitters. Wenger has brought in many players who were either unknown youngsters or players struggling in their careers and turned them into household names.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">When one of his key players does leave, the youth system he can pick from is one of the best in the country.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p><strong>Bouncing back</strong></p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Wenger has been written off before and answered straight back to his critics. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Since 2002 and has never failed to finish in the top four – despite pundits in the last few years predicting otherwise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Even when a prize asset is sold and the squad looks thin, Wenger always finds a way to keep his team battling at the top.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>Experience</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Having been at the club for 15 years Wenger knows Arsenal inside out. If there is a problem facing him at the Emirates Stadium, the chances are he has seen them before and knows better than anyone else how they can be dealt with.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘In Arsene we trust’ has been a common theme for a number of years amongst fans, and although Wenger doesn’t always get it right, he is in the best position to try and turn around the club’s fortunes.</span></p>

              <p>Mertesacke will then undergo a medical and be unveiled as an Arsenal player within the next 24 hours if he gets the all clear.</p>
              <p>The 26-year-old is in the German squad for their Euro 2012 qualification game at home to Austria on Friday.</p>
              <p>But national boss Joachim Loew has granted him permission to leave the training camp in order to finalise his move to the Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>Loew said: "Last night I told the player 'I am giving you a free day' and I expect he will come back this evening.</p>
              <p>"I know there was a specific offer from a club."</p>
              <p>Mertesacker would provide much-needed height and experience at the back, standing at 6ft 6in and boasting 75 international caps.</p>
              <p>He started his career at Hannover 96 in 2003 before moving to Bremen in a £4m deal five years ago.</p>
              <p>Bremen general manager Klaus Allofs added: "Per has had the wish to join a big European club for some time. Arsenal was always his favourite club."</p>

              <h1>Arsenal announce Park capture</h1>
              <p>Arsenal have announced the signing of South Korea striker Park Chu Young from Monaco, subject to the formal registration processes.</p>
              <p><a class="thickbox" title="Park: Heading to Arsenal" href="http://images.football365.com/11/04/800x600/Chu-Young-Park_2583775.jpg"><img src="http://images.football365.com/11/04/640/Chu-Young-Park_2583775.jpg" alt="Park: Heading to Arsenal"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Park has penned what is thought to be an initial two-year contract, amid reports he will be forced to return home in 2013 for a period of military service.</strong></p>
              <p>The fee for the 26-year-old is reported to be £3million up front, plus a further potential £2million in add-ons.</p>
              <p>The Gunners have signed Park from under the noses of Lille, who were convinced they had reached an agreement for the player to join them on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Park's representative, Maurizio Morana, says it was too good an opportunity for his client to pass up when Arsenal made their interest clear.</p>
              <p>"We could not imagine what happened. On Friday, Arsenal contacted Monaco to know if an agreement had been found with Lille about a transfer," Morana told France Football.</p>
              <p>"As it was not the case, Arsenal started to negotiate, then asked to contact the player.</p>
              <p>"Could you imagine how a player from Monaco could refuse such a club?</p>
              <p>"As he should come back to his native Korea later in 2013 for military duties, this could be his last contract in Europe.</p>
              <p>"When Arsene Wenger directly calls a player and asks him to join Arsenal, it is difficult to refuse."</p>
              <p>Morana also rejected suggestions that Park's conduct demonstrated a lack of respect to Lille.</p>
              <p>"We are sorry for the Lille officials who acted in a very professional way, but I can't agree when I hear Park has no sense of morals," the agent stated.</p>
              <p>"There is no link with moral sense or honour, it is only football."</p>

              <p>Whatever it is, these players will do Arsenal no harm... In fact, I think they will be good for Wenger...</p>
              <p>I feel that the present Arsenal squad isn't totally bad, they are actually rather good but the timing of injuries and suspension are the real cause of their current plight... Once these players like <span style="color: #000000;">Kieran Gibbs</span><span style="color: #000000;">, Sagna, Vermaelen, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Abou Diaby</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Alex Song</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Jack Wilshere</span><span style="color: #000000;"> &amp; </span><span style="color: #000000;">Gervinho comes back plus the new additions like Per Metesacker, Andre Santos, <span style="color: #000000;">Park Chu-Young and what else before dateline, we can see their true strenght... Liverpool better watch out cos they can still catch them for 4th place...</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Benayoun has been told he can find a new club by Blues manager Andre Villas-Boas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Gunners, meanwhile, have completed the signing of Brazilian full-back Andre Santos from Fenerbache.<br></span></p>

              <p><br>8m for an england international, who can still play for 2 seasons at the top level not bad. he is english, no need to adapt to EPL playing style, as is Jageilka. maybe 10m for him. how old is he anyway? 28 rite? rodwell not bad, can bid for him for 15m. what if he turns out to be a gem, u never know.</p>

              <p class=" gr3ox"><br></p>
              <p class=" gr3ox"> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is relishing the chance to unleash Andre Santos on the Premier League after the left-back completed his £6.2million move from Fenerbahce. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Santos has signed a four-year deal with the Gunners worth around £40,000 a week. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Wenger, who has also completed the signing of Germany defender Per Mertesacker, said: 'Santos is a quality player, with the ability to both defend well and get forward and help with attacks. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p>'He has experience in the Champions League and for Brazil and has proven he can deliver at the highest level. <br></p>
              <p>'We welcome Santos to the club and look forward to him having a big impact for us.' </p>
              <p>The 28-year-old former Corinthians defender will wear No 11 for Arsenal with A Santos on the back of his shirt. </p>
              <p>Centre-back Mertesacker completed a medical and agreed personal terms on an £8m move but is heading straight back to rejoin the Germany squad for their clash with Austria on Friday.</p>
              <p>A club statement read: 'Arsenal has confirmed they have agreed terms with Werder Bremen to sign German international defender Per Mertesacker.</p>
              <p>'The deal is subject to the completion of formal registration processes.'</p>
              <p>Wenger has been busy in the final days of the transfer window, having brought in South Korea captain Park Chu-young from Monaco.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal manager is also expected to add at least one more new signing ahead of the deadline.</p>
              <p>With Scott Dann's imminent move to Blackburn, reports have suggested Christopher Samba could be set for a transfer to Arsenal, who appear to have cooled interest in Bolton's England centre-half Gary Cahill.</p>
              <p>Wenger is also keen to strengthen the midfield, being linked with Everton duo Marouane Fellaini and Mikel Arteta along with Edin Hazard of Lille, CSKA Moscow's Japan international playmaker Keisuke Honda and Yann M'Vila at Rennes.</p>
