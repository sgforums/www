              <p><strong>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger does not believe that Aston Villa present a genuine Premier League challenge this season, but reckons that Martin O'Neill's side are well placed to disrupt the 'Big Four'.</strong><br><br>The midlands side go into Friday's clash against the Gunners already boosted by their win in November over Arsene Wenger' side. <br><br>A two-nil win at the Emirates has helped the Villans maintain a three point cushion over their Boxing Day opponents; O'Neill's side lie third in the rankings, only five points off the pace set by Liverpool. <br><br>Wenger is not convinced that the clarets will be challenging for the top honours at the end of this seson, but believes that they can break into the Champions League places. <br><br>He told the press: "They are mathematically in there but if you asked me if they are going to win the title I would say no because they are other teams who to me look better equipped.<br><br>"For a place in the top four, they are a threat."<br><br>Coming into the fixture without striker Emmanuel Adebayor and captain Cesc Fabregas, Arsenal are in danger of falling from touching distance of Villa in the table, and their manager is under no illusions about the significance of the Villa Park tie. <br><br>He continued: "It is a big game. We are three points behind and have a good opportunity to come back on them. It is a very important game for us."</p>

              <p><em>O'Neill is keeping his feet firmly on the ground</em></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Aston Villa manager Martin O'Neill is keeping his feet firmly on the ground ahead of the crucial Boxing Day showdown against Arsenal at Villa Park. Villa are in the lofty position of third in the table and their surge up the league has had some people questioning whether they could even be title contenders this season.</strong></p>
              <p>But O'Neill will not be getting carried away with any hype - even though a repeat of last month's 2-0 win against Arsenal would move Villa six points clear of Arsene Wenger's side.</p>
              <p>O'Neill, who has a selection doubt over knee injury victim Martin Laursen, said: "We played very well at the Emirates and we now have to emulate that and try to surpass it. "I wouldn't want to start thinking that we are better than we are. "We are doing fine and it has been a great effort by the team. "It is a big, big game for us on Boxing Day."</p>
              <p>Gabriel Agbonlahor, who was on target in the win at the Emirates, will again lead the Villa attack by himself in the continued absence of the injured John Carew. His form has been crucial to Villa moving into third place and it also caught the eye of Fabio Capello who handed him his England debut against Germany.</p>
              <p>Agbonlahor's pace has terrorised Premier League defences this season but Villa midfielder Gareth Barry is surprised at just how good the 22-year-old has become so quickly.</p>
              <p>Barry said: "Gabby's development has been surprising. His overall game has come together quicker than I would have thought. "His pace and directness is frightening for defenders but he is picking up bits and pieces along the way and scoring lots of goals.</p>
              <p>"He is improving all the time." Agbonlahor has 10 league and cup goals to his name so far this season and Barry believes he will only continue to grow in confidence now that he has got the first England cap of his career under his belt.</p>
              <p>"Making his England debut will do him no harm at all," added Barry. "Coming back from that Germany game he will have taken a lot on board and been full of confidence.</p>
              <p>"But he is a laid back person and he won't be thinking about what he has already done because he is just enjoying his football."</p>
              <p>With flying winger Ashley Young also up front alongside Agbonlahor, Villa possess one of the fastest front lines in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>It is that pace that has proved to be crucial for Villa this season and Barry said: "Gabby and Ashley get on very well together off the pitch. There is a lot of banter between the two of them.</p>
              <p>"That can help but it is their ability, pace and skill that is allowing them to create chances for each other and to score goals."</p>

              <h1>As Arsenal prepare for a scrap with Villa, captain Almunia insists: Don’t lose this one</h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/25/article-1101691-02E3FE5F000005DC-339_468x464.jpg" alt="Almunia " width="468" height="464"></p>
              <p><em>Battle cry: Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia reacts after Aston Villa's Ashley Young failed to score a penalty.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>It is the most attractive fixture of the Christmas programme and that, in itself, says much for Aston Villa's progress. Martin O'Neill's men lie third in the table with </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal </strong></span></a><strong>arriving at Villa Park today - the Gunners two places and three points behind them and fearing that Villa are the team to take their Champions League place.</strong></p>
              <p>'The game against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Aston Villa</span></a> is key for us and we have to keep fighting,' said Arsenal's stand-in captain Manuel Almunia. 'We have to go there and get a win. We are playing for more than just the three points against Villa because we cannot afford for them to go even higher in the table.'</p>
              <p>However, Arsene Wenger has written Villa off as title contenders. 'Mathematically, they are in there, they are a threat to the top four. But if you ask me if they can win the title, I say no. I could be wrong but that's my honest opinion because there are other teams who look better equipped.</p>
              <p>Villa will be six points clear of Arsenal if they win today but with inspirational skipper Martin Laursen out with a knee problem and John Carew also on the sidelines, cracks are beginning to appear.</p>
              <p>O'Neill fielded the same team for seven consecutive weeks in the Premier League earlier this season and said: 'My Christmas wish? If you are talking about football, and Villa, then it has to be keeping all of my players available to me.</p>

              <p><strong>Wenger explains Villa bust-up</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/arsenal/wenger_look_oneill.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger believes Aston
              Villa's staff harrassing the referee at the interval led to the
              second-half penalty given against Arsenal - suggesting this led to his
              sideline argument with Martin O'Neill.</strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners were fortunate to still be in the game at half time, let
              alone 1-0 up through Denilson's strike, but after Abou Diaby doubled
              their lead the Alsatian was furious when a penalty was awarded for
              William Gallas' challenge on Gabriel Agbonlahor.</p>
              <p>After this, Wenger and O'Neill had to be separated on the sideline
              and the referee came over to instigate a shake of hands between the
              managers - one The Gunners boss seemed less than keen to indulge in.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's dismay was increased exponentially when Zat Knight
              equalised in the final minute and Wenger was still fuming when he spoke
              to the press after the game.</p>
              <p>"I know how it works here," Wenger said. "At half-time the referee
              gets stick and then in the second half every little 50-50 decision goes
              the other way.</p>
              <p>"That's what happened. It's not only here. I waited at half-time to see what happened and I was not disappointed."</p>
              <p>"I have nothing to explain more than that.</p>
              <p>"I still believe that for the penalty the first foul was by Agbonlahor on Gallas and the second foul was by Gallas."</p>
              <p>O'Neill admitted that his assistant John Robertson spoke to referee
              Lee Mason at half time about his decision not to give obstruction for a
              foul on Agbonlahor before Denilson scored, but denied any foul play.</p>
              <p>"I couldn't give you any response to that," O'Neill said. "I think
              the referee must have seen, at half-time, that the decision he gave for
              Gabby Agbonlahor was not his best one. Gabby was fouled I think, it was
              obstruction, and the referee must have been at least three yards away.</p>
              <p>"But I didn't tell him on that particular occasion. Arsene Wenger
              has his own opinion about it and I believe we deserved at least a point
              today if not all three. Our first-half performance was incredibly
              exhilarating and a joy to watch.</p>
              <p>"John Robertson, I think, spoke to the referee. I think John asked
              him to explain the decision that Gabby didn't get, that was all. Simple
              as that.</p>
              <p>"He only asked him to explain the decision and the referee chose not to give an answer."</p>

              <p>Actually yesterday's results were mostly expected... Pool and Blues were expected to get easy wins, United's one was a little tricky but they got through. Arsenal was the most likely one to drop points.</p>
              <p>But next match, of the 4 I think Arsenal's match against Portsmouth would be the easiest... Adams going to get the sack soon... Pool and Chelsea may face a little problem, United also although they play Middlesbro at home. Cos Boro always get them problems home or away... so can expect more there...</p>
              <p>Arsenal's match is the best bet for a win this weekend...</p>
