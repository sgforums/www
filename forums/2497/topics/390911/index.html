              <h3>IT must be reel love - cheating husband John Terry gives betrayed wife Toni a quick fishing lesson in the Dubai sunshine and suddenly they're frolicking like newlyweds. </h3>
              <p>Last night after the couple's family day out, the shamed and sacked England captain bragged: "The boat trip was fantastic. It's like being on honeymoon again only this time with the kids, and it's better!" </p>
              <p>One amazed observer who saw the couple angling on the luxury £3 million cruiser yesterday said: </p>
              <p>"I don't know what sort of line JT's been spinning but it looks like his missus has swallowed it! Where's the catch?" </p>
              <p>The sacked England captain plans to put the seal on their astonishing reunion today with a romantic Valentine's date - taking mum-of-two Toni back to the beach in Dubai where he proposed, and swearing undying devotion... again. </p>
              <p>Incredibly it was just seven days ago the News of the World revealed how serial love rat Terry, 29, sensationally gagged mistress Vanessa Perroncel with £750,000 hush money AND paid off four more secret lovers not to blab on his sordid sex life. </p>
              <p>But our pictures of the apparently loved-up Terrys cuddling and giggling in the sun seem to show it did the trick. If the scandal of JT bedding team-mate Wayne Bridge's girlfriend Vanessa was haunting 28-year-old Toni, it didn't show. </p>
              <p>A holidaymaker who witnessed their canoodling added: "What does that man have to do to upset his wife? "He's cheated on her and she's welcomed him back with open arms. She must be the most forgiving woman on the planet." </p>
              <p>After renewing his love vows on their special beach today, Chelsea skipper Terry - given compassionate leave by the club to patch up his marriage - will whisk Toni away to an intimate candlelit dinner for two on board the same £7,000-a-day yacht Thimar 1 they hired yesterday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="image-holder"><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00092/terry_04_1302_92446a.jpg" alt="GOING OVERBOARD: Terry hired £7k-a-day Thimar for love treat

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Then the pair will really take the plunge - on a special scuba dive in the moonlight. The inside source who revealed Terry's Valentine plans, added: "John's gone to great lengths to arrange all this and make it a day to remember. He and Toni are back on track and he wanted to prove to her how much this marriage means to him.</strong> </p>
              <p>"He's taking her for that stroll along the sands of memory lane then the two of them will have some special time on their own. "After dining they'll head down onto the coral reef. They're both experienced swimmers and diving at night with torches will make it so special." </p>
              <p>Terry, who has refused to say a public "sorry" for humiliating his wife, arrived in Dubai on Thursday night. He immediately joined Toni for an emotional reunion with their three-year-old twins Georgie John and Summer Rose - plus his in-laws Sue and Alan Poole - at their penthouse suite in the five-star Le Royal Meridien. And yesterday on the yacht trip the couple kissed, cuddled and couldn't keep their hands off each other.</p>
              <p>Toni looked stunning in a tiny white bikini as she got up close to her hubby in trendy white and blue swimming shorts. At one point slippery Terry appeared to come face to face with a REAL shark that he'd proudly hauled in from the sea. Son Georgie looked well impressed - until spotting it was just a plastic fake. </p>
              <p>After the morning cruise the family all crashed into sun loungers around the hotel pool. Another guest told us: "It's amazing how all seems forgotten so quickly. John must have something special. Toni's been all over him like a rash. </p>
              <p>"She looked so miserable when she first arrived in Dubai. Watching the pair of them fool around in the pool it's difficult to believe it's the same woman.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"At one stage I thought they'd forgotten there were other people about - it was all getting a bit heated as Terry sank down on his knees in the water!</strong> </p>
              <p>"I was amazed to see Toni's mum and dad playing happy families too. "John's a lucky man. A less understanding father-in-law would have clocked him one!" </p>
              <p>As it was revealed that the couple are to fly back to the UK TOGETHER so Terry can prepare for next Saturday's match against Wolves, Toni was relaxing in the heat, checking her phone for messages and reading her holiday book, The Brightest Star in the Sky - a love story by Irish author Marian Keyes. </p>
              <p>Obviously she's a sucker for a bit of romantic fiction. . .</p>

              <p><br>Actually, to be fair to Terry's wife, she has consistently back him all these years... Even before he became rich and famous. If money was really her only reason, then leaving him now would see her entitle to half of what he is worth ($17m).</p>
              <p>From the look of things, if she was only in for the money, leaving him now would be the best deal she could ever get as Terry won't be able to earn his $170k per week salary once his chelsea contract ends and that would be a very hugh problem (which won't be too long from now)... As being the big time gambler at casino tables and horse racing, Terry probably won't be richer than he is now. And maybe a lot poorer too once he no longer bring back $700k per month to help fund his bad habits.</p>
              <p>The only thing we can say is she is probably very naive if she belief Terry won't cheat on her again...</p>
