              <p class="first"><strong>From Milan to the Parmesan cheese-making centre of Reggiolo, it is impossible to find anyone who has a bad word to say about Carlo Ancelotti.</strong></p>
              <p>That is except for the self-appointed 'Special One'. But more of him later.</p>
              <p>On my travels for a special report for BBC Radio 5 Live Sport, I heard repeatedly about his sparkling sense of humour, his calmness under pressure, his love for his family and his genuine modesty. Is he too nice a guy to be boss of a Premier League club?</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>"Of course not," says another Italian who managed Chelsea, Gianluca Vialli.</p>
              <p>"He has proved in his years at AC Milan that you don't have to be a bad person to be successful. He is living proof that nice guys can be outstanding at their jobs."</p>

              <p>Ancelotti was born and raised in Reggiolo, a small farming town nestled between Milan and Parma. It's a small, simple provincial town. Nothing that special happens here, except for the national burping championships.</p>
              <p>I spent an afternoon at the Ancelotti family home and met his 86-year-old father Giuseppe and his nephew Luca. Both talk with passion and pride about his success as an international player and his Champions League triumphs as coach of AC Milan.</p>
              <p>"I am eternally proud. I get very emotional when I talk about him," said Giuseppe, a retired farmer who will miss watching his son's every move on Italian television, but he told me: "He telephones every two or three days."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti's keen sense of humour is clearly a key part of his character. "He is always joking with people," says Giuseppe.</p>
              <p>"Carletto's very light-hearted and takes things in his stride. He's very philosophical about life. During the bad times he doesn't get down if things aren't going his way."</p>

              <p>When visiting the AC Milan training facility at Milanello I chatted to their Australian goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac, who said: "His humour is also an important part of his make up.</p>
              <p>"You guys in England like a black, dry humour. He'll fit in well with that. The media should enjoy it as well. He's good fun.</p>
              <p>"He doesn't take things too seriously. Off the park he enjoys his life. The players will be able to have an evening out, as long as they know he wants 100% on the field."</p>
              <p>There's a strong feeling that it was time for AC Milan and Ancelotti to part company and his father Giuseppe added: "I'm very happy about him going there. I've never been to London but I know there's a lot of quality in the team.</p>
              <p>"The other reason is Roman Abramovich was a very down-to-earth man when he met my son. That impressed Carlo very much."</p>

              <p>And nephew Luca told me: "His move to Chelsea came as no surprise to us. Mr Abramovich has courted Carlo since last year and we felt his experience in Milan was coming to an end."</p>
              <p>Luca plans to travel to a Chelsea game, but Giuseppe is housebound.</p>
              <p>"My legs don't work too well," he said. "And I don't like aeroplanes." Could he not go by train or even car? "No, I will just wait for Carlo to call me and tell me how he is doing."</p>
              <p>The local football club in Reggiolo, where Ancelotti played as a teenager before being spotted by Parma, proudly displays fading photographs of the young Carletto on every wall of their clubhouse.</p>
              <p>Club president Adone Bertazzoni said: "He came here when he was 13 or 14. It was obvious that he had a talent. He was different. He was a popular boy, but he was quiet and well-behaved. He was impeccably brought up."</p>
              <p>For a different perspective I sought the opinion of his rival and one-time Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho at the Inter Milan's Pinetina training ground. Mourinho had the occasional difference of opinion with Ancelotti last season.</p>
              <p>So how will your good friend Carlo Ancelotti cope in the Premier League, I asked during a packed press conference?</p>
              <p>"He is not my friend," snapped back Mourinho, those hazel eyes ablaze.</p>
              <p>But he added: "Ancelotti will find it different, but he's a good coach, he has experience and he has the qualities to adapt and to succeed."</p>
