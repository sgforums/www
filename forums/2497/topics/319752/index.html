              <p><em>Ramsey, Cardiff has received formal bids from three top Premier League teams.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Manchester United are one of two top Premier League clubs to have had offers accepted by Cardiff City for Welsh teenage sensation Aaron Ramsey.</strong></p>
              <p>The Champions League winners have already announced an offer has been accepted, believed to be in the £5m to £6m region. But another top club has joined the bidding battle and the BBC understands Arsenal have had an offer accepted.</p>
              <p>The 17-year-old will ultimately decide on his chosen destination. A statement on United's official website confirmed: "Manchester United is delighted to announce it has agreed terms with Cardiff City for the transfer of Aaron Ramsey subject to terms being agreed and the player passing a medical." But a statement from FA Cup finalists Cardiff said: "We can confirm that on 3 June the club has received formal bids from three top Premier League teams for Aaron Ramsey.</p>
              <p>"And Aaron has been given permission to speak to two of these teams. "One of these teams is Manchester United though at this stage we can confirm that no deal has been done and the player has not yet agreed terms."</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson kept a close eye on the young prodigy since Ramsey, the most wanted man outside the Premier League, broke into the Cardiff first-team this season. Cardiff boss Dave Jones and Ridsdale met Ferguson when Cardiff's management team travelled to Barcelona in April before United's Champions League semi-final.</p>
              <p>Suggestions are that the Manchester United manager will loan Ramsey back to The Bluebirds next season so the player known as 'Rambo' could gain vital first-team experience. It will be the second deal struck between the two clubs this summer when Cardiff signed United's reserve team goalkeeper Tom Heaton on a season-long loan.</p>
              <p>Ramsey has played just 22 games for Championship side Cardiff but has been touted as Ryan Giggs' heir apparent in the Wales side and the Caerphilly-born Welsh speaker could follow his idol and fellow countryman at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Wales youth guru Brian Flynn has hailed Ramsey as "sensational." Flynn told BBC Sport last week: "He has everything - temperament, attitude, ability and work-ethic - to be a top Premier League and international player for the next 15 years.</p>
              <p>"No wonder Sir Alex Ferguson likes the look of him, he's a special talent." Cardiff have a long-standing debt of approximately £31m and Ridsdale has admitted all of his stars, including Ramsey and star midfielder Joe Ledley, are available "at the right price."</p>
