              <p></p>
              <p>The Gunners opened their pre-season campaign with a draw at Barnet on Saturday, but they went goal crazy in Austria.</p>
              <p>However they went behind as the hosts took a shock lead on the half-hour through Patrick Lehner.</p>
              <p>But Arsene Wenger's men made sure of victory as they were 3-1 up at the interval thanks to a brace from Nicklas Bendtner (36 &amp; 44) and an Aaron Ramsey (39) strike.</p>
              <p>After the break Arsenal cruised to victory as Robin van Persie (56 pen &amp; 73) grabbed two, William Gallas scored (77) and Ramsey added the seventh (83) late on via a post.</p>
              <p>In South Africa, Manchester City opened the Vodacom Challenge tournament with a 1-0 win over Kaizer Chiefs.</p>
              <p>The only goal of the game arrived just before the interval when Stephen Ireland scored in a game which Gareth Barry made his debut.</p>
              <p>Tottenham continued their excellent pre-season form with a third cleansheet as they eased to a 4-0 win at Peterborough United.</p>
              <p>Darren Bent (35) opened the scoring for Spurs, before second-half foals from Jermain Defoe (66), Luka Modric (68) and Roman Pavlyuchenko (75) sealed the win.</p>
              <p>Stoke City earned a 1-1 draw with Israeli outfit Hapoel Tel Aviv in Austria.</p>
              <p>City boss Tony Pulis named a strong side and they went ahead just after the half-hour through Salif Diao, but Hapoel sealed a draw as Douglas da Silva levelled just after the break.</p>
              <p>Fulham's first pre-season clash back in Britain, after their trip to Australia, ended in a 0-0 draw at Bournemouth.</p>
              <p>Aston Villa were held to a 2-2 draw at League One Colchester United, but they had to come from two-goals down to seal a draw.</p>
              <p>The home side took the lead just before half-hour when Scott Vernon headed home, and then 10 minutes into the second-half Ashley Vincent double Colchester's lead.</p>
              <p>Villa pulled one back almost immediately through Steve Sidwell and then Adam McGurk was on hand to fire home an equaliser for Martin O'Neil's men.</p>
              <p>Hull City came from behind to seal a 2-1 win at Carlisle United, who went ahead at Brunton Park.</p>
              <p>Matt Robson opened the scoring for The Cumbrians after just 12 minutes, and they held their lead until just after the break when Daniel Cousin volleyed home.</p>
              <p>Peter Halmosi then gave Hull the victory with a well-placed shot.</p>
              <p>Portsmouth were held to a 2-2 draw by local non-league rivals Havant &amp; Waterlooville.</p>
              <p>Trialist Eugene Bopp was the star of the show as he grabbed a brace to put Pompey 2-0 ahead.</p>
              <p>But a mistake from Bopp then allowed Mustafa Tiryaki to pounce and then late on Manny Williams struck to seal a draw for the home side.</p>
              <p>Wolves claimed victory at Walsall with a 1-0 at The Banks's Stadium.</p>
              <p>The only goal of the game arrived after 16 minutes and it was new signing Andrew Surman who drove the ball home.</p>
