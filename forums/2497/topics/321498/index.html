              <h1>Mourinho reveals Chelsea raid plan: I want Drogba and Lamps</h1>
              <p><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/06/19/article-0-0175AEBF00000578-373_468x372.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="372"></p>
              <p>Jose Mourinho has told Chelsea that he wants to be reunited with Frank Lampard and<br>Didier Drogba at Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>It’s
              the first time Mourinho has spoken about his plans to launch a transfer
              raid on Stamford Bridge and comes amid reports that Lampard’s talks
              over a new Chelsea deal have hit a snag over the length of any new deal.</p>
              <p>Lampard, who turns 30 tomorrow, wants to stay at Chelsea but is demanding a four-year extension to his current contract.</p>
              <p>The club are reportedly only prepared to offer him two years.</p>
              <p>The
              England midfielder will have talks with new manager Luiz Felipe Scolari
              in a bid to resolve the problem but it is now clear that Mourinho is
              ready to offer one of his favourite players a way out of Stamford
              Bridge with a £10million bid.</p>
              <p>The former Blues boss, who is also
              keen to sign Barcelona’s Deco — who he managed at Porto and is also a
              target for Chelsea — said: “I am not nostalgic but I really like those
              three players, they helped me win some great titles.</p>
              <p>“I cannot forget Deco, Lampard and Drogba.</p>
              <p>"These are players
              who I could never say no to. I would love to work with them again in
              future, but I am not too obsessed with this idea.</p>
              <p>"I don’t know which of the three will leave their clubs but we’ll see.”</p>
              <p>His declaration of intent comes three days after president Massimo Moratti revealed the midfielder was the club’s No1 target.</p>
              <p>More
              surprising is the former Chelsea coach’s continued desire to sign
              Drogba as Moratti said yesterday that Mourinho had no strikers on his
              shortlist of transfer targets.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are still in negotiations with Barcelona over the fee for Deco as they are not prepared to pay the £15m asking price.</p>
              <p>Barcelona
              vice-president Marc Ingla claims they are no closer to agreeing a deal
              for the 30-year-old and said: “We can’t guarantee his career will
              continue at Chelsea because we are yet to receive an offer from this
              club.”</p>
              <p>Mourinho could now be ready to beat them to his signature
              as Deco  has made no secret of his admiration for his former manager at
              Porto.</p>
