              <p><strong>Frank Lampard has admitted that Chelsea have to beat Aston Villa on Saturday if they are to have any hope of winning the title.</strong> </p>
              <p>Villa moved ahead of Chelsea into third place after beating Blackburn earlier in February, meaning that the clash between the two at Villa Park on Saturday lunchtime takes on extra significance. </p>
              <p>"Aston Villa is massive because they are in front of us," Lampard said in The Times. "To still be in the chase we have to win the game. It is going to be tough but we have a lot of big players, a strong team and we can do it." </p>
              <p>The game will be Guus Hiddink's first in charge of Chelsea, and Lampard has been impressed with the Dutchman's impact so far. </p>
              <p>Lampard said: "Hiddink has cast his eye over training and the game and you can see a little lift in the lads trying to impress him, which always happens when a new manager comes in. </p>
              <p>"I think he will be happy with the desire and spirit we showed at 1-0 down against Watford and some of the football we played on a difficult pitch was good."</p>

              <h1>Hiddink's Chelsea blueprint gathers pace with speedy Mancienne<br></h1>
              <p><br><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/17/article-0-038DE4B4000005DC-351_233x385.jpg" alt="Impressing: Mancienne" width="233" height="385"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Impressing: Mancienne</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Guus Hiddink is considering handing central defender Michael Mancienne a first Barclays Premier League start at </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span></a><strong> on Saturday.</strong></p>
              <p>Mancienne, who played at right back in the 3-1 FA Cup victory over Watford last<br>weekend, has been thrust into contention because of injuries to Ricardo Carvalho<br>(hamstring) and Alex (ankle), and doubts about the quality of Branislav Ivanovic.</p>
              <p>Hiddink watched several DVDs of Aston Villa’s recent games yesterday afternoon and is already aware of the pace that Ashley Young and Gabriel Agbonlahor possess.</p>
              <p>That has convinced the Dutch coach to prepare for several scenarios ahead of his first game in charge of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>, including using Mancienne’s speed to combat Villa’s attacking threat.</p>
              <p>Hiddink has been impressed with Mancienne’s attitude in his first few days in charge and paired the 21-year-old with captain John Terry for most of yesterday’s training session at Stamford Bridge, which was open to fans.</p>
              <p>Terry said of the new coach: ‘He’s made a few changes and in training he got us to press more and play higher up the pitch. It looked sharp, with everyone fighting for their places again.’</p>
              <p>Although Alex is expected to declare himself fit for Saturday lunchtime’s clash, Mancienne emerged as a viable alternative during the hour-and-a-half practice session at the stadium.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have conceded only 15 goals in the Premier League this season, but they have looked far from comfortable in recent weeks and Hiddink will not select players on reputation alone.</p>
              <p>That is why inexperienced Mancienne, who was called into the England squad for<br>the friendly against Germany last November, has suddenly come into the first-team<br>reckoning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Could this be Guus Hiddink's line-up (If Alex &amp; Carvalho still out) ? Seems quite good leh...</p>

              <p><strong>Aston Villa boss Martin O'Neill is sweating over the availability of both </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=7955"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Emile Heskey</strong></span></a><strong> and </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=26843"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>James Milner</strong></span></a><strong> ahead of Saturday lunchtime's crunch showdown with Chelsea at Villa Park.</strong></p>
              <p>Villa go into the game above Guus Hiddink's new side and know victory could go a long way to securing Champions League football.</p>
              <p>O'Neill has been without Heskey, a £3.5m January capture from Wigan Athletic, since he aggravated an Achilles injury while on England duty in Spain and remains a doubt for the weekend. <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=11833"><span style="color: #000000;">John Carew</span></a>'s goalscoring appearance against CSKA Moscow in the UEFA Cup does though provide an option to fall back on.</p>
              <p>But of more concern would be the loss of Milner, a player who has been hitting top form over the last month and has scored a number of goals. The England Under-21 international, injured against Everton in the FA Cup, was also left out of Wednesday's UEFA Cup game in a bid to make sure he is fit to face Chelsea.</p>
              <p>O'Neill said: "Milner has got a bit of a thigh problem and the doctor thought he would have a better chance for Saturday if he didn't play against CSKA.</p>
              <p>"Heskey is improving and we will see how he is during the next 24 hours. I will have a better idea on Friday.''</p>
              <p>O'Neill also revealed he would be seeking an audience with England coach Fabio Capello to ensure there is no repeat of the Heskey situation.</p>
              <p>"I have said already that I wasn't best pleased,'' he added. "I haven't spoken to Capello yet. I will do. I think it is important for me to speak to him. He is coming to the game on Saturday.''</p>
              <p>Villa are currently two points above Chelsea in the table, and three points behind second placed Liverpool, but despite the Blues' recent troubles O'Neill is expecting Hiddink's men to rise to the occasion.</p>
              <p>"Obviously Guus Hiddink has got quality players at his club and it is only a few months ago that Chelsea were the only side this season to have beaten us very well,'' he added.</p>
              <p>"Anyone coming away from the game that evening would have been surprised to have seen a change of manager by this time.</p>
              <p>"But things can happen, so fickle is the game.''</p>

              <h1>Martin O'Neill warns Chelsea must beat Aston Villa</h1>
              <h2>Martin O'Neill, the Aston Villa manager, has warned Chelsea that their title hopes this season will almost certainly be over if they fail to secure at least a draw at Villa Park this afternoon, before declaring that his side are confident of taking the full three points.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01318/martin-oneill-asto_1318803c.jpg" alt="Martin O'Neill is relishing prospect of Chelsea match" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <div class="imageExtras"><span class="caption"><em>Homegrown: Martin O'Neill is relishing prospect of Chelsea match.</em></span> </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>With Manchester United having opened up a ten point lead at the top of the table, O’Neill said that Chelsea must not only go unbeaten for the rest of the season, they must win 11 of their remaining 13 matches.</strong></p>
              <p>“I do think that,” he said. “I think that with Manchester United having completed the same number of games as everybody else and opening up that five point gap over Liverpool, and another five over Chelsea, Chelsea will feel now that with 13 games left, for them to stand any chance they will need to be unbeaten in the 13, and win 11.</p>
              <p>"Ten points behind Manchester United are a lot of points.” "That would take some doing but, with that group of players who have been over the same course before, it is not beyond them to achieve that.</p>
              <p>"Last season, with about this number of games left it looked as if they were out of the picture and then they had a very good run and only effectively lost the chance when they drew with Wigan who scored very late on.</p>
              <p>"That was with only a couple of games left so they pulled it right around and then were within a width of a goalpost of winning the Champions League final."</p>
              <p>James Milner and Emile Heskey were back in training yesterday, so confidence is high at Villa, despite their comprehensive 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge earlier in the season being still fresh in the memory.</p>
              <p>“We were brushed aside,” O’Neill conceded. “But I think that we have picked up since then. There is plenty of confidence and I think we can win.”</p>
              <p>His confidence was echoed by John Carew, the club’s Norwegian striker, who said: “There’s a reason why we are two points ahead of them.</p>
              <p>"We’ve been better than them this season. I think we are going to go out and show that on Saturday.”</p>
