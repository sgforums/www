              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Aston Villa have agreed a £9.5million fee with Wigan over signing winger Charles N’Zogbia. Wigan had rejected Villa’s bid of £9m for the former Newcastle player earlier this month, but have now agreed to sell.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The two clubs held further discussions over the weekend and agreed on a compromise figure of £9.5m.</span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="font-size: x-small;">New Villa boss Alex McLeish needs a new winger after the departures of Ashley Young and Stewart Downing to Manchester United and Liverpool respectively this summer.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But a deal would also suit Wigan as N’Zogbia could leave them for nothing next summer when his current contract runs out, although a transfer now will depend on club owner Dave Whelan giving his seal of approval.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">N’Zogbia will hold talks over personal terms in the next 24 hours and undergo a medical before signing what is expected to be a five-year deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is a case of second time lucky for Scot McLeish who 12 months ago thought he had signed N'Zogbia when in charge of Birmingham, only for the deal to collapse at the 11th hour after Blues failed to agree personal terms with the player.<br><br>N'Zogbia will be reunited with his former Newcastle team-mate Shay Given, who last week became McLeish's first signing of the summer in a £3.5m move from Manchester City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The news was greeted by Villa striker Darren Bent, who is with the rest of the squad on their pre-season tour of Asia.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">On his Twitter account, Bent wrote: 'Great news about @charlesNzo, hopefully the club can get the deal over the line'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But he would be likely to have to wait to join up with Villa’s first-team squad.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">McLeish’s team are currently on a pre-season tour of Hong Kong and N’Zogbia does not have the required work visa. <br></span></p>

              <p><strong>Aston Villa have completed the signing of midfielder Charles N'Zogbia from Wigan on a five-year contract.</strong></p>
              <p>The club confirmed on their website today that the 25-year-old France international had passed a medical and would be available for next Wednesday's pre-season fixture against Derby at Pride Park and for the August 6 date with Braga in Portugal.</p>
              <p>"I am really happy and extremely excited to sign for Aston Villa," N'Zogbia told www.avfc.co.uk.</p>
              <p>"It is a great club and it is a really big step for me in my career, so I am sure I will enjoy my football here.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>"I think it is going to be a really good season and hopefully I'll do well here.</p>
              <p>"I can't wait to meet my new team-mates, play with them and work together to do something special this season.</p>
              <p>"Alex McLeish is a strong manager and I think he is going to build a really good team for this season."</p>
              <p>Neither club disclosed the fee, which is believed to be around £9.5million.</p>
              <p>The move sees N'Zogbia reunited with former Newcastle team-mate Shay Given, who joined from Manchester City earlier this month, and also means Villa boss Alex McLeish has finally succeeded in signing N'Zogbia after two failed attempts.</p>
              <p>The Scot looked to have landed the services of the player 12 months ago when in charge at Birmingham only for the deal to collapse at the 11th hour over personal terms.</p>
              <p>Then McLeish's bid to sign the former Newcastle man earlier this summer was halted when Wigan rejected an initial £9m bid from Villa.</p>
              <p>Wigan manager Roberto Martinez was sorry to lose a player of N'Zogbia's quality, telling www.wiganlatics.co.uk: "We're all disappointed to lose a player like Charles N'Zogbia, who has been fantastic for Wigan Athletic over the last two years and who we feel has grown as a player in that time too.</p>
              <p>"There have been some very enjoyable moments during his time at the club, he made his international debut with France and scored his first goal for his country whilst a Wigan Athletic player - memories I'm sure he'll always treasure as we will.</p>
              <p>"Now is the time for him to move on to a club who have matched the market valuation for him and allow us to move on, reinvest and take our football club onto another level."</p>
