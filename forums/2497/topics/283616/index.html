Chelsea's sporting director Frank Arnesen, who is becoming increasingly influential at Stamford Bridge in the wake of Jose Mourinho's departure, has offered Ten Cate the job. </strong><br><br>Ten Cate, 52, was assistant manager at Barcelona when they won the European Cup under Frank Rijkaard in 2006 and he is already well known to Chelsea officials. The Dutch coach, who is considering Chelsea's surprise offer, clashed with Mourinho's petulant coaching staff during the Champions League clash between the clubs at the Nou Camp in 2005.<br><br>Mourinho accused Rijkaard of going into the referee's dressing room at half-time and Ten Cate was pinpointed as the aggressor during heated scenes in the tunnel involving Rui Faria and Baltemar Brito. That incident has not prevented Chelsea approaching Ten Cate, recommended to the club by Arnesen because of his attention to detail and meticulous planning, and they expect a decision during the international break.<br><br>Ten Cate had an excellent relationship with Ronaldinho Â— who remains a transfer target for Chelsea Â— and his potential arrival will relieve some of the pressure on Grant. His approach is similar to Mourinho's, but it is understood that the appointment will not threaten Grant's position at the club.<br><br>Instead, Ten Cate's arrival will strengthen Arnesen's position at the club after their billionaire benefactor Roman Abramovich asked the Dutchman for potential candidates to fill the role. The approach to Ten Cate has also put Steve Clarke's position in jeopardy.<br><br>Clarke has been taking training following Mourinho's departure, but it is understood that he is considering his position after Grant made it clear that he wanted another coach. That man is Ten Cate and he has an excellent reputation in Europe. He told Rijkaard he wanted to strike out alone following their European Cup success and returned to Ajax as manager that summer.<br><br>Although he never played for the club during his largely anonymous career with Go Ahead Eagles and SC Heracles, he announced that he would be manager of Ajax 'within 10 years' when he began his coaching career in 1988. Although it took a while longer, Ten Cate achieved his ambition eventually, but financial constraints have prevented him taking the four-time European Cup winners back to the top of Dutch football.<br><br>They were denied the Eredivisie title on goal difference last season and face Dinamo Zagreb in the UEFA Cup first round this evening.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ten Cate leaving Ajax for Chelsea, says agent<br><br>LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Henk Ten Cate's agent said the Ajax Amsterdam coach has agreed to join Premier League club Chelsea as assistant to Avram Grant, according to reports in British newspapers on Friday.<br><br>'It's true we have an agreement with Chelsea,' Ten Cate's agent Sigi Lens was quoted as saying by The Sun.<br><br>'Chelsea want to take the coach now so if there is an agreement between the two clubs then everything will be clear.'<br><br>Chelsea, who beat Valencia 2-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday, issued two statements on Thursday, the first regarding Grant's proposed coaching structure and the second dismissing reports of a link with Dutch coach Guus Hiddink.<br><br>Grant was appointed after the departure of Portuguese manager Jose Mourinho last month.<br><br>Ten Cate, who was assistant coach to Frank Rijkaard at Barcelona when they won the Champions League, became Ajax coach in May 2006 on a two-year contract through to July 2008.<br><br>Ajax were eliminated from the UEFA Cup on Thursday after a 3-2 home loss to Dinamo Zagreb saw them go out on away goals.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Grant confirms Ten Cate as Chelsea target<br><br>Chelsea boss Avram Grant stopped short of confirming Ajax coach Henk ten Cate will be one of his lieutenants at Stamford Bridge but admitted the Dutchman was among the names on his shortlist.<br><br>Grant's inability to confirm ten Cate would join his staff was mirrored in Holland, where the Ajax coach played down suggestions he would be leaving the Dutch side for Chelsea.<br><br>Ajax have been eliminated from the UEFA Cup but ten Cate insists he will be on the bench as normal when they play Sparta Rotterdam on Sunday.<br><br>Grant has always worked with two assistants and, with Steve Clarke set to continue in his role, the Israeli is looking for one other to report to him.<br><br>Grant declared: 'It is not a secret. I have made it clear in the past that we have lost four coaches - one assistant coach, one fitness coach, one goalkeeping coach and one scout.<br><br>'We are looking for replacements for them. We have checked many possibilities and I have checked personally. It will be my decision - I am in charge of my staff and my players.<br><br>'I need to work with these people but I want my two assistants to be top of the line - one British one I have is top of the line and we want the European to be one of the best.<br><br>'I have had a meeting with people in the last two weeks and Henk has a good record as assistant in Barcelona. I am still looking for an assistant so I cannot tell you anything for sure.<br><br>'I have the British assistant in Steve Clarke, who is doing a very good job.<br><br>'In the last two weeks, it has not been easy for him - he replaced two men not one. We are in a different way of training - the coach is coaching and I am manager.<br><br>'We are still looking for other assistants from Europe and one of them has been mentioned. We checked many coaches and possibilities but I don't want to say anything because it is not finished yet.<br><br>'Henk has a good record and he is a nice person and when I am looking for an assistant, they would be from the top of the line because they need to work under me and understand the mode of football and the system of playing.<br><br>'We are trying to do it as soon as possible but I don't want to rush and not find good people. We will do the best for Chelsea.'<br><br>But in Holland, ten Cate told RTV Noord Holland: 'Despite the fact that we are now out of the Champions League and UEFA Cup, I still feel secure in my position.<br><br>'I will be, as normal, on the bench when we meet Sparta on Sunday. I don't want to say more about all the speculation about me and Chelsea.'<br><br>Grant also insisted Clark's future was safe under his managerial tenure.<br><br>There had been speculation Clarke was set to quit the club since Jose Mourinho's surprise departure but Grant attempted to put an end to it all by saying he was more than happy with Scotsman's contribution.<br><br>Grant added: 'I am very happy with Steve and I don't recall in the past saying I was looking for a replacement for him. He is doing more now than he was doing before because we have changed the way of training.<br><br>'I must say again he was a key player in the last two weeks. I speak with Steve every day and I think he is happy. If not, he will say so.'<br><br>Grant will welcome back fit-again Frank Lampard for Sunday's Barclays Premier League trip to Bolton but is without striker Didier Drogba through suspension.<br><br>Grant has no problems with Lampard reporting for England duty, even if his match fitness is still lacking.<br><br>Grant added: 'Frank has trained very hard in the last two weeks and he looks good. Of course I am happy that he could be ready for Sunday.<br><br>'Frank does a good job on the pitch not just in terms of goals, he does other things as well, and I will be very happy if he is fit.<br><br>'If he is not fit and doesn't feel good for Sunday, we will see what happens then. It will depend on his condition and how he feels.<br><br>'If he is fit, I don't have a problem with him going with England.'<br><br>Grant is also happy for captain John Terry to continue wearing the face mask to protect his fractured cheekbone.<br><br>Grant said: 'We don't know how long John will have to wear the mask but he felt food with it - better than we thought he would.<br><br>'He headed the ball many times, especially in the last 10 or 15 minutes against Valencia when they were using the long ball. I didn't see any problem for him.'<br></div>
