              <p><span>David James insists England will go 
              out to beat Germany in 90 minutes as they attempt to dodge more penalty 
              misery.</span></p>
              <p><span>The old enemies go 
              head-to-head in the second round of the World Cup on Sunday, with 
              England fans fearing another shootout.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Germans possess an awesome reputation on 
              penalties and England have suffered two doses of spot-kick hell against 
              their rivals - in the 1990 World Cup and at Euro 96.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span>'The intention for us is to win the 
              game
              in 90 minutes,' he said. 'If it requires extra time and then if it goes
              to penalties, there's an opportunity for Germany to miss so we're 
              ready.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Germany are a 
              decent outfit but we've 
              got the confidence of having gone to Berlin a couple of years ago and 
              beaten them 2-1.'</span></p>
              <p><span>James 
              said that England would 'do 
              their homework' on German penalty taking, as they had done for the group
              games.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We've had videos 
              on the three sides we've played already,' he said. 'I was hoping 
              Slovenia might have had a penalty in the last minute and I'd get a 
              chance to save it.'</span></p>
              <p><span>James 
              was between the sticks when Portugal beat England in a quarter-final 
              shoot-out at the European Championship six years ago, but he intends to 
              be better prepared this time around.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'The key issue we have is the homework,' he 
              stressed. 'In Euro 2004, when we played Portugal, we didn't have the 
              access to the information that perhaps we should have done with regards 
              to likely takers.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Spot of bother: James concedes the winner taken 
              by Portugal keeper Ricardo in the Euro 2004 quarter-final</em></p>
              </div>
              <p><span>'</span><span>Realistically in a shoot-out you're 
              going to face at least five
              outfield players and we'll do our homework on as many as possible. </span><span>That will be done, but we're 
              not going into the match with the intention of winning on penalties.'</span></p>
              <p><span>However, he joked that he and fellow 
              goalkeepers Robert Green and Joe Hart couldn't stop too many spot-kicks 
              in training for fear of crushing the confidence of their outfield 
              team-mates.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's a bit 
              difficult for the keepers
              because if we save too many, it doesn't give our strikers confidence,' 
              he said. 'So it's
              a bit more difficult for us.'</span></p>
              <p><span>James says there must be no regrets about missing out on top 
              spot in Group C, which would have set up a last 16 tie with Ghana and a 
              potentially easier route to the final. Victory on Sunday is likely to 
              lead to a quarter-final with Argentina, while a bigger win against 
              Slovenia would make South Korea or Uruguay their last eight opponents.<br></span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span>In fact, the bullish 39-year-old 
              insists
              he is thrilled to have set up a 'romantic' tie against a side who have 
              been rivals on and off the pitch for so long.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I'm delighted for England as
              a 
              nation that we've got a chance to play Germany,' he said. 'It gives 
              everyone at 
              home the opportunity to enjoy a great football match and what will 
              hopefully be a good win against Germany.</span></p>
              <p><span>'If you look at the potential road to the 
              final, the idea of beating Germany is romantic - and it's an achievable 
              goal,' he said. 'And it will bring on another match which will have its 
              own historical significance.'</span></p>

              <p><span>However, he insisted that the players
               
              would not get swept up in the occasion and suffer the detrimental 
              consequences.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It's another
               football match,' he said. 
              'Obviously there'll be a lot of external references and whatever else, 
              historical references. But for us it's a game against a decent outfit - 
              one we have to win to progress.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Our preparation is for a squad of 23
              players
              and whatever they've got to offer in strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We can't do anything about what happened (in
               the group stage). 'We look back at the America game and the performance
               of Tim Howard which prevented a win.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Algeria are very difficult to score against, 
              and then we did what we needed to against Slovenia on Wednesday.'</span></p>

              <p><span>James started between the posts 
              against 
              Algeria and Slovenia after Robert Green's howler gifted Clint Dempsey an
              equaliser for America in the opener, and the England No 1 is pleased to
              have finally grasped his chance at his third World Cup.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'When the squad was announced and the
              numbers
              issued it was more of numerical thing than a suggestion of the first 
              XI,' said the oldest player at the finals.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'True to Mr Capello's previous 
              selection 
              process, he must have gauged something in training and felt Robert was 
              the right goalkeeper to start with. I'm happy with that.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'I'm part of a squad. This World Cup 
              isn't 
              about David James - it's about England being successful. I trained as 
              well as I could, got the chance to go back in and I'm happy.'</span></p>
