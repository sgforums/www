              *Ridgewell's bum note: West Brom star apologises after being pictured wiping his backside with pile of Â£20 notes*
              
               
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              West Brom defender Liam Ridgewell has apologised after an embarrassing picture emerged of him wiping his backside with a wad of Â£20 notes.
               
              The former Aston Villa and Birmingham defender claims the picture was taken to wind up a friend after he won a bet and he never intended on it becoming public. 
              
              
              Ridgewell told The Sun: 'The photo was taken in the privacy of my home around eight months ago as a joke to wind up a mate, who I had just won a personal bet with.
                
              'I only intended him to see the photo but now itâ€™s public, I can understand how it will be viewed. I am sorry for any offence it causes.'
               
              The picture showed the 28-year-old squatting over a toilet with nearly Â£1000 worth of Â£20 notes scattered over the floor.
               
              The West Brom player earns around Â£20,000-a-week and the picture is sure to anger fans â€“ especially as that is the average annual salary in the West Midlands - one of the most deprived areas in the country.
               
              The picture was sent to the newspaper by a fan who asked not to be named, he said: 'The people of West Bromwich earn a fraction of what this idiot earns yet he makes a mockery of his good fortune like this. It makes me sick.
               
              'Weâ€™ve always thought footballers were arrogant, overpaid buffoons and this just proves it.â€™
               
              The club distanced themselves from the issue saying it was a private matter.
               
              They told The Sun: â€˜This is a private issue for Liam that has become public.
               
              'It does not put the club in a good light and we will deal with the matter internally.
               
              'Since Liam joined us 11 months ago, his conduct on club duty has been exemplary.'
