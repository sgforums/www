              <p><em>JOE COLE - taunts</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>CHELSEA’S stars have stuck the knife into crumbling Arsenal and taunted: Where are your medals?</h3>
              <p>Joe Cole and Jose Bosingwa ignited this afternoon’s crunch London derby at Stamford Bridge by blasting the Gunners’ failure to win anything for three years.</p>
              <p>Victory for Premier League leaders Chelsea will put them 13 POINTS ahead of Arsenal, killing off the Gunners’ title hopes before December.</p>
              <p>And England star Cole sneered: “People are always going on about the nice football Arsenal play but if you look at the last few years, who’s won the trophies? Know what I mean?</p>
              <p>“I wouldn’t want to be playing for a team that didn’t win trophies.”</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger’s brittle youngsters have already lost FIVE League games this season.</p>
              <h4>Silverware</h4>
              <p>Cole added: “You are not going to be sitting on the beach at the end of the season speaking about that Cruyff turn you did back in December, or that nutmeg you did in January, are you?</p>
              <p>“You want to be thinking about what medals you won. That’s what it’s all about. That’s why you play. “Our only aim is to put some silverware on the table. I’d like to be sitting on a beach next summer with a medal or two.”</p>
              <h4>Effective</h4>
              <p>Arsenal’s last trophy came in May, 2005 when they won the FA Cup. Chelsea won the League that season, retained it the following year and have also added the FA Cup and two Carling Cups.</p>
              <p>Cole’s Blues team-mate Bosingwa added: “The most beautiful football doesn’t always win games. “Arsenal the prettiest team? But they are not the most effective, are they?</p>
              <p>“Results are what count. We can play just as beautiful football as Arsenal. We are the team with the most goals in the league. I think Chelsea’s style is good.”</p>

              <p>well, if you want a club to be profitable, or do you want the club to win things, which is key? if U want both, I don't think in the last 5 seasons, any EPL clubs can meet it.</p>
              <p>Gunners have not been winning but have been profitable but refusing to spend. Chelsea and MU are heavily in debt but they are spending and getting the sliverwares. Liverpool is spending big and with one EuroCup and no league titles in the last ten plus years.</p>

              <p><br>Err... when he said profitable I think he meant profitable and also win things lah... Of the big 4, all have debts which is true... How they came into debts are totally a different thing... Pool and United came into debts were results of new owners taking over the club and transferring it onto the club... Tho Pool were already in debts of $80m before the 2 Americans took over but still a manageable sum. Arsenal probably because of their stadium...</p>
              <p>How Chelsea came into debts is completely different... They are in debts mainly because of the over priced players they bought over the last 5 yrs... They bought many and try them out and if it didn't work out one season of half a season, they sell him away for much lesser or worse, loan him out for free and buy another one... They don't give some of these guys a chance as money wasn't a problem for them then... I can't imagine how many have come and gone just this past few yrs... Tiago Mendes, Veron, Mutu, Crespo, Del Horno, Boulahrouz, Jarosik, Shevchenko these are the ones i can still remember, the ones i can't remember how... The huge salary to players are also one of the main reasons they have not been able to break even...</p>
              <p>But the most important thing here is, unlike the other big 3... Their yearly profits are not able to cover their overheads resulting in loss for the past consecutive 4, 5 yrs... Whereas the other big 3's yearly turnovers are more than their overheads so they can meet their bank repayments on time without any hassle...</p>

              <p>Winning Trophies is important, in the eyes of fans, manager, and the board and shareholders.</p>
              <p>Shareholders, when at the end of the financial year, may not only look at the sucess the club brings in the football pitch but at the balance sheet. As how profitable the club is generally means how much dividends they are getting. Winning Trophies also increases the revenue of the club, as they are given prize money, TV revenue and many others.</p>
              <p>but</p>
              <p>Success on the footballing pitch counts for nothing if the club is unable to sustain their spending and costs until a day, they have to declare bankrupt if they do not have any financial backing from a sugar daddy.. (Im not quoting any example just stating a fact)</p>

              <p>Haha Chelsea's gotta eat their own shit now. You always pay a price when you play attacking football. Not every team is Brazil. Look at Real Madrid, always trying to win games by that odd goal margin. Mourinho could have been a legend in the English game, much more than Fergie.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Much as i would agreed that attacking football doesn;t always wins you games and trophies these days but i've also to point out that Mourinho can't match SAF's achivement, SAF is probably the only still managing manager who had the most amount of trophies, also ManU's kinda play is pretty attacking also but the main different between ManU and Arsenal is that the former win games while attacking but also knows how to shut down rivals while Arsenal current squad are in a sense too naive in football terms, hence only knows how to attacking but can't do as well when 1 or 2 of their main players had a off day.. </p></div>

              <p>Winning Trophies is important, in the eyes of fans, manager, and
              the board and shareholders.</p>
              <p>Shareholders, when at the end of the financial year, may not
              only look at the sucess the club brings in the football pitch but
              at the balance sheet. As how profitable the club is generally means
              how much dividends they are getting. Winning Trophies also
              increases the revenue of the club, as they are given prize money,
              TV revenue and many others.</p>

              <p>I do agree with you, spend within your means and fight. but may I know which teams are spending within their means and still able to challenge the top 4?</p>
              <p>everton? villa?I believe most teams in EPL are fighting not to win the title as they know it is dominated by top 4 but rather, trying to go into europe where the $ is.</p>
              <p>Yes, I do agree Chelsea burnt money like nothing, but to be fair, MU did the same before them, like in EJJ, Kleberson, Veron, Forlan, and etc.Let's not deny, Liverpool also spend alot under their french manager.  I feel MU has a more bigger fan base due to their history and thus able to cover back. And of course, MU has a much better winning record in the EPL (note, I mean Premier League).</p>

              <p>I believe had Drogba played, the result could be different. Arsenal are a very good side on their day but i feel a big physical striker like Drogba would give them more problems than a running on the ground Anelka...</p>
              <p>But to be fair, I thought Deco didn't perform and Bosingwa only played the first half... 2nd half he was poor. Terry also had a bad game...</p>
