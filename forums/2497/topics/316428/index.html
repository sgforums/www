              <p><strong>ARSENE WENGER has the green light to splash £15million on Obafemi Martins to bolster his paper-thin squad.</strong></p>
              <p>Last week's ousting of chief executive Keith Edelman frees the financial shackles at Arsenal and could allow Wenger to compete on a level playing field in terms of transfer fees and wages. While Edelman always insisted there was money for Wenger to spend, Arsenal sources believe the Gunners boss felt restricted in the transfer market.</p>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>Newcastle striker Martins tops Wenger's list, with the French gaffer confident he can land his target — even if it means paying the Nigerian £75,000 a week. Wenger, whose side face Everton on Sunday afternoon, accepts he must stick to a wage structure as the Gunners' move to the Emirates Stadium has created a £360m debt.</p>
              <h3>Screw</h3>
              <p>But it is understood Edelman had turned the screw too tight. His business acumen had helped the club successfully make their move to the Emirates and increase profitability but, according to one source, he was cutting costs to the bone — thus affecting the football side of the club.</p>
              <p>I understand Wenger increasingly missed the support of former vice-chairman David Dein who fell out with Edelman over potential foreign investment and was ousted last year. Other players on Wenger's radar will be Aston Villa's Gareth Barry, Manchester City midfielder Michael Johnson and Miralen Pjanic of Metz.</p>
              <p>Wenger does not believe he needs to radically reshape his squad but he knows he has to inject more power and experience throughout the team.</p>
              <p>Wenger will also be looking for another centre-half and goalkeeper — possibly West Ham's Robert Green. While a loosening of the purse-strings may be too late to satisfy midfielder Mathieu Flamini's staggering demands, it should enable Wenger to add to quality to his squad and, crucially, keep Cesc Fabregas out of Spanish clutches.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: "The priority is to make sure we keep hold of the players we have at the moment. "We do have a transfer budget but that includes any renegotiating of current players' contracts. "I believe we need to strengthen the team but don't feel we need to kick some players out and replace them.</p>
              <p>"We have a tremendous future but maybe we need to add some experience. "Last season we had 68 points and were far behind. This year we can make 83 and who knows?"</p>

              <p>Well, of the 4 you mentioned... Martins could well end up as the best of the lot... He is faster than the rest of them, can shoot well too...</p>
              <p>Crouch is quite similar to Adebayor that they are both good in the air... Martins on the other hand brings something that gunners are lacking this season... Intensity upfront... His willingness to run and chase lost cause situations is something I didn't see in the gunners team this season... Adebayor seem too relax and can say lazy at times... And since Wenger prefer to play at fast speed mostly on the ground... I feel Crouch is too slow for their style... RVP injury prone... Eduardo probably will miss more than half of next season... and these 2 players don't seem to have a physical presence unlike Martins...</p>
              <p>Anyway, Wenger being interested in Martins isn't something new... Maybe its because he see Martins being able to fit in with the style Arsenal plays... But all this will depend on weather Kelvin Keegan wants to sell Martins...</p>

              <p>Adebayor can do things better than Crouch, of course in my opinion and he's definitely faster and can dribble the ball better than Crouch and do you think that van persie can actually stay out of injury? he's like permanently injured.</p>

              <p>Don't liddat say Eduardo 1st..Eduardo only got his first horror injury, if not for Taylor, i guess we would still be in the title run because of Eduardo and he would still be fit right now. Flamini, just let him go and i guess Wenger can try on Villa too, since Villa claims that he is interested in becoming a Gunner. Barry has Liverpool snatching with us so..not confirm but if get him is best lah!</p>
