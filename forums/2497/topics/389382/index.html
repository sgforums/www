O'Neill accused the </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Arsenal" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong> manager of an "appalling insult" at the end of an evening that saw Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen suffer a suspected broken leg and Eduardo da Silva limp off with a hamstring injury.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger said that the match, a goalless draw, represented two points dropped for Arsenal, who are waiting for X-ray results to establish the extent of Vermaelen's injury before Sunday's match at home to Manchester United. But the Villa match and the injuries were overshadowed by the feud that developed afterwards, following the Frenchman's derogatory comments about Villa's style of play.</p>
              <p>"I believe we dropped two points because we had clear chances," said Wenger. "But on the other hand it was a very difficult game because they stopped us from playing when we had the ball and when they had the ball they played a very long-ball game and closed us down. It was difficult for us. We couldn't find our ­passing game. We know what you get when you come here and we were not disappointed. It's a very efficient English game with long balls and very physical."</p>
              <p>O'Neill, who was involved in a ­touchline argument with Wenger here last year, was incensed. He said: "If that's what he saw tonight, that is a ridiculous statement … He's made a few ridiculous statements in his time here and that's probably as good as any. That's only an annoyance at the end of it all. Anybody who saw the game wouldn't take that viewpoint. Ashley Young didn't have time to play long balls when he was taking that left-back [Gaël Clichy] to the cleaners. It's an ­appalling insult."</p>
              <p>Wenger will no doubt be more concerned about his injury situation. Eduardo limped off in the second half and will play no part against United. Vermaelen, who was able to walk off – how he sustained the injury was unclear but it may have been in a tackle on Emile Heskey that earned him a yellow card – could face an extended spell out of action. That raises the possibility of Sol Campbell starting on Sunday.</p>
              <p>"With Vermaelen we don't know," said Wenger. "He has to have an X-ray. He's on crutches. It's the fibula. Is it just a nerve or is the bone broken? We have to check that in the morning. Eduardo is a hamstring strain. For Sunday he will be out."</p>
              <p>The Arsenal manager said he would think carefully about playing Campbell, who replaced Vermaelen, against United. "Sol has not played for six months and in three days he has two big games, so I will have to see how he recovers," he said.</p>

              <p>so.. he cannot fight against the long ball and physical play he complains about the other team?</p>
              <p>the good manager deals with different types of teams and how they play.. if the team plays the long ball and physical, they should have a way to deal with it too... that differentiates a good team from a great team...</p>
              <p>so far, Chelsea has been taking apart most teams, no matter what the other team does.. it has the makings of a great team...</p>
              <p>just like in the past, The Invincibles were able to deal with all types of teams.. now he expects other teams to play the passing game?</p>
              <p>if i was a manager going against Arsenal, i'd tell them to go in hard, play the long ball, throw two big bruisers of centre-forwards to muscle their way in the box.. they've got Arsenal beaten..</p>
