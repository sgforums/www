              <h3 class="padding-bottom-7">RAFA BENITEZ was booed off again at Stamford Bridge last night.</h3>
              <p>Chelsea’s lowest crowd of the season — 38,484 — turned on the interim manager as they drew 2-2 with Southampton after leading 2-0 in their Premier League clash.</p>
              <p>The fans were furious when hero Frank Lampard was subbed for Fernando Torres 11 minutes from time and they again vented their anger at the final whistle.</p>
              <p>It was only the third time in Chelsea’s Premier League history they had failed to <a id="_GPLITA_2" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Savings Sidekick" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2497/topics/#"><span style="color: #0000ff;">win</span></a> after leading by two goals at half-time.</p>
              <p>Benitez admitted: “I’m not angry but I am disappointed. When you know your players and what they can do, you are disappointed when you don’t win a game like this.</p>
              <p>“Everything changed in the second half. We were not under pressure, but we made the same mistakes as we have in the past and that is my concern.</p>
              <p>“I wanted to see the reaction from my team after Southampton scored their first goal and we didn’t do well.</p>
              <p>“We had chances to score, we weren’t clinical enough and they broke on the counter-attack.</p>
              <p>“I told the team at half-time that we needed a third goal. We cannot be happy to be drawing at home. The next game against Arsenal has to be totally different.”</p>

              <p><span>Chelsea have managed just two victories - albeit high-scoring ones - from their seven home matches in all competitions under Rafa Benitez, who has been jeered by Chelsea fans at every game.</span></p>

              <p style="background: white;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Rafa Benitez was ranting at the double last night, renewing his feud with Sir Alex Ferguson and accusing his former Inter </span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Milan</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> defender Marco Materazzi of being ‘a liar’ 10 times during an amazing outburst.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">’s interim manager insisted it is ‘obvious’ his old Manchester United foe </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> is still putting undue pressure on match officials. </span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Benitez, who attracted notoriety for launching an infamous tirade of ‘facts’ about Ferguson’s approach to referees at Liverpool four years ago, claims that Ferguson has continued to throw his weight around. </span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">He said: ‘Maybe now a lot of people are seeing the same things. I will not talk too much about that because it’s obvious. It’s a question for the FA what they do about it. </span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">'What I said at that time was what I thought and what I’m seeing now is similar. It depends on the FA. I don’t know what they will do.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">He was referring to the potential charge </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> faces for claiming linesman Simon Beck had a ‘shocking game’ at Spurs on Sunday. </span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Benitez’s willingness to reopen the debate about </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">’s influence may increase the enmity between long-standing rivals, but </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Ferguson</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> is unlikely to be too concerned as his side have an 11-point lead over </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Rafa Benitez’s feud with Marco Materazzi yesterday took an extraordinary twist when the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> coach accused the former Inter Milan defender of being ‘a liar’ 10 times during an amazing outburst.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Benitez, who must overturn a 2-0 deficit against </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Swansea</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> in tonight’s Capital One Cup semi-final second leg, is furious over claims made by the World Cup winner.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Materazzi, who played under Benitez at the San Siro in 2010, claimed </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">’s interim manager ‘could not be trusted’ and ‘is weak’. </span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The Italian, who gained notoriety when he was headbutted by Zinedine Zidane in the 2006 World Cup final, also claims Benitez took down pictures of predecessor Jose Mourinho at the training ground.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Benitez said: ‘In </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Italy</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> everyone knows Materazzi and everyone at Inter knows him — he’s a liar. He’s lying. He’s lying. He’s lying, just lying. Everything he has said is a lie.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘What he said about Mourinho is not true. Nobody knew Mourinho was leaving (in 2010) and no-one knew the Inter position would become available.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘I don’t know about the locker room, so it’s a lie. If you talk about lies, then he is a liar. </span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘I’ve spoken to his family and they told me I had to understand him so I want to respect him and be nice — but everyone knows him. He cannot discredit anyone because everyone knows him. Forget about him — it’s a lie. Simple.’</span></p>
              <span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">
              <p style="background: white;"><span>After a fleetingly promising start in Italy, Benitez's Inter began to struggle and following the manager's demands for money to spend he was sacked in December 2010, only six months into a two-year contract.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> fans have consistently been hostile to the Spaniard since he replaced Roberto Di Matteo and became the club's interim manager, and Materazzi, himself no stranger to controversy, says he understands why.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">'Rafael Benitez is not my ideal coach,' the World Cup-winning defender said. 'If I was president of a club, I would not trust him with my team. What I did not like about him is how he introduced himself to the group.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">’A great coach, like Jose Mourinho or (Marcelo) Lippi discusses rules with within the group, but Benitez wanted to write 10 or 12 rules. It was like the traffic or being back at school.’</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Materazzi. who played briefly for Everton, is best known for his part in Zinedine Zidane's red card in the World Cup final of 2006, the legendary Frenchman's final act as a professional footballer.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Benitez held productive talks with Roman Abramovich on Sunday after the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> owner returned to </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">London</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> from his holiday in St Barts.</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The manager said: ‘Without giving away too many details, the owner was really pleased with the result against Arsenal (a 2-1 win on Sunday).</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">‘He has ideas and I do too. We share ideas and it’s fine. We explain to each other what we’re trying to do.’</span></p>
              <p style="background: white;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Addressing </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Chelsea</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">’s form, Benitez added: ‘Could we do a bit better? Yes. Could we have won games we lost? Yes. But the team is progressing and if you talk with the players they say we’re going in the right direction.’ </span></p>

              <p><strong>You can, at least, not fault the defiance of Rafa Benitez. He again proved immovable, unlike his side. "We could have won every single game we draw or we lost, every single game," he insisted after yesterday's defeat. "In all the games we had chances and played good football in the majority of them. When we couldn't we still had chances to </strong><a id="_GPLITA_2" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Savings Sidekick" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2497/topics/#"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>win</strong></span></a><strong>."</strong></p>
              </span>
              <div class="body ">
              <p>Fact: Chelsea have picked up 22 points from a possible 39 during his reign, two points less than Roberto di Matteo picked up from one less game this season.</p>
              <p>"We are trying to finish in the top four, or top three, and we can," added Benitez. "We are still looking up towards Manchester City. With some players coming back I think we have more options. When we are in form and doing well we can beat anyone."</p>
              <p>Fact: Chelsea have won three games out of their previous 10 in all competitions.</p>
              <p>"I was really pleased with the reaction of the players," said the interim manager of Chelsea. "That is the main thing for me. The players showed character in the second half. It means something is right. If we cannot control these games, it is something we will have to improve."</p>
              <p>Fact: they were gun-ho, leaving gaping holes all over their defence and allowing Newcastle to fight back from a lost position.</p>
              <p>With Rafa there is always a "but".</p>
              <p>Frank Lampard's goal tally reached double figures for the 10th season running, a quite phenomenal achievement, with a breathtaking strike in the 54th minute</p>
              <p>"I'm here to talk about the game," said Benitez when asked about the fact Lampard is set to leave Stamford Bridge in the summer.</p>
              <p>There was, and indeed still is, some sympathy for Benitez. His looked a losing hand when he succeeded Di Matteo.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, a crucial decision went against him. Demba Ba had seen a shot saved by Tim Krul when the ball came back to him in the Newcastle penalty area. He headed the rebound narrowly wide. As he lowered his head, Fabricio Coloccini's desperate attempt at a saving tackle saw him smash his former team-mate in the face.</p>
              <p>"We couldn't change the situation of Demba Ba," he added. "It was a penalty and a red card for me. In the middle of the park [it would be] carry on, go back, free-kick. In the penalty area [it would be] carry on, go back, penalty and red card. It would have changed the game. We lost one player with a broken nose.</p>
              <p>"It is something we have to consider. In other circumstances everybody would be talking about this. I want to remind you that that happened. Sometimes we don't remember these things. After watching the replay it is very clear. A player with a nose broken and bleeding for five minutes I think is good evidence. Demba has a broken nose and we will have to wait and see."</p>
              <p>Ba received lengthy treatment. Eventually, with his face taped up, he returned to the game. It was short- lived. By the time he was forced to leave the field, to cruel jeers from the majority of Newcastle supporters, his new club were behind. Davide Santon had crossed from the left and Jonas Gutierrez stole in ahead of a flat-footed John Terry to glance a header past Petr Cech.</p>
              <p>Lampard had missed a fine opportunity after just quarter-of-an-hour but on 55 minutes made amends in style, crashing a 25-yard shot past Krul. At that point Benitez was correct. Chelsea took control. A second, delightful goal would come their way just past the hour, Fernando Torres, who entered as Ba went off, laid the ball to Juan Mata and the finish was precise, curling into the top corner of the Newcastle goal.</p>
              <p>At this point Benitez needed his new team for once to speak up for his endless work on the training ground. They did not.</p>
              <p>Moussa Sissoko, the January signing from Toulouse, had become an increasing presence in the game. In the 68th minute, when fellow home debutant Yoan Gouffran broke free of an absent Chelsea defence and saw his shot parried by Cech, Sissoko was there to equalise.</p>
              <p>That was the end for the visitors. Newcastle had new energy. In the 90th minute Sissoko passed to Santon, took the return and drilled a fierce, low drive into Cech's goal.</p>
              <p>"It is undoubtedly the game of the season," said Alan Pardew. "It was fabulous. I do not think we will better that. When you play the top sides, it is important to knock them out of their stride.</p>
              <p>"We got the goal and in the second half Chelsea came out and showed why they had such fabulous players. We struggled for 15 minutes. They were two unbelievable goals. It can knock the stuffing out of sides but we didn't let that happen. We had intelligence. We got a breakaway and then we were back in the game. It was a fantastic winning goal. It nearly took the roof off. The whole team was magnificent. Sissoko? I don't really need to say too much. His performance spoke for itself."</p>
              <p>Something Benitez's Chelsea still cannot do.</p>

              <p>why did RA appoint him is really beyond anyone's comprehension.</p>
              <p>i hope chelsea finished outside top 4 and not qualify for next season's CL.</p>
              <p>i cant help laughing when i think of torres which cost chelsea 50 million from liverpool.  he cant score.  liverpool in turn bought sturridge from chelsea at 15 million.  he has scored 4 goals in 6 matches.</p>

              <p>But more importantly, he being here at chelsea makes them a lesser threat to the title challenge. So United only have City to deal with... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>Rafa looked so good during his liverpool days, and i still think he should be the man instead of Rodger.</p>
