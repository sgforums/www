              <p>Barcelona won their 19th La Liga title this weekend without even
                      having to kick a ball, thanks to Real Madrid’s loss at Villarreal. The
                      game reached a thrilling conclusion, with the Valencian side stealing a
                      3-2 win in the 90th minute.</p>
              <p>Everyone in attendance found it to be an exciting affair, except for <strong>Julien Faubert</strong>, who was too busy scratching his nuts and falling asleep to notice.</p>
