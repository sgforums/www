              <p><strong>Manchester United are set to put their disappointment at missing out on Eden Hazard behind them by landing Japanese star Shinji Kagawa.</strong></p>
              <p>After having an initial offer knocked back by Borussia Dortmund last week, German magazine Kicker claims United have made an improved bid to the Bundesliga champions.  </p>
              <p>United's new offer for Kagawa is said to be worth £12.5million up front, rising to £18.3million.</p>
              <p>Dortmund are resigned to losing the midfielder, who has just one year left on his contract, and are determined to squeeze as much money out of United to buy a replacement.</p>

              Utd: Kagawa deal not about shirts
              
              Manchester United commercial director Richard Arnold insists the club are not looking to sign Japan playmaker Shinji Kagawa simply to sell shirts.
              
              Kagawa is reportedly close to moving from Bundesliga champions Borussia Dortmund to Old Trafford on a â‚¬15 million transfer, which could rise to â‚¬22 million with add-ons. Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke fuelled speculation further on Tuesday evening, telling Derwesten: "Both sides want to conclude the deal."
              
              Meanwhile, United's South Korean midfielder Park Ji-Sung may exit the club this summer, sparking talk the club are looking to the sign Kagawa to boost brand recognition throughout Asia. Arnold, though, believes United's individual players do not drive the club's off-field profitability.
              
              "We don't sign players to sell shirts." Arnold said. "We are reliant on 25 players and they are all massive stars. We have 25 George Clooneys.
              
              "When you look at the success we've seen in that part of the world [Asia], it isn't down to any one player or person. Of course, Ji is a fantastic player, was captain of the South Korea team and continues to be a key part of our squad. 
              
              "But for Manchester United, it's more than any one player. It was more than George Best, it was more than Bryan Robson, it was more than David Beckham, it was more than Cantona, than Park. 
              
              "Ji is very popular in Korea, just as Javier Hernandez is hugely popular in Mexico, but Paul Scholes has his own Chinese character. These are huge stars and the big stars are the big stars in every country. Our games are shown 1.1 billion homes across the globe and you think 'which film does that 60 times a year?' 
              
              "Be it George Clooney or Brad Pitt, what is there where that is shown? There just isn't anything like it."
              
              =============
              
              its about shirts.  who are they trying to fool?

              <p>Obviously it's not about shirts. I think first and foremost he must have the ability otherwise how many shirts he can sell won't warrant him a place in the limited squad of 25.</p>
              <p>Fergie also won't bother to take the time out to personally watch him since April.</p>
              <p>Secondly, it's a disrespect to him to suggest he is bought solely to sell shirts when he played a major roll in <span style="color: #000000;">Borussia Dortmund winning the German title for the last 2 seasons.</span></p>
              <p>However, there will sure be some who will still like to say so just like they did when United bought Park years ago... Park has proven it not to be the case when he has played in so many of United's big games over the years including the final of the CL.</p>
              <p>But if his shirts sell, it's a bonus... He will probably be the biggest star since Hidetoshi Nakata to come out of Japan. Tho Nakata didn't had that much success on the pitch compare to Kagawa's so far relatively short spell in Europe. United must quickly close the deal before someone comes in to disturb.</p>

              <p>The Borussia Dortmund playmaker, 23, will seal the move later this month once a medical and work permit have been completed.</p>
              <p>A United statement said: "We are delighted to announce that we have agreed terms with both Borussia Dortmund and Shinji Kagawa for his transfer to the club.</p>
              <p>"The deal is subject only to the player passing a medical and obtaining a UK work permit.</p>
              <p>"These conditions are anticipated to be completed by the end of June."</p>
              <p>Kagawa, who is on international duty with Japan, said: "We still have two games left and the entire team is focused on these qualifiers.</p>
              <p>"I'll talk about all of this once I am done here. I hope people will understand."</p>
              <p>United defender Rio Ferdinand was delighted with the capture.</p>
              <p>He wrote on Twitter: "Welcome to Shinji Kagawa for his transfer to Man Utd. Here's to a successful time here bro!"</p>
              <p>Borussia sports director Michael Zorc was responsible for bringing the player to Dortmund in 2010.</p>
              <p>And he said: "We would like to thank Shinji for his effort and his large contribution in two extraordinarily successful years."</p>
              <p>Kagawa was named in the Bundesliga's team of the season for 2010-11 despite being absent through injury for half the campaign.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Shinji Kagawa has become the fifth Japanese player signed by a Premier League club after Manchester United confirmed a deal to bring the forward to Old Trafford.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Borussia Dortmund star will cost United up to £17million, representing a staggering profit of £16.7m for the Bundesliga side in just two years. </span></p>
              <p><span>Kagawa follows Junichi Inamoto, Kazuyuki Toda, Hidetoshi Nakata and Ryo Miyaichi, but stands to be the one to at last shatter once and for all the stereotypical view that Far Eastern players are bought solely as a marketing tool.</span></p>
              <p><span>And the stats bear this out. </span> </p>
              <p><span>Last season as Dortmund secured back-to-back Bundesliga titles, Kagawa was at the fulcrum of everything good in their play, carrying the burden of creativity in the absence, for the most part, of Mario Gotze. </span></p>
              <p><span>In fact, no midfielder was involved in more top flight goals in Germany in the second half of the season than Kagawa, who this year alone registered  nine goals (he scored 16 in total) and four assists.</span></p>
              <p><span>He even scored against Arsenal earlier this season in the Champions League.</span></p>
              <p><span>Of all those, perhaps the most important came in the DFB Pokal final. Kagawa scored inside three minutes to set Dortmund on their way to glory, a match watched from the stands by Sir Alex Ferguson.</span></p>
              <p><span>On the international front, Kagawa, who featured in Japan's 3-0 World Cup qualifying win over Oman recently, has scored a goal every three games since making his debut in 2008. And that's from a predominantly wide position. </span></p>
              <p><span>At club level, Kagawa is comfortable anywhere across the line of attacking midfielders behind the striker.</span></p>
              <p><span>So it's fair to say United have pulled off quite the coup in capturing the versatile forward.</span></p>

However, Sir Alex Ferguson moved quickly to secure the signing of the Japan midfielder. <br><br>Kagawa is now eagerly anticipating getting started for the Red Devils and insists he wants to carve out his own legacy at Old Trafford after turning down the chance to wear the famed No.7 shirt once donned with such distinction by George Best, David Beckham, and Cristiano Ronaldo. <br><br>United's latest signing announced the decision in an impromptu press conference at Tokyo's Narita Airport following a whirlwind trip to England. <br><br>In addition to a flock of journalists, the Japan international was greeted by 100 fans seeking autographs and handshakes.<br><br>"I've just joined the team and haven't accomplished anything yet," Kagawa said after the 12-hour flight. "I want to make a name for myself [at United] on my own terms."<br><br>Kagawa further elaborated that he had asked for a number with personal meaning, leading to speculation among Japanese media that the player could wear the 8, 26, or 29 he once wore at Cerezo Osaka, or the 23 shirt that brought him fame at Dortmund.<br><br>"I don't know which numbers are free," Kagawa coyly told reporters.  "I gave them my requests, but they aren't as important a number [as No. 7]" <br><br>Despite the rigorous travel schedule, the Samurai Blue star still appeared excited after finally putting pen to paper on the move.<br><br>"The contract was as long as I'd expected from a club [like United]," Kagawa laughed. "When I was at [Old Trafford], I thought about how incredible it would be if I could score there."<span><span><br></span></span></div>

              <p><span><strong>Manchester United are closing in on Brazilian teenage forward Lucas Moura after unveiling their first two signings of the summer.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>While manager Sir Alex Ferguson paraded Shinji Kagawa and Nick Powell at Old Trafford, chief scout Jim Lawlor was in Sao Paulo to tie up a £25million deal for the highly rated playmaker.</span></p>
              <p><span>Lawlor flew to Brazil on Wednesday evening and club secretary John Alexander is also believed to be on standby to complete the transfer as United look to secure Moura’s signature before he plays in a pre-Olympic friendly against Great Britain at Middlesbrough next week.</span></p>
              <p><span>Sao Paulo claim they have already rejected a £32.4m offer from Chelsea but United are hopeful of signing the 19-year-old if they can improve on Inter Milan’s unsuccessful bid of £20m. Brazil midfielder Anderson could also be included as part of the package.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson, who continues to monitor Robin van Persie’s situation at Arsenal, said: ‘It’s possible we could bring in one or maybe two more. When there’s a European Championship or World Cup on there is a delay in the transfer industry. Now that’s over we’re still trying to get maybe one player in.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>Flanked by the boy from Kobe and one from Crewe, Ferguson set about trying to re-establish United as champions of England following that dramatic title race with neighbours Manchester City.</span></p>
              <p><span>Asked how he had reflected on losing the Barclays Premier League title on the last day of the season, the Old Trafford boss joked: ‘Red wine helps!’ </span></p>
              <div class="moduleHalf">
              <div class="sport item"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ManUnitedMail"></a><span>Bringing in Kagawa and Powell for an initial joint cost of £16m might not be seen as the most emphatic of statements but Ferguson continues to build carefully for the future amid persistent questions over his spending power.

              <p>His performance in the 5-2 German Cup Final win over Bayern Munich convinced Ferguson to spend £12million on a man he believes will help reinvigorate his side.</p>
              <p>Fergie said: “He can give us that bit extra in the final third of the field.</p>
              <p>“If his goalscoring record continues, he could be a very good player for us.</p>
              </span>

              <p><span><strong>‘I’m sure he’ll improve his English over the next few months,’ said  Ferguson. ‘He won’t understand my Scottish when I lose my temper anyway so it doesn’t matter! </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>‘Once he adapts and knows some of the football phrases our players use then he can start in the first game.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘He plays in behind the striker, he’s quick and he’s got good vision. He can give us that bit extra in the final third.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Kagawa’s popularity in the Far East was clear from the number of Japanese media at Old Trafford.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘I definitely feel the attention of the media globally now that I’m a member of a great club like Manchester United,’ said Kagawa. ‘But I think I can take the pressure. I’m confident I can adapt to the Premier League style.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘Now that I’m training here I can really see the difference. Everything is on a high level and when all the other players join us it will be even higher. This is definitely the greatest  challenge of my career.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>If Kagawa is aware of the increased interest, imagine how Powell feels after just two seasons at Crewe in League Two. Ferguson says he sees the 18-year-old’s future in central midfield, but Powell is prepared to be patient following his £4m move.</span></p>
              <p><span>He said: ‘At Crewe it was one camera and one person, but Manchester United is the whole world. I want to be a United player and show what I can do. But obviously I’ll bide my time.’</span></p>
