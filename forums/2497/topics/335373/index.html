              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez says he expects Ryan Babel to play more and more as a
              striker for Liverpool – but admits he has little intention of including
              him in the first-team. </strong></p>
              <p>The 21-year-old Holland international has
              spent most of his time on the wing since moving to Anfield last summer,
              but he can also play up front and showed his potential as a forward
              when he came off the bench in the 1-0 win over Chelsea on Sunday.</p>
              <p>And, after Spain winger Albert Riera joined
              the club in September, Benitez has revealed that he wants to play Babel
              as a striker on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>“When we signed Albert Riera, we thought of Babel more as a striker,” he told the club’s official website.</p>
              <p>“Ryan is still a young player.</p>
              <p>“Some Dutch players come to England for only
              one or two years – in this case, this is his second year and he was
              injured at the start coming back from the Olympic Games, but he is
              giving us something more.”</p>
              <p>Benitez believes Babel can make the most
              impact as a substitute for the time being, though, due to his pace, and
              believes his performance against Chelsea was a perfect example.</p>
              <p>“Clearly, there is a massive difference when
              you are talking about a player with pace – normally their stamina
              levels are not the same.</p>
              <p>“To do the same thing 20 times at maximum intensity, it’s not easy, so they need time to rest.</p>
              <p>“For these kind of players to play 90 minutes
              at this pace and high tempo is impossible. That is the reason why he
              can make a massive difference in 20 to 30 minutes.”</p>
              <p>He added: “I was really pleased with him the other day at Chelsea. I think that was the perfect game for him.</p>
              <p>“At that time, we needed pace and power and ability so we could cope with the two centre backs – he could beat them.</p>
              <p>“It was perfect and really good for him.”</p>
