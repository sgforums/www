              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">BRAZIL legend Branco reckons he knows the recipe for a successful World Cup - sex and booze.  </h2>
              <p>The full-back, a member of the victorious Brazilian team in 1994, reckons a bonk does you good during the finals - as long as it is not with a team-mate's missus! </p>
              <p>Branco, 46, said: "What harm is there in it? My son Stefano was conceived during the 1994 World Cup when I spent a day off in San Francisco with my wife.</p>
              <p>"Sex is good for you. It relieves tension. We hadn't won the World Cup for 24 years, so it didn't do us any harm.</p>
              <p>"Sex at the camp should only be ruled out with a team-mate's wife. What you can't do is stuff your face until four in the morning or stay in a brothel.</p>
              <p>"We were very professional when we won the World Cup in '94. We went there to win it.</p>
              <p>"Drinking was allowed and we'd have three or four drinks to relax. What's wrong with that?</p>
              <p>"If it were a problem, then there wouldn't be any football in England or Germany, where they drink beer, or in Italy, France and Argentina, where they drink wine. It's part of the culture.</p>
              <p>"There was drink in '94, I conceived my son and everyone said we were perfect physically and tactically. What's the problem?"</p>
              <p>Robinho scored two goals and Kaka added another as Brazil easily defeated Tanzania 5-1 yesterday in their last World Cup warm-up in Dar Es Salaam.</p>
              <p>Sub midfielder Ramires scored his first two international goals for the Samba stars in the second half.</p>
              <p>Brazil started with all their regulars bar keeper Julio Cesar, who is nursing a back injury.</p>
              <p>If he fails to recover in time, Tottenham ace Heurelho Gomes is itching to become the South Americans' No 1.</p>
              <p>Gomes insists he would not let down his country if he gets the nod to start against North Korea in their opening group game a week today.</p>
              <p>He said: "Yes, it's a chance for me. I feel good but I think Julio Cesar will be fit."</p>
