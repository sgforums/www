              *Milan chief rules out Chelsea signing Kaka and Pato*
                  
                  
                  
              *AC Milan general manager and vice-president Adriano Galliani has ruled out any chance of Chelsea signing Kaka this summer, insisting it's a case of moving to Real Madrid or staying at the San Siro.*
                  
              Reports on Wednesday evening suggested Chelsea had tried to usurp Real with a bid of Â£73.5m, but that has been denied by all parties. And now Galliani claims there is no chance of a move to the Premier League for Brazil star Kaka, or his compatriot Alexander Pato. 
                  
              With doubts over the deal for Kaka it was suggested new Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti would instead try to take Pato with him to Stamford Bridge. But it appears Milan are adamant that the only person making the switch from Milan to London will be their former coach.
                  
              Milan seem certain to complete a deal which will see the 27-year-old Kaka head to the Bernabeu, with the money on the table too good to turn down for a club which has been losing â‚¬70m a season. Real are expected to pay â‚¬65m.
                  
              Galliani told Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport: "An agreement with Chelsea could not exist. *Kaka goes to Real or he remains at Milan.* "That is his choice and we are doing everything in complete agreement. Negotiations (with Real) do exist, but an agreement is not done.
                  
              Milan can not go on losing â‚¬70m a year. The motivation behind Kaka's sale would be economical."
                  
              Galliani insisted 19-year-old superstar Pato is not for sale, though. He said: "There is a negotiation for Kaka, but none of our other key men are for sale. That includes (Alexandre) Pato, (Andrea) Pirlo and (Clarence) Seedorf."
                  
              The news of Kaka's possible departure has angered Milan supporters, but Galliani said: "I want to calm the fans. It's not that by selling Kaka we will not sign anyone else. If Kaka leaves, a great striker will arrive.''
                  
              Milan have long been interested in Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor who is thought to be on his way out at the Emirates. But when asked if Arsenal forward Emmanuel Adebayor would be the chosen one, Galliani said: "No.''
                  
              Owner Silvio Berlusconi insists Kaka will have the final say on his future. "No decision has been taken yet,'' Berlusconi told TV Station Rai Uno. "On Monday I will speak to Kaka and then I will let you know. The ones that decide the future are always the lads (players), who need to choose where to continue their career and when to put their money aside.
                  
              "Players must choose what suits their interests best.'' Real Madrid president Floretino Perez was glad to hear Chelsea claim they would not be making a bid on Wednesday evening. 
                  
              "This statement is an advantage,'' he added. "If Chelsea are not competing with us it is good news. "The problem wouldn't be the presentation of Kaka, the problem would be if we are capable of fixing it so he plays for Real Madrid.
                  
              "We have good relations with Milan. I'm a friend of (general manager, Adriano) Galliani which will make this agreement easier. Moreover, the player has shown his desire to play for us.''
