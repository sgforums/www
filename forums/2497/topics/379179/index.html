              <p> </p>
              <p>A multinational consortium, led by a group of wealthy West Ham fans,
              is reportedly lining up a £100 million bid to buy the Premier League
              strugglers.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The
              Hammers are currently owned by CB Holding, an Icelandic holding company
              made up of banks owed money by the previous owner Bjorgolfur
              Gudmundsson, but a report in the <em>News of the World</em> claims that a group headed by Wall Street businessman Jim Bowe will make an offer.</p>
              <p>Bowe's
              Intermarket Group have begun negotiations with a view to buying the
              Upton Park club in the coming weeks and have aspirations to make money
              available in the January transfer window.</p>
              <p>"My colleagues and I
              have been approached by the consortium with the aim of buying West Ham
              in its entirety," Bowe told the News of the World. "We are not
              interested in just taking on the debt, or securing a percentage. We
              want to get West Ham back on track for the upper echelons of the
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>"We
              want what the fans want and there is no restriction on us as to how we
              achieve that aim. We are in the early stages of our discussions with
              the club. But we are optimistic that we can develop a proposal that
              will benefit all parties. The best deal is the deal where everyone
              feels that they've won.</p>
              <p>"The consortium comprises West Ham
              supporters who have made serious money in the City, the United States
              and elsewhere and who see the potential in the club, its fanbase,
              academy and playing staff.</p>
              <p>"The people involved have the money
              required, and, more importantly, the right sentiments. They have no
              interest in interfering with the playing side of things, but they will
              make money available in the January transfer window."</p>

              <p>Bowe, who is also is the former head of the New York Board of Trade,
              was recruited specifically to arrange the deal and the group made
