If we get beaten 1-0 at home and people have a moan, then that's fine. I've had a moan as well."<br><br>Pearce is refusing to put the blame onto his players, who have not been performing lately.<br><br>He added: "I don't feel let down. Sometimes I'm disappointed with their performance, as I am with my own performance.<br><br>"But sometimes I'm not. I don't feel as though players have let me down on purpose." </span><br><br>Wonders if he will stay...</div>

"This is one of the biggest clubs in the country.<br><br>"If I had spent Â£50million, Â£60million or Â£70million putting talent on the pitch and it wasn't happening then I might say to myself `Hang on a minute son, you haven't done it'. But I haven't.<br><br>"At this club, over the last two years, there have been a lot of things right and a few things wrong.<br><br>"We know what the shortcomings are. This season they are there for all to see. I don't fear the sack because I know the players will respond.<br><br>"It is important that - no matter what my future is at City - the baby doesn't go out with the bath water."<br><br>Meanwhile, Pearce has filled the void vacated by Frankie Bunn by naming former Swansea boss Kenny Jackett as their new reserve team coach.<br><br>Jackett, who spent three years in charge of The Swans, had been out of work since leaving the Welsh outfit three months ago.</span></div>
