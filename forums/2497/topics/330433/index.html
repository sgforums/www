              <h2><img src="http://cache.daylife.com/imageserve/05eMeZk46v9Vz/610x.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="406"></h2>
              <h2>Noh Alam Shah sent a strong warning out to the rest of the league
                                on Thursday evening, as he scored twice to help Tampines Rovers to a
                                4-1 victory over bottom-placed Balestier Khalsa.</h2>
              <p>After a substitute appearance almost two weeks ago, all eyes were on
                                the man in the No.9 as he lined up alongside his old and new Rovers
                                team-mates for the first time since that fateful Singapore Cup Final of
                                2007. <br><br>There had been doubts over his match fitness and
                                technical ability, having not played at this level for a long time, but
                                his two goals and numerous chances to convert were a testament to the
                                fact that his ability has not faded away with the seven-month ban. <br><br>Noticeable
                                missing figures in the lineup were veterans Rafi Ali and Zulkarnaen
                                Zainal, the former out with an injury while the latter served the first
                                of his two-match suspension. <br><br>Despite these absences, the
                                energetic Alam Shah was dangerous from the beginning, and as early as
                                the third minute threatened to score as Santi Chaiyaphuak’s cross was
                                headed down into his path by Ridhuan Muhammad, but his shot flew past
                                the left post. <br><br>On the ten-minute mark, Qiu Li bagged his
                                eleventh goal of the season with an easy tap-in, after Ang Bang Heng
                                failed to muster a proper save to Alam Shah’s overhead kick. <br><br>Alam
                                Shah then turned provider for Khairul Amri in a quick
                                counterattack after Fahrudin Mustafic volleyed the ball away from the
                                penalty box, out of Paul Bekombo’s reach, but Amri aimed for the middle
                                and sent his shot right into the goalkeeper’s safe hands.<br><br>The
                                28-year-old could have scored early when Ridhuan toe-poked a cross from
                                the extreme right which shaved past the top of his head and in front of
                                an empty goal. The loose ball landed at Amri’s feet, but even he failed
                                to contribute effectively to the scoreline. <br><br>Tampines’ failure
                                to convert their numerous chances was punished when the speedy Hironori
                                Saruta equalized for the away side in stoppage time at the end of the
                                first half. <br><br>Mba Vitus Onyekachi’s through pass down the middle
                                caused panic amongst the Stags defence, as Rezal Hassan came off his
                                line only to see Mustafic, Shariff Abdul Samat and Sutee Suksomkit
                                embarrass themselves in a three-way collision, allowing the Japanese
                                forward to volley the ball into an empty net. <br><br>However,
                                Tampines managed to raise their game in the second half, and five
                                minutes after the restart, Santi blazed through the middle and threaded
                                a pass to to Alam Shah, who beat his marker and shot past the keeper to
                                record his first goal of the season. <br><br>Not too long later,
                                Tampines were 3-1 up as Ridhuan tore down the right flank and sent in a
                                quick, low cross to Amri, who slammed the ball into the bottom near
                                corner.<br><br>Despite the attacking prowess, Tampines appeared weak at the back as they were exposed by Balestier several times in the match. <br><br>If Saruta’s
                                goal was not warning enough, they were tested again twice in the second
                                half, when Rezal smothered Rhysh Roshan Rai’s narrow-angled shot and
                                cleared away a loose ball. <br><br>When Mustafic then missed a
                                backpass and was pressured by Bekombo, Rezal saved his team again
                                by getting his hands to the powerful shot from outside the box by the
                                Cameroonian. <br><br>Alam Shah rounded off a wonderful evening for
                                himself and his team in the 72nd minute, faking a defender and adding
                                his second by slipping the ball in between Ang’s legs. <br><br>Aliff
                                Shafaein replaced Amri in the 80th minute and could have provided the
                                man dubbed “the Crown Prince” with a hat-trick in the closing stages,
                                but the latter saw his shot swerve just past the left post. <br><br>Despite not
                                making the game more memorable by scoring thrice, Alam Shah was happy
                                with two, and now looks set to reclaim his former glory as the king of
                                Tampines. <br><br>“I feel great, and it is good for a striker to get
                                early goals, and for his fellow strikers to score as well,” he said
                                after the match.<br><br>“I wouldn’t say we were very good for the first half, but this is a young squad and we need to take our time.” <br><br>Alam
                                Shah also likened his current role as a mentor-figure to the younger
                                Amri and Qiu Li to the one Mirko Grabovac played when he was still at
                                the club. <br><br>“I am now doing what Mirko did for me in the past,”
                                he said. “The three of us are doing very well together in training for
                                the past few days, but there is still a lot of work to do, and a lot of
                                understanding to be cultivated.” <br><br>On the other end, Balestier
                                coach Nasaruddin Jalil admitted that lack of experience was one of the
                                major deciding factors in the match.<br><br>“We all know Alam Shah is a good striker, but our defenders made it too easy for him,” said Nasaruddin. <br><br>“Experience
                                is experience. Our defending was not tight enough and we made simple
                                but fundamental mistakes which we should not be making. If you don’t
                                mark strikers properly, even the lousy ones would be able to score a
                                goal.<br><br>“For strikers, if you don’t score, you don’t lose matches, but it is different for the defenders.” <br><br>Nasaruddin
                                also commented on his team’s lack of ability to sustain a performance
                                for 90 minutes, as seen in the second half when they let in three goals
                                after a strong first period. <br><br>“We were able to reduce their
                                chances in the first half, because we managed to close them down and
                                shut them off, but the second half, we sat back and then they came at
                                us.<br><br>“When I decide to play an offensive and highly intense game,
                                we will be able to put pressure on any team if we are able to sustain
                                the intensity, but we cannot do so and because of this our confidence
                                drops.<br><br>“I can see players who are willing to push up, but if we
                                do too much offensively, we will expose our back, and the defenders
                                need to work on identifying this problem.<br><br>“We had our chances on goal, but we just don’t have enough experience.”</p>
