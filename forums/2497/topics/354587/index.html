              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has agreed a two-year extension to his current contract at Anfield. </strong></p>
              <p>The England ace's deal on Merseyside still had two years before it expired, but the Reds have moved to secure their star asset.</p>
              <p>Gerrard
              has been in inspirational form as Rafa Benitez's side chase Premier
              League and UEFA Champions League glory, and the news will come as a
              major boost.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old is now tied to the club until at
              least 2013 and Benitez, who recently signed a new five-year deal, is
              pleased his skipper has put pen-to-paper.</p>
              <p>Benitez told Liverpool's <em>official website</em>: "This is fantastic news for the club.</p>
              <p>"Steven
              has once again shown his commitment and it was an easy deal to agree.
              As soon as we offered him the option he said yes. There were no
              problems at all. He wants to stay for life.</p>
              <p>"This deal sends
              out another clear message that we are moving forward as a club. To know
              we have a player of Steven's quality with us for many more years is a
              great boost for the club and the fans.</p>
              <p>"He is clearly a player
              who inspires those around him and even though he is playing very well
              at the moment, I still think his best years are ahead of him."</p>

              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard today denied being involved in a nightclub fight - on the day he was handed a hefty pay rise by </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>The Anfield captain pleaded not guilty to affray when he appeared at Liverpool Crown Court. The 28-year-old was accused of being part of a group that injured businessman Marcus McGee, 34, at the Lounge Inn, Southport, in the early hours of December 29 last year.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old had two years to run on his £100,000 a week Liverpool deal but has agreed improved terms to stay at the club until 2013.</p>
              <p>He has surpassed Fernando Torres as the top earner at the club and will pick up about £125,000 a week in a deal that will be worth close to £26million.</p>
              <p>Manager Rafael Benitez told the club's website: 'This is fantastic news for the club. Steven has once again shown his commitment and it was an easy deal to agree. As soon as we offered him the option he said yes. There were no problems at all. He wants to stay for life.</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool’s money-men have been hard at work on Friday, tying Dirk Kuyt and Steven Gerrard to new contracts. </strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard, who had two years to run on his current deal, has penned a two-year extension that keeps him at the club until 2013.</p>
              <p>Workmanlike winger Kuyt has also been handed the handsome reward of
              a two-year extension, as Rafa Benitez follows through with his promise
              to tie key players to new contracts.</p>
              <p>Kuyt has often divided opinion during his time on Merseyside, with
              some Kopites believing the blond Dutchman to be too limited, while
              others recognise his big contributions in big games.</p>
              <p>Arriving from Feyenoord with a goalscoring reputation after netting
              71 league goals in 101 games, Kuyt has rarely looked as skilful in
              front of goal for Liverpool, netting just 23 league goals in 94
              outings.</p>
              <p>His contribution and work ethic though, particularly in the big
              games (most notably last season’s Champions League tie with Arsenal)
              can never be overlooked , and Benitez will be delighted to have tied
              down his favourite Dutchman ahead of Saturday's crucial clash with
              Fulham.</p>
