              <p>William Gallas is ready to sign with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Harry Redknapp</span></abbr> has stepped up his bid to pull off a controversial deal for Gallas.</p>
              <p>Wheeler dealer Redknapp is determined to strengthen his squad, 
              especially after Tottenham’s Champions League defensive horror show 
              against Young Boys.</p>
              <p>Former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> skipper Gallas, now a free agent, is understood to be “very interested” in moving to White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>Redknapp wants the Frenchman because he has concerns over the long-term 
              future of Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate, but may struggle to 
              convince chairman Daniel Levy about signing the 33-year-old centre-half.</p>
              <p>Gallas left <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> in June after he failed to land a two-year deal and looked destined for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr> before the Italian giants pulled out when he received a better offer from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Panathinaikos</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>But the move to Greece fell through and, despite interest in France, Gallas has set his sights on the Premier League.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">WILLIAM GALLAS is set to sign for Spurs - and instantly become a hate figure for Arsenal fans.</h2>
              <p>The free-agent former Gunners captain will have a medical and is due to sign a one-year deal over the weekend.</p>
              <p>A pal said: "Apart from a few details, everything has been agreed and William will have a medical on Friday."</p>
              <p>Gallas met Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp last night and asked for a two-year contract but only a year was on offer.</p>
              <p>Redknapp was desperate to boost his defence due to the long-standing injury problems of Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate.</p>
              <p>Gallas, 33, will not be registered in time to face Stoke tomorrow or play in the crucial second leg of the Champions League qualifier against Young Boys with Spurs 3-2 down.</p>
              <p>He was let go by Arsenal after refusing to accept a one-year deal that included a pay cut.</p>
              <p>The ex-Chelsea centre-half suffered abuse from fans every time he went back to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>But that will be nothing compared to the reception he will get at the Emirates on November 21.</p>

              <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur manager</strong> <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Harry Redknapp</strong></span> <strong>has confirmed that William Gallas is on the brink of joining the club, describing the signing of the former Arsenal captain as a "no-brainer".</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Gallas left Arsenal on a free transfer in June having failed to agree a contract extension with the club he joined from Chelsea in 2006. The French defender made 145 appearances for the Gunners, scoring 17 goals.</p>
              <p>Following France's disastrous World Cup campaign, Gallas was targeted by Panathinaikos but could not agree personal terms with the Greek side.</p>
              <p>Despite reservations over the reaction of Tottenham fans to a former Arsenal captain arriving at the club, Redknapp is determined to strengthen his defensive options with <span style="color: #000000;">Jonathan Woodgate</span> a long-term injury victim and <span style="color: #000000;">Ledley King</span> often unable to play two games in a week.</p>
              <p>Gallas will undergo a medical on Friday afternoon before making Tottenham the third club he has represented in London.</p>
              <p>In recent seasons, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/23602/David-Bentley"><span style="color: #000000;">David Bentley</span></a>, Rohan Ricketts and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/42237/Jamie-O'Hara"><span style="color: #000000;">Jamie O'Hara</span></a> have all crossed the North London divide, while <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/8049/Sol-Campbell"><span style="color: #000000;">Sol Campbell</span></a> famously made the reverse journey in 2001.</p>

              <p><em>Redknapp on</em> <em>Gallas: He gets annoyed with people who are not as professional as he is, which is not a bad thing.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"He's a no-brainer on a free transfer," Redknapp said. "He's never asked for big money here. The chairman's agreed a one-year contract with him and the wages are more than reasonable.</strong></p>
              <p>"He's done nothing wrong. What's he done wrong? He's not the first player to go from Arsenal to Tottenham or Tottenham to Arsenal. It happens all the time. He won championships and all sorts at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"He's a great lad as well, smashing fellow. I've been absolutely really impressed with him. He'll improve Tottenham and that's all I'm concerned about. He wants to come here and play and I think that shows the character. He could say, 'I played at Arsenal; I daren't go there'. He's got the bottle to want to come and play here.</p>
              <p>"I don't think his attitude's ever been questioned. The only problem he has, he gets annoyed with people at times - they tell me - who are not as professional as he is, which is not a bad thing. That can't do any harm.</p>
              <p>"He wants everybody to be as professional and want to win as much as he does. If he can bring that to this team as well, that'll be a good bonus for us. Whenever we've played against him over the years, I've always thought he was a world-class defender.''</p>
              <p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger did not expect Gallas to move to White Hart Lane, but has dismissed suggestions that the defender was a disruptive influence at Emirates Stadium, despite being stripped of the captaincy for criticising team-mates in public.</p>
