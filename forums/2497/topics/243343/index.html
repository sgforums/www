            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"> Suggestions that Roman Abramovich could be prepared to sell Chelsea have been branded as 'ludicrous' by the Russian billionaire's spokesman.<br><br>Reports in Sunday's newspapers claim that the Stamford Bridge supremo is contemplating the sale of the club he purchased in 2003 and bankrolled to successive Premiership titles.<br><br>Abramovich is reputedly being asked to supply Â£1billion towards Russia's bid to host the 2014 Winter Olympics by the country's president Vladimir Putin, and recently underwent a costly divorce.<br><br>Now reports in the press claim that the oligarch may be prepared to sell up at Chelsea after plunging over Â£500million of his personal fortune into the club.<br><br>However, Abramovich's spokesman John Mann has stringently denied that the Blues owner is ready to relinquish control at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"These rumours are ludicrous," Mann told the Sunday Express.<br><br>"Roman has said it a million times, he is in this for the long term.<br><br>"This doesn't make any sense because Chelsea is a very small part of his investment portfolio."<br><br>The Blues have claimed four major trophies since Abramovich took charge, but his relationship with manager Jose Mourinho has become strained after reported disputes regarding the club's recent transfer policy.<br><br>However, the club's head of communications Simon Greenberg remains convinced that Abramovich is whole-heartedly committed to the Chelsea cause.<br><br>"It's rubbish," Greenberg added. "I know what the investment plans are." </span></div>

And also with quality players its always easier... you cannot compare to that Newcastle team cos there were many inexperience players then compare to the present chelsea players on average, i think their players cost about $20m per position...<br><br>Therefore i am saying that everyone should remember how important Roman is to Chelsea. Cos without him... you can imagine if Jose gets a budget like Benitez at pool where on average, their purchases i think should be below $10m per player cos their most ex player i think is Dirk Kuyt right which cost about $10m and see how he perform?<br><br>Do you still think if he were only to have players like Cudicini, Boulahrouz, Geremi those below $10m types can he still do as well?<br><br>He wouldn't be that Special would he?<br><br>That is why i said, every blue fans should realise that without any of the others, chelsea will still continue to be strong but without just one Roman...
