Even if England were to hit double figures against the tiny principality, the pressure on their manager would ease off only a fraction between now and his squad's next genuine test in their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, an end-of-season trip to Estonia. </strong><br><br>Failure to beat Andorra, against whom England scored five without reply in McClaren's first match in charge last year, is so unthinkable that the manager will be able to claim no credit from ending a winless run of five games in which his side have produced a solitary goal.<br><br>A bit of target practice at Barcelona's Olympic stadium could nonethless serve a valuable purpose for McClaren as he seeks to rebuild the self-belief of a squad in which morale appears to be disintegrating.<br><br>In the build-up to the match, McClaren could have done without having to deny suggestions that a rift has developed between him and Wayne Rooney, whose current difficulties in recapturing his best form in an England shirt is one of the main reasons why the team's supply of goals has dried up.<br><br>McClaren dismissed the claims as "an absolute load of rubbish," insisting that Rooney is one of the players to whom he is closest. But it was telling that the head coach did not deny that things had got heated during the dressing room inquest into Saturday's disappointing goalless draw in Israel, a reality which had in any case already been confirmed by his captain, John Terry.<br><br>Instead, McClaren implied that frank exchanges reflected a genuine willingness to address the mystery of why the likes of Rooney, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard have, of late, rarely transformed their club form to the international stage.<br><br>"Everybody is together and knows what we have to do and we have got to start doing it," McClaren said.<br></div>

"Can Lampard and Gerrard play together? They can. They can. They can," the England manager responded with a mixture of desperation and playground histronics.<br><br>Nor was he convincing in dismissing reports of a dressing-room row with Wayne Rooney. "Whatever happened after the game, there is no rift between me and Rooney," he insisted, before stretching credibility by declaring: "Me and Wayne Rooney have one of the best relationships between a player and coach."<br><br>Meanwhile, Andy Johnson, rather than Frank Lampard, is expected to become the fall-guy for the failure to beat Israel...</div>

Coach McClaren has come in for severe criticism following the goalless draw in Israel on Saturday. But speaking ahead of Wednesday's Euro 2008 qualifier with Andorra, Terry said: "The players are 100% behind him. </strong><br><br>Midfielder Steven Gerrard echoed Terry's assertion that an immediate improvement in results is required. "There is no place for hiding now," he said. "I am not enjoying where we are in the table and our performances of late." And the Liverpool skipper was cagey when asked about his ability to play in the same midfield as Frank Lampard.<br><br>"That is a decision that the manager has to make," added Gerrard. "He will pick whatever midfield he thinks is best or suited to the game coming up. "I cannot really say much more on it. Whatever the manager asks me to do I will try to give my best performance for the team. "It is up to Steve McClaren where he wants me to play and what job he wants me to do. "I am trying my best. A lot of us are trying to transmit our club form into internationals.<br><br></div>
