            <div class='col-md body'><strong>STEVEN GERRARD says Wayne Rooney should be getting more help from his team-mates. Striker Rooney, 21, has not scored a competitive England goal in more than 2Â½ years Â— dating back to his double against Croatia at Euro 2004.</strong><br><br>He threw his kit across the dressing- room floor after being blasted by coach Steve McClaren for his display in the 0-0 draw with Israel on Saturday. But midfield man Gerrard claimed: Â“A goal would do Wayne the world of good Â— and then he will go on and score a load more.<br><br>Â“He is all right at the moment. He is the same as usual but he knows he needs a goal at international level. Â“I think it is my responsibility and other players to create the chances for Wayne so he can get on the end of one.<br><br>Â“For England, there have been problems. Â“But if you look at him with Manchester United, he is on fire Â— which I donÂ’t like to see being a Liverpool player. Â“He is playing some of the best football of his career for United.<br><br>Â“I think he is just a goal away from turning it around for England. Â“He is working really hard in training. I donÂ’t have to tell anybody what a wonderful talent Wayne is.Â”<br><br></div>

The midfielder was so desperate to play that he took part in training yesterday wearing protective strapping on his injury, after an X-ray earlier in the week had confirmed the break. It is understood that Lampard has a fracture low down on his arm and that he has also ruptured all the ligaments in his wrist.</strong><br>The news means that Owen Hargreaves, who had been expected to drop out in a tactical rethink, and Steven Gerrard are likely to play in central midfield, with Aaron Lennon on the right and Stewart Downing on the left. The FA declined to give an update on Lampard's fitness although it did confirm the player would travel home with the remainder of McClaren's squad after tonight's game. "We will know the team 75 minutes before kick-off," said a spokesman.<br><br>At this stage it is not known exactly how long Lampard, who is due to play for Chelsea at Watford on Saturday, will be injured for.<br><br></div>

The towering Toni was left unmarked to power in an early goal from a Massimo Oddo free-kick.<br><br>Scotland rallied briefly in the closing stages of the first half but Italy controlled the game for long spells. After an intensive period of pressure from the World Cup winners, Toni again found the net with ease after slack Scottish play on 70 minutes. The Scots are now tied at the top of Group B on 12 points with Ukraine and France, while Italy are two points behind. However, Scotland have played one more game than the other nations.<br><br>Scotland looked out of their depth in the opening stages, struggling to retain the ball and committing a number of clumsy fouls. Italy were enjoying a lot of possession but did not have to work too hard for the opening goal on 12 minutes. Oddo flighted a straightforward free-kick into the penalty box and Toni left Stephen McManus trailing to power in a header from eight yards. Full-backs Gianluca Zambrotta and Oddo were causing Scotland problems with their strong running but Scotland did get forward occasionally.<br><br>Barry Ferguson broke in behind the home defence but his chipped cross was cut out by Marco Materazzi, while Lee McCulloch forced a save from Gianluigi Buffon with a dipping shot from 25 yards. The sliding McCulloch was a yard away from a dangerous low cross from Gary Teale and Kenny Miller made a mess of a header from a Gary Naysmith delivery.<br><br>The second half was three minutes old when Antonio Di Natale was allowed to charge in on goal but Craig Gordon thrust out a hand to keep out the angled shot. The same player broke clear again minutes later and the Hearts goalkeeper used an outstretched leg to deny him for a second time. Gordon smothered a deflected drive from Mauro Camoranesi and Toni glanced a header wide as Italy poured forward in search of a killer second goal. Toni shot straight at Gordon before the prolific Fiorentina striker grabbed his second of the night.<br><br>Substitute Shaun Maloney played a poor pass to Naysmith and the ball was presented to Camoranesi who ran on to flight in a cross for the unchallenged Toni to head in from close range. Scotland threw on strikers Kris Boyd and Craig Beattie but could not trouble the home defence.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Italy: Buffon, Oddo, Cannavaro, Materazzi, Zambrotta, Gattuso, De Rossi, Camoranesi, Perrotta (Pirlo 77), Di Natale (Del Piero 66), Toni (Quagliarella 87).<br>Subs Not Used: Abbiati, Barzagli, Ambrosini, Tonetto.<br><br>Goals: Toni 12, 70.<br><br>Scotland: Gordon, Graham Alexander, Naysmith, Weir, McManus, Ferguson, Teale (Maloney 66), Hartley, Brown (Beattie 86), McCulloch (Boyd 81), Miller.<br>Subs Not Used: McGregor, McNamara, Pressley, Dailly.<br><br>Att: 37,500<br><br>Ref: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium).<br></div>

The visitors took a 27th-minute lead when Johan Elmander held off Aaron Hughes before firing past Maik Taylor.<br><br>Healy levelled four minutes later with a superb strike from 18 yards and won it with a near-post finish from Damien Johnson's cross on 59 minutes. Stephen Craigan nearly scored an own goal after his clearance hit a post.<br><br>The Belfast fans were in full voice as the game started at a frantic pace. There was plenty of effort but creating chances was proving a problem in what was becoming a physical battle. Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was first to go close on 23 minutes with a 25-yard free-kick which drifted just wide. Michael Duff was presented with Northern Ireland's first opening two minutes later but headed well over from a Chris Brunt corner.<br><br>The visitors took the lead with the first good move after 27 minutes, which finished with Elmander using his strength to create space before netting from close range. The equaliser came just four minutes later and it was a superb strike from the prolific Healy, who sent a dipping shot into the top corner from 18 yards.<br><br>Johnson picked up the first booking seven minutes from the break after a trip on Freddie Ljungberg. Sweden looked more potent early in the second half and Grant McCann had to clear off the line from Ibrahimovich's 54th minute header. But it was Northern Ireland who struck next and again it was Healy, meeting Johnson's cross at the nearpost and flicking the ball beyond a diving Iasaksson.<br><br>Lawrie's Sanchez's side were also having a bit of luck as Craigan sent an attempted clearance crashing against a post and out to safety on 69 minutes.<br>Sweden pressed for the equaliser and Ibrahimovich shot over before Ljungberg and Elmander wasted good opportunities. Healy could have made it a second hat-trick in two games but his fierce shot went straight at Andreas Isaksson.<br><br>The Leeds United forward, who has scored nine goals in the qualifying campaign, received a standing ovation after being substituted in the dying seconds.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Northern Ireland: Taylor, Duff, Hughes, Craigan, Evans, Johnson, McCann, Davis, Brunt (Sproule 90), Healy (Webb 89), Feeney (Lafferty 79).<br>Subs Not Used: Carroll, Quinn, Elliott, Jones.<br><br>Booked: Johnson.<br><br>Goals: Healy 31, 58.<br><br>Sweden: Isaksson, Nilsson, Mellberg (Majstorovic 69), Hansson, Edman, Alexandersson (Wilhelmsson 61), Andersson, Svensson (Kallstrom 45), Ljungberg, Ibrahimovic, Elmander.<br>Subs Not Used: Shaaban, Von Schlebrugge, Bakircioglu, Rosenberg.<br><br>Goals: Elmander 26.<br><br>Att: 14,500.<br><br>Ref: Eric Braamhaar (Holland).<br></div>

We wanted six, but we've got four.<br><br>"I thought the first half was difficult, the conditions and they had 11 players behind the ball and you could see we lacked a bit of confidence in our passing.<br><br>"<strong>But at half-time we said you've got to show real guts, real character because of the conditions on and off the field and they dealt with it.</strong> &lt;-- Against an amateur team<br><br>"And you talk about people stepping forward, Stevie Gerrard he really did that tonight.<br><br>"I'm proud of all the players for the way they reacted, the way they won it."<br><br>McClaren accepts the performance and result may not please everyone.<br><br>"That's football, you can never please everybody. Yes, they were a little bit low on confidence, but they kept going and eventually got their rewards.<br><br>Asked about the fans' reaction, he added: "I can understand it, but we came here to win and we've done it. <strong>We're still in a very good position, it's still in our hands.</strong> I'd ask the fans to stick with the players, the players want to do it for the fans. <strong>At times it's difficult but they came through tonight."</strong> -- o9<br><br>Steve McClown thinks England is in a very good position. England despite winning 3-0 has dropped by one place. 4th place, you say you are in a very good position, how about being in the top and 2nd place ? What do you call that ? McClown ? Do you need new spectacles ? Can you count ? (look at the points and goal differences) Do you think Croatia and Russia are walkover teams ? You are obviously talking nonsense and at the same time making England the world biggest laughing stock. Do you know just 3-0 against Andorra (no disrespect ) is a very very poor win ? You talk as if we just beaten an Italian or Brazil side 3-0. Wake up your f***ing idea , McClown. Even the manager has also said that they thought they could get something out of the game, only Gerrard and Lennon threatened to run riots, the rest were inept.<br><br>The boos England gets are well deserved, those players that backed McClown should shut their mouths up. Who are they to speak when their team are not performing and delivering the results. The England fans have every right to boo them whether they like it or not. For them to pay $$ to travel to see them giving such inept and mediocre performance is absolutely unacceptable. Do you really think FA is backing you up? I am sure they are considering their next move. With you in charge, McClown. I can see you losing your job before you know it.<br><br>McClown is the same mould as Alan Clasrubbish (West Ham manager.)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hargreaves backing McClaren</span></strong></span><br><br><strong>England international midfielder Owen Hargreaves has given his backing to under-fire manager Steve McClaren following their 3-0 win over Andorra.</strong><br><br>McClaren felt the heat from England fans on Wednesday after receiving some early barracking in Barcelona after taking 54 minutes to break down the international minnows.<br><br>Despite being held to a goalless draw at half-time Bayern Munich ace Hargreaves believes the former Middlesbrough boss guided his troops to the crucial win.<br><br>"The manager did a great job at half-time," explained Hargreaves. "He found the right words to motivate the team and make sure we did a great job in winning the game.<br><br>"He found the right message to get the lads going. He said 'keep going, we will get goals and create chances.' and he was very positive.<br><br>"That's what we needed to hear from him and we responded in the right way and did a very good job in the second half. Should he stay? Definitely."<br><br>Hargreaves was critical of Andorra's style of play in the Euro 2008 qualifier and felt referee Bruno Paixao did not offer enough protection to the players.<br><br>"The first half was frustrating," he continued. "We tried to set out to score goals and put them under pressure and we didn't do a great job on them.<br><br>"They didn't really come to play and just defended. In the second half we moved the ball quickly and created chances and just a shame we couldn't score more goals.<br><br>"In the second half we kept our cool and even in the conditions - and despite some of the tackles they put in - we did the job we needed.<br><br>"Some of the challenges were shocking and I don't think the referee protected the players enough at times. I told him numerous times.<br><br>"People could have got injured. You don't want to see that and it was a shame something like that could happen at this level."</div>
