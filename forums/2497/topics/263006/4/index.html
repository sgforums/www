            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Henry urged to be Frank over exit</strong></span><br><br><strong>Arsenal legend Frank McLintock has accused Barcelona-bound striker Thierry Henry of making excuses over his impending departure.</strong><br><br>Henry is on the verge of a Â£16million move to Barca, with the Gunners confirming only a medical and other formalities had yet to be completed.<br><br>Arsenal's talismanic captain, who only signed a new four-year contract last summer, has cited the acrimonious exit of vice-chairman David Dein and the refusal of manager Arsene Wenger to commit his own future beyond the end of the forthcoming season as his reasons for leaving.<br><br>But former defender McLintock, who skippered the club to their first league and FA Cup double in 1971, was having none of it.<br><br>He said: "I think it's a reason, like most players make a reason up.<br><br>"I would rather he just said: 'I've had great years at Arsenal, I've loved it there, I think it's now time to move on'.<br><br>"I would rather hear a player saying that.<br><br>"I'd prefer a little bit more honesty. He should say: 'I think it's time for me to move on. I think I can maybe win more honours at Barcelona, because of Arsenal's financial set-up at the moment'.<br><br>McLintock is particularly sceptical about Henry's relationship with Dein.<br><br>"I can't see the relevance of David Dein's departure," he said.<br><br>"I don't know how a player can get caught up with a director's departure and that making a difference to a player's performance.<br><br>"I'm sure David Dein did a marvellous job but I think his marvellous work would have been done with Arsene Wenger.<br><br>"That would usually be in the office, talking and working out financial settlements.<br><br>"I'm sure he was a great ally to Arsene Wenger - but I don't see how a player comes into contact with a director day after day.<br><br>"I've never heard such talk in my life before.<br><br>"I never remember seeing any director apart from the then chairman, Denis Hill-Wood, who used to come in before the game and wish us all the best.<br><br>"That was the only time we ever saw any directors.<br><br>"I'm not trying to knock what David Dein's done, because he has done a smashing job, but I don't see where the relevance is between a player who plays for the football club and what is contact is with him [Dein].<br><br>"It's not as though he's in his pocket every day and he's all of a sudden missing him badly."<br><br>McLintock accepts Henry, who scored a record 226 goals in 364 games for the club, has more of case regarding his concerns about Wenger's future.<br><br>But he added: "It might be a genuine reason, I don't really know.<br><br>"It could be just another excuse for moving on. Most players seem to say something to prevent the fans turning on them, so they can leave with a warm feeling."<br><br>Despite his reservations, McLintock hailed Henry as Arsenal's greatest player ever.<br><br>"He didn't play well last year and even part of the year before," he said.<br><br>"But he's probably been the finest player Arsenal have ever had so you can't dismiss five or six great seasons that he gave us.<br><br>"You've got to hand that to him.<br><br>"I think the fans should leave with a warm feeling for Thierry Henry. He deserves it - he's been magnificent."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Thierry Henry Goes And Kroenke Wants To Underwrite Arsenal</strong><br><br>THIERRY Henry is leaving Arsenal. But they are not the same club that made him into a world star. Have faith Gunners:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stan Kroenke has offered to underwrite a multimillion-pound transfer budget</span> for Arsenal but the club's directors are determined to go it alone.<br><br>Arsenal's capacity to compete in the transfer market has frequently been called into question and uncertainty surrounds the position of the manager, ArsÃ¨ne Wenger, beyond the expiry of his contract in 12 months.<br><br>With that in mind, Kroenke has suggested ploughing fresh funds into the club.<br><br>"It seems that the anxiety about Stan Kroenke and his intentions has been well documented," said a source close to the American billionaire. "But he'd like to support Arsenal."<br><br>If Hill-Wood and Kroenke were able to repair the damage, Wenger may be persuaded to extend his contract. Conversely, if Kroenke managed to buy out Arsenal in the next 12 months and have Dein reinstated, Wenger would almost certainly stay.<br><br>How Wenger replaces Henry will also have a great bearing on his final decision. It is, though, the impossible task.<br><br>Even at 29 and injury prone, Henry is blessed with skills that are possessed by only a few. That Samuel EtoÂ’o Â– one of those few Â– will remain at Barcelona and play alongside Henry limits the field farther.<br><br>When Patrick Vieira left two years ago, Cesc FÃ bregas emerged from the Arsenal brat pack to plug the gap. However, when Henry goes, there appears to be no one to fill his shoes. Another campaign of frustration and touchline ranting looms for Wenger.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Who Arsenal gets next will be important.<br><br>Its different from RVN leaving Man Utd. In RVN case its Man Utd not wanting him and not the other way round. Even then, they had Rooney and Ronaldo waiting in the wings. Also, they had the experience of Giggs, Scholes and Neville to back them up.<br><br>Now that Henry leaves, there is no longer any real experience up front. Hopefully RVP can fill up the space. Although I Man Utd fan, but I like and respect the way Arsenal play. They can really claim to be playing beautiful football. Sometimes better than Man Utd even.</div>
