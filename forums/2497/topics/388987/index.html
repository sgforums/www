              <p>Hamburg have signed <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Real Madrid</span></abbr> striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.</p>
              <p>The 33-year-old had been linked with a host of clubs recently as he looked to secure more playing time, with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West Ham</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> just two of the teams that were interested in the former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> striker.</p>
              <p>But HSV confirmed after their 1-0 Bundesliga defeat at Borussia
              Dortmund on Saturday evening that they had won the race for the
              player's signature.</p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy quit international football after Holland's
              quarter-final exit to Russia at Euro 2008, but recently expressed his
              desire to return and now has his sights firmly set on a place in Bert
              van Marwijk's Oranje squad for South Africa.</p>
              <p>"I would like to play well for HSV and be successful with them," he told <em>hsv.de</em>. "And then I obviously hope that the national team coach gives me a call and that I can go to the World Cup."</p>
              <p>Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia was delighted to have secured the services of the prolific Dutchman.</p>
              <p>He said: "Ruud has proved his qualities impressively at some of
              Europe's top clubs. I am convinced that he will also score some
              important goals for HSV.</p>
              <p>"It just emphasises the reputation of our club that a player like Ruud van Nistelrooy decides to join Hamburg."</p>
              <p>Van Nistelrooy was equally thrilled to have become a Hamburg player.</p>
              <p>"I am really happy that it has worked out," he said.</p>
              <p>"I am also looking forward to Monday when I come to Hamburg. I
              had great talks with both Bernd Hoffmann (Hamburg president) and Bruno
              Labbadia and had a very positive impression from the very beginning.</p>
              <p>"HSV is a great club with a strong team and big ambitions. I also have big ambitions."</p>

              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Ruud van Nistelrooy has officially completed his free transfer from Real Madrid to Hamburger SV.<br><br>The 33-year-old moves to the north of Germany on a free transfer, penning a 1.5 year deal at the HSH Nordbank Arena.<br><br>Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia confirmed the move on television, saying: "Yes, we have made an agreement with (Ruud).<br><br>"I'm very happy that he decided to join us. He's joined for free."<br><br>Ruud joined Madrid after five years with Manchester United in 2006, going on to score 33 goals in all competitions in his first season in Spain.<br><br>However,
              injuries took their toll in his second campaign in La Liga, and in the
              last 18 months he's been restricted to a mere seven league appearances.<br><br>The arrival of young Karim Benzema at the Bernabeu this summer, coupled by Cristiano Ronaldo's forward position and the continued form of Gonzalo Higuain, has meant that even in fitness van Nistelrooy's chances have been limited.<br><br>This
              prompted the forward to look into a January move, with Madrid agreeing
              to release him from his contract six months early as reward for his
              good service.<br><br>Clubs from across the continent, including Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United, had designs on the veteran forward but in the end he has opted to try his luck in the Bundesliga.<br><br>Ruud
              has previously announced his retirement from international football but
              it is not impossible that a fine start to his Hamburg career could spur
              a Netherlands comeback in time for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.</span></p>
