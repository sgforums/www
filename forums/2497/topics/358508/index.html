              <p><strong>Frank Lampard claims there should not even be an argument over who is the best player in the world. </strong></p>
              <p>Lampard is convinced Chelsea’s Champions League destiny is under
              threat from the world’s greatest player on Wednesday, as Barcelona and
              Lionel Messi come to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Messi has been sublime for Barcelona this season, already
              contributing to more goals in a season (36 goals and 17 assists) than
              Cristiano Ronaldo managed last season (42 goals and eight assists).</p>
              <p>Having watched Messi rip Real Madrid to shreds on Saturday
              night, Lampard insists there is not even a doubt over the world’s
              greatest player.</p>
              <p>“I rate Messi as the best,” he said in The News of the World.</p>
              <p>“He is the best player in the world without a shadow of a doubt. By a country mile in fact.</p>
              <p>“He is absolute fantastic. Okay I don’t think in the first leg he delivered what people were expecting of him.</p>
              <p>“But believe me the man is a genius and can explode with a piece of magic that can change a game.”</p>

              <p>Say all this also no point lah, Messi is still not going to give chance in the 2nd leg...</p>
              <p>He think say this type of stuff at this time just when they are about to play them he will feel so good that he won't think about trying his best is it... Like Fergie said Boro boss Gareth Southgate is a good young manager and deserve to stay in his job then the Boro team come out without fire to win... Cos not angry mah... lol.</p>
              <p>This is subjective lah... But one thing I guess most would agree is... They are both better than him lor... lol    <img title="Laughing" src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"></p>

              <p>Better in character? Hmmm... I am not very sure about that leh... You serious? You thought of that thoroughly or you just shoot it off your mouth without thinking?</p>
              <p>He got a "wife" for many years already, they even had 2 daughters together but still refused to marry her... Then over the years he is still fooling around like he was still a single young man...</p>
              <p>His "wife" spent the best years of her youth with him, before he joint Chelsea, before he even became rich and famous... bore him 2 children... Now that he has made it and she has "become old" (34)... He dump her for a younger 23 yrs old...</p>
              <p>Whats worse is, all these years as he was fooling around and got caught with other women by the Press while he was still with her... You can only imagine the agony she have been feeling over the years reading the news about him bringing all these women back to hotels and stuff like that...</p>
              <p>Better in character? I seriously doubt that... Look at some of the top players around, Giggs, Scholes, Carrick, Neville... They got married and look after their wives and children. You don't hear them bring women out or to hotels... Even Terry, who is also in the same position as Lampard, got wife and kids, you don't catch him bringing other women to hotels or having the women coming out to the press to talk... He at most goes to the Pub or some lap-dancing club or drink himself dead drunk... Lampard have so far been caught bringing women back to his hotel when he was in Las Vegas and Spain... and back to his home in London...</p>
              <p>So, still better in character? definitely not... The very least with Ronaldo, who came from a very poor family, today he has helped his brother, his sisters who now have their own fashion business because of him and he still look after his mother dearly... In character wise, the very least he still look after his family... Lampard, seems to have a lot of flaws...</p>
              <p>I applause the DJ that highlighted the plight of his "ex-wife"... At least public pressure and wanting to keep his reputation will make him do the right thing even if he didn't do it the first time round...</p>
              <p>But one thing I have no doubt on is... As good as he may be, he is still a lesser player than either Messi or Ronaldo lah... This I think you also agree with me right...</p>

              For Messi to be crowned best player for next year award, Barcelona would need to win the CL.
              
              The previous 2 winners, their club won the CL.The current one, Ronaldo and the previous one, kaka.

              <p>I think lampard is up there and comparable with messi or ronaldo.</p>
              <p>At least we know lampard is a professional and have been good in every season for almost 10 years already.</p>
              <p>As for messi, he may turn out to be a 'flash in the pan'. He may be explosive and strong for 5 seasons but maybe he will go downhill after 5 seasons.</p>

              <p>That incident at West Ham, I think it also involved Kieron Dyer.</p>
              <p>As much as I don't approve of that kind of lifestyle, that is the personal lives of footballers itself. Not like Ronaldo isn't guilty of such going-ons as well.

              <p>Point is not about his personal life or whatever, he made a comment that was based on football. Although extreme or even biased, he made that comment from a footballing perspective.</p>
