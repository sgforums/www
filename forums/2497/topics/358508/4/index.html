              <p class="introcopy"><strong>FRANK LAMPARD has launched a broadside at the critics who attacked Didier Drogba for his post-match rant at ­referee Tom Henning Ovrebo and said he would be proud to play alongside a man with such passion – if he stays at the club.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">Chelsea are still reeling from the shock of their Champions League semi-final exit at the hands of Barcelona on Wednesday night, their agony intensified by the fact their dream ended in the third minute of injury-time with Andres Iniesta’s goal – Barcelona’s only shot on target .</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Pep Guardiola’s Barca team progressed on the away goals rule to face Manchester United in the final in Rome on May 27, as Iniesta’s heartbreaking goal cancelled out Michael Essien’s superb early strike.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But it is the scenes after the game which could hurt Chelsea just as much as what went on during it. Drogba, substituted before the end, raced back on to the pitch at the final whistle to confront referee Ovrebo and harangued him as he left the pitch and down the tunnel.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">He and Michael Ballack, who also hounded Ovrebo, could now face European bans – and it is understood Chelsea could be willing to listen to offers for Drogba this summer because of that potential ban and his age.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">But Lampard remains staunchly behind Drogba, 31, and has defended his actions.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Lampard, whose team have now lost five out of their six Champions League semi-finals, said: “I can understand Didier’s reactions. He’s an emotional man. But that’s the sort of player you want to play with. People can relate to that.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“All the fans in the stadium were frustrated at the end. We were trying to get to the final and Didier wanted to get to the final. When that gets taken away you get passionate.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“We deserved to go through . Barcelona were very strong in the Nou Camp. We defended, worked hard out there, but we deserved to win this second leg.</p>
              <div class="padding7north">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">“We could have scored more goals and we had at least three blatant penalties turned down. Everyone who saw it can see that, when there’s that many blatant penalties and they’re not given, they can understand our sense of injustice.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I don’t know what people expect. When you have 11 grown men battling to get to the final and at least three penalty decisions don’t go your way, you can’t expect men to walk away quietly. There was nothing violent, it was just angry, because we had worked so very hard to get that far.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Skipper John Terry and Lampard also confronted Ovrebo at the end, but it was Drogba who had to be dragged away, swearing at television cameras as he went.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Ovrebo refused at least three legitimate appeals, for fouls on Florent Malouda and Drogba and a handball by Gerard Pique, plus a more questionable call on a handball by Samuel Eto’o.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Lampard said: “I tried to ask the question of the referee. One decision maybe you don’t get, two maybe, but three, four or five then it’s just not possible that you don’t get them.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“Whether it’s a conspiracy or not is not for me to say. That’s for others. But you have to wonder why. The referee didn’t say anything. He didn’t explain, but then I don’t think it’s explainable. I think if he looks again then he will realise.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“The Pique handball was as blatant a penalty as you will ever see. The linesman was right in line, the ref was very close.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Lampard had spoken before about Chelsea being cursed never to win the Champions League after so many near misses – they were beaten in a penalty shoot-out in the final by United last year – but he said: “I don’t think it’s a curse but one day hopefully we’ll get that little bit of luck and go on and win it.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“Everyone knows what we felt after last year’s final. Credit to Barcelona, they are a great team and it will be a great final, probably the final a lot of people wanted to see against United.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“There was a lot said in our dressing room, but I can’t repeat it. It wasn’t just frustration with the referee. They scored in the last minute and we were going through at that stage, so that was frustrating for us.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“We had chances to kill the game, even after you take the penalties out of it. We played a very strong game. You know they are going to have possession but I don’t remember them getting behind us, whereas we created a number of chances.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I was worried when the decisions were not being given because you know the more that happens the more chance there is that Barcelona can come back and hurt you.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Chelsea now have to pick themselves up, firstly for Sunday’s Premier League clash with Arsenal at the Emirates , then for the FA Cup final against Everton at Wembley on May 30 – their only remaining chance of silverware this season.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Lampard added: “ This has been so disappointing, but we’re footballers and we carry on. The FA Cup matters a lot and we want to win it, we’d not have taken our eye off the ball on that whatever happened.”‘I can understand Didier’s reaction’</p>
