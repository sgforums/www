              <p>well, true, but then it started with someone who throw

              <p>You mean youyayu? I know you guys have issues between each other. I do agree that when it comes to character, Lampard is a better man. But it may be because he is older and more mature. That supposed incident while at West Ham, I guess he was around Ronaldo's age as well?</p>
              <p>And when I talk about character, I'm not just referring to issues of fidelity or whatever. Remember how Ronaldo shamelessly displayed he wanted to go Real Madrid? And going as far as to imply he's a 'slave' and all?</p>

              <p><br> yes orgies are commonplace among footballers. But he already has a
              gf. We dont hear the likes of married men like giggs and scholes
              screwing around. haha oh well, lampard is not married despite 2
              kids. wonderful.</p>

              <p>Not being married and having two kids, cohabitation and all. Again even though I don't agree with this kind of lifestyle, the acceptance level there is different. I don't think it's fair to use our standards to judge him like that. You can't deny he doesn't love his kids or his family. The only reason he phoned in was because his sister was distressed by it and he was man enough to do something about it. The way he dealt with it was way better than how most people would have done, whether it was here in Singapore or there in England.</p>
              <p>Just a point of information about Man U players though, Giggs himself had an issue before, although I never followed-up on how it went. I remember reading about it, it was while Beckham was still there and should be before they won the treble. Giggs the girlfriend of a good friend pregnant. Then there was all sorts of talk about him being sold to Inter Milan because he was also falling out with people in the dressing room.</p>
              <p>Cantona himself has had scandals, one night after dinner at his home with his missus and Man U's then head of security, the two men went out to a bar together where Cantona went off and slept with the wife of the owner of the bar albeit with the husband's consent. This story was an excerpt from the book by that Head of Security (forgot his name).</p>
              <p>Also, Beckham and his international flings?</p>
              <p>I say give and take, especially since all this involves personal lives and for all we know, none of these stories are true. It might be even that there are stories we don't know about.</p>
              <p>Let's just try to keep the discussion to footballing, even the character part. Like how they conduct themselves with respect to loyalty to club or how they honour their contracts or things like that. I hope you get what I mean.</p>
              <p>Maybe just to mention, Ronaldo when he played awat against Sporting Lison in the Champs League was nice enough to acknowledge the club and its fans for all they had done for him. Can't say every footballer is like that, especially since Ronaldo is known to give his own when it comes to opposition fans.</p>

              <p>I think one thing we can agree on is Ronaldo really did express explicit interest to go Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>I'm pretty much 50-50 about the Lampard going to Barcelona, mainly because there was no explicit indication of interest to go. To actually come out and say it is a different thing altogether.</p>
              <p>We don't know what happened within the club, but I can't quite say going around your club and using the media seems like a nice thing to do.</p>
              <p>I was more understanding after the Euro Cup incident involving Rooney and England vs Portugal. It made sense if he were to leave. But after having survived through the worst of the abuse, where club, fans and manager have stood by him. Not comparing him to anyone by itself it just seems wrong to me.</p>
              <p>Just curious though, if the club themselves had been the ones who wanted to sell to cash in on him, without the player himself saying he wanted to leave, what would your thoughts be then?</p>

              <p>That incident at West Ham, I think it also involved Kieron Dyer.</p>
              <p>As much as I don't approve of that kind of lifestyle, that is the personal lives of footballers itself. Not like Ronaldo isn't guilty of such going-ons as well. Remember the party with Nani and Anderson? Besides, this kind of lifestyle is much more common there and more accepted in general.</p>
              <p>Also, it's hard to say whether he's been around as many as reports say, if every report is to be believed then Ronaldo would have been guilty of rape too as reported some time back.</p>
              <p>Not like he earns money from sleeping around, but he does earn based on his performance on the pitch. I think it's only natural that a father earns what he can to give his children a better life.</p>
              <p>Point is not about his personal life or whatever, he made a comment that was based on football. Although extreme or even biased, he made that comment from a footballing perspective.</p>
              <p>As for his performance during the game, I don't think the teams tactics that night helped him either. We'll see how during the second leg.</p>

              <p>Yes indeed it's his personal live... It's their personal lives that is the best way to see a character, not on the field where it's just a job at the end of the day... And where on earth did you get the impression it was just from a footballing perspective? Because it certainly wasn't obvious to me... But whatever it is, you cannot deny what he did and continue to do till this present day is an act of bad character can you?</p>
              <p>If you talk about that incident of Ronaldo with<span style="color: #008000;"> </span>Nani and Anderson... Seriously speaking, what was so wrong about them? They are all young unmarried men in their early 20s... No wife, no partner, no son, no daughters... in other words, no children... All single young men. You even bother to compare this to Lampard's? Do you see the difference or not, or your bias mind can't tell it apart? Well, I will try to point it out for you... One is not married, is single and no kids at home waiting for them... The other is in his 30s, has a partner for 7 yrs, have 2 kids at home... Now, do you see the vast difference?</p>
              <p>Lets put it this way, even Rooney... ever since he got married, he don't go fooling around anymore... he is even expecting a kid with his wife soon... Then their is Henry, he also has a child and he got married too... He is prepared to be responsible to them legally unlike Lampard... I can's think any worse of him. He had a partner before he even joint Chelsea, became rich and famous, have kids but yet refused to marry the woman of his children... Why? One can only assume that he isn't responsible enough... He could be afraid that he may have to pay a huge settlement in the event he decides to dump her... But now he don't really have to... And if not for the DJ and the public attention it attracted, he may have just left them in that small apartment... In other words, I find his actions that of a cowardice...</p>

              <p>You mean youyayu? I know you guys have issues between each other. I do agree that when it comes to character, Lampard is a better man. But it may be because he is older and more mature. That supposed incident while at West Ham, I guess he was around Ronaldo's age as well?</p>
              <p>And when I talk about character, I'm not just referring to issues of fidelity or whatever. Remember how Ronaldo shamelessly displayed he wanted to go Real Madrid? And going as far as to imply he's a 'slave' and all?</p>

              <p>I find it very hard to agree with you that Lampard have a better character at all...</p>
              <p>When we talk about character, its about the whole part of it. What is so wrong for Ronaldo to talk about his dream to play for Real Madrid? He is a Portuguese least you not know... We know Portugese and S Americans, Mexicans and even some parts of N America grow up following Spanish football...</p>
              <p>It's no surprise cos of their language and they don't come any bigger than Real Madrid. Its just a dream most aspiring young footballers from these countries could have as a young boy. Zizu, Figo and many famous footballers requested to leave their respective clubs so as to join Real Madrid... Were they any worse, they went for footballing reasons and not because of the money...</p>
              <p>You just ask yourself, Who was flirting with Barcelona then Inter Milan at the start of this season because he wasn't pleased with the $100,000 he was getting and demanded $150,000 and a 5 years contract? Is Ronaldo any worse than Lampard who held his club to ransom... Certainly not in my opinion...</p>

              <p>Not being married and having two kids, cohabitation and all. Again even though I don't agree with this kind of lifestyle, the acceptance level there is different. I don't think it's fair to use our standards to judge him like that. You can't deny he doesn't love his kids or his family. The only reason he phoned in was because his sister was distressed by it and he was man enough to do something about it. The way he dealt with it was way better than how most people would have done, whether it was here in Singapore or there in England.</p>
              <p>Just a point of information about Man U players though, Giggs himself had an issue before, although I never followed-up on how it went. I remember reading about it, it was while Beckham was still there and should be before they won the treble. Giggs the girlfriend of a good friend pregnant. Then there was all sorts of talk about him being sold to Inter Milan because he was also falling out with people in the dressing room.</p>
              <p>Cantona himself has had scandals, one night after dinner at his home with his missus and Man U's then head of security, the two men went out to a bar together where Cantona went off and slept with the wife of the owner of the bar albeit with the husband's consent. This story was an excerpt from the book by that Head of Security (forgot his name).</p>
              <p>Also, Beckham and his international flings?</p>
              <p>I say give and take, especially since all this involves personal lives and for all we know, none of these stories are true. It might be even that there are stories we don't know about.</p>
              <p>Let's just try to keep the discussion to footballing, even the character part. Like how they conduct themselves with respect to loyalty to club or how they honour their contracts or things like that. I hope you get what I mean.</p>
              <p>Maybe just to mention, Ronaldo when he played awat against Sporting Lison in the Champs League was nice enough to acknowledge the club and its fans for all they had done for him. Can't say every footballer is like that, especially since Ronaldo is known to give his own when it comes to opposition fans.</p>

              <p>I don't know where you get your acceptance level from... But perhaps you might like to name a few who live it up like him... The names I mentioned earlier are all around his age and living in the same country as him... Carrick, Scholes, Neville, Brown, Giggs, Gerrard... Am I using our standard?</p>
              <p>If you talk about Giggs, it was a long time ago before he got married or have kids... Have you heard of anything since? Is Lampard in the same position? How can you even compare them... How much does he love his children? Well, we have to ask...</p>
              <p>Is it enough for him to stop fooling around? I guess not right... The very least he could have done was moved out and leave the house to his kids and the mother of his children... But he let them go instead...</p>

              <p>With a post list that Zocoss, it's really ironic that you accusse me of bias. And to think you so eagerly side me when I was commenting about certain other forumers in the past that you had issues with. Bias indeed.</p>
              <p>The thing about his kids and the apartment and all, we won't really know sure whether the arrangements were before or after the article. Give and take. And what he says makes sense, when you split, obviously you're not going to stay together, it's a fact of life. I'm sure whatever arrangements they have, there's bound to be many considerations into it good or bad. All I'm saying is not to read too much into it. You seem eager to condemn him though, bias maybe?</p>
              <p>The Ronaldo, Nani, Anderson issue, Ronaldo was attached then was he not? Some supermodel or something. In any case, I was only bringing up that incident in response to that of the one involving current Man U defender, Ferdinand and Lampard while they were still at West Ham. Back then, Ferdinand, Lampard were young and single too. Maybe if you weren't so worked up you might realise what I was trying to say and that the bias doesn't lie with me.</p>
              <p>About Rooney, well, if we were to assume every news article is true, remember him and some old granny hooker?</p>
              <p>Henry himself before he left to Barcelona split with his wife. Again media reports rumoured there was a third party involved.</p>
              <p>I just wish you'd come up with better examples actually. Gary Neville in my opinion is a good example when it comes to such issues about personal life. Or even Paul Scholes. I think ex-keeper Tim Howard is a good example as well. Just funny you should mention Rooney off hand. I'm just recalling off the top of my head as well just like you.</p>
              <p>I think also when commenting on character, you and I have different standards. I won't comment on yours, but personally their private lives is one thing, whether or not I agree or approve of that kind of lifestyle. But what comment Lampard made about Messi vs Ronaldo was based on football. Ronaldo's wanting to leave Man U is also footballing linked.</p>
              <p>Maybe as a person, you can talk about who they sleep with and all, for myself I limit to just what the person is as a footballer and in the footballing world. Just for the record though, a professional footballer's personal life shouldn't interfere with his performance (think Ronaldinho). Ronaldo and Lampard though are two individuals who haven't let their personal lives affect what they do on the pitch. Maybe it drives and inspires them even.</p>
              <p>It's really funny to think that people in this forum have previously accused me of being a Man U fan and here this is happening. I think you should reflect on yourself about bias being an ex-Chelsea fan and all.</p>

              <p>Yes, and I commented on it then already. So don't wish to repeat. Not here anyway.</p>
              <p>So, do you think Messi is better or Ronaldo is better?</p>

              <p>Rather than react the way some of you do, why not point out in what ways Ronaldo is better than Messi? I believe the true fans among you should be able to raise some points.</p>
              <p>Why is your first reaction to react like a raving fanatic and blast whoever said that?</p>
              <p>Is Ronaldo really such a perfect player to you guys?</p>

              <p>With a post list that Zocoss, it's really ironic that you accusse me of bias. And to think you so eagerly side me when I was commenting about certain other forumers in the past that you had issues with. Bias indeed.</p>
              <p>The thing about his kids and the apartment and all, we won't really know sure whether the arrangements were before or after the article. Give and take. And what he says makes sense, when you split, obviously you're not going to stay together, it's a fact of life. I'm sure whatever arrangements they have, there's bound to be many considerations into it good or bad. All I'm saying is not to read too much into it. You seem eager to condemn him though, bias maybe?</p>
              <p>The Ronaldo, Nani, Anderson issue, Ronaldo was attached then was he not? Some supermodel or something. In any case, I was only bringing up that incident in response to that of the one involving current Man U defender, Ferdinand and Lampard while they were still at West Ham. Back then, Ferdinand, Lampard were young and single too. Maybe if you weren't so worked up you might realise what I was trying to say and that the bias doesn't lie with me.</p>
              <p>About Rooney, well, if we were to assume every news article is true, remember him and some old granny hooker?</p>
              <p>Henry himself before he left to Barcelona split with his wife. Again media reports rumoured there was a third party involved.</p>
              <p>I just wish you'd come up with better examples actually. Gary Neville in my opinion is a good example when it comes to such issues about personal life. Or even Paul Scholes. I think ex-keeper Tim Howard is a good example as well. Just funny you should mention Rooney off hand. I'm just recalling off the top of my head as well just like you.</p>
              <p>I think also when commenting on character, you and I have different standards. I won't comment on yours, but personally their private lives is one thing, whether or not I agree or approve of that kind of lifestyle. But what comment Lampard made about Messi vs Ronaldo was based on football. Ronaldo's wanting to leave Man U is also footballing linked.</p>
              <p>Maybe as a person, you can talk about who they sleep with and all, for myself I limit to just what the person is as a footballer and in the footballing world. Just for the record though, a professional footballer's personal life shouldn't interfere with his performance (think Ronaldinho). Ronaldo and Lampard though are two individuals who haven't let their personal lives affect what they do on the pitch. Maybe it drives and inspires them even.</p>
              <p>It's really funny to think that people in this forum have previously accused me of being a Man U fan and here this is happening. I think you should reflect on yourself about bias being an ex-Chelsea fan and all.</p>

              <p>Errr... did I sided with you before?</p>
              <p>The thing with his kids, they moved to a small apartment didn't they?</p>
              <p>Ronaldo attach to who? One of his many girlfriends? You call that attach? What do you call Lampard's 7 yrs relationship then?</p>
              <p>On Rooney, how old was he then? did I not mention before he got married and now expecting a kid? </p>
              <p>Henry had the responsibility to marry the mother of his kid... And was prepared to be bound to them legally... Did Lampard?</p>
              <p>And there is this cock guy going around faking as a Man United fan... When in truth, he is a Chelsea fan trying to get others work up only... How obvious...</p>
