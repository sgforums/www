              <p>So Rooney wasn't married at that time correct?  Yes / No?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are the standards over there so different? Perhaps you can name a few more footballers who have kids and live like Lamp? Cos I have mentioned a number already who don't...</p>
              <p>So you think Lamp's character is better when he isn't prepared to be bound to them legally... In other words, he was ready to shy away responsibility and let his kids grow up and be consider bastards all their lives? Is this how much he loved them? Apparently not very much is it?</p>

              <p>End of the day zocoss, no matter how much scandal there is involving Man U players or players of any club, you like them for what they achieve on the pitch right? Be it simply for titles, the way they play on the field or even the history of the club.</p>
              <p>The main thing is, do feel Ronaldo is better or Messi is better? (and I don't mean in terms of off-pitch night activites)</p>
              <p>Btw, you're assuming I'm a Chelsea fan aren't you?</p>

              <p>On your question... For me both are brilliant players... Messi was much better at the beginning of the season and still is but I feel Ronaldo has now regain his last season's form and this has made him a more dangerous player than Messi right now.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Messi is easier to mark out... his game is mainly great dribbling skills and shooting from within the 12 yard box... If you can place 2 good defenders on him and kick him unfairly, he can be disrupted... Another thing is, I can't remember watching him play as a left winger before... Is he only a right-winger all the time?</p>
              <p>Ronaldo in my opinion has more in him... His dribbling may be a shade below Messi, but he makes it up with other attributes like he can score from headers, free-kicks, long-range... and of course within the box as well. He can also play in all the top 4 positions well... Striker, 2nd striker, left and right wingers too... Only thing is he don't defend very well, something that is not uncommon to Messi too.</p>
              <p>So, Messi is great to watch but like Wilcott, he can be controlled too if the tactics are good enough like what Chelsea did in the 1st leg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, I am not assuming you are, bias does not mean you have to be a Blue... Just read up your past postings and you can see why I said it... If you need further explanation I will be happy to provide it. While I only comment on Lampard the player the man, his character, I leave Chelsea totally out of it.</p>

              <p><br>I think you missed my point... When I mentioned Lamp himself could have moved to a hotel or the temporary apartment if he was really concern for his kids, I also expected you to know that their mother would be with them in the mansion... (Just Lamp moved out instead rather than all 3 of them).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok on Ronaldo... Don't you think you are assuming too much here? For all you know, he might get married next year... But the question was at that point in time, not the future... Was Lampard's relationship similar to Ronaldo's? Of course not right. One has a partner for 7 yrs with kids, while the other was fooling around openly for all to see... I am surprise you are still trying not to see the obvious difference to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, engaged or maybe not but definitely not married or have kids at that time correct? His future wife could choose to still marry him or not correct? The point is, since he got married, has he continued that behaviour to date? How about Lamp even after he had kids or during his 7 yrs relationship?</p>

              <p>You say the standards there are different, and you are sure there are other footballers that are in such arrangements... yet you can't name any? Not even one... But even if you can, don't you agree I can come up with more that isn't like Lamp? I have already mentioned Neville, Carrick, Gerrard, Scholes, Brown, Tevez, Shevchenko, Giggs, Van Der Vaart, Rual, Buffon... You cannot deny the majority isn't living it like Lamp can you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You asked why is he not bound to them legally? You serious? Simple... Cos he is not married to Elen Rives. She has no redress to take him to court for any settlement... What she can get out of him is his charity to her and her children. She cannot be like Henry's wife who got almost half of what he is worth... She can only get what he is willing to give.</p>
              <p>You keep stressing that you don't agree with such lifestyle but yet you don't seem to see anything wrong with it either and in fact you defend it as well... You can't always be a fence sitter right...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh... I think you know what I'm talking about on that point... But we shall keep it at that then since you claim otherwise... Again, I must say you got it very wrong and all mixed up... Its definitely not me... I'm not so sure if its stell also or not unless you have been in here much longer than April...</p>
              <p>Ok, so you know who I was referring too... I am no Gunners fan, so you can excuse me on this... Wilcott, Walcott... You got it I believed... So thats that...</p>

              <p>Not off the top of my head, nope. And whether footballers or not, without referring to any sort of national or official statistics, I can't give you the kind of figures you want. It's good you've taken my suggestion to name better examples after I mentioned your poorer examples earlier on. The examples you're mentioning now are the type I was talking about, Neville was a name suggested by me.</p>
              <p>I would hope majority of people in the world and not just Lampard are living their life like Lampard. But he's doing so does not compel me to condemn him or dislike him any more than the next footballer or person. You seem eager to condemn him though.</p>

              <p>I see that's what you mean by legally bound, although earlier on you mentioned it was to the kids and not to Elen Rives (I forgot her name actually). I believe the his name is one birth certificate of the kids, and though there's no contract or legal document as of yet, I believe if he were to refuse to pay or partake in expenses for raising the children, Elen could take him to court or something. It's not like he's financially unstable or anything so she would have a case should he refuse to contribute financially to the upbringing of the children. Bear in mind though that my knowledge of UK law would be extremely limited.</p>
              <p>The issue about whether Elen deserves to get half of his possessions is a whole new discussion in itself. Because it's a discussion that can apply to many other relationships or marraiges itself. I personally don't agree that every divorcee lady to be deserves to get alimony, but that really is a different issue altogether.</p>
              <p>Again like I said, it doesn't make me like or dislike Lampard as a footballer any more or less than the next player or person.</p>

              <p>Technically speaking, Ronaldo is better at his set-pieces: free kicks, corners, penalties. Not to mention his headers. Messi is more of a penetrative dribbler that prefers to cut in from the right &amp; a more accurate short-passer cum playmaker. Their styles are different even though both are wingers but at the moment, one can't deny that Ronaldo is the best for now. If Messi is the supposed heir of Maradona for Argentina now, then Ronaldo is the heir of Figo for Portugal, but a much much better Figo. That's what I feel...</p>
