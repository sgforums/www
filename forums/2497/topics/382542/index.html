              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Arsenal head to the Stadium of Light in fine fettle but face the first examination of their strength in depth as Robin van Persie misses a tough trip to Sunderland.</strong></p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger's stylish Gunners have made light of those who played down their title aspirations in the summer, as they sit pretty second in the table, five points from leaders Chelsea but with a game in hand.</p>
              <p>However, key to much of their success has been the fine form of striker Van Persie, whose goals and set-up play have been instrumental throughout the campaign.</p>
              <p>Which is why the sight of the technically talented striker lying prostrate with an ankle injury while on international duty last weekend will have alarmed Wenger and the club's supporters.</p>
              <p>A trip to Sunderland is far from an easy task these days as Steve Bruce has moulded a side now looking more than capable of competing with the division's top dogs.</p>
              <p>Having defeated Liverpool and drawn with Manchester United already this term, the Black Cats faithful will be quietly hoping for another upset at the weekend.</p>
              <h4>Sunderland news</h4>
              <p>Goalkeeper Marton Fulop is set to begin an extended run in the Sunderland side following injury to regular first choice Craig Gordon.</p>
              <p>The Scottish custodian will be out for three months after breaking his arm in the defeat by Tottenham a fortnight ago.</p>
              <p>Fraizer Campbell could start up front as Kenwyne Jones sits out the second match of a three-game ban while defender Michael Turner is also suspended.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Lorik Cana returns from a ban while John Mensah (calf) and Boudewijn Zenden (hip) are back in contention. Lee Cattermole (knee) is another long-term absentee.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Arsenal news</h5>
              <p>Van Persie is set for six weeks on the sidelines, which could open the door for Eduardo da Silva to stake his claim for a regular starting berth as he is likely to compete with Nicklas Bendtner to spearhead Arsenal's attack on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>The prognosis on the foot injury to England Under 21 defender Kieran Gibbs is, meanwhile, also now more positive.</p>
              <p>"Our medical staff called me saying he was in hospital in Lithuania with a suspected broken metatarsal. Later on it, was much better news," said Wenger.</p>
              <p>Gibbs had been pencilled in to replace Gael Clichy (back) on the left side of defence, but that role is now likely to be filled by veteran Mikael Silvestre.</p>
              <p>Wenger, though, has been boosted by the availability of midfielder Denilson, the young Brazilian having been out of action since mid-September with a back problem.</p>
              <p>Goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, Mexican striker Carlos Vela and defender Armand Traore have also all left a busy treatment room during the international break.</p>
              <p>However, England Under 21 midfielder Jack Wilshere (ankle) remains unavailable and Abou Diaby, who returned early from the France camp, is still troubled by a calf problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Possible starting XIs</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sunderland:</strong> Fulop, McCartney, da Silva, Mensah, Bardsley, Malbranque, Reid, Richardson, Cana, Bent, Campbell</p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Almunia, Sagna, Silvestre, Gallas, Vermaelen, Ramsey, Song, Fabregas, Arshavin, Eduardo, Bendtner</p>

              <h1>Sunderland 1-0 Arsenal: Black Cats halt Gunners' good form</h1>
              <h2>Stadium of Light scoreline stuns Arsenal's travelling support.</h2>
              </div>
              <div id="article_detail_block"></div>
              <div id="small_article_image_container"><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/54096_news.jpg" alt="EPL: Darren Bent, Sunderland - Chelsea (PA)"></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>A sole goal from Sunderland striker <strong>Darren Bent</strong> was enough to see off the Arsenal threat as the Black Cats inflicted a third away defeat on their visitors.Arsenal's
              ability to play an aesthetic brand of football was displayed from the
              off as, for the first time this season, midfield playmaker Cesc
              Fabregas, returning star Tomas Rosicky, and burgeoning France
              international Samir Nasri were all selected.</p>
              <p>Fabregas and
              Rosicky linked-up in the eighth minute to test Sunderland shot-stopper
              Marton Fulop.</p>
              <p>The resiliance at the back was again threatened five
              minutes later when Fabregas fired a 25-yard strike goal-ward, but Fulop
              watched as the ball fizzed over the framework.</p>
              <p>The Gunners
              maintained the pressure on Sunderland's goal throughout the first half,
              as Alex Song found Eduardo - filling in for creative Dutch forward
              Robin van Persie who sustained an ankle injury with the Netherlands -
              but the Brazil-born Croatia international's finish was lacking in terms
              of quality, and flew wide.Six minutes later, Eduardo played the
              part of provider, and fed blossoming midfielder Aaron Ramsey, so
              instrumental last weekend while on international duty with Wales, but
              the teenager failed to find the target.</p>
              <p>Sunderland began to test
              Arsenal following the half-time break, when they countered a Gunners
              attack, the rear-guard stifled a Samir Nasri strike, but Darren Bent
              and Andy Reid did not trouble Almunia's net on the hour mark.</p>
              <p>Their
              patience, however, was rewarded. Darren Bent's initial header caused
              confusion in the area in the 71st minute before the striker again
              capitalised and Sunderland took the lead.</p>
              <p>After this display
              Arsene Wenger must truly be hoping that Van Persie's horse placenta
              treatment proves miraculous and his top scorer returns ASAP.</p>
              <p>Steve
              Bruce, meanwhile, couldn't hide his delight after shaking the losing
              manager's hand at the final whistle.</p>

              <p>when in fine form, arsenal rocks.</p>
              <p>but i notice arsenal weakness is when their player come back from international.</p>
              <p>Why their player always injure when go international? Why when they come back, they can't play well? Wenger got to do something about it else there goes the title again. Chelsea and Manu both don't have this problem.</p>

              <p>when in fine form, arsenal rocks.</p>
              <p>but i notice arsenal weakness is when their player come back from international.</p>
              <p>Why their player always injure when go international? Why when they come back, they can't play well? Wenger got to do something about it else there goes the title again. Chelsea and Manu both don't have this problem.</p>
              <p>Arsenal can do it with more confident. common</p>

              <p>I was reading on Sun how wenger explains his playing/coaching, where it is a red/green light thingy.</p>
              <p>Every arsenal players when they got the ball needs to get many options, and similiarly, they need to run into spaces so as to create many options for their team mates.</p>
              <p>If they are already ingrained, day in/out, I don't think an international weekend will really disrupt their playing styles, or mentality.Perhaps it is the fatigue factor of travelling. U can see how they affected some players.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I may be wrong.</p>
