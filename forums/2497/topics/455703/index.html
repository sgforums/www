              <p><strong><span>Liverpool midfielder Charlie Adam has revealed that the club are targeting a top four finish next season in order to secure Champions League football.</span><br></strong></p>
              <p><span>The Reds have failed to qualify for Europe's premier competition in each of the last three seasons, but they will return to European action for the first time in over two years when they compete in next season's Europa League.</span></p>
              <p><span>And while Adam revealed to the<span style="font-style: italic;"> Daily Star</span> that the club will be taking the Europa League seriously, the aim of Champions League football remains.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Everyone wants to play in the Champions League. It’s the pinnacle,' he said.</span><span> <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'For us, we’re in the Europa League. We want to try and get into the group stages and try and win every game.</span></p>
              <p><span>'That’s the expectation of this club. It’s the expectation of the supporters and the players inside the dressing room.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool ended last season in eighth place in the Premier League - their lowest finish for 18 years.</span></p>
              <p><span>But Adam claims that the club 'didn't deserve' to finish eighth, and he expects improvements under new manager Brendan Rodgers.</span></p>
              <p><span>'They say the table doesn’t lie but we didn’t deserve to finish eighth. If we had had a bit of luck on our side we probably would have finished higher.</span></p>
              <p><span>'But it’s done and gone now. We move forward and hopefully we will finish better than we did last season.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I can’t believe the amount of times we drew at home. It was incredible but you have got to change your own luck.</span></p>
              <p><span>'If we work hard and do the right things next season we will be further up the table.</span></p>
              <p><span>'This is one of the best clubs in the world and the opportunity to play here is a dream for any player.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We have the right people on board and the right players. Hopefully we can keep progressing as a club. Bridging that gap doesn’t happen overnight.</span></p>
              <p><span>'But if you have the right balance, the right group of players and you work hard, you never know what can happen.'</span></p>

              <p>I can say liverpool will not qualify for CL for the next 3 seasons. after 3 seasons is up, if liverpool still does not play in the CL, I may extend it to another 5 more seasons.</p>
              <p>I suspect Rodgers will face Hodgson's fate, probably not replaced so soon in November, but in January.</p>

              <p>As i always think, any new manager should have 2 full seasons in charge beforesacking them, of course there is other desperate cases.</p>

              <p>hodgson choice of players didnt help, esp that danish midfielder poulsen and that leftback from charlton. its a results industry, no matter what happens. at that time liverpool were languishing near in relegation, the owner and board will need to take action to stop the rot.</p>
              <p>dun get me wrong, rodgers is young and up and coming, but I feel that this job is far too big for his shoes. its a results industry and if liverpool is languishing at mid table by December, you will feel for the job security of rodgers. dun rule out harry rednapp doing a mid season rescue.</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Steven Gerrard claims Liverpool will “definitely” make the top four under new boss Brendan Rodgers next season.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">The Reds skipper has seen enough after just two days on the pre-season trip to America to predict a bright future for the Anfield club with the Irishman in charge.</p>
              <p class="body ">It is a remarkable prediction given Liverpool’s desperate form last season which saw them finish 17th in the form table over the second half of the campaign.</p>
              <p class="body ">It is even more remarkable given that Gerrard is never anything but brutally honest about the club’s prospects.</p>
              <p class="body ">His optimism is based on what he has seen at close hand after joining Rodgers for the first time to get a crash course in the tactical revolution planned for Anfield.</p>
              <p class="body ">Gerrard arrived in Boston late on Monday night, too late to even be considered for the friendly game against <span style="color: #000000;">Roma on Wednesday, where Liverpool offered some encouraging signs in a 2-1 defeat.</span></p>
              <p class="body ">Yet the England captain already feels a different mood around the place and can sense a real enthusiasm for the new manager’s approach among battle-scarred troops wearied and bloodied by last season’s grim failures.</p>
              <p class="body ">“We’ll definitely see a much bolder and exciting Liverpool team,” he said after watching the Roma game. “Every time you speak to the manager you can’t help but be impressed by his vision. And his man-management is fantastic.</p>

              <p class="body ">Given the depths Liverpool sometimes plumbed during the second half of the league campaign, many fans would be hard pressed to share that optimism.</p>
              <p class="body ">Yet Gerrard has long been of the belief that there is a quality within the Liverpool squad, that needs to be encouraged in the right way to adopt a bolder, more ambitious tactical philosophy. And he believes Rodgers is just the man to do that.</p>
              <p class="body ">“Over the years, sometimes Liverpool have come up against a certain type of opposition and we have shown them too much respect,” he explained.</p>
              <p class="body ">“Maybe we have had to do that, because of the style we’ve been asked to play. There were times under previous managers when we did that, but I think this manager is the opposite, he wants us to play like a big team.</p>
              <p class="body ">“There is a lot of hard work and a lot of learning to be done sharpish if we want to implement that straight away.</p>
              <p class="body ">“We’ll definitely see a much bolder Liverpool team, but with a quick transition into organisation when we lose the ball.”</p>
              <p class="body ">It says much for Rodgers that he has already been able to win over such battle-hardened veterans as Jamie Carragher and Daniel Agger, who have spoken out in impressed support of their new boss.</p>

              <p>players make team. just look at hodgson's buy and now rodgers buy, I dun think he can survive next year. If liverpool is hovering at relegation, you think the owner wont sack him and replace him with harry rednapp? results is everything these days. I am being realistic.</p>
              <p>liverpool is going backwards, not forwards. their best players have left them(Torres and Alonso and Abelour) and gerrard is getting injury prone and older and suarez, for all his trickery and skill, is not a goalscorer that can score 20 goals a season striker not yet at EPL, not sure if he did at Ajax before.</p>
