              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Big money move: Phil Jones departs following his medical with Manchester United</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Sir Alex Ferguson will complete a dramatic transfer double over Liverpool in the next 48 hours by signing England winger Ashley Young from Aston Villa in a £15million deal.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Manchester United manager took time out from his holiday in the south of France to ambush old rival Kenny Dalglish by paying £16.5m to snatch Blackburn’s teenage defender Phil Jones from Liverpool’s grasp. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>And, as revealed in <em>Sportsmail</em> last month, Ferguson is convinced he will win the race for Anfield target Young as well. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The 25-year-old’s agent, Eric Walters, was understood to have been at United’s  training ground at Carrington yesterday to finalise the deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Young is said to want the move to Old Trafford tied up before his wedding this weekend.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>His arrival will complete a remarkable coup for Ferguson following the capture of Jones on Wednesday. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool thought they were first in line for the highly rated 19-year-old after agreeing to sign his England Under 21 team-mate Jordan Henderson from Sunderland in a deal worth £20m.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Both players were given permission to miss England’s flight to Denmark ahead of the European Under 21 Championship. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But, while Henderson travelled to Merseyside for his medical, Jones and his representatives met United to complete a five-year deal worth £40,000 a week.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ferguson acted on his long-standing interest in Jones when it looked like the player was bound for Anfield, the manager interrupting his summer holiday to sanction the deal. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He told Jones he sees him as the long-term replacement for Rio Ferdinand and also talked to his parents. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Dalglish and Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger are both believed to have spoken to the teenager after agreeing to meet the £16m release clause in his contract. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Gunners will now turn their attention to landing Bolton’s Gary Cahill or Blackburn’s Chris Samba having missed out on Jones. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/06/08/article-0-0BC554A400000578-939_634x350.jpg" alt="Hot property: Jones had his pick of Premier League clubs" width="634" height="350"> </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Hot property: Jones had his pick of Premier League clubs</em></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Blackburn also made a huge effort to keep Jones, offering to beat United’s terms by making him the highest-paid player at Ewood Park on £50,000 a week, while Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp confirmed he made a late bid. </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘We were in for him along with about five other top clubs,’ said Redknapp. ‘I think everybody was in for the boy. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘Obviously he had a choice and he’s made up his mind that Manchester United was the move for him. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘I think he’s got the potential to go on one day to be an England centre half and maybe even a captain of England. I think he’s that good so Alex has pulled off a real coup.’</span></p>
              <p class="imagecaption" style="margin: auto 0in;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>United striker Wayne Rooney was first to indicate that a deal had been done when he wrote on Twitter: ‘Phil Jones is a good young English player. One of the toughest defenders I played against last season. Can play midfield too.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ferguson will take his summer spending to almost £50m when he completes the signing of Spanish goalkeeper David De Gea from Atletico Madrid. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Although 20-year-old De Gea insisted yesterday he will make an announcement on his future after the European Under 21 Championship, a £17m deal is already in place as United look to replace Edwin van der Sar, who retired at the end of the season.</span> </p>

              <p>Phil Jones is being bought for the future not the present... Of course he will play some games this season but he isn't being seen as the main signing so to speak... Established players like Young, a necessary one in goal, and a play maker to replace Scholes are the main objectives. Jones will probably be a sub more often than not if Fletcher isn't fit... In defence, well if Rio is injured again, there's still a toss up between Evans, Smalling and himself... And Smalling has proven to be an able stand in so far...</p>
              <p>On the price, it's not totally unthinkable... Blackburn may have second thoughts after seeing so many clubs willing to meet his $16m fee... There is always this problem where they may think... Hang on here, maybe we could get more for this kid with so many big clubs interested. Liverpool, Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea...</p>

              <p>"His mental strength and the abilities to cope with the pressure of the Premier League at such a young age stood out.</p>
              <p>"He wasn't fazed and that is important going into the biggest league in the world at such a young age.</p>
              <p>"He made his debut against Chelsea and was man of the match.</p>
              <p>"His mental strength was always going to be good enough and that is one of the biggest factors if you are going to be a top, top player."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Manchester United’s multi-million pound signing of teenage defender Phil Jones from Blackburn Rovers lies in tatters.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Blackburn’s Indian owners have reacted furiously to what they perceive as United’s attempt to railroad them into selling the 19-year-old and have told United: ‘We will not be bullied’. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And in a stunning 11th-hour development on Saturday, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mail on Sunday</span> can reveal that Liverpool have told Blackburn they will pay £22million for Jones, a move that will ruin Sir Alex Ferguson’s holiday mood as he takes a break in the south of France. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Arsenal have also belatedly submitted a bid that tops United’s £16.5m offer, and with Chelsea showing serious interest in the player, too, an auction appears to be unfolding. It will come as a bitter blow to Ferguson if he misses out on Jones, and it will sting all the harder if the player ends up at United’s fierce rivals at Anfield. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rovers’ owners have been angered by United’s attitude and at a meeting on Saturday in Pune, India, which was attended by manager Steve Kean — straight off a plane to Mumbai — they resolved to prevent the deal going through.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">United have offered to make Jones the highest-paid teenager in the history of English football with a startling £80,000-a-week contract, but Blackburn are even prepared to top that. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Rovers chairwoman Anuradha Desai made it clear to Kean and fellow executives, who made up a ‘war council’ in India, that they must try to persuade the defender to stay. The prospect of being a future club captain is also being dangled before Jones.</span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Money is said to be ‘not an issue’ for Desai’s family, who are billionaires through their Venky’s poultry conglomerate.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">They want to keep their best players, especially homegrown talents such as Jones.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But if they fail to persuade him, they will do all they can to elicit the best price from one of Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, United or Tottenham, telling Jones: ‘If you go, you go where we get the best money.’ </span></p>
              <p> <span style="font-size: x-small;">A source close to Rovers said. ‘United can’t do what they want in this case. Jones is a Blackburn player and while there is a clause that could mean he leaves, it’s far from the straightforward issue everyone assumes it to be.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Jones signed a United shirt for fans while training with England’s Under-21s in Denmark on Friday and, along with his representatives and United, had thought the transfer was a formality. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The player wants to join United but it is not known whether he has even been informed yet that Liverpool have made a bigger offer. </span></p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>A major headache for United is in the interpretation of the release clause in Jones’s contract. They triggered it with their £16.5m offer and were allowed to talk to the player as a result. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But Rovers have taken legal advice and insist the clause does not force them to sell to the first club to meet the figure. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The biggest loser in all this could be England Under- 21 boss Stuart Pearce.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He would not name his team on Saturday night for the opening game against Spain as the possibility of the transfer deal distracting the versatile defender grew.</span></p>

              <p>Well, if you still insist he isn't a natural left-sided player then it's your choice lah, I can respect that.</p>
              <p>But I maintain my opinion having seen him played countless times for Villa in that position as well as in attack and excel in it for club and country to a point where he has made a name for himself to warrant suggestions that he would be Giggs replacement in the near future... As i have said, I belief he would be the best United can have in that position to whatever they currently have...</p>
              <p>Look, there are some wingers who can play on both wings, Young is just one of them... But of these, there is always a side that they seem to perform better on... Like Nani can play on both sides either but it's the right that he excel in... Or Villa's very own Steward Downing who was a regular left-winger for Middlesbrough all along but is moved to the right wing at Villa. Perhaps we should ask why so? </p>
              <p>Does he perform better on the right-wing or has Young outshine him on the left? Whichever we think is the reason, it points to the same outcome...</p>
              <p>Just like Ronaldo and Messi seems to does better on the right wing than on the left... And Robben and Giggs seems to do better on the other side...</p>
              <p>Anyway, would you dare suggest he won't take up the left wing position in the United team or in which ever team should he join them? I like to know...</p>

              <p>A bit off topic to Tennis.....like Rafael Nadal is naturally right handed but is now more comfortable playing as a left hander (to boost his backhand). :D :D</p>
              <p>Like Glenn Johnson is a natural right footer but has been played by KK on the left a few times last season and he may be ended up on the left for the rest of his career, if he excel there (which was not bad last season on the left).</p>

              <p>Young crosses more with his right than his left...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I feel he is not as impactful as the 07/08 or 08/09 seasons... and recently, with the arrival of Downing, it seems like both of them always switches flanks during the games by MON.</p>
              <p>Then when Houllier came, he played behind the main striker (Heskey?) instead.</p>

              <p>I think Ashely Young arrival will just be to have enough wingers to cover or rotate.</p>
              <p>Young plays on the left with his natural right foot and likes to cut into the box so that the position allows him to take a shot (like how Robben likes to do it on the other side as well as messi). He is not that kind of crosser like Valencia in my book and to compare him to robben and messi is still quite some way behind them.</p>
