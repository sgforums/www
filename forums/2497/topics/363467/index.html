              <p><strong>Former Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari has been appointed as the new coach of FC Bunyodkor, according to the Uzbek club.</strong></p>
              <p>Bunyodkor may be in a relative football backwater but they boast
              both ambition and extensive funds and currently employ World Cup winner
              Rivaldo as their star player.</p>
              <p>The club also count Zico amongst their former managers and now another Brazilian, Scolari, has joined the club.</p>
              <p>‘Big Phil’ parted company with Chelsea at the start of February
              following some unconvincing form and has made an unexpected return to
              the game.</p>
              <p>Any public declaration from Bunyodkor is bound to be viewed with
              suspicion after they incorrectly claimed they had signed Samuel Eto’o
              last season, but Scolari has signed an 18-month deal, according to
              their official website.</p>
              <p>“Uzbek football now creates its own success story, especially
              Bunyodkor with its remarkable dynamism and prospects for the past four
              years,” said Scolari.</p>
              <p>“I know that I am in the right place at the right time and in the right team.”</p>

              <p>Yeah I agree with you... chelsea for him was a wrong move. A move tat is so wrong.</p>
              <p>Look at portugal now, that team is shit. If scolari stayed with them, they would have simply entered the world cup finals by not and not stuggling to win games under the former man utd no. 2.</p>
              <p>Anyway, what kind of team is this Ubez team, <strong>FC Bunyodkor?? Hahahaha..</strong></p>

              I think the pay-off he got from Chelsea is enough to last him for the rest of his life already... This guy is in relax mode lah... Joining a rubbish team in a rubbish league... Can relax more what... somemore got money to take...
              
              To think he downgrade himself so much from a Chelsea manager just a few months ago only... Even Grant was offered the Czech Republic job in April and he turn it down... This Scolari, rubbish also pick-up... lol

              Well... as Rafa would say it... Its a fact... no need to be in love... lol 
              
              The Czech Republic did offered him the job... Anything wrong to say it since they are both recent Chelsea managers? 
              
              One had a decent offer but turn it down, the other, anything comes along also take... You really don't like anyone who highlight Grant's achievements ah... lol... hard lucky...
