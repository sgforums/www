              <p>Now AVB can put his leg up for a job well done.</p>
              <p>Think he is on $6m a year and maybe a 3 to 4 years contract so... Most probably he will be waiting for his compensation package coming his way... He couldn't have dream of making this kind of money at Porto even in ten years, now he is getting all for just 9 months of work.</p>
              <p>Well Done Andre, you can retire liao... Almost $15m to $20m for less than a year work...</p>

              <p>sure he is paid lots of money, but I think he rather carry on the job.</p>
              <p>roman thought that he is a younger version of mourinho after his treble with Porto last season or at the very least, be as successful as mourinho, but he was wrong. when Mourinho managed chelsea in 2004, lampard, drogba, terry etc, were in the prime. now they are in their twilight years, as were cole, bosingwa, essien etc. chelsea are a team in transition. roman should have sticked with ancelotti on hindsight.</p>

              <p>Now, he is chasing Pep to become the next chelsea manager.</p>
              <p>AVB is still in demand for other football league so he have no worries.</p>

              <p>He takes his compensation and put his leg up till Jun who don't want?</p>
              <p>The pressure at Chelsea was too much and the problems he faced everyday with Lampard, Terry, Cole made his life a living hell in London.</p>
              <p>Now he got no more pressure, the press won't be hounding him anymore, he can go back to his country, buy a villa and relax and wait for the next job offer to come in.</p>
              <p>Why not? lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Chelsea's part, I can understand why Roman did it also. With AVB in charge, they were never going to make the CL place. With him gone, maybe they still stand a better chance as the players will now regroup and try to catch up.</p>
              <p>You must really hand it to Roman for trying... Had Pool owners did the same in Dec, Pool will stand a very good chance of getting 4th i feel. Oh well...</p>

              <p>Blues have appointed Di Matteo until the end of the season.</p>
              <p>But the move will do little to improve morale.</p>
              <p>A source said: "The players could not stand AVB because of his arrogance. But, if anything, they like Roberto even less.</p>
              <p>"He's just too cock-sure. They might unite behind him to start with but after a couple of bad results it will be just as bad, if not worse.</p>
              <p>"It's a shambles from top to bottom. They just don't have a coach.</p>
              <p>"There's no one to take control of training, no one for the players to look to."</p>
              <p>Chelsea fans still like Di Matteo from his playing days, which were cut short by injury.</p>
              <p>But after early success at MK Dons and winning promotion with West Brom, he was sacked by Baggies in 2011 after winning just 10 of 30 Prem games.</p>
              <p>He was still out of work last summer when Villas-Boas drafted him in as his assistant.</p>
