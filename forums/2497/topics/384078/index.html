              <p>Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani has been fit for over a month, claims his father.<br><br>The
              former Roma player arrived on Merseyside in a blockbuster move after
              the two clubs agreed on a fee believed to be in the region of £17
              million.<br><br>The 25-year-old spent months on the sidelines following
              an injury that required surgery, and has been used sparingly since
              making his debut in a League Cup tie at Arsenal in October.<br><br>However,
              the player's father - who is a Giallorossi medic - is dumbfounded as to
              why Rafael Benitez has been so reluctant to field his son in the
              Premier League.<br><br>"Alberto's available to play and has been for more than a month," he told <em>The Guardian</em>.<br><br>"He feels good and the injury has cleared up, and now the only way he can get truly fit is to play more and more minutes.<br><br>"He
              is desperate to get his career in England up and running. He has been
              very frustrated, first at being injured, then at not being chosen to
              play for so long. Obviously he's not happy at waiting for such a long
              time to get involved with the team.<br><br>"I don't know the reasons why Benítez has chosen not to play him since he came back for injury. <br><br>"That
              is an issue for Alberto. He must convince the coach that he has to
              play. I don't know of any special motivation for Benítez in not playing
              him."<br><br>The Liverpool manager has so far maintained that he has no
              intention of shoving the silky passer into an intense situation, as he
              wishes to ease him back to full fitness.<br><br>And despite being
              unhappy with his son's situation, Aquilani Snr concedes that the Roma
              youth product has settled down very well in England.<br><br>"He is really happy in Liverpool, he has settled in really well," he said.<br><br>"He's
              getting to grips with the language, which was a problem at first, and
              he is always surrounded by friends, family and his fiance. <br><br>"He
              likes the city a lot, the culture, the football and the atmosphere at
              the stadiums. He has been really impressed by the bond the crowd have
              with the players."</p>
