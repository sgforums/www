            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Roberto Carlos has revealed that his move to FenerbahÃ§e has given him a new lease of life and he is confident of playing on for another four seasons.</strong><br><br><img src="http://goal.com/images/20506_news.jpg"><br><br>The Brazilian full-back opted to join the Turkish giants after leaving Real Madrid at the end of the season and is delighted with his choice.<br><br>One major factor in the decision was FenerbahÃ§e's desire to make him a key member of their team and he cannot wait to start playing.<br><br>"They made me feel really wanted again and I am happy again," Carlos explained.<br><br>"Normally at 34 people are finishing their careers, but I feel like I am starting mine again.<br><br>"I saw a difficult future for myself in playing, but they have opened the door and showed me the light.<br><br>"Like with Inter and Madrid they have offered me a year and my idea is to make that into four years. Until my fitness lasts.<br><br>"All my dreams came true with Real Madrid. Now I want to enjoy myself and to make history with FenerbahÃ§e and try to help them win the Turkish league and cup.<br><br>"I feel good and my family likes it here and if they are happy then that gives me strength."<br><br>Carlos was stunned by the reception that he received as the FernebahÃ§e supporters turned out in their thousands to give him a warm welcome to the club.<br><br>"It was crazy, really incredible. Since I announced that I was signing for FenerbahÃ§e everything has gone very well," he continued.<br><br>"I signed my contract in front of a packed stadium, as everyone came to see me.<br><br>"They deserve to see the best of Roberto Carlos and I am going to use all my experience to help the team and I hope that we can go a long way in the Champions League too.<br><br>"We know that it is not like Spain, Italy or England, but Turkish football is growing.<br><br>"I have joined a rich club with a great coach in Zico, who I know well, and he has promised that he is going to build a strong squad here."</div>
