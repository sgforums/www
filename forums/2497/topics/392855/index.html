              <h3>FERNANDO Torres will be offered the chance to become 'the face of Liverpool' 
                                  to fend off mega bids from Manchester City and Barcelona.<span style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;"> </span></h3>
              <p>The Merseysiders are in talks with the striker's advisors to massively 
                                  enhance Torres' commercial earnings as they try to kill off speculation about 
                                  his future. </p>
              <p>Torres signed a £100k a week four year deal last summer, but the terms will 
                                  be made much more lucrative following this summer's World Cup. </p>
              <p>Liverpool want to provide substantially greater rewards on Torres' image 
                                  rights as he's marketed as a Kop icon around the world. </p>
              <p>It would be the most profitable player specific commercial deal in Anfield 
                                  history, recognising Torres' hero status as critical to Liverpool's enduring 
                                  global popularity. </p>
              <p>Liverpool know they can't compete with the kind of wages City are prepared to 
                                  offer the 25-year-old, which is why they've devised a similar strategy to that 
                                  Manchester United are adopting to retain Wayne Rooney. </p>
              <p>The Kop's commercial profits have been on the rise in recent seasons, and 
                                  it's the fame and pulling power of Anfield which will allow the club to maximise 
                                  Torres' financial rewards. </p>
              <p>Although the club is confident Torres won't quit Liverpool as early as this 
                                  summer, they're braced for massive bids, especially if they fail to qualify for 
                                  the Champions League. </p>
              <p>Manchester City's hopes of luring the striker have always looked slim 
                                  regardless of their wealth, but Barcelona have also recently registered an 
                                  interest. </p>
              <p>Chelsea also tried to sign Torres last summer and Liverpool know they face a 
                                  serious battle to keep the player if they don't get their act together on and 
                                  off the pitch. </p>
              <p>Torres is known to have been anxious for reassurances about the direction of 
                                  the club following a disappointing season, but Liverpool hope their proposals 
                                  prove that any suggestion they'd cash in on the player are ill-founded. </p>
              <p>There have been fears the cash problems of co-owners Tom Hicks and George 
                                  Gillett Jr would make them vulnerable to £80m offers, but their joint reign is 
                                  entering its final months. </p>
              <p>They know it's in the club's interest to keep their most prized asset on 
                                  Merseyside as it makes Liverpool more attractive to investors. </p>
              <p>The talks with Torres' advisors underline the determination to not only 
                                  resist all bids, but to ensure that financially he'll be rewarded as handsomely 
                                  at Anfield as anywhere else. </p>
