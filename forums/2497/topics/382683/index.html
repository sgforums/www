              <h2>FLETCHER IS ON FIRE - CARRICK</h2>
              <div><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/11/240/Darren-Fletcher-Manchester-United-Everton-Pre_2387617.jpg" border="0" alt="Darren Fletcher celebrates his goal against Everton."></div>
              <div>.</div>
              <div>.</div>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Michael Carrick has hailed Manchester United team-mate Darren Fletcher as one of the best midfielders in the Barclays Premier League. It does not seem that long ago that Fletcher was being vilified by his own supporters, who were demanding his Old Trafford departure.</strong></p>
              <p>Yet over the past 12 months, the Scotland skipper's star has risen rapidly. His absence from the Champions League final in Rome was cited as one of the major reasons why Sir Alex Ferguson's side were so badly overpowered by Barcelona and it is no real surprise to learn Fletcher has missed seven of United's last nine defeats in all competitions.</p>
              <p>Now it seems the 26-year-old has also added goalscoring to his repertoire. Although still not prolific by any means, Fletcher scored twice in the thrilling win over Manchester City in September and put United on the road to a comfortable 3-0 win over Everton on Saturday with a stunning volley which curled past Tim Howard from 20 yards.</p>
              <p>"Darren is one of the best midfielders around at the moment," said Carrick. "His performances are at the highest level and it is great to play alongside him. He really is on top of his game."</p>
              <p>Fletcher is not the type to seek attention and his reaction to another eye-catching contribution was typically matter of fact. "The main thing with a strike like that is to get your foot over the ball and fortunately it went in the back of the net," he said.</p>
              <p>"It was one of my best strikes." Fletcher is going to be a pivotal figure over the next few months as United try to hunt down Chelsea, who are five points clear at the top of the table.</p>
              <p>As United's next truly arduous fixture is at Arsenal on January 31, they do at least have the opportunity to go on one of the lengthy unbeaten runs which have been the hallmark of so many title successes down the years.</p>
              <p>However, they will need goals from every department as the loss of Cristiano Ronaldo has turned up the heat on everyone. "The goals Ronaldo scored were extraordinary for a wide man," Carrick added. "It's obvious that we cannot rely on the strikers every week.</p>
              <p>"We have all chipped in and we need to do it more often. As long as someone is scoring it is not an issue. It is winning games that matter."</p>
              <p>Carrick counts himself among that number, so he was particularly pleased with the neat side-footed effort which effectively sealed victory before Antonio Valencia grabbed a late third.</p>
              <p>As the direct replacement for Ronaldo, Valencia has been cajoled into increasing what was a minimal goals output at Wigan. He only scored seven for the Latics last season and, including the deflected effort against CSKA Moscow, the Ecuador international now has four for United.</p>
              <p>He is also starting to impose himself on games, with his forceful running unhinging a disappointing Everton outfit who seemed intent on containment.</p>

              <p class="small bold">ROAR POWER ... Darren Fletcher</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DARREN FLETCHER has revealed he loves nothing better than getting his teeth into the likes of Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Cesc Fabregas.</h2>
              <p class="article">Manchester United midfield ace Fletcher gets a buzz out of challenging himself against the best players in the Premier League. The Scotland international said: "I don't want to sound big-headed but I've never come up against anyone who has torn me to shreds. "The only time that's happened has been in training against Roy Keane and Paul Scholes.</p>
              <p class="article">"I watch how good Lampard, Fabregas and Gerrard are but when we play them I think 'Right, I'm going to see how good you really are!' "I'm going to get against you and see how you like it. And when you've not got the ball I'm still going to get about you and see how you like it. "I'm going to ask you 'Do you fancy it? Do you like getting kicked? Do you like the fact I am going to be at you for the whole 90 minutes?</p>
              <p class="article">" 'As soon as you get the ball I am going to be in your face. You are not going to like it one bit. Are you ready for that because that's what's going to happen'." Reigning Premier League champions United do not face another member of the Big Four until January 31 when they travel to arch rivals Arsenal. And you can bet 25-year-old Fletcher is counting down the days to that trip to the Emirates.</p>
              <p class="article">He told fanzine United We Stand: "I love the big games. I get excited before them and not a bit nervous. I'm determined to make the most of them and test myself to my full ability.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">"In my younger days, I would perhaps sit back in the so-called lesser games. I'd let the lads go and play while covering for them. "But in the big games I'd come out wanting the ball all the time. I've had to learn to do that in every game, week in, week out.</p>
              <p class="article">"I've made a conscious effort in the last couple of years to play every game as if it's my last. If I'm going to stay in the team, I believe I have to play like that."</p>
              <p class="article">Fletcher is one of the United players who has stepped up to the plate following Cristiano Ronaldo's departure to Real Madrid. Life without the £80million World Footballer of the Year took some getting used to but there were signs in the 3-0 win against Everton on Saturday that United are finally starting to cope.</p>
              <p class="article">Their goals all came from midfield from Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Antonio Valencia - with Fletch's the pick of the bunch. He said: "Hopefully, we can become a more rounded team and other players will raise their game to cover the gap left by Cristiano.</p>
              <p class="article">"We're starting to see that, with Wayne Rooney banging the goals in. We need more goals from midfield and more goals from all the players. That will make us a stronger team because we won't be as reliant on one player."</p>
              <p class="article">And Fletcher feels he has been let off the leash following Ronaldo's summer exit for Madrid. He added: "Teams adapt when players leave. Much as Cristiano was brilliant for us, the team sacrificed a lot for him, too.</p>
              <p class="article">"As a midfielder, I knew I couldn't bomb forward because Cristiano had gone forward. "I knew I had to cover on the right so the left-back and left midfielder couldn't double up on our full-back.</p>
              <p class="article">"Maybe now we're a lot more rigid 4-4-2, with everyone knowing their role. There are more opportunities for midfielders to get in the box and get goals."</p>
