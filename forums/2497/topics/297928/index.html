The Blackburn boss insists a number of dirty challenges went unpunished in the GunnersÂ’ 1-0 win over Chelsea on Sunday, claiming officials are too scared to send off Arsene WengerÂ’s players. </strong><br><br>Emmanuel EboueÂ’s late tackle on John Terry left the Blues skipper out for six weeks yet the Ivory Coast star landed just a yellow card. Fellow midfielder Cesc Fabregas was also involved in a nasty clash with Ashley Cole that could have earned him more than a caution.<br><br>Now, ahead of tonightÂ’s Carling Cup quarter-final at Ewood, Hughes says it is time the officials started taking action on ArsenalÂ’s bad-boy tactics.<br><br><strong>Straight reds </strong><br><br>He said: Â“I looked at the game on Sunday and some of the challenges could have been straight reds. Â“The referees were asking the players to come over and have a chat to calm it down. "They tend to give them the benefit of the doubt but I donÂ’t see that where Blackburn are concerned. I just see yellow cards coming out too readily and, as a consequence, weÂ’re always on a tightrope for sendings-off. We have had four in our last seven games now.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s too hard to take and we do feel that there is a perception from referees that they have to referee us in a certain way Â— and it's wrong. Â“In the high-profile games, because of the reaction that would be prompted if a high-profile player was sent off, referees tend to err away from making those decisions. Â“They are more inclined to make the decisions to book players in our games, though. Arsenal donÂ’t pick up yellows and reds for the challenges that we get penalised for.<br><br>Â“Referees will say, by the letter of the law, incidents are either red or yellow cards. We donÂ’t complain about that but we just want to see the games refereed in a fair way.Â”<br><br></div>

The Chelsea manager has consistently claimed that his club are being victimised by referees and he told Soho Square chiefs to clamp down on opposition players.</strong><br><br>John Obi Mikel, Didier Drogba and Michael Essien have all been sent off during Grant's 19-game spell in charge of the club and he claims Chelsea are being singled out for special treatment.<br><br>Avram said: "If you look at Arsenal's players on Sunday, who ran up to the referee to complain more Â— ours or theirs? It's part of the game. "If players do that it is not important. The right message would be how we can protect players better. There were bad fouls on Sunday, including the one on John Terry. "They need to prioritise. I have a feeling that it's easy to punish Chelsea, but there are bad challenges against us that are not punished. "At the moment, I believe there are too many incidents, but I cannot tell you why. I just don't know."<br><br>Terry fears he will be out for three months after breaking three bones in his foot, but Grant is planning to bring in reinforcements in January. Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen has held preliminary discussions with Chilean side Audax Italiano over the possible Â£3.4million transfer of 18-yearold Argentine striker Franco Matias Di Santo.<br><br>The 6ft 4ins Di Santo, who holds an Italian passport, has told his club he wants to leave during the transfer window, but Chelsea have yet to decide whether to follow up their interest. Audax president Valentin Cantergiani seemed confident they would. He said: "Everything is nearly agreed, there are only a few details to be resolved but there will not be any problems."<br><br>Full back Ashley Cole is likely to find out today if he faces an FA charge over allegations he made a gesture towards Arsenal fans at the weekend.<br><br></div>

Â“Tackles have to be made in this game and I had to make the tackle on Eboue. Â“I felt he left his studs in there and it should have been a sending-off. Â“I thought straight away I had broken something. ThatÂ’s how it felt. Â“Even when the X-ray didnÂ’t show up anything on the day, I was convinced there was a break.

Terry was angered by Emmanuel Eboue's first-half challenge that forced him off with a broken metatarsal in Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at the Emirates Stadium last Sunday. </strong><br><br>The England skipper believes Eboue should have been shown a red card for the offence. But Wenger insists Terry himself was lucky to still be on the pitch following a cruder lunge on a prone Cesc Fabregas earlier in the match. "I watched Eboue's tackle again and I don't think he wanted to 'do' John Terry," he said. "He touched him and I'm really sorry that John was injured. Ideally, Eboue shouldn't have put his foot in there. We do not encourage our players to do that.<br><br>"But John Terry should not have been on the pitch at that time because his tackle on Fabregas was the worst of the match. "I don't think he would have been sent off had he not been England captain. If you start to think like that you become mad.<br><br>"But the referee did not see exactly the violence of the tackle. Terry got away with it and good luck to him. "But that didn't mean we wanted to injure him. I want my players to behave well and we do not want to injure people."<br><br></div>
