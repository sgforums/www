              <p><strong>Petr Cech is out of Chelsea's Champions League return against Fenerbahce tomorrow night after an accident in training left him needing surgery on his face. The freak injury occurred yesterday when an unnamed team-mate struck the Czech international in the face with his studs.</strong></p>
              <p>Cech suffered lacerations to his lip and chin and was taken to hospital for an operation, but it means he will definitely be missing at Stamford Bridge. It comes as a huge blow to the keeper, who fractured his skull last season and wears a rugby scrum cap when he plays, as he was set to return after being out for a month with an ankle injury.</p>
              <p>The No1 resumed full training only last Friday and was on course to replace Carlo Cudicini in goal against the Turkish champions, who lead 2-1 from the first leg.</p>
              <p>It is not yet known whether the damage caused to his face will also rule him out of the club's next Premier League game at home to Wigan a week today. The Blues kept their title hopes alive with a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday but captain John Terry revealed they needed a halftime rant from Avram Grant to inspire them.</p>
              <p>Terry said: "In the first half we should have finished the game off and we came in at half-time and got an absolute b********g by the manager, Steve Clarke and Henk Ten Cate. They all said their piece and rightly so.</p>
              <p>"The tempo was too slow and lackadaisical and we should have had the game won before we did in the end.</p>
              <p>"The manager was worried that we had taken early leads against Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Fenerbahce and didn't build on it.</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #0000ff;">Season is over for Cech after horrific facial injury</span></h1>
              <p><strong>Petr Cech has been ruled out for the rest of the season after a horrific training-ground injury left him needing 50 stitches in a facial wound. Sportsmail can reveal that the Chelsea goalkeeper, who would have returned to the team for this evening's Champions League quarter-final tie against Fenerbahce, suffered the injury in a collision with Tal Ben Haim during training on Sunday.</strong></p>
              <p>Cech was wearing his skull cap at the time the incident happened but it offered no protection as the wound was on the part of his face which is not covered. His stunned team-mates, who feared a repeat of the horrific head injury he suffered during a clash with Reading midfielder Stephen Hunt last season, immediately called for Chelsea doctor Bryan English.</p>
              <p>Cech was taken to the Saint John-Saint Elizabeth Hospital in London for surgery on a laceration that a Chelsea source disclosed yesterday 'went right to the jaw bone'. The Chelsea keeper had 30 stitches sewn in the deepest area of the wound that stretches from his bottom lip to his chin, a further 20 on the outside of his face and also required plastic surgery 'for aesthetic reasons'.</p>
              <p>Although Chelsea coach Avram Grant claimed that he expected Cech to return to first-team action within two weeks, it is feared that he may even miss Euro 2008 with the Czech Republic. Sportsmail understands that English is taking advice from boxing experts on the recovery time and the worst-case scenario for an injury this serious is six months on the treatment table.</p>
              <p>Grant said: 'I don't feel good about it. 'He was great in training on Sunday, but it was a tackle between two players. He was very unlucky to get the injury and we think he will be out for another two weeks.' He missed five games in November and December with a hip complaint, four in December and January with a side strain and has been ruled out of the last six with an ankle problem.</p>
              <p>Although he is currently at home recovering, he has been told not to rush back into action and is highly unlikely to play again this season.</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Chelsea keeper had 50 stitches put in his lip and chin after a training-ground accident with Tal Ben-Haim on Monday. But, with deputy Carlo Cudicini sidelined with a hamstring injury, Blues boss Avram Grant wants to rush back Cech for the Champions League semi-final, first-leg against Liverpool in two weeks.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Work has already begun on constructing a mask to allow the Czech international to come back early. Cech, 25, needs to wear headgear as it is after fracturing his skull at Reading in October 2006.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Cudicini’s knock in the Fenerbahce tie on Tuesday, which could put him out for three weeks, leaves Hilario as the only fit senior stopper. And Chelsea chiefs are considering asking the Premier League if they can make an emergency loan signing.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Aston Villa’s Thomas Sorensen and Manchester City goalie Andreas Isaksson are possible targets. It remains likely manager Grant will have to put Welsh keeper Rhys Taylor, who turned 18 on Monday, on the subs’ bench.</p>
