I think so. At the moment only Manchester City are buying players,” Mancini told <em>The Sun</em>.<br><br>"But that is normal because Manchester City want to improve and the other teams are just big teams who would like a lot of people. <br><br>"All the other teams are trying to put pressure on us because for 10 years there were only four teams challenging for the title. <br><br>"This year, there are five. I think all these teams over the years have spent a lot of money. <br><br>"Manchester United, Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool but now City do. There isn't a difference." <br><br>Mancini hopes that City’s ambitious approach will help the club achieve their main goal of winning the Premier League this season.<br><br>"We have a big opportunity to win the league if we believe in ourselves and do our jobs. We have improved as a team. <br><br>"It depends if we can put together a team in the short time available. In my experience, I know after the World Cup in every country there can be a different situation in the league. <br><br>"If you remember a few years ago Manchester City were in the Championship, then it is clear every year we must improve. <br><br>"Last year, we fought for fourth place until the penultimate game against Tottenham - the aim this year is to try to win the Premier League. That must be our target.” <br></span></div>

              <p>As Real Madrid has shown, buying a dream team and making it work effectively are two mutually-exclusive concepts.</p>
              <p>Simply put, Man City has too many stars fighting for limited places. Certainly there will be discontent when some of these stars can't even make it to the substitutes' bench.</p>
              <p>And for all of their glitz, their backline is still weak as hell. They're so busy overcrowding the midfield and attack with overpriced players when a few solid defenders is what they really need.</p>

              <p>I don't think their backline will be weak anymore... Jerome Boateng is actually very good and he can play anywhere at the back 4 positions... Left, Right and Centre.

              <p>Yaya Toure is another one if needed can slot in to the centre-back position without any problems...

And also the likes of Lescott, Richards, <span style="color: #000000;">Kolo Toure might improve during this times as well in order to get into the first team...

              <p>Then it's really a question of how well they can settle in and work together, then.</p>
              <p>If the individual players are reasonably good, then they have to learn to play reasonably well together. Defence was the weakest part of Man City in the past two seasons. Only time will tell whether this new defensive lineup can pull itself together.</p>
