              <p><span><strong>Tottenham have finally agreed a deal with Manchester City over the permanent transfer of Emmanuel Adebayor.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Striker Adebayor, who spent last season on loan at White Hart Lane, returns to London in a £6million move.</span></p>
              <p><span>The former Arsenal man is set to become Spurs' highest-paid player, although he will be taking a cut on the £160,000 a week he was on at City.</span> </p>
              <p><span>Adebayor had three and a half years with the Gunners before joining City for £25m in 2009.</span></p>
              <p><span>But he fell down the pecking order when Mark Hughes was sacked and Roberto Mancini took over as boss.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Togolese forward was sent on loan to Real Madrid on loan in January 2011 before joining Spurs last summer.</span></p>
              <p><span>As a former Gunner, he won over the fans with 18 goals in all competitions.</span></p>
              <p><span>Adebayor joins new recruits Jan Vertonghen and Gylfi Sigurdsson as Andre Villas-Boas shapes his squad for the start of the Premier League campaign.<br></span></p>

              <div class="clear-left">
              <div id="bodyText">
              <p>The striker, 28, is unhappy at being asked to take a £3million-a-year pay cut to join Spurs.</p>
              <p>A close pal confirmed: “Manu is digging his heels in and I don’t think this is going to be sorted any time soon.</p>
              <p>“He’s the sort of guy who will see out his contract rather than cave in.”</p>
              <p>The two clubs agreed a £6m deal last week but Adebayor, who last played for City in December 2010, is stalling on the move because of the huge gulf in wages.</p>
              <p>City paid Arsenal £25m for Adebayor in 2009 and he still has two years left on his £175,000-a-week contract at the Etihad.</p>
              <p>Spurs’ offer of a four-year deal comes nowhere near so Adebayor, who scored 18 goals on loan at White Hart lane last season, is holding out for a sizeable increase from the Londoners or a big pay-off from City.</p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Manchester City are facing the prospect of handing Emmanuel Adebayor a free transfer.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">And that would take the amount of talent written off by boss Roberto Mancini towards £90million.</p>
              <p class="body ">The Blues are furious that, after agreeing a cut-price £6m deal with Tottenham for a player they valued at £12m, the move is collapsing over personal terms.</p>
              <p class="body ">City were desperate to save Adebayor’s £170,000-a-week wages – and remove a major obstacle stopping them ­making a £20m raid for ­Arsenal’s Robin van Persie.</p>
              <p class="body ">The champions told chairman Daniel Levy that they would accept a cut-price fee of £6m to help Spurs offer Adebayor a package close to the wages he earns at the Etihad.</p>
              <p class="body ">City feel Levy has now backtracked – a move forcing them to examine the prospect of either allowing the former Arsenal hit-man to leave for free or giving him a pay-off to compensate him for the money he will lose on the final two years of his contract.</p>
              <p class="body ">A City insider said: “It was felt there was two ways to handle Adebayor. Either we could ask for a fee in ­excess of £10m knowing we would have to spend perhaps half of that compensating the player for lost earnings.</p>
              <p class="body ">“Or, by asking £6m, the buying club would be able to offer wages acceptable to Adebayor.</p>
              <p class="body ">“Tottenham knew that was our intention. Now they want us to accept the lower fee and pay Adebayor off.</p>
              <p class="body ">“Basically they want a player who scored the goals that took them to fourth place in the Premier League last season for nothing.”</p>
              <p class="body ">Sunday Mirror Sport can reveal that signing Van Persie will remain an impossible dream while Adebayor stays.</p>
              <p class="body ">Mancini has issued a thinly-veiled attack on the failure of City’s football administrator Brian Marwood to land his No.1 target.</p>
              <p class="body ">But even if City doubled their initial £15m offer to tempt the Gunners, Van Persie will not join the same club as Adebayor.</p>
              <p class="body ">The Dutchman still hasn’t forgiven his former Emirates team-mate for the stamp which left him nursing a head wound and earned Adebayor a three-match ban for violent conduct when City beat Arsenal 4-2 in an explosive encounter in September 2009.</p>
              <p class="body ">Like City, Manchester United and Juventus will not meet Arsenal’s £30m valuation.</p>
              <p class="body ">But Adebayor’s continuing presence at the Etihad is a stumbling block for City.</p>
              <p class="body "> </p>

              <p class="body "><strong>Mancini is unhappy that Marwood has been unable to offload both Adebayor and Roque Santa Cruz. But City have already lost more than £45m of the £431m they have spent in transfer fees since Sheikh Mansour took over the club in August 2008.</strong></p>
              <p class="body ">They have also lost another fortune subsidising wages to compensate for the loss of earnings once a player leaves the club, either on loan or permanently.</p>
              <p class="body ">Santa Cruz, a £17.5m buy from Blackburn, is available for free but clubs are reluctant to match the £90,000-a-week wages he will earn in the final year of his contract.</p>
              <p class="body ">If he and Adebayor leave for free, that will wipe another £42.5m off the players Sheikh Mansour has bought.</p>
              <p class="body ">Kolo Toure, a £16m buy from Arsenal, can go for £5m. And £16m Nigel de Jong will leave for free when his contract runs out next year. Robinho, a £32m marquee signing who ­arrived when the Abu Dhabi United Group took over, was sold to AC Milan for £15m.</p>
              <p class="body ">Craig Bellamy joined ­Liverpool on a free after costing £14m, while £12m Wayne Bridge will have his £90,000-a-week pay subsidised while on loan at Brighton.</p>
              <p class="body ">Keeper Shay Given joined Aston Villa for half of the £6m he cost from Newcastle.</p>
              <p class="body ">But Jerome Boateng was sold for a profit. He cost £10.5m from Hamburg but moved to Bayern Munich for £12.4m.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Emmanuel Adebayor declared he is 'hungry for goals' after finally completing his permanent transfer to Tottenham.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Manchester City and Adebayor came to an agreement on the terms of a pay-off on Tuesday afternoon, allowing the Togo striker to complete his permanent move to White Hart Lane for a reported fee of £5million.</span></p>
              <p><span>The 28-year-old's arrival is a huge boost to Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas, who until Tuesday had only one recognised out and out striker in Jermain Defoe.</span></p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p><span>Despite spending three and a half years at bitter rivals Arsenal, Adebayor became a fans' favourite at Tottenham last season, mainly because he scored 18 goals and struck up a sound understanding with Rafael van der Vaart while on loan at the London club.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Togo hitman vowed to continue his goal-scoring spree at the club on Tuesday after sealing his return to Spurs.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I'm back!!!! Tottenham here I come!! I'm hungry for goals...Get ready,' Adebayor tweeted.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span><strong>'I am pleased to be signing for Spurs on a permanent basis after finally agreeing my departure with Manchester City,' he added later on Spurs' website.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'It may have taken longer than expected but I am delighted to be back at Tottenham Hotspur.</span></p>
              <p><span>'I really enjoyed my time here last season and I am hoping we can achieve great things together again.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Adebayor spent three years at City but fell out of favour upon Robert Mancini's appointment as manager and spent the last year and a half on loan at Real Madrid and Spurs. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>With 10 days to go until the close of the transfer window, Villas-Boas is starting to put the finishing touches to the squad he wants to win a trophy this season.</span></p>
              <p><span>Adebayor joined on the same day Spurs sold out-of-favour centre-back Sebastien Bassong to Norwich and it may not be long before another Tottenham defender, Michael Dawson, leaves the club after QPR made a bid for the England international on Tuesday.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/21/article-2191560-149A4716000005DC-389_468x309.jpg" alt="Two's company: Jermain Defoe (centre right) has a strike partner at last" width="468" height="309">

              <p><span><strong>Although he is the club's captain, Dawson was left out of the squad that travelled to Newcastle at the weekend, hinting that the centre-back may be surplus to requirements under Villas-Boas.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>There is likely to be further transfer activity at White Hart Lane before the window shuts.</span></p>
              <p><span>Tom Huddlestone has been linked with a loan move to Stoke and fellow squad players David Bentley and Giovani Dos Santos may depart.</span></p>
              <p><span>Tottenham also remain in talks with Real Madrid over the protracted sale of Luka Modric.</span></p>
              <p><span>Villas-Boas will also be looking to add to Tottenham's ranks, with Manchester City midfielder Adam Johnson the latest player to be linked with the north London outfit.</span></p>
