              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal have played a game less than most of their rivals following the Champions League qualifying round against Celtic and also faced away games at Everton, Manchester United, Manchester City and Fulham in their opening six matches.</span></strong></p>
              <p>“We are in a strong position, despite the fact we have lost two games,” said Wenger. “If you look at the away games we had, it was at places where other teams can drop points – Manchester, Everton and Fulham. We should have won the two games in Manchester but that made our resolve even stronger.</p>
              <p>“But let’s not just look at Man United. We have also Chelsea, Liverpool and maybe Man City. The most important thing is for us to play at that level and get stronger and stronger.”</p>
              <p>Arsenal also have the best goal difference in the entire league, with their seven games having so far produced 34 goals. Wenger says that a degree of defensive fragility may be the price his team must pay for their attacking style.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">“We scored six against Blackburn</span> and their goalkeeper had a great game,” he said. “There is something in the side that is light-hearted, and enjoyable to watch. Why? Because they feel they enjoy what they do. They enjoy to play together and that for me is the most important.</p>
              <p>“When we are confident we have a flow that looks like the goals will come at any moment and from anywhere. There is some strength coming out of this team – we have to add some discipline defensively.</p>
              <p>“We looked always like we would score goals. It’s difficult to have so many people going forward and as well have everybody straight away defending well. It’s a consequence of our philosophy a little bit.”</p>
