              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Flop of the Kops: The Italian's spell on Merseyside was a complete disaster</em></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Kenny Dalglish is in danger of being saddled with a midfielder he does not want after Juventus told Alberto Aquilani that they will not be taking up the option to sign him on a permanent basis.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>On the day the Liverpool manager wrapped up the £20million acquisition of Sunderland's England Under 21 midfielder Jordan Henderson, Juventus finally confirmed that new coach Antonio Conte had won the battle of wills over on-loan Aquilani's future.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>While Juve's board had given Aquilani assurances that they would be keeping him beyond his 12-month temporary stay, Conte insisted, after being recruited to replace the sacked Luigi Del Neri, that Liverpool's £17million signing from Roma had no place in his plans.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A bitterly unhappy Aquilani is now pinning his Serie A hopes on AC Milan following up their interest in him and agreeing a fee with Liverpool and personal terms with the 26-year old.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Worryingly for Dalglish, Inter Milan are the only other realistic candidates for his signature. Unless either of the San Siro clubs come to the rescue, Aquilani will return to Anfield, despite his wife and young daughter wanting to stay in Italy.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Dalglish would then face the task of trying to coax the best out of a player who has slipped further down the pecking order, after Henderson's arrival, and is seething at his treatment by Juventus.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He claims a deal was in place in January, after an £8million fee was agreed between the clubs, and that Juve have gone back on their word.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Milan are his best hope of salvaging a full-time move back to Serie A, after they lost Andrea Pirlo to Juventus, but Liverpool may have to take an even bigger financial hit than the one negotiated with the Turin club.</span></p>

              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Catania have claimed that Liverpool are interested in their Argentine defender Matias Silvestre. </strong></p>
              <p>The 26-year-old has been playing for the Serie A club for the past three-and-a-half seasons, having arrived in Italy from Boca Juniors in January 2008.</p>
              <p>His performances over the past 12 months have been particularly impressive and Catania general manager Pietro Lo Monaco admitted in April it was probably time for him to move on to a bigger stage.</p>
              <p>Lo Monaco has now declared that Liverpool are among the clubs chasing Silvestre's signature, along with Villarreal and a couple of Italian rivals.</p>
              <p>"Top of the list of those moving on is Silvestre," Lo Monaco told <em>Itasportpress</em>.</p>
              <p>"I'd struggle to keep him here, considering what a great player he is. There are two Italian clubs tracking him, but Liverpool and Villarreal are also interested in Silvestre.</p>
              <p>"Silvestre is worth as much as Thiago Silva and scores more goals."</p>
