              <p><span><strong>Liverpool have reportedly lost patience with £35million flop Andy Carroll.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The England striker has struggled to settle at Anfield since moving south last January and is set to be sold this summer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Carroll further harmed his chances of rebuilding his reputation when he delivered a volley of abuse towards manager Kenny Dalglish last weekend.<br></span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen5334" class="moduleHalf">
              <div class="sport item"> </div>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Having started against his former side Newcastle, he was replaced in the second half, much to his obvious disgust.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Liverpool lost 2-0 as their league campaign continued to spiral out of control.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Carroll was benched for the Reds' 1-1 draw with Aston Villa on Saturday, coming on for the final 25 minutes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Dalglish has insisted that Carroll's outburst has been dealt with but the Sunday Mirror reports that the striker is on his way out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'Kenny has gone out of his way to protect Carroll from criticism. He’s straight with his staff, but many people here are concerned that players like Andy have not adapted to the Liverpool way,' an Anfield source said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">There is no chance Liverpool will recoup the staggering fee they paid for Carroll and would have to accept a cut-price deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Carroll has reportedly told friends he would welcome a return to Newcastle but he would need to accept a drop in wages to fit in with his former club's pay scale.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">He has also been more than adequately replaced on Tyneside by the Senegalese strikers Demba Ba and Papiss Cisse.</span></p>

              Carroll need to improve and so does Kenny.

              <p><span><strong>Misfiring Liverpool striker Andy Carroll has admitted privately that he is struggling to cope with the pressure of the £35million price tag that made him the most expensive British footballer.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Carroll and his Liverpool team-mates head to Blackburn tonight hoping to win only their second Barclays Premier League game since the end of January. </span> </p>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>The former Newcastle striker has become symbolic of Liverpool's struggles, scoring just three times in the league this season. </span></div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>.</span></div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span>Now it has emerged that the England international has admitted to friends that he has struggled to deal with the attention and pressure that came with a transfer fee that shocked the Premier League when Liverpool bought him in January last year. </span></div>
              <div class="moduleHalf">.</div>
              <p><span>It is understood that the 23-year-old is determined to make things work at Anfield and still believes he has what it takes to prove himself a valuable asset on Merseyside. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, he feels his best form will not come until he can forget about the enormous amount Liverpool paid to take him to the North West from his home city. </span></p>
              <p><span>One friend of Carroll said this week: 'Andy isn't unhappy at Liverpool - he thinks Kenny Dalglish has been supportive and he still thinks he can make it work. </span></p>
              <p><span>'But one of his main problems is the fact that Liverpool paid so much for him. </span></p>
              <p><span>'He feels that the size of the fee wasn't his fault but that he has had to deal with the consequences of it being so huge and a record.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Carroll has scored only five times in the Premier League since arriving at Anfield and only eight times for the club in total. </span></p>
              <p><span>At Newcastle, he had an impressive record of 31 league goals in 57 league starts. </span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish is preparing to leave some of his key performers on the bench tonight against Blackburn at Ewood Park in an attempt to safeguard Liverpool's FA Cup ambitions. </span></p>
              <p><span>Skipper Steven Gerrard is likely to be the biggest name held back ahead of Saturday's Wembley semi-final showdown against Everton, while leading goalscorer Luis Suarez and defender Daniel Agger could also be rested.</span></p>

              <p>Andy need good and proper cross into the box to score.</p>
              <p>That is what Gerard told Bellamy before he took the free kick.</p>
              <p>Carroll need more work to regain his sharpness.</p>
              <p>But, he need to put in lots of hard work in getting the balls instead of walking around the box.</p>

              <p>Carroll is like in the middle right now. Not sure which way is he going to go... A lot will depends on Kenny's vision to play him and the team's style of play he employs.</p>
              <p>Of course $35m no matter how you look at it is still over priced. Since he joint, they say he scored like 9 or 10 league goals to date (1 and a half years)... Compare to that Newcastle's new $9m no.9... 10 goals in 4 months? He still looks very far away.</p>
              <p>Maybe if he came at $15m he won't be feeling the pressure... Or another option is Pool goes out and buy an even more expensive striker then he will feel all the eyes isn't on him anymore... and maybe start playing better...</p>
              <p>With some players, you just have an image of them in your mind. To be frank, to date his most memorable moment i have of him is still his ridiculous dive against Newcastle. Perhaps he can do better in future to change this perception.</p>

              <p>Liverpool start playing well when the 35 million worth of players were off.</p>
