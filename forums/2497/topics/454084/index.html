              <p><span><strong>Liverpool's principal owner John Henry insists it is a myth that a new stadium will transform the club's financial fortunes.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The lead figure in Fenway Sports Group has suggested a new-build in Stanley Park would most likely lead to increased ticket prices, quoting recent examples taken from the United States.</span></p>
              <p><span>Henry believes the best way of improving the Reds' ability to compete financially is through worldwide commercial revenue streams and their long-term future is not dependent on the stadium issue, which casts doubt over whether the long-mooted Stanley Park project will ever come to fruition.</span></p>
              <p><span>'A long-term myth has existed about the financial impact of a new stadium for Liverpool," the American wrote in an email to The Anfield Wrap website.</span></p>
              <p><span>'A belief has grown that Liverpool FC must have a new stadium to compete with (Manchester) United, Arsenal and others.</span></p>
              <p><span>'No-one has ever addressed whether or not a new stadium is rational.</span></p>
              <p><span>'New stadiums that are publicly-financed make sense for clubs - I've never heard of a club turning down a publicly-financed stadium.</span></p>
              <div class="moduleHalf">
              <div class="sport item"><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LiverpoolMail"></a><span>'But privately carrying new stadiums is an enormous challenge. Arsenal is centred in a very wealthy city with a metropolitan population of approximately 14 million people.</span></div>
              <div class="sport item"><span>.</span></div>
              <div class="sport item"><span>'They did a tremendous job of carrying it off on a number of levels but how many new football stadiums with more than 30,000 seats have been built in the UK over the past decade or so?</span></div>
              <div class="sport item">.</div>
              </div>
              <p><span>'New stadiums increase revenues primarily by raising ticket prices - especially premium seating.'</span></p>
              <p><span>Henry accepts there is a balancing act to be done when considering the worth of a new stadium against a redevelopment of Anfield, which presents numerous logistical problems.</span></p>
              <p><span>'We've been exploring a new stadium for the past 18 months. At one point we made it clear that if a naming rights deal could be secured of sufficient size, we would make every effort to build a new facility,' he added.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>'Liverpool FC has an advantage in being a global club and a naming rights deal could make a new stadium a reality.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>'It is something we are working on. There has been interest.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Going in the other direction, many football clubs have successfully enlarged their seating capacity.</span></p>
              <p><span>'LFC has had plans to expand the main stand at Anfield but this avenue has been very difficult for the club over the past couple of decades.</span></p>
              <p><span>'There are homes behind the main stand. Expansion of the main stand would have to be a priority for the city, community and immediate neighbourhood in order for that to occur.</span></p>
              <p><span>'This issue is vital to the neighbourhood's future but we cannot and will not act unilaterally.</span></p>
              <p><span>'While a new stadium or an expansion of Anfield is beneficial over the long-term for the club, the financial impact of adding seats and amenities should be put into perspective.</span></p>
              <p><span>'That's why I say that it is a myth that stadium issues are going to magically transform LFC's fortunes.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Building new or refurbishing Anfield is going to lead to an increase from £40million of match-day revenue to perhaps £60-70m if you don't factor in debt service.</span></p>
              <p><span>'That would certainly help but it's just one component of LFC long-term fortunes.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Our future is based not on a stadium issue but on building a strong football club that can compete with anyone in Europe.</span></p>
              <p><span>'This will be principally driven financially by our commercial strengths globally.'</span></p>

              <p>It's all so strange sometimes... Roman got the cash and willing to used it to build a new stadium for Chelsea but their fans want to stay and stop him from moving the team out of the Bridge.</p>
              <p>The truth about Henry is beginning to show... He looks like a man who is only interested in the bottomline and can't wait to see the $$$ start rolling in instead. Refused to start plans on building a new stadium but has been deferring it with time wasting plans of redevelopment of Anfield... Is this a delay tactics of FSG?</p>
              <p>When he talks about "factor in debt service", it gives me the impression his group like G&amp;H, don't have the money to build a new stadium and if they are to do so, they will need to take bank loans again.</p>
              <p>It's like out of the fire and into the frying pan... Should have gone with Peter Lim and they might have got a better chance of it...</p>

              <p>If he have chosen Rodgers to be the new manager, the fan will not be expecting any big signings or big results for the next three seasons.</p>
              <p>Henry is awaiting for chance to offload Liverpool when the time is right.</p>
