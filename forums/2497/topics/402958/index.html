              <h1>England captain Steven Gerrard: Don't give up on us<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Steven Gerrard, captain of an England side on the brink of ignominy, 
              looked visibly shaken as he offered a possible escape from the 
              ever-deepening World Cup hole he and his team-mates have dug themselves 
              into.</p>
              <p>Gerrard, the man who wore the armband and therefore shouldered his 
              share of responsibility for Friday night's abject 0-0 draw with Algeria,
              wisely offered no excuses for a desperate result that leaves England on
              the brink of elimination with just two points to their name from two 
              winnable fixtures.</p>
              <p>But after failing to see off either the United States or Algeria, 
              this deflated group are left with no option but to beat Slovenia in Port
              Elizabeth on Wednesday night to reach the last 16.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/19/article-0-0A1A530C000005DC-114_468x286.jpg" alt="Steven Gerrard" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Rally the troops: Steven Gerrard needs to ensure
               his team mates are up for the Slovenia clash</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Remember the euphoria of last December when England were pitched into
               the same group as three perceived lightweights in USA, Algeria and 
              Slovenia.</p>
              <p>They were even hailed by the bookmakers as third 
              favourites for the greatest prize in the game behind Spain and Brazil 
              and informed they were effectively being handed a bye into the knockout 
              stage.</p>
              <p>How the landscape has changed. Gerrard's withering 
              post-mortem into Friday night made you wonder where it has all gone so 
              dismally wrong.</p>
              <p>'We weren't aggressive enough against 
              Algeria,' said the Liverpool midfielder. 'We never pressed the ball and 
              won it back quickly enough. We never showed enough urgency. We certainly
               weren't clinical enough around the box.'</p>
              <p>Hardly the 
              attributes of the competition's third favourites. England now have four 
              days to rediscover those basic skills or they face a terrible 
              humiliation.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/19/article-0-0A1A6BD5000005DC-112_306x423.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Blame game: Wayne Rooney looked disinterested on
               Friday night</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'We need to find something quick for Wednesday night,' said Gerrard. 
              'We need to improve and improve quickly. We need to find more spirit. 
              This is the last chance. What's done is done. There's no looking back. 
              We can't change that.</p>
              <p>'As captain, I've got to make sure we don't
               feel sorry for ourselves and we've got to go out on Wednesday night and
               perform a lot better.'</p>
              <p>In complete contrast to Wayne 
              Rooney's angry condemnation of the fans who booed the players off the 
              pitch in Cape Town, Gerrard joined with England team-mates John Terry 
              and Frank Lampard in offering hope and optimism that their journey 
              halfway around the world has not been wasted.</p>
              <p>'The fans pay 
              good money,' he added. 'They have been terrific in the two games, 
              getting behind us and showing us support and we need to produce more for
               them.</p>
              <p>'Hopefully on Wednesday we can send them away smiling 
              rather than the way they are feeling now.'</p>
              <p>So what did go 
              wrong against Algeria, when England produced one of the most laboured 
              and disjointed performances for many years?</p>
              <p>Gerrard himself 
              was at a loss to put his finger on it. 'I thought the first game would 
              get the cobwebs out of the system and I'm very surprised with the result
               against Algeria,' he said.</p>
              <p>'I thought we prepared really 
              well for this game, going into the game we felt good and, unfortunately,
               we haven't delivered the result we wanted.</p>
              <p>'It puts a lot more 
              pressure on ourselves for Wednesday, but as a player you've got to 
              thrive on that pressure and look forward to it and hope we can get the 
              result we want.</p>
              <p>'There's a lot of pressure on the guys, 
              there's no lying about that. There's a lot of tension because we want to
               stay in this tournament for a long time.</p>
              <p>'But we knew that 
              coming into it, that there was always going to be big pressure and as 
              players you've got to accept that. You've got to play under that 
              pressure and play well. As players, we don't want to go home. We want to
               stay with the supporters and have a successful tournament. But we will 
              only do that if we improve on our performance against Algeria.'</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/19/article-0-0A1A6034000005DC-14_468x359.jpg" alt="David James" width="468" height="359">

              </div>
              <p>Terry acknowledged the disappointment of England followers, but urged
               them to get behind the team, declaring: 'The players are feeling 
              exactly the same way as the fans - frustrated.</p>
              <p>'At the same 
              time, we need to win our last game. It's as simple as that.</p>
              <p>'There's
               one game left and we just need everyone behind us. There's no point 
              everyone criticising. We haven't done it up to now. We need to do it in 
              the next game. If we do it in the next game, we go through.</p>
              <p>'If 
              we don't win the next game, then is the time to be worried. We still 
              have a chance of going through in the group and still topping it. It's 
              in our hands. If we win, we could be top of the group and we move on.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/19/article-0-0A1A5618000005DC-261_468x295.jpg" alt="Capello" width="468" height="295">

              </div>
              <p>'But first and foremost is getting through the group. We have made 
              it difficult for ourselves but nothing should change.</p>
              <p>'We 
              shouldn't be changing the way we play and we shouldn't be worried about 
              other sides because, after what I've seen so far, other teams don't 
              worry me at all. But it's a must to get through the group if we want to 
              go on.'</p>
              <p>He added: 'I'm urging everyone not to criticise us 
              too much. We understand the frustration of you guys [the media] and the 
              fans. We've got one game left. It's in our own hands.'</p>

              <p>Jamie Carragher's suspension after two yellow cards means Terry will 
              have either Matthew Upson or Michael Dawson as his central defensive 
              partner against Slovenia.</p>
              <p>'Whoever comes in alongside me will
               be fine,' the Chelsea captain said. 'I've got four or five days to the 
              next game so there will be enough preparation on the training field.'</p>
              <p>His
               Stamford Bridge team-mate Lampard was equally upbeat, insisting: 'We've
               gone into one-off games before and come through, and if you'd said 
              before the tournament, "You have to beat Slovenia to go through", we'd
