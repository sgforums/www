              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>I'm
               a Saints fan, and it seems to me that virtually every first-team player
               who played for Southampton in the Premier League managed a playing 
              career with at least one goal in the top flight (goalkeepers excluded). 
               Even though Claus Lundekvam took nearly 300 games to get his first, and
               Francis Benali only had one goal in 311 games, they all seemed to score
               eventually.  That got me wondering: how common is it for a Premier 
              League player to retire from the league without scoring?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I 
              imagine it would be very common, as many players might only have short 
              Premier League careers, for whatever reason  (Ali Dia certainly does not
               have any goals to his name!).  But does the answer to the question 
              change when we ask instead "How common is it for someone who has played 
              more than a full Premier League season to retire without scoring?"  Is 
              that list still a long one, or is that more rare?</strong><em> Dennis Crawford asked</em></p>
              <p>It
               is rather more rare. Excluding goalkeepers (obviously), no one in the 
              Premier League's top 50 appearance makers has failed to score. The 
              winner of this unwanted award, therefore, is the former Birmingham and 
              Wimbledon defender Kenny Cunningham, who played 335 Premier League games
               without scoring, though his career did include two goals, one in the 
              league, for Millwall.</p>
              <p>In second place, with no goals in 264 games,
               is a famously goal-shy player. Des Walker's entire career brought just 
              one, for Nottingham Forest against Luton, in the season before the 
              Premier League began. Next is Stephane Henchoz, who played 243 league 
              games for Blackburn, Liverpool and Wigan without finding the opponents' 
              net.</p>
              <p>Those three are the only non-goalkeepers among the top 200 
              appearance-makers without a Premier League goal. The next in line, the 
              first current player and the first man without a goal for any club in 
              any competition is Tony Hibbert, whose 221 league games (282 in total) 
              have been utterly unproductive. I believe he also has Everton's record 
              for an outfield player without scoring.</p>
              <p><strong>With the recent 
              promotion of Swansea to the Premier League, I was wondering whether 
              there are any other football teams around the world which are based in, 
              and compete in, separate countries' football leagues?</strong> <em>Ekrem Sonmenis asked</em></p>
              <p>This
               is an awkward situation. Technically Wales is not a different country, 
              though it has its own national team, but is part of the United Kingdom. 
              However, there is a separate League of Wales. Nevertheless, six Welsh 
              teams are in the English football pyramid: Swansea, Cardiff (in the 
              Championship) and, in non-league, Newport, Wrexham, Colwyn Bay and 
              Merthyr Town. Newport, Wrexham and a former club in Merthyr Tydfil have 
              all played in the Football League in the past.</p>
              <p>However, there is 
              an English team who play in a different league: Berwick Rangers, members
               of the Scottish League since 1955 and currently in the third division. 
              To further complicate matters, one Scottish club - Queens Park - have 
              played in the English FA Cup, albeit in the 19th Century. They reached 
              the final in both 1884 and 1885. Cardiff, by the way, are the only 
              non-English club to have won the FA Cup.</p>
              <p>In addition, the League 
              of Ireland includes one club from Northern Ireland, Derry City. They 
              required special dispensation to join the division south of the border.
               
              Leaving the British Isles, Major League Soccer in the United States 
              contains two Canadian teams, Toronto and the Vancouver Whitecaps and its
               predecessor, NASL, also included clubs from Calgary, Edmonton and 
              Montreal as well as Toronto and Vancouver. In addition, the Australian 
              A-League has a side from New Zealand, Wellington Phoenix. In both cases,
               there is a tradition of other sports competing in club leagues across 
              the two countries while Canada and New Zealand lack a full-time 
              professional football league.</p>
              <p>There are other examples. The 
              seven-times champions of France, Monaco, actually play in a separate 
              country, though Monaco is not a member of FIFA. Exceptions are made for 
              other small countries, too: San Marino Calcio are in Serie C2 in Italy, 
              FC Andorra play in Spain and Liechtenstein's club sides are in the Swiss
               system. <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Perhaps the most extreme example is Singapore's S League which 
              has featured 10 different non-Singaporean teams, though only two are in 
              the current division.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong>I would like to know if Ryan Giggs has ever made the FIFA world XI in his career?</strong> Oyeniyi Raphael from Nigeria asked</p>
              <p>He hasn't, although, as the annual selection of players only began in 2005, much of Giggs' career predated it.</p>
              <p><strong>In history, is there a team who got promoted to the top league and won the title the very next season? </strong><em>Alan Goh from Singapore asked</em></p>
              <p>In
               English football, there are four: first Liverpool, title winners in 
              1906, then Tottenham in 1951. Ipswich Town, under Alf Ramsey, were next 
              in 1962 followed by the most modern, and probably last for some time to 
              come, Nottingham Forest. Promoted from Division Two in 1977, when they 
              only finished third, they won Division One 12 months later and, 
              remarkably, won the European Cup in each of the two following seasons.</p>
              <p>There
               are examples abroad, too, with a prominent and comparatively recent one
               in the Bundesliga: Kaiserslautern won Germany's top two divisions in 
              successive seasons, becoming champions of the country in 1998.</p>
