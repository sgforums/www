              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">HARRY REDKNAPP admitted he was stunned at how easily Tottenham rolled over Liverpool at White Hart Lane. The Spurs boss could not believe the contrast to last season's fixture, when the Reds battered his side.</h2>
              <p class="article">Redknapp's season got off to a rip-roaring start as goals from Benoit Assou-Ekotto and Sebastien Bassong left the Kop red-faced and pointless after the opening weekend of the campaign.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool, who missed out on the title by four points in 2008-09, threatened briefly when Steven Gerrard scored from the spot. But they clearly missed Xabi Alonso, sold to Real Madrid for Â£30million.</p>
              <p class="article">Redknapp said: "Last season we beat Liverpool 2-1 here but they absolutely destroyed us. How we won that game I have no idea. We were battered. "It was a totally different story this time around, though, and we could easily have been two-up by half-time. "I expected Liverpool to put us under the cosh a bit more, especially after last year. I thought it would be another tough game for us.</p>
              <p class="article">"Of course, Liverpool are going to miss Alonso. He is quality. They had no one who could get the ball to Gerrard playing in that hole off Torres. "Alonso is so clever, an intelligent player who sees things early. But they have bought the Italian boy, Aquilani, and he is supposed to be top, top class.</p>
              <p class="article">"It would have been hard to press Liverpool like we did if Alonso had been in their team, as he can turn the ball around corners with just one touch. I was worried about how Gerrard could hurt us. But with the pressing game we played, it restricted possession for Liverpool."</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez agreed his side were well below par and called for an immediate improvement. He said: "We won a lot of games last year without Alonso. We have enough quality in the squad and have to prove this. "We have to improve in the middle, at keeping the ball and passing the ball.</p>
              <p class="article">"The strikers and midfielders understand it has to be better. As a team we were not comfortable in possession in the first half, so it is not just about one player. Everybody has to improve."</p>
              <p class="article">Tottenham won their opening league fixture at home for the first time in eight years and the signs are there already they will better last season's eighth place. Redknapp predicted the most open title race for years, with mid-table sides capable of knocking off the top six.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "There is more of an edge to the league already. I can see a lot more teams being involved.</p>
              <p class="article">"Look at some of the results on Saturday - Villa got beat by Wigan and Sunderland looked useful winning at Bolton. They have all improved, have all brought in good players. It will be a tight division all the way down and at the top very tight.</p>
              <p class="article">"Everybody had been writing Arsenal off but look what they did at Everton. That 6-1 win was amazing and could be the result of the season. We have a decent squad. When our centre-halves Jonathan Woodgate and Michael Dawson come back it will give us a strong group of players."</p>
              <p class="article">New recruit Bassong, bought from Newcastle for Â£8million, looked comfortable at the heart of Tottenham's defence and Redknapp reckons he has a bargain. He declared: "I like Bassong. I think he can be an outstanding player. "He is not even fit yet, as he has missed most of the pre-season training with Newcastle." Tottenham could well do more business before the transfer window closes, with Aston Villa interested in David Bentley and Jermaine Jenas.</p>
              <p class="article">Redknapp said: "I'm sure my phone will be ringing this week with one or two looking to buy players off us. If we are offered good money for whoever and can get someone else in to improve us, then we will have a go.</p>
              <p class="article">"I've read I was at Aberdeen on Saturday looking at Celtic's Scott Brown. "In fact I was at Chelsea because they played Hull and we play them on Wednesday. I like Brown but we have not made an enquiry for him."</p>
              <p class="article">Redknapp is now looking for Spurs to maintain their improved home form and do better on their travels. He stated: "Tottenham beat Chelsea here last year, held Manchester United and beat Liverpool. The only home game we lost after I took over was to Everton.</p>
              <p class="article">"We now have to prove we can play away as well on a more consistent basis. "Tottenham have to keep going and see where it takes us."</p>

              <p>i believe liverpool will out of the big 4 this season. liverpool survived the last season with minimal injuries. i cant imagine what will happen if either Gerrard or Torres is injured some time this season. liverpool certainly need at least one strong midfielder and defenders. Pepe alone cant save its defence. pepe deserves more cover but afterall he is a really world class keeper despite not playing first team for spain.</p>
              <p>tottenham and man city may pose great threat to both arsenal and liverpool for the big four status. as an arsenal fan, i am not really amazed by the rumours that AW is trying to buy van der vaart. yes Vdv is good, but will prove to be a surplus in arsenal squad with walcott, nasri, rosicky, arshavin, vela or even wilshere that play similar attacking football. a defensive midfielder should be more urgently needed. song is reliable but inconsisent. denilson is creative but not solid enough. diaby is too inconsisent. eboue performs better as a RB then DM. good luck to arsenal this season.</p>
              <p>i believe tottenham will be a bright spark this season.</p>
