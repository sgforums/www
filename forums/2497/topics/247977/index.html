            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>Rafa Benitez believes Peter Crouch will keep firing on all cylinders until the end of the season.</strong><br><br>The England striker scored the only goal of the game in Liverpool's UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg against PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday night, and Benitez feels his fine run of form can continue right through till the summer.<br><br>"I think that now he has the confidence that all strikers need when they start scoring goals," he told the website after the game.<br><br>"He can keep scoring goals until the end of the season."<br><br>Crouch himself also was also in confident mood after the game.<br><br>"I've been pleased with my form in the Champions League. It's a fantastic competition," he said.<br><br>"Hopefully I can keep that run going."<br><br>Crouch admitted, however, that the match was not a classic.<br><br>"I don't think it was much of a spectacle, but we did a job, got the result," he said.<br><br>"We did most of the work in the first leg obviously and it was just a case of seeing it out today, and that's what we did well.<br><br>"It was a strange game. All the lads were up for it. If it had stayed 0-0, I'm sure you would've seen more urgency."<br><br>They now go on to face Chelsea in the semi-final in a repeat of the clash in 2005 when Liverpool went on to win the competition, and Benitez was cautiously optimistic about his side's chances.<br><br>"We know that it will be really difficult because Chelsea is a very good team," he said.<br><br>"But we all know that if we play at our level, we can beat them."<br><br>With the first leg taking place at Stamford Bridge, Liverpool could have a slight advantage in playing the decider at home, but Benitez does not feel it is significant.<br><br>"Chelsea are a good team playing away - you could see the other day against Valencia.<br><br>"There is not a great advantage. Maybe a little bit."<br><br>Chelsea are also involved in the FA Cup and the title race, which could also be seen as an advantage for Liverpool.<br><br>"It could be, but they have a big squad and a lot of very good players.<br><br>"They have enough players and enough quality for playing a lot of competitions."</span></div>
