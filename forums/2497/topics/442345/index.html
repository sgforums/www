              <p><strong>Some of the responses;</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Former Wales international teammate of Gary Speed, Robbie Savage on BBC Radio 5 live:</strong> "I loved him as a friend. His wife is beautiful, he had a lovely family. He'd do anything for anybody. Football and family were Gary's life. I idolised him. He was one of my heroes in life. Everybody loved Gary Speed. It's so sad he couldn't talk to people. He was such a good looking guy, he had everything. Why has this happened?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Dan Walker, who presented Football Focus, with Gary Speed as a guest, yesterday:</strong> "He was as bubbly as I've known him. He was talking about his kids how they were really coming on and talking about playing golf next week. Even small things like how he'd just got into Twitter. It's awful to think someone who was so gifted and so well liked with the rest of his life to look forward to has been cruelly removed. He was in such a good mood about the show and said he'd love to come back before Christmas, he said: 'I really enjoyed it.'"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Kevin Blackwell, who Speed succeeded as Sheffield United manager:</strong> "Gary was developing a plan [at Wales]. The first few games they weren't very good but he knew that. He was very excited about the players he had with Wales. He knew he could turn it around. They were playing some terrific stuff under Gary. He was a great raconteur. He was a first-class man. He leaves behind such a legacy. The feeling about the man is unbelievable. I just feel sick. It doesn't seem right. It's a sad loss for football."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>BBC Wales football reporter Rob Phillips:</strong> "The whole of the sporting world are united in their grief."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Former Wales international team-mate of Speed Ryan Giggs on the Manchester United website:</strong> "I am totally devastated. Gary Speed was one of the nicest men in football and someone I am honoured to call a team-mate and friend. Words cannot begin to describe how sad I feel at hearing this awful news. It goes without saying my thoughts are with his family at this tremendously sad time."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Leeds manager Simon Grayson:</strong> "We signed on the same day and played in the youth and reserve teams together. We also did all our coaching badges together. He was a good friend and this is a very sad day. Gary was such a popular person and this is a hard time for everybody."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Former Arsenal defender Nigel Winterburn:</strong> "I'm absolutely shocked. I can't believe the news. I've seen Gary around at some of the grounds. He was doing a fabulous job for his country. Welsh football has been down in the dumps for a long time but they've got some terrific players coming through. He was very fit and energetic. A midfield dynamo. He was terrific on the ball and scored goals for all the clubs he was at."</p>

              <p>Gary Speed 'was not depressed... he was happily married'<br><br></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Gary Speed was not depressed and had not argued with his wife before being found hanged at his home, according to a close friend.<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Wales manager’s agent and best man Hayden Evans said Speed was ‘happily married’ and that his widow Louise is bewildered by his suspected suicide.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Mr Evans said: ‘They were happily married and anyone who knows them will tell you that. This is why it is a mystery.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘We genuinely at the moment have no clue whatsoever what has caused it and I have been with the family all day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘Everybody is asking the same question and no one has an answer. We are all in shock.’</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption">The final picture: Gary Speed poses with a fan outisde the BBC studios in Salford. Hours later he was found dead</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">When asked if 42-year-old Speed had suffered bouts of depression, Mr Evans told The Sun ‘none whatsoever’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He added: ‘The one thing the family and me as one of his closest friends would totally refute is that. There was no indication of any problems and never has been’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Speed appeared happy as he left BBC studios in Salford on Saturday afternoon after filming Football Focus. His wife found him hanged in the garage of their £1.5million mansion near Chester just after 7am on Sunday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Yesterday, as tributes continued to pour in from across the sporting world to the popular Welshman, police were preparing for the delicate task of speaking to his 40-year-old wife and their two teenage sons.</span></p>
              <p><br><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/11/27/article-2066812-0EF6061E00000578-585_306x694.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="694"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption">Gary Speed, with his wife Louise, earlier this year at Shay Given's Fashion Kicks event held at Lancashire County Cricket Club</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As they struggled to come to terms with his shock death, Mr Evans spoke of how they had been ‘overwhelmed’ by the outpouring of sympathy over the past 24 hours.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘Gary’s family would sincerely like to thank all the people who have sent messages of condolence and tributes in what is a very difficult time,’ said Mr Evans.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Speaking outside the family’s home, he added: ‘They have been overwhelmed by the support – it really has helped. You can imagine how Louise is feeling.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A pile of tributes including flowers, footballs and soccer shirts was growing at the gates at the end of the star’s drive last night as a steady stream of fans came to pay their respects.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Yesterday officials at the Welsh Football Association promised to support the family and offer them a ‘shoulder to cry on’ in the coming weeks.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘I’ve no understanding of why it happened, I don’t know the answer and I don’t think we ever will,’ said chief executive Jonathan Ford.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘At the moment our thoughts aren’t with that – they are with Gary’s family. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘He was a family man, he loved his wife and children.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘We will do whatever we can to help Louise and the boys.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Both Speed’s sons are promising sportsmen, 14-year-old Ed a talented footballer and his  13-year-old brother Tommy a keen boxer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Also yesterday shocked fans of the clubs Speed represented over his long career – including Leeds United, Everton, Newcastle and Bolton Wanderers – left photographs, shirts and bouquets of flowers outside their grounds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Cheshire Police confirmed that Speed’s death was being treated as ‘non-suspicious’. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">An inquest will be opened and adjourned today in Warrington.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Shocked friends have told how he seemed happy and planning for the future when he appeared as a guest on Football Focus which was filmed in Salford on Saturday - an account borne out by the photograph of him beaming alongside a delighted fan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">It was taken as he walked out of the studios with former teammate Gary McAllister at 2.30pm.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And yet just after 7am on Sunday, his wife is understood to have made the horrifying discovery of his body hanging in the garage of their home.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Speed's widow, Louise, 40, was a constant figure of support throughout his career. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Speed’s parents Roger and Carol were being comforted by family and friends at their neat semi-detached home in nearby Queensferry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A friend said: ‘The family are far too upset to say anything at this terrible time.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Shocked fans of the clubs Speed represented over his long career – including Leeds United, Everton, Newcastle and Bolton Wanderers – left photographs, shirts and bouquets of flowers outside their grounds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">At the Welsh Assembly building in Cardiff, flags were flying at half-mast.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Prime Minister David Cameron described Gary Speed's death as 'incredibly moving'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I was watching Match Of The Day last night and watching people, crowds, absolutely silent and footballers revering his memory,' he said.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I think it has been extremely moving. Obviously here in the north, where he played for so many of the iconic teams, I know he meant an enormous amount to people and people feel very, very sad on his behalf and on his family's behalf.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">During Football Focus on BBC1, Speed talked enthusiastically about his team’s improving fortunes and his hopes for success in World Cup qualifying matches next year.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Presenter Dan Walker, who spent four hours on and off camera with him, said: ‘He was as bubbly as I’ve known him. He was talking about his kids, how they were really coming on, and talking about playing golf next week.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘Even small things like how he’d just got into Twitter. It’s awful to think someone who was so gifted and so well liked with the rest of his life to look forward to has been cruelly removed. He was in such a good mood about the show and said he’d love to come back before Christmas.’</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A book of remembrance was opened at the FAW headquarters in Cardiff and hundreds queued up to sign it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Speed's assistant manager Raymond Verheijen said his boss was 'adored' by Wales stars such as Gareth Bale, Craig Bellamy and Aaron Ramsey.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: 'I remember him as a beautiful person, a very stable person full of energy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Every time he stepped into a room he energised the place. You could see the players adored him. They really looked up to him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He was the perfect example of practise what you preach and the players really followed him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'When we sat down with one player for individual talks you could how open the players were to listen to his advice.'</span></p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I spoke to him yesterday and we were laughing and joking – he was saying make sure you don’t get a (mark of) two off Craig (Revel Horwood, the Strictly judge) tonight. That’s what Gary’s like – he always thinks about other people.</span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">‘As my captain when I was a young boy in the squad, he’d come to me and I could go to him with my problems.’ <br></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Speed’s former Newcastle United teammate Shay Given, who attended a charity fundraising fashion event with him in May, was seen in floods of tears on television as a minute’s silence was held at Swansea City’s match against Given’s team Aston Villa.</span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Thousands of fans sang Welsh hymns and joined in the chant ‘there’s only one Gary Speed’.</span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">At Anfield, Liverpool’s Welsh star Craig Bellamy asked not to play against Manchester City after hearing the news.</span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Speed, who was awarded an MBE in the 2010 Birthday Honours, retired from playing only last year after winning 85 caps for his country.</span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">He represented Leeds United, Everton, Newcastle and Bolton Wanderers during his long career.</span></span><span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Both Speed’s parents were from Chester but he was born in the Welsh border town of Mancot and was always proud to represent his country. His father Roger played football for Wrexham before returning to his trade as a joiner.</span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Speed made his league debut for Leeds United in May 1989 and was a member of the team which went on to win the league title in 1992.</span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">He was a familiar face in his home village and at the Grosvenor Arms pub in nearby Aldford.</span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Neighbour Stephen Smith, 36, said: ‘It is such a shock. I’m an Everton season ticket holder and shouted his name from the terraces at Goodison Park.’</span></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Helen Hewitt, who has a cottage near Speed’s mansion, said: ‘I  cannot believe it. He was such a  lovely man.</span></span></p>
              <p><span>
              </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: normal;">
              </span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">‘Parcels would be delivered  for him here and he would come and collect them. <br></span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">‘He would always wave from his big, black Jaguar car.’</span></p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Despite having limited experience as a manager, Gary Speed’s impact on the Welsh national team had been dramatic</span></p>
