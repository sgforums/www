              <h1 class="titlestory">Unfair to judge me on silverware – Liverpool’s Benitez</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> boss Rafael Benitez says it is unfair to judge him on a lack of trophies.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard believes during his tenure at Anfield that the Reds have
              enjoyed success even though it has not come in silverware form,
              however, he does admit that the number one goal has to be obtaining
              these desirable awards.</p>
              <p>Since Benitez took over, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> have won the European Champions League (2004/05), the FA Cup (2006) and
              the FA Community Shield (2006) and he pointed out that in the seasons
              they didn’t win things, they still performed very well.</p>
              <p>"This club has to win trophies, that is clear," said the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> manager.</p>
              <p>"But it's not fair to judge us simply on silverware when you
              consider we got to the Champions League final in Athens two years ago
              and then finished second in the league with 86 points last season.</p>
              <p>"We broke our <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> points record, but some people will still say 'oh, no trophies'. We got to Athens, but people may still say 'oh, no trophies'.</p>
              <p>"The three years since we won the FA Cup haven't been too bad.
              Yes, it has to be better because we have to win trophies, but you
              cannot put <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> in the same category as some of the other clubs that have not been winning trophies in that time.</p>
              <p>"When you are up near the top of the table and reaching the final of
              the Champions League, maybe it's not as bad as some people may think
              when you simply talk about trophies.</p>
              <p>"If you want to win things you first have to have a good team and then be consistent.</p>
              <p>"Finishing at the top of the table and reaching the latter
              stages of the Champions League each year - finals, semi-finals,
              quarter-finals - means we are consistent. That is the main thing for
              the future if we want to win trophies."</p>

              <p>well, the only thing that is still supporting him is the Sliverware - UCL.</p>
              <p>I think many will tend to agree if I say that in the tenture as Pool's manager, he did not really make Pool better. Maybe last season was his best chance.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>so how many years u proposed that a manager be given? I do not think Rafa has been given a fair crack of the whip by the owners anyway. Is he a bad manager? No he isnt. He has of course not given what we Liverpool fans wanted but I do not think his reign has been a bad one. I am confident if right from the start, he was given what he wanted, he would have done much better. But I looked around and honestly he is still better than most of the managers available now. So how many years are a benchmark? If it is Tohairi Pajian, I would not even give him one day. But Rafa, give him a couple more years, I still believe in him.</p></div>

              <p>I think we have to look at it this way. Rafa may have done well for Pool at the begainning of his career but clearly it has left him since...</p>
              <p>The thing with managers is, sometimes they are successful but in some cases or most, it doesn't last... History, tells us that even good managers get the sack for some reason or another. And there are many short term successful managers around too...</p>
              <p>I guess sometimes, a manager may lose it or need a break to get back to their best form too, some do manage to get it back but some don't... Kenny Dalglish was a good manager at one time, but then he lost it suddenly and couldn't get it back till today... And I guess many also doubt if he still has the bottle to do it again considering how he bow out time and time again with Pool, Blackburn then Newcastle...</p>
              <p>Bobby Robson is also another one... A good manager but it also didn't last...</p>
              <p>I think one of Rafa's biggest shortcoming is, he can't spot a talent when they haven't fully develop... His purchases have not been impressive at all. His 2005 CL win was achieved by mainly using Gerard Houllier's players... Of the 11 that took the field, only 2 was his own...</p>
              <p>Sometimes the owners must make the serious decision to cut off before it becomes too critical... Roman did the right thing with Scolari last season otherwise, Chelsea could be out of the CL this season...</p>

              <p>Rafa should play with 4-4-2, with gerrard reverting to midfield
              and mascherano as midfield anchor. Torres to partner Kuyt as
              strikers.</p>

              <p>Torres pairing Kuyt as strikers shouldnt be a problem, but rafa should rotate around his strikers though, like Arsene (wenger) did</p>

              <p>Ah Ben believe only in one system - single striker.</p>
              <p>No one is judging him on silverware, or else he should be jobless now.</p>
              <p>Questions are thrown at his player selection, player buy and team tactics.</p>
              <p>Things are basic stuff for a manager.</p>
              <p>The players are not even hungry in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>I see that in Man Utd, Chelsea and Arsenal.</p>
              <p>But, rarely with Liverpool players except Benny and Bellamy.</p>
              <p>Arsenal was without silverware but I can see the improvement in their squad even without any star player buy.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben should learn from Wenger.</p>

              <p>the owner cant afford to sack and pay him and his coaches compensation, so he is safe for now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if he still does not deliver in 1 - 2 seasons the league or CL title, he could be sacked after that. he still have 1-2 seasons to do that. if he doesnt, fair game, resign and let others take over to win.</p>
