              <p>With a December fixture list featuring crunch games against <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a>, there will be no margin for error in the coming weeks.</p>

              <h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">O captain, my captain </span></h2>
              <p>Just when Chelsea need the leadership qualities of their skipper they are hit by the news that John Terry could be sidelined for months. In his absence, who can Ancelotti turn to? Didier Drogba wore the armband against Sunderland and although the striker has plenty of experience, his temperament hardly lends itself to that of on-pitch leader. Other candidates are Ashley Cole and Petr Cech but neither have the commanding character of Terry when it comes to delivering timely rallying cries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">No case for the defence </span></h2>
              <p>Chelsea registered the smallest squad when the summer transfer window closed - just 19 players over 21 - and were always likely to be hardest hit in defence when the injuries began to mount up.</p>
              <p>The loss of Terry with a nerve problem has been compounded by yet another injury for Alex. Branislav Ivanovic has coped well enough with a switch from right back to central defence but the same cannot be said of Paulo Ferreira. Ancelotti speaks highly of Jeffrey Bruma but there are concerns over his physique. Selling Ricardo Carvalho to Real Madrid is already looking like a terrible decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">The kids aren't alright </span></h2>
              <p>What are the results of the millions of pounds spent on Frank Arnesen's youth recruitment drive? Gael Kakuta is out of contract in the summer and there is real doubt over whether he will be offered another. Daniel Sturridge was omitted from the squad which lost to Sunderland and his absence smacks of a player in need of a wake-up call. And Fabio Borini has not featured at all as he stalls over a new deal.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/11/16/article-0-0C121EC0000005DC-223_468x356.jpg" alt="Jaded: Malouda has struggled to recapture his early season form " width="468" height="356">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p>With Drogba only now recovering from malaria, Nicolas Anelka looking jaded and Florent Malouda struggling to recapture his early-season form, Ancelotti needs one of his young strikers to step up rather than always having to rely on Salomon Kalou in his hour of need.</p>
              <p>Ironically, the most promising talent appears to be midfielder Josh McEachran, 17, who has been at the club since he was eight, long before Arnesen joined Chelsea.</p>

              <h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lame Lampard </span><br></h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Missing since the end of August with a groin injury, Lampard looked set to feature against Sunderland after he returned to training with the group at the start of last week. But by the end of the week he was in pain again. He trained yesterday with those not on international duty but Chelsea are not prepared to risk him.</p>
              <p>The impact of his absence has been softened by the form of John Mikel Obi and the return to fitness of Michael Essien. The Ghana international was sorely missed against Sunderland after suspension and will be again against Birmingham and Newcastle. Doubts remain over whether Ramires has the necessary frame for the Premier League while Zhirkov struggles to fit into a three-man midfield.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2><span style="color: #0000ff;">It's a shame about Ray </span><br></h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ancelotti prides himself on his relationship with the squad so the shock departure of Ray Wilkins will not have too great an effect, especially given how popular the Italian is.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti is also a coach first and foremost so training will not have been that much different. But the ruthless manner in which Wilkins was axed has certainly had an effect on dressing-room morale.</p>
              <p>Senior players were stunned when they heard how he was given his marching orders midway through a reserve-team game. As Terry said: 'Ray was great to have around. He would always pick you up when you were down.' A handy person to call upon after a 3-0 home defeat to Sunderland, for example.</p>

              <p>I, along with some others, always felt Chelsea had an easy early season set of fixtures, banging in 4 to 6 goals each match like nobodies business, they were runaway leaders in the league and immediately billed as favourites... So I guess confidence must have been really high enough for one of their player to think the title could be won by Christmas...</p>
              <p>But now is where the real tough fixtures comes into play... So far, they have already lost 2 in Nov and the last 2 away matches won't be easy either... and without Essien, it probably be a bit more difficult... What awaits them in Dec won't be easy too, at least they got 3 home matches though...</p>
              <p>All the current problem needs is another injury to Cech and I belief they could be seriously damage... That guy alone is doing a lot for them right now... His form has return and I felt he has saved them a few points over the last few matches.</p>
              <p>I am thinking, maybe Chelsea could lose their top spot before Christmas rather than seal the title by then... Let's see what happens from here on, gunners pushing really hard now...</p>

              <p>Chelsea had said: "Further to the Chelsea medical team's diagnosis, the Brazilian national team doctors agree that further investigation via arthroscopic surgery is required on the player's right knee. That will take place over the coming days." Yet despite this, he subsequently warmed up at the Khalifa International Stadium before taking his place on the bench.</p>
              <p>Mano Menezes, the Brazil head coach, however claimed that there was agreement with Chelsea to use Alex. "We have good relations and agreed we'd only use him for a few minutes at most," he said.</p>
              <p>In the event, Alex was not brought on and so avoided any danger of further aggravating the injury.</p>
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti, the Chelsea head coach, nevertheless still faces a crisis in defence. John Terry, the captain, flew to Italy today to see a specialist regarding a nerve problem in his right leg that may rule him out for the foreseeable future.</p>
              <p>"I'm at my wits' end," he said. "I know I won't play on Saturday against Birmingham City, but beyond that there are no clues. It could be weeks, it could be months."</p>
              <p>Alongside Alex and Terry, Ashley Cole was unable to play for England in tonight's friendly against France at Wembley, due to his ongoing ankle problem. And, with the sale of Ricardo Carvalho to Real Madrid in the summer, Branislav Ivanovic and Paulo Ferreira are the only senior defenders currently definitely available for the trip to Birmingham at the weekend.</p>
              <p>If Alex and Terry are confirmed as long-term casualties then Ancelotti may be forced to sign at least one experienced central defender in the January transfer window.</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry has been told the nerve problem in his right leg is not related to his previous back problem. </strong></p>
              <p>Terry has seen four specialists, including a team in Italy, in an attempt to solve the mystery injury, which has now dragged on for seven months.</p>
              <p>And he will return to Italy next week for further treatment, as <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> face up to a growing injury crisis, with centre half Alex also needing surgery.</p>
              <p>Yet Terry, 29, insisted he cannot afford to be rushed back, after leaving it until the pain became unbearable before seeking treatment.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I will get back as quickly as I can but there was no point going to these lengths if I then return before I am ready. I need to sort this out once and for all.</p>
              <p>'I saw a specialist in London yesterday, which was encouraging and I will go back to him today. Then I will travel to Italy again next week for further treatment. I have been given some new ideas to try, so we shall see.</p>

              <p>'I have read reports that I will be playing as early as next Saturday, but that is a bit premature. We do not know enough yet to make any estimates about my return. The good news is that none of the specialists believe it is related to the back injury, so now we go from there.'</p>
