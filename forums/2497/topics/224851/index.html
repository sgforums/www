The search for a successor is now underway in order that a new manager can be in place ahead of the January transfer window.<br><br>First Team Coach Kevin Keen will take temporary charge of team affairs until a new appointment has been made.<br><br>No further statements on this matter will be made by the Club before that time.Â”<br><br></div>
