Just seven days after backing their boss, the clubÂ’s Icelandic owners wielded the axe and last night approached Alan Curbishley to become their new manager. WiganÂ’s Paul Jewell is also in the frame but Sven Goran Eriksson appears to be slipping out of the running.<br><br>Owners  Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson and Eggert Magnusson hope to hold talks with former Charlton boss Curbishley within the next 24 hours. But it is understood Curbishley has major concerns over the influence of West HamÂ’s Icelandic owners and the fact they might interfere.<br><br>Gudmundsson and Magnusson, who gave Pardew just four games in charge after buying the club, also rate Terry Venables and Croatian boss Slaven Bilic.<br><br>They have also talked about bringing in a major name from abroad such as Guus Hiddink Â— currently on a big-money deal with Russia Â— or German Ottmar Hitzfeld.<br><br>SaturdayÂ’s 4-0 defeat at Bolton was the last straw and Pardew was fired yesterday morning.<br><br>Pardew had also lost some of the dressing room and suffered a series of bust-ups with players. These included Anton Ferdinand, Shaun Newton, Yossi Benayoun, Bobby Zamora and Javier Mascherano.<br><br>Kia Joorabchian, who owns the rights to Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez and who failed in his West Ham takeover bid, hopes Curbishley will join the club. He said: Â“I believe Alan Curbishley is the best man for the job and the man who can get them out of trouble.<br><br>Â“I think Carlos and Javier would be pleased if Curbs came in. He has a good track record and will instil confidence.Â” Curbishley will be offered Â£1million a year in wages.<br><br>Meanwhile, the clubÂ’s Icelandic owners are due to have a meeting with the team today. Yesterday, Pardew gave a speech to them after training before clearing his desk. In a statement, he said: Â“I am proud of my achievements at West Ham United.<br><br>Â“When I took the helm they were in the Championship and struggling to find direction. Â“In two consecutive seasons we qualified for the play-off final, ultimately achieving the Premiership status the club so richly deserve.Â”<br><br></div>

Kevin Keen, the assistant manager, takes temporary charge.<br><br>Following internal discussions between the Icelanders on Sunday, Magnusson informed the 45-year-old Pardew of his belief that the players were no longer responding to his management. The league position - which, if translated into relegation, threatens the future viability of the investment - rendered change a necessity.<br><br>Curbishley's suitability for that role is enhanced by his track record as a manager capable of almost guaranteeing Premiership survival. Born locally in Canning Town and a former West Ham player, Curbishley would also satisfy the stated desire to have an English spine to the team.<br><br>But he will be under pressure to deliver on the pitch. Magnusson had stated on his first day as West Ham's chairman that Pardew's "throat will be cut" with bad results, rendering yesterday's announcement a matter of time.<br><br></div>
