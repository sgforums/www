              Ronaldinho holds Madrid in Milan 
               
              MILAN - AC Milan striker Alexandre Pato was controversially denied a winning goal in the 1-1 home draw with Real Madrid in Champions League Group C on Tuesday.
              
              Striker Karim Benzema put the dominant Spanish side ahead on 29 minutes when he squeezed a close-range effort under Dida, who had first parried a shot from former Milan playmaker Kaka.
              
              Milan, level at the top with Real on seven points from four games, equalised 10 minutes before the break through Ronaldinho's thumping penalty after Pepe slid in on Gianluca Zambrotta and was harshly adjudged to have handled.
              
              Moments later the home side had the ball in the net again but Pato, who scored twice in Milan's 3-2 win at the Bernabeu last month, had his goal ruled out for another debateable handball as he brought down a high pass.
              
              The Brazilian did not protest but an almost full San Siro roared with anger at the officials.
              
              "These things happen. I always believe in the good intentions of the referee," Milan's Brazilian coach Leonardo told a news conference, partly in fluent Spanish.
              
              "It seemed to me it was a normal goal while for the penalty you could say that it was right to give it.
              
              "We are getting better, each game we improve a bit."

              <p><strong>KAKA APPLAUDED</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The visitors had much the better of the early exchanges, Benzema going close twice and strike partner Gonzalo Higuain scuffing one of several other good chances for Real.</p>
              <p>When Milan finally imposed themselves on the game, Pato wasted a decent opportunity and midfielder Massimo Ambrosini headed over before Dida pulled off two fine late saves.</p>
              <p>"We played a good first half with a good attitude, we had 16 shots," Real coach Manuel Pellegrini said, refusing to answer questions about the referee.</p>
              <p>"We had a lot of control of the game but second half it was a bit more complicated. At the end there were a couple of chances to get the three points which we would have deserved."</p>
              <p>Kaka, who joined Real from Milan in the close season, was given a warm welcome back with the crowd applauding him and several banners being unveiled thanking him for his six years with the Rossoneri.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian, the inspiration behind Milan's last trophy when they won the 2007 Champions League, had another fairly quiet game and was often muscled off the ball by Ambrosini.</p>
              <p>Real left out Raul, level with Gerd Mueller on a record 66 goals in the three main European club competitions while fellow European maestro Filippo Inzaghi also started on the bench for Milan.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ronaldinho</span></span> cancelled out Karim Benzema's opener for <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Real Madrid</span></span> in the Champions League clash.</abbr></abbr></p>
              <p>“It was wonderful, just as I expected it to be. I had such great moments at San Siro and this too was another emotional night. I thank all the fans for that gift, said <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Kaka</span></span>.</abbr></p>
              <p>“It wasn’t easy to deal with so many emotions, but I did prepare for it and knew it was going to be tough. I tried to keep those feelings in check and focus on my football.”</p>
              <p>There was some controversy before his arrival, as striker Marco Borriello was quoted as saying he thought <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Kaka</span></span> had lost some of his technique since moving to Madrid.</abbr></p>
              <p>“I went to the Milan locker room before kick-off and joked about it. He said that wasn’t what he meant, these things are stirred up by the media. It wasn’t a problem,” grinned the Brazilian on <em>Sky Italia television</em>.</p>
              <p>Real have been hammered by the media lately, but <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Kaka</span></span> can see light at the end of the tunnel.</abbr></p>
              <p>“The pressure is the same, the expectation to always win. I had a good start, recently things have been bad for everyone in the team, but we are getting back on track.</p>
              <p>“In these last two games against Getafe and Milan there have been significant improvements. Before when we won it was mainly down to individual moments, but now we are seeing the team unit come together.</p>
              <p>“It’s not enough to just buy lots of stars in order to win.”</p>

              <p>well, I am not so sure that selling your best player is the best way to help a club.</p>
              <p>cause the club still has to function and win games, so if they can settle some of their debts, and end up losing more games or not going into latter stages of important cup matches which may spin more money, it is not going to help long term. Furthermore, what about Shirt sales, endorsement and etc.</p>
              <p>Hence, for a player to leave a club for another,  yes, maybe, they may want to help their former club, but don't tell me, they don't yearn for something else.So not sure about this, going to another club to help the former club theory.</p>

              <p>There are alot of things that is more important than money

              <p>Selling him was the best option...AC Milan still has alot of
                  good players anyway but no one can fetch near the price of

              <p>well, true. Forget, TV rights, without the big stars, less money would come into the League, and ur team will suffer as a result, also.. seems more minus than plus to me.</p>
              <p>anyway,I still struggle to understand the logic of selling your only superstar so as to propel your team forward.. To me, it is like giving your best motor to your competitor, and saying your ship will still move faster.</p>
              <p>anyway, it is just me.</p>

              <p>Not now...at least wait until Rafa leave first...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think Rafa purposely and secretly hoping to get sacked...Real Madrid is certainly interested in his service. If he resign, then no payout...got lots of payout if he get sacked.</p>

              <p>houllier la..i know, but Liverpool in general mah.</p>
              <p>Bellamy is good, but erratic and like one report said, "put him in a room, and he may end up fighting with himself".</p>
              <p>Defoe is good, but seemingly, like a Andy Cole, once on big stages, becomes suspect leh. Just my thoughts.</p>
