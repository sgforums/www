              <p><strong>Arsenal defender Mikael Silvestre has only a 50:50 chance of
              featuring against his former side Manchester United in Wednesday’s
              Champions League semi-final first leg, according to manager Arsene
              Wenger.</strong></p>
              <p>Silvestre, who joined Arsenal from United in August after spending
              nine years at Old Trafford, was poised to start the European encounter
              but suffered a back spasm against Middlesbrough and is now a doubt
              after being removed at half-time of Sunday's 2-0 win.</p>
              <p>With William Gallas and Gael Clichy on the injured list, news of
              Silvestre’s problem is unwelcome for Wenger who must also wait to see
              how Johan Djourou reacts to his appearance as a substitute before
              assessing the defender’s availability for Wednesday’s game.</p>
              <p>Djourou was making his comeback from a knee problem and if both he
              and Silvestre are sidelined then Alex Song could be asked to step into
              defence alongside Kolo Toure.</p>
              <p>“Djourou’s knee was not 100 per cent but he came through – I will decide that on Tuesday or Wednesday,” said Wenger.</p>
              <p>“Djourou came through the game well we will have to see how he responds tomorrow.</p>
              <p>“I believe the only serious problem we have from today is Silvestre, he has a back spasm. He is a 50:50 [for Old Trafford].”</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor returned to the side against Boro having shrugged
              off a hamstring problem but Robin van Persie will be absent for the
              trip to Old Trafford as he is currently suffering from a groin strain.</p>
              <p>In the absence of the Dutchman, Cesc Fabregas will likely assume an
              advanced role in behind Adebayor so Wenger was naturally relieved to
              see that a strong challenge from Boro midfielder Stewart Downing did
              not inflict an injury on his captain and inspiration.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard, who recently returned from a three-and-a-half-month
              absence due to a knee injury, scored twice at Emirates Stadium and is
              expected to be fit to play a crucial role at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Wenger added: “He told me it was the knee that he had before and we
              don’t like that. But he told me after the game that the ankle is worse
              than the knee so it’s not too bad.</p>
              <p>“The referee told me he played the ball, Downing told me that as
              well. But he didn’t play only the ball. It’s always difficult to say if
              it’s intentional or not, if it is to aggravate or not.</p>
              <p>“He gets sharper and sharper in every game. He was out for three
              months and you don’t come back at your best straight away. But now he
              gets better in every game.</p>
              <p>“Every player who plays in midfield, who thinks they are creative
              and offensive, needs to score goals. That happened to him today and
              that’s important.</p>
              <p>“Usually Fabregas plays deeper with Nasri higher. I wanted to test
              how it would work the other way round. It could be reiterated that we
              will do it again because it was quite convincing. But that is open; we
              have 48 hours to study that then make a decision.”</p>
