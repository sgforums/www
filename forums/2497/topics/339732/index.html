              <h1>Manchester United prepare £40 million deal for Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
              <h2>Manchester United are reported to have opened talks for a new £40 million deal to keep Cristiano Ronaldo at the club for the next five years.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01175/ronaldo_ferguson_1175443c.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo - Manchester United prepare £40 million deal for Cristiano Ronaldo" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Reeling him in: Alex Ferguson is doing everything he can to tie Cristiano Ronaldo down at Manchester United</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The 23-year-old arrived at Old Trafford on Friday evening for a meeeting to discuss what, should a deal be done, would become the biggest deal in the club's history.</strong></p>
              <p>United have been trying to secure Ronaldo's future since the summer-long saga linking him to Real Madrid ended.</p>
              <p>According to the Express, Ronaldo met with Sir Alex Ferguson and chief executive David Gill. After two hours of discussions, Ferguson is said to have left in an "upbeat mood", giving Ronaldo and Gill the chance to talk alone.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo is currently paid £120,000 a week but should a new deal be struck an extra £30,000 could be added to that, putting him on £8 million a year.</p>
              <p>Despite pledging his future to United when Real talks subsided, it seems Ferguson is not happy to take any chances on Ronaldo's current contract which still has three years to run. The Scot is all too aware that Madrid are prepared to spend as much as £50 million on the winger and so ensuring another five years would end all chances of any similar speculation in the near future.</p>

              <p>yep, he is good but not great yet.. but the money is to tie his future down.</p>
              <p>maybe till he is 27/8? I think that's great investment if Ronaldo goes on to improve.</p>
              <p>Yes, Maradona is one in a lifetime player, but hey, MU has Ronaldo now, and they should go all they can to keep him given vultures are circling.</p>

              <p><br>There is nothing bias to it at all... There is a big difference to what you are referring to here... The $40m in question in his weekly salary for the next 5 yrs. Whereas the $28m you mentioned is suppose to be a transfer fee. So it doesn't mean after paying the $28m, you don't need to pay his $80 to $90 thousand weekly salary...</p>

              <p>Well, if you compare him to Robinho, Kaka, Terry, Lampard, Ballack, Henry, or even Shevchenko, then he is right at the bottom of it.</p>
              <p>I agree with you that if a club want to pay really big money for him, they should take the money but not at the moment cos he still has 6, 7 more yrs at the top... Therefore selling him now would be a mistake. It should be a better time to sell him in another 2 to 4 yrs, It will still be big money.</p>
              <p>Although Maradona did help his club turn into champions, there are others as well. Ronaldo himself is one such player as much as others don't want to give him the credit for whatever reasons... But I dare say that had it not been for him, and his 42 goals, United wouldn't have beaten Chelsea to the title or even the Champions League last season.</p>
              <p>I find paying him $150k per week is correct, cos he deserved it. We look around and see players like Lampard on $150k, Terry very close to it as well, Kaka on $145k, Robinho on $160k, Ballack and Shev on $130k... Ronaldo is definitely worth the $150k or maybe even more...</p>
              <p>Ronaldo is good and he really is that good otherwise he wouldn't win all the awards at the same time...  </p>
