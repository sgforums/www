              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has warned that </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong>'s frugal approach in the transfer market could last another 20 years.</strong></p>
              <p>The manager has repeatedly had to defend the club's cost-conscious approach while the trophy cabinet remains bare and has now said there is no way out in the foreseeable future.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's move to Emirates Stadium has saddled them with a debt of £239 million and annual payments of £20m on a 'mortgage' which is not due to be paid off until 2031.</p>
              <p>They are generating profits in other parts of the club's business but the problem is stretching an annual wage bill which had already reached £110.7m by the end of last season.</p>
              <p>'Yes, the wage bill approach will stay the same until the stadium is paid off,' said Wenger. 'But when it is we can go a bit higher. We can never be dominant in the transfer market because it is never just the money you spend to buy players, it is the wages as well.'</p>
              <p>They made £56m overall in the year to May and have cleared all debts unrelated to the stadium, but profits from the football operation are expected to drop.</p>
              <p>So free signings, such as Marouane Chamakh, and the focus on youth are here to stay.</p>
              <p>Wenger believes they will take what would be a 'significant' step forward by winning at Chelsea today and has urged his players to forget their neighbours' acknowledged superiority.</p>
              <p>'I don't believe in history,' said Wenger, aware Arsenal have beaten <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> just twice in their last 15 meetings.</p>
              <p>Wenger has just served a touchline ban but claims he was just unlucky to be caught.</p>
              <p>'In the 14 years I have been here and walked up and down the corridors I have seen people who have lost it much more than that.</p>
              <p>'It depends if you are caught on camera or not.'</p>
              <p>So was Harry Redknapp right when he said the studious Arsenal boss has been driven nuts by life in the Premier League?</p>
              <p>'Frankly, no,' said Wenger. 'I was already passionately crazy about football and that has not changed. All managers are mad.'</p>
