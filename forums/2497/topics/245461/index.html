            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"> Charlton boss Alan Pardew insists there was nothing 'irregular' about Darren Bent's non-appearance for England in their last two European Championship qualifying games.<br><br>The 23-year-old striker was a noticeable absentee from Steve McClaren's squad that travelled to Israel and Barcelona, for the Andorra clash, having been withdrawn after aggravating a knee problem.<br><br>Bent has subsequently been declared fit for Charlton's vital Premiership clash with Wigan at the weekend, in a turn of events that has manifest the odd whisper that club commitments were being put first.<br><br>Pardew, though, is refusing to be drawn into any such debate and is adamant in his stance that there was nothing suspicious about his player's unavailability.<br><br>"I do not really care if it looks suspicious, really, because it is just not true," said the Charlton boss.<br><br>"Darren was injured and you are talking about the highest level of football here and you need to be 100 per cent right.<br><br>"There was nothing going on that was irregular in any shape or form.<br><br>"Steve McClaren and I had a long discussion about it on the phone, and he had a chat with Darren. I left it up to them and they came to their own conclusion."<br><br>While Pardew claims Bent was in no way ready in terms of his fitness to play international football, he is firmly of the opinion that were circumstances different, then his striker would have shone on the highest stage.<br><br>"I just think he would make a difference to any team," he concluded. "Darren is a top player and he is going to get better as well.<br><br>"He has been a great character in training and is a natural goalscorer, a Premiership goalscorer." </span></div>
