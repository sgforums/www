              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>West Ham United</strong></span><strong>'s Dean Ashton is expected to confirm today that he is retiring because of an ankle injury. The 26-year-old striker has struggled to recover from an injury he first suffered on England duty in August 2006 following a training-ground tackle with Shaun Wright-Phillips.</strong></p>
              <p>It was reported last night that Ashton is looking into whether he can take legal action against Wright-Phillips and Chelsea, for whom the winger – now with Manchester City – was then playing.</p>
              <p>Chelsea would challenge any such case given that the tackle was made while Wright-Phillips was with England.</p>
              <p>Ashton returned the following year to play again for West Ham and went on to win his sole England cap in 2008 but the ankle injury recurred last season and he has been advised by the surgeon who performed the original operation, Niek van Dijk, that he risks rendering himself permanently unable to walk should he continue playing football.</p>
              <p>Ashton moved to Upton Park from Norwich City in January 2006 for £7.25m. West Ham have been examining whether they are able to launch a compensation claim of around £7m against the Football Association.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DEAN ASHTON quit football yesterday and admitted: I'll never be able to run again.</h2>
              <p class="article">The former West Ham and England striker opened his heart to SunSport in an exclusive emotion-charged interview.</p>
              <p class="article">Ashton, 26, said: "It's a rubbish situation. I just want to be able to walk properly and, at the moment, I cannot. "My health is obviously more important than football. I was told if I kept trying to play football, I might never walk again.</p>
              <p class="article">"I am going to hospital on Tuesday for a fifth operation. "It's unlikely I will ever be able to jog again but right now, I can't walk properly. "My left ankle is still very sore. It will be a while before I feel OK and get over this disappointment. "There is a bit of bitterness and I think 'Why me?'. It's a sad part of football."</p>
              <p class="article">Ashton gave up his fight to play again after failing to recover from an ankle injury caused by Shaun Wright- Phillips on England duty in August 2006. Ashton, a £7.25million signing from Norwich in January 2006, realised his career was over when he broke down again in training last August.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "I was never the same, I was always in pain." West Ham are now looking to claim off the FA's insurers. Ashton is looking at other avenues of compensation from the FA's insurers as they, along with Chelsea, who Wright-Phillips played for at the time, could be liable.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DEAN ASHTON has always been a quiet and private man who displays little emotion. </h2>
              <p class="article">So when the West Ham striker broke down in tears at the club's Chadwell Heath training ground, his team-mates realised the severity of his ankle injury. </p>
              <p class="article">Ashton's career was at an end. This talented striker, just 26, should have been preparing for next summer's World Cup. </p>
              <p class="article">Instead he will never play football again and, speaking from his home in the Essex countryside yesterday, he admitted he has yet to come to terms with that fact. </p>
              <p class="article">Four months after aborting his final attempt at a recovery, Ashton's only concern is whether he will be able to walk properly.</p>
              <p class="article">He was unable to jump properly and even had to change the way he kicked a ball with his left foot.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "After missing a whole year, I started last season with two goals against Wigan and thought I was getting there. But I started getting a new, funny feeling which then became worse. I knew I was going to need a third operation. </p>
              <p class="article">"I had the op at the end of September and still had hope. I then started getting another different feeling. I went over to Holland to see a specialist. He said that I had a bit of bone rubbing against my tendon and would need another op. My fourth. </p>
              <p class="article">"In August of this year, I tried to join in with the first team. I went to do a jog around the pitch but at the end of second lap, I was struggling. The noise coming from my joint was terrible. </p>
              <p class="article">"Kieron Dyer thought it was my boots making the noise. I went to the side and was crying on the floor. This was the second time I'd broken down in tears. </p>
              <p class="article">"I knew this was it. Definitely. My last chance had gone. </p>
              <p class="article">"I was finished. The lads were all shocked and saddened to see me like that.</p>
              <p class="article">"Generally, I don't show a lot of emotion so it was probably strange to see a big lad like me crying. But I knew that was it. </p>
              <p class="article">"I've not watched much football since then. Just highlights, now and again, to see the goals. I haven't been to Upton Park because while I knew I was retiring, other people didn't and I didn't want to answer questions and lie. </p>
              <p class="article">"I'd like to think I had a chance of making the squad for South Africa but to be honest, I hate thinking about that. </p>
              <p class="article">"I will, of course, watch it and want England to win. I fell in love with football when I watched Gary Lineker at the 1990 World Cup. </p>
              <p class="article">"The delay over these last few months was due to myself and West Ham sorting out all the technicalities of me retiring. </p>
              <p class="article">"I'd like to thank West Ham for all the time they have spent on me and the fans have been terrific. I'm sad I could not get back and play in front of them."</p>

              <p>Ya this is damn sad... Dean Ashton to me is a talented striker, with both a powerful shot and good heading ability. He was quite highly rated. It is damn sad to see him retiring at only 26 yrs old.</p>
              <p>Dean Ashton would have easily got into the england team ahead of defoe crouch and maybe even heskey.</p>
              <p>If Ashton was injured while the england team was preparing for a major WC qualifier then, FA has the right to win the case since it was an important match. However, if it was just another of those unless friendly, then it is really damn sad for someone to have his ankle broken and injured so badly.</p>
              <p>It just damn sad for him. Not say that he is 30 or 29, but just 26, at the peak of his career and he has to call time on it, then its terribly disheartening.</p>
              <p>I hope Ashton can recover from his and i wish his future the very best.</p>
