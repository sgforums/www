            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Players told Mour to sign Micah</strong></span><br><br>JOSE MOURINHO had to be persuaded by his senior players that Micah Richards is good enough to play for Chelsea.<br><br>Blues boss Mourinho has been monitoring the Manchester City defender for a year Â— and tried to buy him last summer. City refused ChelseaÂ’s Â£6million offer but it was MourinhoÂ’s England internationals who told him the 18-year-old was worth having Â— now put at a monster Â£18m.<br><br>Richards made his full England debut against Holland in Amsterdam last month and Mourinho canvassed the opinion of John Terry, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Joe Cole about him on their return.<br><br>He received glowing reports and was told Richards is the real deal. For Richards, the prospect of becoming an instant first-choice for the champions and making his name at Stamford Bridge could be too great a temptation to resist.<br><br>The youngsterÂ’s family and advisors have been wary of ChelseaÂ’s interest, having seen Shaun Wright-Phillips take the same path from Manchester only to end up on the bench. But Mourinho has made it clear Richards will deputise for Terry in central defence and then solve his problem right-back position for the rest of the season.<br><br>Part of the allure for Richards is the promise he will be groomed as a central defender to become a long-term partner for Terry. Playing alongside the England captain, still only 26, will surely see him become a regular for his country far quicker than he might imagine. Â“International managers are very keen on good partnerships all the way through the centre of a team.<br><br>Â“You have less time to work with players at international level so anyone who has an understanding with another player at club level has an instant advantage.Â”<br><br></div>
