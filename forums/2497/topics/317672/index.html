              <h2>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has hit back at waves of criticism
              calling for Emmanuel Eboue to be dropped from the side, and
              particularly, the midfield.</h2>
              <p>Eboue, traditionally a right-back, has been deployed in right wing for
              much of the season, to the behest of many Arsenal fans and pundits.<br><br>While
              there have been calls for youngster Theo Walcott to permanently take up
              the position or for a new signing to be brought in, many have
              maintained that Eboue does not make the grade in that position,
              particularly due to his lack of offensive contribution to the team.<br><br>Wenger,
              however, has refuted the claims that Eboue is useless for the team,
              reminding all that his side are still a potent attacking force even
              with the Cote d'Ivoire international on the right flank, insisting it
              is done for the balance of the team.<br><br>"If you look at the number
              of goals we scored you will see we are near the top of the League. A
              team is first of all a balance, that's why I am not a fan of going into
              any individual case," explained Wenger.<br><br>"You don't always play a
              player because he scores goals, you play him because he gives you a
              balance to the team. We play in a very attacking style and Eboue gives
              us defensive balance." <br><br>The Arsenal boss compared Eboue to Ray
              Parlour, who was a key component in Arsenal's midfield in previous
              years. However, while the Romford Pele, as he was known, did play in
              right wing, more often than not he was deployed centrally, alongside
              Patrick Vieira, with Fredrik Ljungberg and Robert Pires occupying the
              wing slots, so whether the Professor's analysis is quite true to life
              is another matter.<br><br>"Ray Parlour did not score many goals on the
              right side of midfield," noted the Frenchman. "You look at the numbers
              and you will be surprised but for me he was a great player for Arsenal
              Football Club. <br><br>"You can not only go on the goals and assists,
              you must look at the efficiency of the whole team. That's why Ray
              Parlour was a great player for us and why Eboue helps us too. <br><br>"What
              counts is how many goals a team scores as a unit and how many chances
              we create. On that front we can compete with everybody in the League."</p>
