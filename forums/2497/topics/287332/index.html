            <div class='col-md body'>The defender spent five years at Chelsea before his bitterly-disputed move to the Emirates in part-exchange for Ashley Cole.<br><br>And the Frenchman says he has never experienced such thrilling football since becoming the captain of manager Arsene WengerÂ’s young entertainers.<br><br>On the eve of tonightÂ’s home Champions League qualifier against Slavia Prague, Gallas said: Â“We are playing better football than any other team I have ever been a part of.<br><br>Â“Different to Chelsea? Yes, itÂ’s better. I am very happy to be playing for Arsenal.<br><br>Â“When I was watching from the stands during my recent injuries, I was really surprised how we played and was so happy for the team. I was just like a kid.<br><br>Â“When we didnÂ’t score I would stand up with the other supporters and shout. Watching the kids beating Newcastle in the Carling Cup by playing great football made me realise that our squad is very strong.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t remember ever being like that at Chelsea. I didnÂ’t go to watch many games there.Â”<br><br>Gallas, 30, won the Premier League twice under old Blues boss Jose Mourinho and reached two Champions League semi-finals.<br><br>He is still in touch with some of his old West London team-mates.<br><br>He admitted: Â“I donÂ’t want to say too much about their situation Â— but I do think they have been affected by what has happened with Mourinho.Â”<br><br>But he is more concerned about ArsenalÂ’s prospects. He said: Â“It is very important to win something this season. We definitely have to do that.<br><br>Â“We are winning game after game and all the young players in the squad are starting to believe we can do something. If we donÂ’t win anything, then thereÂ’s no point.<br><br>Â“At Arsenal we have played some great football but we could still win nothing. It is more important to win a trophy and show our strength to everyone in that way.<br><br>Â“All the teams want to beat Arsenal so we have to fight and improve in every game.Â”<br><br>Gallas was WengerÂ’s surprise choice to inherit the captainÂ’s armband from Thierry Henry in the summer Â— and the French international is thriving on the challenge. He said: Â“I am really enjoying the extra responsibility.<br><br>Â“Most of the players are younger than me but they donÂ’t make me feel old. That means IÂ’m still young! IÂ’ve had strong words with them when itÂ’s been needed. ThatÂ’s my job.<br><br>Â“The players might not agree with me but there are times when we need to speak and say what is wrong.Â”<br><br>GallasÂ’ return from his groin injury means further frustration for Brazilian Gilberto Silva, who will be back on the bench for tonightÂ’s game against the Czech league leaders. GermanyÂ’s No 1 keeper Jens Lehmann will also have to settle for the bench.<br><br>Wenger revealed: Â“IÂ’ve never had this situation with established internationals unable to get into my team before.<br><br>Â“Gilberto and Lehmann are certainly not happy Â— but their attitude in training has been spot-on and that is where they gain more respect.<br><br>Â“It is unjust to change a team when they are doing well and some other players are having to pay the price for that.<br><br>Â“There is real competition for places and even for a place on our bench. There will be world- class players who will not even be involved against Slavia.Â”<br></div>
