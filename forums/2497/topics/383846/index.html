              <p>The Glazer family are struggling to refinance the massive debts at <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/clubs/manchester-united">Manchester United</a></abbr>, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says the Americans have been trying unsuccessfully to
                                  secure a refinancing package for part of the club’s £699 million debt
                                  for months, having failed in 2007 and last year, because of the bleak
                                  global economic climate.</p>
              <p>Fans’ groups have cast doubt over whether they will ever see the £80 million raised from the sale of <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/players/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a></abbr>, the Portugal forward, to <abbr><a class="glossary-term" href="http://www.tribalfootball.com/category/clubs/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a></abbr> last summer reinvested in the squad.</p>
              <p>The main concern is understood to centre around the £175.5
                                  million worth of debt that the Glazers are personally responsible for,
                                  not the £518.7 million of loans secured against the club.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for the Glazer family said: “We continue to keep
                                  our financial options for the club under review just like any other
                                  business.”  </p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Bayern Munich join doubters of Man Utd finances</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Bayern Munich have joined the doubters of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>'s financial state.</p>
              <p>The <em>Mail on Sunday</em> says Bayern have added to the growing consensus among European clubs that <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> face an imminent financial crisis because of the £700million debt laden on the club by the Glazer family.</p>
              <p>Partizan Belgrade president Dragan Djuric raised the spectre last week
              by suggesting that a lack of funds might be a reason for United's
              failure to follow through on the proposed signing of Serbia Under-21
              midfielder Adem Ljajic, even though United insist it is a decision made
              purely because of the strength of their emerging players.</p>
              <p>But directors at Bayern Munich formed the same impression as
              Djuric in the summer when United made an early inquiry about the
              availability of Bayern winger Franck Ribery.</p>
              <p>Bayern suggested a price in the region of £60million, heard
              nothing more and concluded that United didn't have the money to spend,
              despite the £80m sale of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></abbr>.</p>

              <h1><br></h1>
              <p><strong>No doubt it is true that the recession has bitten hard at Manchester United. Partizan Belgrade president Dragan Djuric suggested as much following the collapse of Adem Ljajic’s £10million transfer, although his club is in greater crisis and signalling that more players will have to be sold in January’s transfer window.</strong></p>
              <p>Bayern Munich, apparently, also concluded that Manchester United were struggling when they asked £60m for Franck Ribery in the summer and heard nothing more.</p>
              <p>In the case of Ribery, however, the explanation could be simply that he was over-rated, over-priced and the fee was always going to fall dramatically once Munich realised greed had cost them the opportunity to sell at a high, yet fair, figure; which is exactly what has happened.</p>

              There are some serious problems at the heart of English football. Debt, despite what Scudamore thinks, is not a good thing. How can there be anything good about millions of pounds in interest vanishing from the game?
              
              Everything is staked on the hope that revenues will continue to rise, but they can't keep going up forever. Sooner or later, people run out of money. Ticket prices go too high, cable subscriptions become too expensive, replica shirts become an unnecessary expense. Football clubs have been ripping off fans for years. It will not last forever and when it ends, we're going to see some fireworks. Leeds will not be the last team to collapse under the weight of their own stupidity.

              </blockquote>
              <p>Debts isn't purely confine to only English clubs my dear friend... The majority of European clubs have it... Even Real Madrid... So its not as what you perceived it to be "serious problems at the heart of English football" </p>
              <p>Valencia, one of the better Spanish club also have huge debt problems... If you compare them to Arsenal and Liverpool then you will know that Pool and Arsenal's problems are not as serious despite having debts of around $300m. Reason being, they are much more profitable to Valencia.</p>
              <p>And not everything is just pin on revenues will continue to rise... Just maintaining current levels is more than enough. Which is not something very difficult to do in the present state for these clubs as sponsorship deals have been signed for the next few years...</p>
              <p>We have seen that even during the financial crises or the economic tsunami, they remain strong. If anything, we are seeing new high in Tv deals being set, new transfer record fees being broken... Bigger sponsorship fees from shirts to other areas being closed... These are all signs of much better days ahead.</p>
              <p>As a businessman, these are good opportunities to get into the game. Cos the future looks bright. And unless something very drastic happens, and I mean very drastic... Example like a war breaks out, and I don't just mean a war like the Iraq one which was already very big, but it still doesn't really effect Europe... So maybe one like a WW3 type, which I belief is still very remote so there shouldn't be too much worry there.</p>
              <p>My personal belief is tickets will continue to raise over the next 5 to 10 years... Even if not for other reasons, inflation alone will make it happen.</p>
              <p>In United's case, it shouldn't be too serious... Like someone mentioned here, if the Glazers cannot pay up, the most they will have to sell it off to someone else at whatever price they can get or the banks will do it for them. And there shouldn't be any lack of takers too, only the price to accept that's all. The reason being due to the proper management over the last 2 decades, it is the most profitable club.</p>
              <p>One thing you must understand is... The current debts isn't incur due to operation but rather due to the owner's purchase of it. So the club being in debts wouldn't frighten serious investors. The worse case if they can't get a single investor, they can always re-list on the stock market or have a few different private shareholders...</p>
              <p>The picture you painted is too gloomy, probably too extreme I would say... Leeds is no longer a good example to be used with United... They live in a different time, Tv deals and revenue was not as it is today, they hardly had a marketing plan back then, or huge sponsorship deals to help support the club and of course a rich owner... Income mainly depended on getting into champions league as gate collection then was very little. And Leeds probably didn't had a proper plan, buying a few very expensive players with high salaries at the same time was the killer blow for them.  </p>
              <p>And lastly, and very unfortunately... I think cable subscriptions will continue to go up in the years to come, new design or colours replica shirts will still sell just like they have been increasing this last few years... Thats just the way it looks to me at least for the next 10 years if no WW3 breaks out.</p>

              <p><br>Hmmm... So did the property price remain as in during the financial crises or are they the same as in 2007 or even better than 2007 now?</p>
              <p>Can I say a property agent told my parents that their home will continue to increase in 1987 as well? Like they purchased their home a 4R flat for $60k then and today its worth $340k? And it have... simply because of inflation. It will continue to happen unless like I have said earlier, a WW3 breaks out...</p>
              <p>Football clubs today are no longer just your plain old football clubs. You cannot compare today to yesteryear's. They are a business entity these days... Much richer investors pump in a lot of money as well in the hope of making too...</p>
              <p>I don't agree that English clubs cannot attract big players... And remember, its a team sport, so having a few star players confine to just 2 clubs out of 20 isn't a healthy or competitive league that would attract interest from the neutrals...</p>
              <p>I have already made plans to leave Starhub and have Mio for the simple reason of next season's EPL. And I also know quite a number of friends have done so as well. Starhub's LaLiga isn't going to stop me from cancelling my subscription with them... And I believed many others will do so too regardless of those star players you seem to think is the reason the league is attractive...</p>
              <p>Really, I believed it's the style and the competitive nature of it where a mid table side or a near bottom side also have a high chance of taking on the top sides is what makes it interesting... Not the one or two star players... Like I used to like watching Ronaldo play but now that he has gone to Laliga, I don't really care to watch him now... I belief its the same with many Pool fans as well with Alonso. I enjoyed watching City v Chelsea much more than I would be with Barch v Real... Honestly...</p>
