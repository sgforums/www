              <h1>City beat Chelsea to sign £32.5m Robinho</h1>
              <h2 id="stand-first">Surprise twist to deadline day as Brazilian breaks British record<br></h2>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/08/31/robinho2.jpg" alt="Robinho" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan -<span style="color: #0000ff;"> £555 billion</span></strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Roman Abramovich -</strong> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">£11.7billion</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester City demonstrated their new-found status as the richest club on the planet when the billionaire Arabs who have bought the club from Thaksin Shinawatra stunned Roman Abramovich late last night by signing Robinho from under the noses of Chelsea.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazilian has cost a British-record £32.5m after a remarkable transfer-deadline day in which Manchester United managed to rush through Dimitar Berbatov's signing on a four year-deal for a fee of £30.75m - After that Abramovich was left under no illusion that Chelsea are no longer the financial superpower of English football.</p>
              <p>Never has Abramovich lost out in a straight battle of money for a player's transfer. And never before have City had the financial muscle that comes from being backed by an organisation as powerful as the Abu Dhabi United Group, comprising members of the super-rich United Arab Emirates royal family and the multi-billionaire Sulaiman Al Fahim.</p>
              <p>On a seminal day that saw Thaksin sell the club for £210m and relinquish his chairmanship, Robinho's arrival represents an immediate statement of intent - a box-office signing that takes their spending to £70m since Mark Hughes replaced Sven-Goran Eriksson as manager.</p>
              <p>"I am absolutely delighted to get the opportunity to work with such an incredible talent like Robinho," said Hughes, who will give the Brazilian a debut, against Chelsea, on September 13. "In order to compete with the best teams in the Premier League we have to be in the market for players of this calibre, and Robinho is undoubtedly one of the best in the world. I am really looking forward to introducing him to the rest of the squad and to the City fans. This is a real statement of intent as to the ambitions of Manchester City."</p>
              <p>The transfer represents a major disappointment for Chelsea and their manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, who had identified Robinho as his principal target, and the player had gone so far as to give a bizarre press briefing in Madrid on Sunday declaring his wish to move to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Indeed the lesson of the past 24 hours is that the Premier League has a new big hitter. "I just wish we could have done it [the takeover] earlier to give us more time to spend but unfortunately I was on vacation travelling across Europe when the proposition reached me," said Al Fahim. "Thierry Henry and [Brazil's] Ronaldo can add the confidence and the experience and provide the mix with he younger players. These are the kind of players we are looking for. We have deep pockets."</p>
              <p>A day of high-stakes negotiating began with City bidding £34m in a late, ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to hijack United's move for Berbatov. At the same time City made an opening bid of £28.5m for Robinho as well as contacting Valencia to see whether £40m would persuade them to sell David Villa and offering in excess of £10m for another striker, Stuttgart's Mario Gómez. Valencia and Stuttgart did not want to sell, and Berbatov always had his heart set on Old Trafford, but Real were willing to do business provided City offered another £4m. As Al Fahim said: <span style="color: #008000;">"Money is not a worry to my board."</span></p>
              <p>City were unable to compete with United, however, when it came to Berbatov, despite offering Tottenham a more lucrative deal and letting the Bulgarian know through intermediaries that they would pay him more in wages.</p>
              <p>To the intense irritation of Spurs, Berbatov flew into Manchester yesterday without permission and was picked up at the airport by Sir Alex Ferguson. He was then taken to the training ground before being driven to a hospital to undergo a medical while United came to a compromise with Spurs over the fee. "This is a key signing," said Ferguson. "Dimitar is one of the best and most exciting strikers in world football. His style and ability will give the team a different dimension."</p>
              <p>Tottenham earlier completed the £14m signing of Roman Pavlyuchenko from Spartak Moscow, as well as bringing in the £8m defender Vedran Corluka from City. They would rather have sold Berbatov to City and also took a call from Real offering £36m. However, Berbatov made it clear he was interested only in United and Spurs had no option but to reopen talks.</p>

              <p>thats probably not the case, Real was pretty pissed with Chelsea because of the pre-order shirt thingy, for any other transfer, seller would probably notify all buyers when there is a new bid comes in, this very case is due to Real trying to play Chelsea out, even if someone came in with the same offer as Chelsea reported 28-29m i would gather Real will do business with them instead of with Chelsea..</p>
              <p>good thing for the blues of Manchester, with ultra rich UAE owners entering into EPL it would be fun to see how the rest of the league catch up with EPL.</p>
              <p>however, alot will still be left to be seen if UAE owners are willing to bankroll the way Roman did, not all will spend the way Roman spent.. and not all will be as willing to let result determine the way their money goes...  </p>

                                exciting, yes but not this season....this season city will be lucky to be at the top half of the table....next season will be a different story once they have the time to scout for more players....then again i doubt hughes would be around then....he's nobody with that kind of money the club has...there's a new manchester in town...lol....expect more new fans to jump on board....
              
              liverpool also had some dubai group wanting to buy but the club owners weren't willing...
