              <h2>VILLA REVEAL £37M LOSSES</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"></div>
              <div><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/08/240/Rapid-Vienna-v-Aston-Villa-Randy-Lerner_2492177.jpg" border="0" alt="Randy Lerner - looking to cut wage bill at Villa."></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Aston Villa are aiming to manage their escalating wage bill while remaining competitive on the pitch after suffering losses of more than £37million for the year ending May 31, 2010. </strong></p>
              <p>The midlands club saw wages increase to almost £80million last season - an increase of £9million and they now account for 88% of the club's £90million turnover.</p>
              <p>But Villa sources are confident they will comply with UEFA's financial fair play regulations by the time they are in force by the beginning of the 2013-2014 campaign.</p>
              <p>The regulations will force clubs to live within their means, something Villa insist they are striving to achieve despite the backing of American owner Randy Lerner.</p>
              <p>Villa manager Gerard Houllier was made aware of the situation when he took charge nearly six months ago.</p>
              <p>The aim is not to reduce the number of quality players at his disposal but to trim the squad to ensure those on sizeable wages while making little meaningful contribution are moved on.</p>
              <p>In January, John Carew, Steve Sidwell, Stephen Ireland and Curtis Davies - four high-profile players on substantial wages who have made minimal impact at Villa this season - were off-loaded.</p>
              <p>Carew and Ireland made temporary moves to Stoke and Newcastle while Sidwell and Davies were sold to Fulham and Birmingham respectively.</p>
              <p>The sources also pointed out that having an owner like Lerner is dissimilar to the situations at Manchester United and Liverpool where massive loans were taken out against the two clubs.</p>
              <p>The US billionaire has injected £115.6m in equity and another £89.6m has come in through shareholder loans.</p>
              <p>Increased turnover means Villa have become one of the top 20 earning clubs in Europe for the first time.</p>
              <p>This included £52million from television revenue while matchday turnover was £24million and commercial income £14.4million.</p>

              <p>time to offload beye, warnock and stilian petrov too...</p>
              <p>it's amazing that villa has such a high wage bill for one of the smallest squad in the pl and players like luke young are actually getting 40k per week.....and to think o'neill is one of the most vocal about average players getting obscene pay but he's still willing to sign overpaid, overvalued english players and don't play them...</p>

              <p>Amazing that Villa spend so much yet not even close to Top 4.</p>
              <p>They should cut the wage bill and let Houllier reconstruct the team.</p>

              <p><strong>Martin O’Neill’s ongoing dispute with <span style="color: #000000;">Aston Villa</span> is heading for a tribunal.</strong></p>
              <p>The Northern Irishman left Villa Park on the eve of this season and the two parties have been attempting to resolve their difference.</p>
              <p>However, they have failed to reach an agreement over his exit and the case will now head for the Premier League Managers’ Arbitration Tribunal.</p>
              <p>A statement from the League Managers’ Association read: ‘Premier League managers’ contracts contain a clause requiring the parties to mediate their differences in the event of a dispute, and, if the dispute cannot be resolved at mediation, that the case moves forward to  the Premier League Managers Arbitration Tribunal.</p>
              <p>‘Regrettably, despite mediation, it has not been possible to resolve the dispute between Martin and Aston Villa concerning the termination of his employment with the club, the matter has now been placed in the hands of the Premier League Managers’ Arbitration Tribunal.</p>
              <p>‘The tribunal is ideally placed to resolve disputes of this nature, combining the skills and experience of prominent individuals from football and the law.’</p>
              <p>Former Celtic and Leicester boss O’Neill has yet to take a new job since leaving Villa, although he came close to taking over from Avram Grant at lowly West Ham.</p>
