              <p><em>Looks like the fat guy on his left will also lose his job...</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Roman Abramovich never really wanted Luiz Felipe Scolari. He wanted Carlo Ancelotti, but failed to lure the Italian from AC Milan.</strong><br><br>He wanted Guus Hiddink, only to be told there would be serious political repercussions should he dare undermine Russia’s quest for success in the next World Cup.<br><br>But, in the end, he settled for the Brazilian World Cup winner and even made a point of following the progress of his Portugal team at last summer’s European Championship. In darting between Russia and Portugal’s fixtures, Abramovich saw an awful lot of Austria and Switzerland from his helicopter.</p>
              <p>Clearly, however, Big Phil’s subsequent appointment excited Chelsea’s owner about as much as a night out with his ex-wife. <br><br>‘I’ve only met him three or four times since I arrived,’ revealed Scolari last month, which was not something Jose Mourinho, or even Avram Grant, could have said before their relationships with the Russian deteriorated.</p>
              <p>He was there to begin with, when the team were playing well and Scolari was being hailed as a tactical genius. When 23 points from 27 planted them at the summit of the Barclays Premier League and left Manchester United looking like a busted flush.</p>
              <p>But the Russian’s interest waned as Chelsea began to wilt, so much so that when he missed Saturday’s desperately disappointing performance against Hull, nobody was even surprised.</p>
              <p>From a distance, Abramovich had nevertheless decided that enough was enough. No more defeats by Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United. No more embarrassment at home against Burnley or away versus Roma. No evidence, in the eyes of Abramovich anyway, that Scolari could avoid what he would consider the ultimate loss — to a Juventus side managed by Claudio Ranieri, the tactically hapless Italian dismissed himself as Chelsea manager following Champions League semi-final defeat by Monaco in 2004. <br><br>Under Scolari, Chelsea’s football had been inferior even to then. Second place in the Premier League would appear beyond their reach, as would a place in the last four of Europe’s most illustrious competition. Stamford Bridge was no longer the fortress it had become, first under Mourinho and then Grant.</p>
              <p>To begin with, the Brazilian’s relaxed approach was given as a cause for celebration. The players were inspired by his mere presence, and receptive to his coaching. He was a World Cup winner, after all, as well as an all-conquering club coach.</p>
              <p>But with poor results came reasons for the sudden dip in form. The tactics were flawed; training lacked its usual intensity, Scolari seemingly failing to appreciate the demands of England’s Premier League. It would take him time to adapt, we were told, having been out of club football for so long.</p>
              <p>Key members of the Chelsea hierarchy were still desperate for Scolari to succeed. They liked his style even if they were not that enamoured with his style of football. The man had humility, and respect for the club that even extended to his reluctance to ‘waste money’ on a third-choice keeper before the January transfer window closed. <br><br>Even yesterday, Scolari could still count on certain key people who considered it prudent to give him until the end of the season. <br><br>It certainly was not in Peter Kenyon’s thinking to sack him when he decided to take a holiday that prevented him from even being there when Scolari was summoned to a meeting at Chelsea’s training ground in Cobham at 2.45pm yesterday.</p>
              <p>While Scolari met Abramovich, chairman Bruce Buck and director Eugene Tenenbaum in person, Chelsea’s chief executive was only at the end of a telephone.<br><br>When Simon Greenberg, club communications and public affairs director, arrived in the office yesterday morning, his diary for the week included a trip to Geneva for a European clubs conference and the publication of the club’s latest accounts, accompanied by hard evidence of Abramovich’s long-term commitment to the club.</p>
              <p>Greenberg did, however, sense things could move faster than even he imagined and cancelled his trip to Switzerland. <br><br>Abramovich would no doubt argue that sacking Scolari already shows how committed he remains. If he retains enough interest to take such an extraordinary decision, he must care for the club he bankrolled to successive league titles.</p>
              <p>Under Scolari, such success seemed highly unlikely and by yesterday one insider suggested the Brazilian was managing like someone trying to secure what is sure to be a massive pay-off.<br><br>He was not at Saturday’s post-match press conference, and nowhere near delivering the promises of his original press conference in July. ‘I am a fighter,’ he said then. <br><br>‘Everything I have tried to achieve has been difficult but I get there. I arrive. And my teams are the same. <br><br>‘Football is beautiful. If it’s possible, we’ll try to play beautiful football. But, sometimes, if you want to win you don’t play beautiful. I want both: to win and be beautiful. But sometimes it’s impossible.’ <br><br>For Scolari, success here in England proved impossible.<br></p>

              <p>With the transfer window closed, and the current ageing squad, I don't even know how can we manage to stay within top 4. Somemore the next BPL match is against Aston Vila!</p>

              <h1>Rijkaard interested in Blues post</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Frank
              Rijkaard's agent insists the Dutchman would consider the Chelsea job
              and would not be scared off by Roman Abramovich's reputation.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Rijkaard has been out of
              management since leaving Barcelona last summer and is among a list of
              candidates who have been linked to the Chelsea job following the
              sacking of Luiz Felipe Scolari on Monday.</p>
              <p>His agent Perry Overeem said on Tuesday if Chelsea did make an approach then Rijkaard would certainly listen.</p>
              <p>"(Frank) is obviously a big fan of the game and a big fan of the
              Premier League so he can be interested in working in the Premier
              League," he told Sky Sports News.</p>
              <p>"He would consider every serious job offer from one of the
              major teams in Europe and obviously Chelsea and the Premier League is
              one of those."</p>
              <p>Four managers have come and gone since Abramovich bought
              Chelsea in the summer of 2003, but Overeem insisted that would not put
              Rijkaard off the challenge at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"Well of course (the reputation of Chelsea) doesn't make it a
              lot easier and Frank would take some more time to consider the
              opportunity, but I don't think Frank will be scared off by those
              statistics.</p>
              <p>"He will just think of himself as maybe the one candidate who can stay there longer than those earlier coaches."</p>

              <p><br>Actually it wasn't so expected lah... I thought they will still keep faith in him since he is afterall a World Cup winner, and new to the Premiership... Or the very least see how he does at the end of this season then decide.</p>
              <p>But I guess I the coming CL match against Juve is very important and I think they don't belief he has what it takes to beat <span style="color: #000000;">Claudio Ranieri's Juve...</span></p>
