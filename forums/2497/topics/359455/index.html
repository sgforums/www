              <p><strong>Arsenal were ruthlessly picked off by Chelsea on Sunday as Guus Hiddink’s men smashed The Gunners 4-1 at Emirates Stadium. </strong></p>
              <p>In a game that promised all the hallmarks of an
              after-the-Lord-Mayor’s-show routine following both sides’ midweek
              heartache, Chelsea came to the home of their rivals and dished out
              something of a beating.</p>
              <p>Having weathered a red storm for half an hour, Chelsea shocked
              their hosts with a quick-fire double from Alex and Nicolas Anelka,
              before an own goal by Kolo Toure and a late Florent Malouda strike
              rendered Nicklas Bendtner’s reposte mere consolation.</p>

              <h1>Guus Hiddink defends Didier Drogba after diving claims</h1>
              <p><strong>Premier League: Arsenal 1-4 Chelsea</strong></p>
              <div id="article-body">
              <div class="art-o art-align-left"><img src="http://images.mirror.co.uk/upl/m4/apr2009/8/1/image-11-for-team-of-the-weekend-april-18-19-gallery-949240124.jpg" border="0" alt="Didier Drogba (Pic:Getty)" width="450" height="324"></div>
              <p><em>Guus Hiddink last night defended Didier Drogba after his striker was caught up in a diving storm.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger accused Drogba of diving to win a free-kick for Chelsea's first goal as Hiddink's men stormed to a thumping victory which secured third place.</strong></p>
              <p>But Hiddink claimed he was "proud" of his players and said Drogba showed character to play despite having a potential UEFA ban hanging over his head after his antics following their Champions League exit to Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss Hiddink said: "We told him everyone would be focused on him, so he had to play the simple game. He put in the free-kick for Alex's beautiful header. He did not react to any challenges.</p>
              <p>"I'd have to see the free-kick again. There were also some other incidents which the referee was very 'gentle' about. "Our victory showed this team is one of the strongest in Europe. That was a great reaction, and I'm proud of them.</p>
              <p>Everyone knew after Wednesday it would be very difficult. "But it's a long time since Chelsea have had such a big victory against Arsenal.</p>
              <p>That's why I'm very proud of the boys in the way they reacted, tactically and mentally."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I don't think Arsene should mention about the Drogba's incident. On the video replay, Fabregas did clip Drogba's ankle. Arsene should not be looking for excuses like this. The fact is that his team's performance was bad and he should be looking at ways to improve rather than pointing fingers at others like this. Again I think his policy about youth needs to change if Arsenal were to seriously put in a challenge for the title.</p></div>
