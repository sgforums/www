              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOHN TERRY is demanding showdown talks with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich over his future. </h2>
              <p class="article">The Blues skipper is furious nobody at the club has spoken to him since Manchester City tabled a £30million bid last week and cannot understand why he has been left in the dark. </p>
              <p class="article">Defender Terry, 28, feels insulted by the Stamford Bridge silence. And an insider said: "John feels betrayed and even unwanted.</p>
              <p class="article"> "It's unbelievable - even though he's the club captain and one of the Blues' most important players, senior management at the club haven't once tried to talk to him. </p>
              <p class="article">"John wants to know what's going on and, more importantly, whether Chelsea actually want to keep him or cash in while they have a chance." </p>
              <p class="article">Even though Terry is widely regarded as a key player, he takes home £20,000 a week less than his England team-mate Frank Lampard, who is on £151,000 a week. </p>
              <p class="article">Big-spending City are prepared to give the Three Lions skipper the wages he believes he deserves and are desperate to make him the bedrock of their new-look side. </p>
              <p class="article">Terry has played 272 games for Chelsea and scored 17 goals in 11 senior years at the club. </p>
              <p class="article">He joined Chelsea aged just 14 and led the club to its first league title for 50 years in his first year as captain in 2004-5. </p>
              <p class="article">Both chief executive Peter Kenyon and new boss Carlo Ancelotti have said Terry is not for sale - but the skipper's future is still in the balance.</p>

              <p>Chelsea have made their public stance clear through a statement rejecting the bid, a position emphasised by Carlo Ancelotti, the new head coach, who will have talks with Terry today, and the chief executive, Peter Kenyon, both confirming that the 28-year-old was not for sale.</p>
              <p>It is understood that Roman Abramovich, the owner, does not wish to sell the England captain and the club say Terry, their captain, has told them he intends to remain at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>City, for their part, are thought to be refusing to make a third official offer for the player until he speaks publicly. The club are aware that, if Terry goes on the record to confirm his desire to continue at Chelsea, that may, for the time being, be the end of the matter.</p>
              <p>However, until he does so there is a view at Eastlands that his ongoing silence may be an encouraging sign and that he is seriously considering what would be his final opportunity to make a big move during his peak years.</p>
              <p>City are also conscious that, given Chelsea's reluctance, Terry would have to make a formal transfer request to leave the club. If he were to do so, then it is thought there is scope for an improved bid from City for the player as the manager, Mark Hughes, views Terry's ability and leadership qualities as essential to what is seen in Manchester as a pivotal season in the club's development now that the billionaire Sheikh Mansour has owned City for close to a year.</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry will reportedly be offered a £25,000-a-week pay rise to ward off interest from Manchester City.</strong> </p>
              <p>The Daily Mirror claims that Chelsea will make Terry the highest-paid player at Stamford Bridge with a £7.7m-a-year offer. </p>
              <p>That figure would still see Terry earning around half of the money reportedly offered by Manchester City. </p>
              <p>The England captain returns to training this week to meet new boss Carlo Ancelotti for the first time and is expected to be met with a new contract offer. </p>
              <p>Chairman Bruce Buck said: "My line as a Chelsea fan, is that I would be devastated if John Terry left Chelsea. Having said that, it's not going to happen. John Terry is synonymous with Chelsea and Chelsea is synonymous with John Terry.</p>
              <p>"He has been here since he was a wee tot, he is the captain of Chelsea, he is the captain of England, he is the backbone of our team, he is not leaving."</p>
