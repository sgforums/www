            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Charlotte Mears reveals all about her crazy life with England soccer ace Jermain</span><br><br>STUNNING Charlotte Mears reveals the incredible truth about her fabulous life as a WAGÂ—and how it all came crashing down when love rat England star Jermain Defoe dumped her. It was a fairytale romance. The former Â£6,000-a-year holiday rep was hard up and trying to make it as a beauty queen when she first dated the Â£35,000-a-week Spurs striker. </strong><br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/1301_wags_01.jpg"><br><br>Within a few months she was SHARING his Â£3million mansion, DRIVING his flash motors, COSYING up to new celebrity pals and SPLASHING Â£200,000 on a kitchen!<br><br>The pair planned a dream summer wedding complete with 5ft ice sculpture of their interlocked initials. "Yes, I was very privileged," she sighed. But in November Jermain, 25, broke it off and traded 22-year-old Charlotte in for a new model, pin-up Danielle Lloyd.<br><br>In an exclusive interview, Charlotte admitted she was so devastated she needed THERAPY to recoverÂ—plus Â£4,000 worth of new boobs! The surgery blew the last of the cash left from her two years with Jermain. But she insisted she is RELIEVED to be shot of her lavish life and back to being almost penniless.<br><br>Charlotte said: "I don't see it like Danielle is now living my dream. That was my life, this is my life now and I'm moving on. "I hated the WAG label because it didn't show me as a person, just a thing. WAG implies you don't do anything with your life and live off your partner. That's just not me. I've always worked and earned my own money. There was no difference between me and an ordinary girl."<br><br>No difference except her lover RAKED in Â£5,000 a day, SPLURGED Â£63,000 on her engagement ring and FORKED OUT a staggering Â£40,000 on her 100 pairs of designer shoes! She grinned: "But I had to be careful with my Christian Louboutin stilettos. I couldn't go too high because Jermain was quite little."<br><br>Despite her protests Charlotte fitted the glitzy jetsetting WAG stereotype. She said: "The most amazing trip we had was to Anguilla and St Barts in the Caribbean. First-class tickets all the way."<br><br>While Jermain (she calls him Jem) drove around in an Â£110,000 DB9 Aston Martin Vantage, Charlotte (he calls her Lots) swanned around in his Range Rover 4x4 complete with blacked-out windows. "But I gave that back when we split," she added. "Now I drive a Hyundai."<br><br>Recalling how they met in September 2005 at an exhibition Charlotte told us: "It was very serious very quickly and we knew straight away we'd be together. "Jem was very loving, caring and funny. We had so much in common. We had a laugh all the time and loved chilling out together. We were the perfect match. I wasn't a football fan, I was a Jermain fan. I loved watching him play."<br><br>In July 2006 Charlotte sealed her position as an official WAG by moving into Jermain's luxury home in Hertfordshire. "It was built from scratch for Jem and me," she said. "We chose it but he bought it." Despite being unable to cook Charlotte quickly convinced Jermain to spend an extra Â£200,000 on a state-of-the-art kitchen. It had SIX ovens, TWO dishwashers, TWO wine coolers holding 132 bottles each, a FOUR-FEET WIDE fridge and TWO 42-inch TVs.<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/1301_wags_02.jpg"><br><br>But Charlotte confessed: "Until then I never cooked and ate a lot of Pot Noodles. I wasn't very good at following recipes but managed spaghetti and lasagne. " I found the equipment difficult to operate, though. I'd picked all this hi-tech stuff but I couldn't work anything. It was all touch-screen and all I wanted to do was turn an old-fashioned button. "Sometimes I couldn't even turn the hotplate on and ended up breaking my manicured nails. It wound me up."<br><br>But one time Charlotte was glad not to eat came the week before the engagement party last FebruaryÂ— when she tried on a Â£2,500 Dolce &amp; Gabbana dress that did not fit. "When I saw that dress I thought Â‘Oh my God, I love it' but there was only one and it was a bit small for me," she recalled. "I was in the changing room going, Â‘Do it up Jem, do it up!' and he was saying, Â‘I can't, Lots, it won't go!' I insisted, Â‘It will, it will!'Â—but it wouldn't.<br><br>"So I told the shop to hold on to it for a week then ate nothing but salad and water and went to the gym loads. When we went back seven days later it did up. But I was in a total state right up to the party, worrying whether it would still fit. Afterwards I went out and ate a double hamburger and chips!"<br><br>The most expensive gift Jermain ever bought Charlotte was her Â£63,000 diamond engagement ring. He presented it to her over a romantic Valentine's Day meal last year at the swanky Brocket Hall hotel after booking an entire section of the restaurant at a cost of Â£10,000.<br><br>"It was the best day of my life, so romantic," she said. "The ring is perfect, it was so big on my finger. "I've still got it. I keep it at home in a safe place but I'd never wear it now, it's just a souvenir of the time I had with Jem."<br><br>On Thursday Charlotte got a poignant reminder of those free-spending days before the big splitÂ—Channel 4 screened a millionaire version of A Place In The Sun showing her and Jermain bidding to snap up a Â£2million Majorca holiday home. It brought memories flooding back. Like the times she rubbed shoulders with big names in exotic surroundingsÂ—particularly the Beckhams' World Cup bash in May 2006 at their Beckingham Palace home.<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/1301_wags_04.jpg"><br><br>"That was the best party ever," said Charlotte. "It was surreal being surrounded by stars. I loved meeting Sharon Osbourne, a real inspiration. And Posh was so nice." But Charlotte insists it wasn't the glamorous times but the quiet, private moments that mattered most.<br><br>"We did normal things like shopping, going to the gym, watching telly," she said. "Our favourite was to pop down the local Nando's for a peri-peri chicken then catch a movie. But our dream night was an evening in, cuddling up on the sofa."<br><br>Sadly for Charlotte, she wasn't the only one Jermain loved cuddling. Shop girl Claire Chidley told how he romped with her last April at her parents' home in Bishop's Stortford, Herts, and Spurs' team hotel in nearby Cheshunt. In July he started a four-month affair with Charlotte lookalike Rachel Cameron.<br><br>Charlotte admitted: "It's tough being a WAG when girls throw themselves at your man. Now he's with Danielle. I'd like to think that he wasn't seeing her before we finished but I just don't know. It's been a difficult couple of months for me.<br><br>"I've been doing a lot of self-therapy, not counselling but stuff that makes me feel good about myself. "Now as well as modelling I'm going into interior design. I'm looking to the future and my boob jobÂ—from 32C to 32DDÂ—was part of that. I wanted to boost my confidence.<br><br></div>
