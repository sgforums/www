              <p><em>Fix claim: Sir Alex Ferguson believes there is a fixtures conspiracy against United</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1104458" rel="1104458_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1104458/Its-fix-Sir-Alex-claims-Premier-League-cheating-United.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>As </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><strong> embark on their bid to land the FA Cup, Sir Alex Ferguson made the bizarre claim that the Barclays Premier League fixture programme is fixed.</strong></p>
              <p>The United manager has already taken his team to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/aston-villa.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Aston Villa</span></a>, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham</span></a>,<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"> Manchester City</span></a> and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/portsmouth.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Portsmouth</span></a> in a first half of the season that saw the champions with one of the toughest away schedules in recent times.</p>
              <p>They now face four League games in 16 days this month as their Premier demands threaten to derail their bid to win four more trophies this season. But Ferguson's suggestion that the schedule may not be drawn randomly will raise eyebrows across the country.</p>
              <p>The United manager said: 'I've been saying this for a few months, but our fixture programme didn't do us any favours and I think we have been handicapped by the Premier League in the fixture list. They tell me it's not planned. Bloody hell!'</p>
              <p>Asked why the Premier League would wish to make it tough on United, Ferguson added: 'I've got my doubts. 'I'm not saying what they do down there, but next year we will be sending somebody to see how it happens, I can assure you. 'I just don't understand how you can get the fixtures like that.'</p>
              <p>The Premier League were quick to respond to Ferguson's outburst, with a spokesman stressing the neutrality of the procedure. 'The Premier League fixtures are put together through as random a process as possible,' he said.</p>
              <p>'The initial list is created by specialist software before going to the fixtures working party, which is made up of representatives from the Premier League, Football League, FA, clubs and supporters.</p>
              <p>'The police also approve it before it is sent to the clubs, at which point they can raise any objections they may have. 'There are various factors that go into the structuring of the fixture list - police requests, club requests, as well as involvement in European or FIFA competitions, for example - but the overriding factor is the luck of the draw.'</p>
              <p>It has also emerged that United did not object to the fixtures when they came out last June, but club official Ken Ramsden will be on the fixtures working party from this summer onwards.</p>
              <p>Not that there is anything sinister in that. There are four representatives from clubs on the panel, who are involved in the process for two or three years before new members are voted in.</p>
              <p>United have a break from League duty this weekend as they travel to Southampton on Sunday for their FA Cup third-round tie. The fact that Ferguson will rest several leading players ahead of next weekend's League game against Chelsea at Old Trafford says everything about his priorities.</p>
              <p>He said: 'The season really does start now. We are into the second half and we are on the home straight. Big games are coming up - with all the top teams coming here - and these can decide championships and they can be really exciting affairs.</p>
              <p>'We've got a big month in January. The key is going to be how I navigate that month with the 23 players I have. All those players are going to have to play their part, particularly against Southampton and in the two legs against Derby in the Carling Cup semi-final.</p>
              <p>'There's a big game against Chelsea coming up next Sunday, which I've got one eye on, so it's a busy spell and we have to give careful consideration to the teams we pick. 'We're competing for all four tournaments that we are in.'</p>
