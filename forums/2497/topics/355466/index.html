              <p><strong>Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher insists that tomorrow's Premier League encounter with Blackburn Rovers is the biggest of his career so far.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds go into the lunchtime clash knowing that victory will put them two points clear of Manchester United at the top of the table - and mark the first time in seven years that they have still been involved in the title race at this stage.</p>
              <p>In 2002, Carragher was part of the Liverpool squad that pushed Arsenal all the way until defeat against Tottenham on April 27 ended their hopes, and the 31-year-old isn't playing down the need for three points at Anfield tomorrow.</p>
              <p>'I'm not just saying this because of what happened against Chelsea the other night but the league has always been the priority for everyone at the club,' he says.</p>
              <p>'In the 13 years I have been involved in the first team this will be the biggest league game I've played in – it really is that important.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p>'If we win we can go top of the league with just six games to go and if someone would have told us that we would be in this position when the season started we would have all been delighted.</p>
              <p>'This is a massive chance for everyone at the club and I'm sure the fans will create a great atmosphere because they know what is at stake.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/10/article-0-004F9F7D00000258-921_306x423.jpg" alt="Jamie Carragher" width="306" height="423">

              </div>
              <p>Chelsea's victory in the Champions League on Wednesday was the first time the Reds have been beaten by a fellow member of the big four this season.</p>
              <p>Carragher added: 'Sometimes you just have to hold your hands up and say that the other team played well on the night, and this is one of those occasions. 'But it's important to remember that we've now played them and Man United five times this season and we've won four of those games.</p>
              <p>'That's a record we can be proud of even though we are obviously disappointed about what happened the other night.</p>
              <p>'We've played more than 40 games in the Premier League and the Champions League – the two biggest competitions – and we've only lost three times. One of the most important things is that when we have lost we've tended to respond in the right way by going on good runs.</p>
              <p>'The incentive is there for us to go back on top of the league. It may only be for a few hours until United play but you never know, it could even be for longer than that.</p>
              <p>'That's how big this game is and that's why I honestly believe it's the biggest we've had in the league since I've been at the club - and maybe for even longer than that.'</p>

"I have seen Sam Allardyce's teams at Bolton and now at Blackburn. I do not expect the style to change very much but I believe it is more difficult to manage at the bottom of the table because every defeat is very negative."</p>

              <p><strong>Blackburn manager Sam Allardyce: </strong><br>"We've picked up 11 points out of 18 from the last six games. "It is a good run, we are in good form, and we've had more wins than draws in those games, I'm glad to say, which is what we were looking for. "We are on the up at the moment, not just in terms of our form, but also our points total is getting better as time goes on."</p>
