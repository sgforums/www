After Marek Saganowski had put the hosts ahead at St Mary's on 67 minutes, man of the match Carlos Edwards soon levelled. However, Sunderland left it late to secure the points, substitiute Grant Leadbitter netted a spectacular winner with just three minutes to play.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Derby</span> had started the day at the top but dropped two points as they were held 1-1 by Coventry at Pride Park. It could have been worse for the Rams after Leon McKenzie struck for the visitors after 73 minutes but parity was restored just six minutes later. Matt Oakley was the scorer for County when he converted after good work from James McEveley and Steve Howard.<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Birmingham's</span> promotion bid also suffered a setback as they were beaten 1-0 by strugglers Barnsley. Victory for the Oakwell side lifted them out of the relegation zone - at the expense of Leeds - and Daniel Nardiello is the man they have to thank after he grabbed the game's only goal in the 52nd minute. A stormy affair ended with Blues' Neil Danns and Barnsley's Bobby. Hassell sent off by referee Mike Russell for violent conduct after the final whistle.<br><br><span style="color: green;">Leeds</span>, meanwhile, continue to go through the whole spectrum of emotions, getting sucked back into the bottom three following a dramatic 2-1 loss to Colchester.<br></div>

"We had a mad 10 minutes when we didn't defend properly and it drives you potty.<br><br>"You ask them to do something and they don't do it. It makes me realise why we lose games when they don't do these things. Some of them don't take it on board enough, unfortunately.<br><br>You keep telling them about these small details that can be so important but sometimes they just think you're mad and don't do them.<br><br>"So this is why we'll get back on the field and do them again. And I'll drive them potty until they get it right." This was Leeds' first visit to Colchester since their shock FA Cup defeat in 1971, when Colchester were in the old Fourth Division.<br><br>The victory means Colchester must still be regarded as contenders to gatecrash the play-offs, with Leeds the 14th team to have been beaten at this tiny ground this season. Cureton said: "Yes, there's an outside chance we can make it and it would be a massive bonus if we did, but it's not something we talk about."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the updates.<br><br>Glad to see Sunderland doing well again , scrapping results without dropping points is what a champion is all about . The next game will be against Colechester and they are not easy to play against at their home turf especially only losing 3 times at home so far.

Derby's defeat against Ipswich has opened up the chance for Birmingham to regain the automatic spot (2nd) if they beat Leicester on wednesday morning.<br><br>Hopefully Birmingham will lose the upcoming games and settle for play offs .

The likes of Leicester, Hull City, Barnsley, Leeds , Southend and probably QPR  are fighting to take the last two spots. It's one of the tightest relegation battles we have seen for years. Who do I think will go down along with Luton ? Southend has lost their crucial games and I say they will go down along with Leeds. Most of you guys know what Leeds is all about , especially few years ago , they were playing against Lazio at Elland Road, now they have to settle for the likes of Colchester, Luton town this season , their downfall is very similar to Man City who dropped to 2nd division before climbing back to the EPL.<br><br>Relegation to league one<br>Southend<br>Leeds Utd<br>Southend</div>

How can Southend be in two positions at the same time?<br><br>But having Leeds go down is a real shame. If only RA bought them over instead of Chelsea.<br><br>CCC has been rather exciting this season. The leadership changed hands quite a few times. Sunderland's slow and steady rise from mid-table to the summit certainly reflects well on KEano. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Andy Gray's first goal since November helped Burnley to a fourth win in five matches, 3-0 against injury-hit Norwich.<br><br>Ade Akinbiyi's header gave the hosts a half-time lead before Gray, who endured a two-month spell on the sidelines after picking up a foot problem in the 2-1 win over Leeds in November, and Wade Elliott added the gloss with two goals in the final minutes<br></div>
