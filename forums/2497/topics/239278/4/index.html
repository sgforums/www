The Rams started the day four points adrift of Sunderland and five behind leaders Birmingham and were unable to close the gap, with one match to play. </strong><br><br>That means they must be content with a place in the play-offs. Birmingham go to Preston and Sunderland visit Luton on the final day of the season as they battle for the title.<br><br>And Blues managing director Karren Brady confirmed there will be funds to strengthen the team during the summer. "Of course there will be funds," she stated. "There is a lot of money coming into football next year from the broadcasting deal and we have all learnt that the Premiership is the only place to be. "We have learned from our mistakes, we understand what needs to be done and that is going to take an enormous amount of investment. "The board has got to stump up that money and has got to invest that money in the club's future."<br><br><strong>Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn was ecstatic as the club returned to the Premiership a year after leaving it with a record low points tally. The season began poorly with five straight defeat under Quinn's management, before the appointment of Roy Keane - and the club have never looked back.</strong><br><br>"It's terrific because everybody played a part, none more so than Roy and the players," Quinn told the club website. "It shows that when people put their mind to it and work as a team, you are capable of doing anything.<br><br>"There will be immense pride around the city. "I'm trying to take this in and enjoy it but I'm also thinking very much about going forward and the people of this city have to realise the role they play. "Looking back at what Roy and his staff have put together in such a short space of time, it's amazing, they are brilliant people."<br><br>Keane took the day's excitement in his stride by taking his dog for a walk when the match was on, and only found out the news of their promotion when someone sent him a text message. "I'm delighted for the players who have done a fantastic job," he told the club website. "I'm also delighted for the staff, who have played such a vital part, the fans and Niall and the board who have been a great support since I arrived at the club."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Â£25 million - Keane's prize for promotion</strong></span><br><br><strong>Roy Keane will be handed a bumper new four year contract, a Â£25 million transfer kitty and possibly even a significant shareholding in Sunderland as a reward for getting Sunderland back into the Premiership. Sunderland were promoted without even playing after Derby lost two-nil at Crystal Palace. That will hasten contract talks that have Keane on the brink of signing a two-year extension to the two years he currently has left on his contract at the Stadium of Light. It will also put him alongside Sir Alex Ferguson on a Â£3 million-a-year salary. </strong><br><br>Keane will also be handed a major war chest of Â£25 million by chairman Niall Quinn to launch an assault on the top 10 of English football. Quinn has admitted promotion could bank the club Â£65 million and reports in Ireland yesterday suggested Keane could be handed as much as 10 per cent of the club by the Drumaville Group for leading Sunderland back into the big-time. Keane has fashioned a remarkable turnaround after agreeing to take over at the end of August last year when the club was bottom of the Championship.<br><br>The former Manchester United captain was out walking his dog when the news came through that Sunderland had made an immediate return to the top-flight following their relegation Quinn said: Â“Roy is capable of becoming a great manager. I'm convinced heÂ’s going to be a better manager than he was a player and thatÂ’s the highest praise I can give him, because he was one of the best.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m thrilled. What people donÂ’t see is that behind the scenes Roy wants to build a football club, not just a team and thatÂ’s really refreshing for us going forward. Â“The structures are improving and changing and altering. WeÂ’re doing it RoyÂ’s way, itÂ’s as simple as that. All I can do is provide the opportunity and the finance. Structure is the word I use and itÂ’s for Roy to use his expertise. Â“ThereÂ’s no point running away with ourselves, but if we look at our club and what weÂ’re trying to achieve, I think now weÂ’re an attraction to players.<br><br>Â“Going into the Premiership increases the ante and we can look for more and better players if thatÂ’s required and if thatÂ’s what Roy wants. I think some of our players can be stars in the bigger league but thatÂ’s all down to Roy. Â“IÂ’m just happy to provide the structure and the foundations to release everything in a positive way, so that we can attempt to get players that otherwise might never have come to the club.<br><br>Â“Roy will play a huge part in that. I know that if I was still playing, IÂ’d want to play here. To drive your career on, heÂ’d be great to work with.Â” SunderlandÂ’s revival under Keane this year has been staggering, the defeat at Colchester nine days ago their only one in the league in 2007. Similarly, their 45,000 crowd to watch a thrilling three-two victory over Burnley on Friday night was the second biggest crowd in the country this weekend.<br><br>It is a far cry from when Quinn persuaded a group of Irish businessmen, the Drumaville Group, to buy out former chairman Bob Murray last summer for Â£10 million. Quinn added: Â“It feels good, but what I do know, and Roy will feel this as well, is that if you stop and rest on your laurels, the tide will come back in and take you away again. Â“Did I mention promotion to Roy when he took the job? I donÂ’t think so. Win a game was the first thing I said! Help was my flag! But the main thrust of it was time, structures and finance and for us to have the trust in Roy to do the entire job and to do it on his own.<br><br>Â“We were glad to do that. We think most people do know that heÂ’s an exceptional talent and somebody who is not here purely to win a match every weekend, but to build this club into an amazing force again. Â“I donÂ’t think heÂ’ll settle until heÂ’s done that. That kind of ambition seemed miles away to me last August and itÂ’s marvelous that we have it now.<br><br>All we have to do now is keep things going as well as they are behind the scenes now and be ready for any problems that might come. Â“Ultimately, the fans will decide how weÂ’re doing, but just now they seem very pleased. WeÂ’d like some more of that.Â” Keane added: Â“It's great news for the club. I am delighted for the players, who have done a fantastic job. I am also delighted for all the staff, who have played such a vital part, the fans, who have been tremendous in their support for the team and for Niall and the board, who have been a great support since I arrived at the club.Â”<br><br></div>

The Black Cats were two goals up inside the opening 10 minutes through Anthony Stokes' drilled shot and Daryl Murphy's 25-yard left-footed drive.</strong><br><br>Early in the second half Sunderland were 3-0 up as Stokes set up Murphy, who tapped in from four yards. Ross Wallace's left-footed strike from 30 yards made it 4-0, with David Connolly's header completing the rout. Stokes gave Sunderland the perfect start, lashing a shot past Dean Brill after exchanging passes with Murphy in the fourth minute. Two minutes later Murphy got on the scoresheet, collecting former Luton man Carlos Edwards' pass before unleashing a powerful left-footed shot past Dean Brill into the corner.<br><br>Sunderland started the second half in equally dominant fashion as Murphy scored with a close-range finish after good work by Stokes. Sunderland added two more goals in the last 12 minutes, with two substitutes making their mark. Wallace's left-footed shot flew past Brill and the Luton goalkeeper was soon picking the ball out of the net after Connolly headed in Grant Leadbitter's free-kick.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Luton: Brill, Keane, Coyne, Barnett, Emanuel, O'Leary (Langley 55), Spring, Heikkinen, Bell (Brkovic 60), Andrew, Idrizaj.<br>Subs Not Used: Perrett, Boyd, Talbot.<br><br>Booked: Coyne, Idrizaj, Keane, Brkovic.
