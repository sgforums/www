"As the final hurdle in the season-long race for promotion, these are exciting and critical matches and we are delighted that they will be returning to Wembley this year."<br><br>The Millennium Stadium has proved a more than able deputy during Wembley's redevelopment and the Cardiff venue will play host to the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final between Bristol Rovers and Doncaster on Sunday.<br><br>Mawhinney added: "I would like to place on record the League's thanks to The Millennium Stadium and the people of Cardiff for providing such a wonderful home to our finals over these last seven seasons."<br><br></div>

Wise denied the charge but his defence was unsuccessful when he appeared in person before a disciplinary panel.</strong><br><br>The charge related to an incident at Elland Road on January 20 when Wise was sent off during his side's 3-2 defeat by West Bromwich Albion. The referee, Nigel Swarbrick, sent Wise to the stands after he had pushed Diomansy Kamara off the pitch. Wise later confirmed he was angry with the West Bromwich striker for the slow manner in which he left the field after being substituted.<br><br>Wise has since fallen foul of the FA for a second time, being charged with using abusive words and/or insulting behaviour towards a match official following his side's recent 1-1 draw at Southend United.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The championship is just as exciting ! Relegation and Promotion race are very tight this year which makes it even more exciting. Birmingham shock 1-0 loss at home to Burnley sums it up ! Hopefully Derby and Sunderland will clinched the top 2 spots but Sunderland will be facing a tough game on monday against Southampton who scored 8 goals in 2 games without conceding and Sunderland is unbeaten throughout 2007 so far. That will have be the game of the day . Hopefully Sunderland to snatch a 1-0 victory at St's Mary .</div>

Daryl Murphy's opener came out of nothing as he beat two defenders before striking a sweet left-foot volley into the far corner.<br><br>Murphy then crossed for Ross Wallace to head in a second at the far post. Within two minutes Andy Keogh stooped to head one back from Michael McIndoe's cross, but the result was rarely in doubt as Wolves slipped to seventh.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Sunderland manager Roy Keane:</strong><br>"It was a good result for us and a good performance, plus the weather was nice! "Wolves had a right go at us as you would expect, and we had injured players coming back in, so that's another massive plus. "It's nice to have over 40,000 and the players certainly appreciate the support we've had. "The players keep giving me their all and since Christmas they've been superb. I feel very lucky to be working with them."<br><br><strong>Wolves boss Mick McCarthy:</strong><br>"It's never nice when you lose anywhere but remember who we were playing.<br>"Sunderland will take some stopping because Roy has brought in some very good players. "Jonny Evans looks a superb player and Nyron Nosworthy was outstanding, although I don't remember him ever wanting to play centre-back for me! "But I've enjoyed being back because I've got a lot of happy memories from the place.

Peter Halmosi gave Plymouth the lead in the first half when he raced on to Sylvan Ebanks-Blake's ball and slipped his shot past Casper Ankergren.<br><br>David Healy levelled just before the break, pouncing on the loose ball inside the area. And Michalik scored the winner when he headed in Alan Thompson's free-kick.<br><br><strong>Leeds assistant manager Gus Poyet:</strong><br>"It's a great day. The last five games have been fantastic. I don't know how many months we've been there. We're feeling great and enjoying it but unfortunately you cannot enjoy it too much because there's another big game on Monday. "We're very happy today, but the job is far from done, we have to make sure we keep going.<br>"The players are very happy, they've been absolutely fantastic out there, when you win a game like this, again in the last few moments of the game and with the supporters and how they were today it's difficult to come down. "But fortunately we're going away today, staying together for the next two days and we'll make sure everybody calms down."<br><br><strong>Plymouth manager Ian Holloway:</strong><br>"I still can't believe how we've lost, but that's life. You've got to be able to win headers in your box. "But other than that I thought we were terrific. We were calculated, we were calm, we looked a composed side, we looked like we deserved to have a few more points on the board than the team we were playing against. "I came here not expecting to get one decision to be honest.<br><br>"You're going to have 35,000 people going absolutely ballistic, but what impressed me was that they didn't turn on their team. "Well done to the Leeds fans and I felt their players responded to them. That's two great results they've just had so they're still in there."<br><br></div>
