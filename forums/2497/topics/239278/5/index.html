But there is no lack of play-off experience at the club, with manager George Burley preparing for his seventh such campaign. Burley's one promotion through the play-offs came with former club Ipswich at the old Wembley in 2000. </strong><br><br>The last time Derby reached the play-offs - in 2005 - Burley was at the helm and current Pride Park boss Billy Davies is the man who masterminded Preston's semi-final victory over the Rams. Davies is preparing for his third Championship play-off campaign in as many years after reaching the final in 2005 and the semi-final stage one year later with his former club.<br><br>Derby spent a large chunk of the season in the top two places but lost out to Sunderland and Birmingham in the final weeks of the regular season and now have to hope for promotion through the play-offs for the first time.

West Brom currently lead with 59 wins to Wolves's 52. The Baggies thrashed Barnsley 7-0 on the final day of the regular season to remind everyone of their ability. But Tony Mowbray's team have had an inconsistent season, climbing from 10th to first before slipping down to sixth and eventually moving back up to fourth.</strong><br><br>Wolves have surprised many with their form since the turn of the year. Mick McCarthy's team were 14th with half the season gone but the manager bought well in January, with Michael McIndoe, Stephen Ward, Michael Kightly and Andy Keogh all key performers as his team climbed the table.

Albion deserved their victory, although they almost let Wolves back in when defender Sam Sodje cleared his own back-pass off the line. Koren and Diomansy Kamara were then denied as Albion closed in on victory.<br><br><strong>West Bromwich Albion boss Tony Mowbray:</strong><br>"The task when we came here was to get in the Premier League and we still have a huge hurdle to overcome. "The win means nothing to me, I have no feeling of joy in my stomach. We have to try and get the job done against a good Derby County side. "It's the best day of your life if you can win at Wembley. That's the opportunity we have got and we have to prepare and we will be ready."<br><br><strong>Wolves manager Mick McCarthy:</strong><br>"It is disappointing but we have not really performed as well as we can. Maybe we had our opportunity at Molineux when we were by far the better side. "We had a lead in that game and lost, so maybe that was our chance. "We weren't expected to be here, so the players should have pride in what they have done for me, the club and themselves. "They have done wonders, and when the disappointment dies down they can look back on a great season."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>West Brom: Kiely, McShane, Perry, Sodje, Robinson, Koren, Greening, Gera, Koumas, Kamara (MacDonald 83), Phillips (Ellington 79).<br>Subs Not Used: Daniels, Clement, Carter.<br><br>Booked: Kamara.<br><br>Goals: Phillips 65.<br><br>Wolverhampton: Hennessey, Neill Collins, Breen, Craddock, McNamara (Mulgrew 76), Kightly (Ward 84), Olofinjana, Potter, McIndoe (Gleeson 59), Bothroyd, Keogh.<br>Subs Not Used: Oakes, Little.<br><br>Booked: Potter.<br><br>Att: 27,415<br><br>Ref: M Halsey (Lancashire).<br><br></div>
