              <p>Honestly, I don't see any present Arsenal player being well qualified enough to take over the captaincy... Of course if no other choice, we can talk about Cese, Toure or even worse, Adebayor... But really, are any of these really good enough?</p>
              <p>Another policy blunder by Wenger i feel... They don't have enough experience players in the squad... Suddenly Silvestre becomes a possibility too...</p>
              <p>At Pool, there are Carragher, Mascherano to back up Gerrard...</p>
              <p>At Chelsea, there are Lampard, Carvalho, Ballack to back up Terry...</p>
              <p>At United, there are Giggs, Rio, Scholes, VDS to back up Neville...</p>

              <h1>Arsenal should be privately pleased that William Gallas highlighted failings at Emirates</h1>
              <h2>In William Gallas, Arsenal have found a man who, at last, is speaking the truth.</h2>

              <p><span class="caption"><em>Speaking his mind: William Gallas could be stripped of captaincy for lifting lid on turmoil at Arsenal.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sack him? Strip him of his captaincy? Why, on earth should Arsene Wenger get rid of a man who is showing the very passion so sadly lacking in his team-mates this season? </strong></p>
              <p>At every Arsenal game a banner is unfurled with the legend "Arsene knows". It was accompanied recently by another with the poignant command "Show us some passion". That is exactly what Gallas is doing.</p>
              <p>Yes he has a history – some say that history should have prevented him from joining the Emirates staff – but what is wrong with making your feelings felt? Others believe Wenger was wrong to hand the Frenchman the captaincy.</p>
              <p>After Patrick Vieira and, less impressively, Thierry Henry, the job was always going to be a hard one. But, if not Gallas, then who? Manuel Almunia is not the most vocal, while Cesc Fabregas is still learning the trade.</p>
              <p>The problem with investing in youth is that maturity takes a back seat.</p>
              <p>When Gallas kicked the hoardings at St Andrews last season after Gael Clichy gave away a penalty, he was expressing his deep feelings at a missed opportunity.</p>
              <p>Losing Eduardo with a broken leg on that bleak February lunchtime was bad enough. Throwing away the points coincided with a drop in form and cost Arsenal the title, so his anger and frustrations were right.</p>
              <p>Before he arrived at Arsenal he had fallen out with Chelsea. After the transfer, Gallas, used in the deal that took Ashley Cole to Stamford Bridge, Chelsea issued a statement claiming that Gallas threatened to deliberately score own goals if he was not allowed to leave Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Gallas rejected Chelsea's claims and accused them of lacking class and 'hiding behind false accusations'. Gallas had probably not anticipated that his latest outburst, about his team-mates, would receive such a response – or was it a calculated response from a 31-year-old looking, possibly, ahead of the launch of his autobiography?</p>
              <p>Whatever the case, Arsenal should, on one hand, warn Gallas about his future comments. But, privately, they should be pleased he was brave enough to highlight the failings at the Emirates Stadium.</p>

              <h2 id="ctl00_ctl00_Full_Main_Main_stcArticleBodyNew_hHeader" class="football">Gallas returns but Cesc made captain</h2>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has revealed that William Gallas will play for Arsenal
              against Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League on Tuesday but that the
              captain’s armband will be worn by Cesc Fabregas.</strong></p>
              <p>Last week’s events in which Gallas publicly criticised his
              team-mates before being stripped of the captaincy were described by
              Wenger as 'interesting', though the Frenchman would not elaborate on
              his decision to relieve Gallas of his duties and award them instead to
              Fabregas.</p>
              <p>Manuel Almunia stood in for Gallas who was dropped for Saturday's
              3-0 defeat at Manchester City, but Fabregas will succeed the
              31-year-old in the role of captain on a permanent basis.</p>
              <p>Wenger insisted that he retained 'a big respect' for the France
              international defender, even if he stopped short of ruling out a
              possible departure in January.</p>
              <p>Wenger told a Monday lunchtime press conference: "William is a
              player that I rate and a man that I rate. I have a big respect for him.</p>
              <p>"He was working as a captain in a very difficult media environment. He was under big pressure from the press."</p>
              <p>Asked whether Gallas could leave Emirates Stadium when the transfer
              window opens again in January, Wenger replied: "Suggestions are
              suggestions and I cannot stop them.</p>
              <p>"For me, if the player is committed to the club and I think he can
              be stronger as a player because he took all the problems of the team to
              his heart.</p>
              <p>"I think it can be a new start."</p>

              <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">WILLIAM GALLAS has been told he can leave Arsenal after a furious bust-up with boss Arsene Wenger. Wenger stripped defender Gallas of the captaincy in a sensational showdown yesterday. And he ordered the Frenchman to stay at home for today’s game at Manchester City. </h2>
              <p>SunSport understands Gallas was “shocked and devastated” and is now considering his future. A close family member revealed: “Arsene told him ‘If you don’t want to be in my team then just go. You are free to leave’. William was shocked at the outburst and went straight home. </p>
              <p>“He’s had the captaincy taken away and has also been suspended from the team. “Of course, he’s totally devastated about what’s happened and is now wondering what to do next. </p>
              <p>Gallas, 31, stunned Wenger by revealing problems in the Arsenal dressing room. He claimed he had to break up a fight between Robin van Persie and Theo Walcott at half-time during the explosive 4-4 draw with Spurs last month. </p>
              <p>The defender also claimed there was a rat in the Emirates camp who everyone dislikes, thought to be Emmanuel Eboue. Our source, who asked not to be named, added: “William’s had big fall-outs with Nicklas Bendtner in the past and most recently he’s had a problem with Eboue. </p>
              <p>“He doesn’t mix with anyone in the club any more and is a bit of a loner. “He has no friends in the dressing room and feels his authority has been undermined.</p>
              <p>“But the other Arsenal players seem to have short memories. “After all, one of the first things he did as captain was negotiate a better deal for the players’ win bonuses. </p>
              <p>“Under him, they went from earning a win bonus of £800 per game to £2,500. “That made him everyone’s friend at first. Now he has no friends.” </p>
              <p>One player said: “We were called into a team meeting and told William was not going to be captain for the match at City. “We are all very angry with William. But we were told we have to move on and forget about the captaincy. </p>
              <p>“But at the moment, there are a lot of problems at Arsenal.” </p>
              <p>Gunners chairman Peter Hill-Wood said: “Baring all these things in public is no help for anybody.”</p>

              <p><strong>Sack him? Strip him of his captaincy? Why, on earth should Arsene Wenger get rid of a man who is showing the very passion so sadly lacking in his team-mates this season?</strong></p>
              <p>At every Arsenal game a banner is unfurled with the legend "Arsene knows". It was accompanied recently by another with the poignant command "Show us some passion". That is exactly what Gallas is doing.</p>
              <p>Yes he has a history – some say that history should have prevented him from joining the Emirates staff – but what is wrong with making your feelings felt? Others believe Wenger was wrong to hand the Frenchman the captaincy.</p>
              <p>After Patrick Vieira and, less impressively, Thierry Henry, the job was always going to be a hard one. But, if not Gallas, then who? Manuel Almunia is not the most vocal, while Cesc Fabregas is still learning the trade.</p>
              <p>The problem with investing in youth is that maturity takes a back seat.</p>
              <p>When Gallas kicked the hoardings at St Andrews last season after Gael Clichy gave away a penalty, he was expressing his deep feelings at a missed opportunity.</p>
              <p>Losing Eduardo with a broken leg on that bleak February lunchtime was bad enough. Throwing away the points coincided with a drop in form and cost Arsenal the title, so his anger and frustrations were right.</p>
              <p>Before he arrived at Arsenal he had fallen out with Chelsea. After the transfer, Gallas, used in the deal that took Ashley Cole to Stamford Bridge, Chelsea issued a statement claiming that Gallas threatened to deliberately score own goals if he was not allowed to leave Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Gallas rejected Chelsea's claims and accused them of lacking class and 'hiding behind false accusations'. Gallas had probably not anticipated that his latest outburst, about his team-mates, would receive such a response – or was it a calculated response from a 31-year-old looking, possibly, ahead of the launch of his autobiography?</p>
              <p>Whatever the case, Arsenal should, on one hand, warn Gallas about his future comments. But, privately, they should be pleased he was brave enough to highlight the failings at the Emirates Stadium.</p>

              <h2 style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">WILLIAM GALLAS has been told he can leave Arsenal after a furious bust-up with boss Arsene Wenger. Wenger stripped defender Gallas of the captaincy in a sensational showdown yesterday. And he ordered the Frenchman to stay at home for today’s game at Manchester City. </h2>
              <p>SunSport understands Gallas was “shocked and devastated” and is now considering his future. A close family member revealed: “Arsene told him ‘If you don’t want to be in my team then just go. You are free to leave’. William was shocked at the outburst and went straight home. </p>
              <p>“He’s had the captaincy taken away and has also been suspended from the team. “Of course, he’s totally devastated about what’s happened and is now wondering what to do next. </p>
              <p>Gallas, 31, stunned Wenger by revealing problems in the Arsenal dressing room. He claimed he had to break up a fight between Robin van Persie and Theo Walcott at half-time during the explosive 4-4 draw with Spurs last month. </p>
              <p>The defender also claimed there was a rat in the Emirates camp who everyone dislikes, thought to be Emmanuel Eboue. Our source, who asked not to be named, added: “William’s had big fall-outs with Nicklas Bendtner in the past and most recently he’s had a problem with Eboue. </p>
              <p>“He doesn’t mix with anyone in the club any more and is a bit of a loner. “He has no friends in the dressing room and feels his authority has been undermined.</p>
              <p>“But the other Arsenal players seem to have short memories. “After all, one of the first things he did as captain was negotiate a better deal for the players’ win bonuses. </p>
              <p>“Under him, they went from earning a win bonus of £800 per game to £2,500. “That made him everyone’s friend at first. Now he has no friends.” </p>
              <p>One player said: “We were called into a team meeting and told William was not going to be captain for the match at City. “We are all very angry with William. But we were told we have to move on and forget about the captaincy. </p>
              <p>“But at the moment, there are a lot of problems at Arsenal.” </p>
              <p>Gunners chairman Peter Hill-Wood said: “Baring all these things in public is no help for anybody.”</p>
