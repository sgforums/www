              <p class="article"><strong>1. Ronaldo</strong></p>
              <p class="article">He's one of the greatest strikers of all time but Brazilian Ronaldo just can't keep away from our Top 10s.</p>
              <p class="article">After being crowned No1 in the fat footballers list, he now makes the top spot with this 2002 horror show.</p>
              <p class="article">Despite leading his country to another World Cup in Japan and South Korea, Ronaldo managed to ruin all the post-match photos with his shocking half-shaven bonce.</p>
              <p class="article">Soon after he became one of the world's most expensive players by joining Real Madrid for £28million.</p>
              <p class="article">He obviously used some of the cash from his megabucks move to buy a decent razor as he then returned to his familar skinhead look.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>2. Carlos Valderrama </strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Columbian is possibly the only player in the world to be more famous for his hair than being a footballer.</p>
              <p class="article">He spent all-but three years of his entire career in South and North America, but still became a household name in Europe thanks to his crazy blonde locks.</p>
              <p class="article">Football fans in England first caught a glimpse of during the World Cups in the 1980s.</p>
              <p class="article">And Valderrama, who player 111 times for his country, is still a cult figure to this day.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>3. Taribo West </strong></p>
              <p class="article">West's<strong></strong>creative styling may not be the most flashy of our picks but it makes the No3 spot thanks to the fact he kept it for his entire career.</p>
              <p class="article">Whereas some players some become bored or embarrassed by their dodgy looks, Nigeria defender West stuck to his guns.</p>
              <p class="article">His playing career spanned almost 15 years and included illustrious names such as Inter and AC Milan, Auxerre, Derby and... Plymouth.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00779/Jason_Lee_280x390_779890a.jpg" alt="Jason Lee" width="191" height="215"></p>
              <p class="article"><strong>4. Jason Lee </strong></p>
              <p class="article">There can't be many footballers who have a chant about their hair.</p>
              <p class="article">Lee, however, is one and it's an anthem that still used around the grounds today.</p>
              <p class="article">During his time at Nottingham Forest in the 1990s, Lee was subjected to "He's got a pineapple on his head" at almost every league game.</p>
              <p class="article">Over a decade later and aged 37, he is still plying his trade at lowly Kettering Town but time has obviously taken its toll and legendary Lee is now sporting a slaphead.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>5. Kevin Keegan </strong></p>
              <p class="article">If Chris Waddle's mullet defined the 1980s, then Kevin Keegan's perm was the hairdo of the 1970s.</p>
              <p class="article">The poodle-like crop somehow captured the imagination of the nation and Keegan's style was widely adopted.</p>
              <p class="article">Thankfully, most of the pictures and video from that era are either in black and white or are poor quality, so we're not reminded of the full extent of those dark days in footy fashion.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00779/Chris_Waddle_280x39_779914a.jpg" alt="Chris Waddle" width="201" height="210"></p>
              <p class="article"><strong>6. Chris Waddle </strong></p>
              <p class="article">They're one of the greatest fashion crimes of all time<strong></strong>but no-one pulled off the mullet quite like Chris Waddle.</p>
              <p class="article">The former Newcastle, Tottenham and Sheffield Wednesday winger was one of England's biggest stars in 1980s.</p>
              <p class="article">But his talent on the field will always be tainted by his (very) dodgy barnet.</p>
              <p class="article">Since moving into TV work he had the good sense get it chopped off.</p>

              <p class="article"><strong>7. David Beckham </strong></p>
              <p class="article">Becks is one of the planet's biggest fashion icons - and his hair styles are world renowned.</p>
              <p class="article">He turned football fans across the globe from scruffy slobs into manicured metrosexuals.</p>
              <p class="article">The England star inspired many trends during his heyday, including the mowhawk, aliceband and skinhead.</p>
              <p class="article">But even Becks could not convince fans to take on this mowhican-style look in 2001.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00779/David_James_280x390_779931a.jpg" alt="David James" width="187" height="227"></p>
              <p class="article"><strong>8. David James </strong></p>
              <p class="article">England keeper James could probably bring out his own hair magazine with the amount of styles he's had.</p>
              <p class="article">But there's none worse, or more ridiculous than this belter from 2006.</p>
              <p class="article">After trying out the 'fro, cornrows and skinhead, James experimented with the old gents' favourite - the side-parting.</p>
              <p class="article">He became the butt of jokes - for once, not about his famous howlers - and the slick look was no more.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00779/Marouane_Fellaini_2_779889a.jpg" alt="Marouane Fellaini" width="169" height="181"></p>
              <p class="article"><strong>9. Marouane Fellaini </strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Belgian's 'fro is probably the most famous hair in the Premier League right now.</p>
              <p class="article">Everton midfielder and part-time striker Fellaini has been banging in the goals this season.</p>
              <p class="article">And he has used his huge barnet to his advantage by nodding in his fair share of headers.</p>
              <p class="article">It's safe to say he has become a cult-hairo at Goodison Park.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00779/Andy_Carroll_280x39_779934a.jpg" alt="Andy Carroll" width="188" height="169"></p>
              <p class="article"><strong>10. Andy Carroll </strong></p>
              <p class="article">Cornrows seem like the perfect footballer's hairdo. They are practical, easy to maintain and (arguably) fashionable.</p>
              <p class="article">That is of course, unless you're Newcastle youngster Carroll.</p>
              <p class="article">The striker showed off his new look against West Ham in January and scored too.</p>
              <p class="article">But after a ribbing from his team-mates and the Toon Army, it was a case of hair today, gone tomorrow as he soon returned to his usual scruffy mop.</p>
