              <h2><img src="http://www.goal.com/images/19316_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"></h2>
              <h2>Jose Mourinho has told <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Michael Essien</span> that he will sign for Inter on Monday according to La Gazzetta Dello Sport.</h2>
              <p>The former Chelsea coach has been linked with the club ever since
              current boss, Roberto Mancini, walked out on the club only to make a
              dramatic U-turn on his decision.</p>
              <p>Mancini still hasn't confirmed his position with the Nerazzurri and
              he may leave in the summer. Meanwhile the Special One is currently free
              and waiting to pounce and, according to reports, he has claimed that he
              will sign for Inter on Monday.</p>
              <p>Gazzetta claim Mourinho sent Chelsea midifielder Michael Essien a
              text message after the Moscow Champions League final telling him the
              news of his new adventure with the Nerazzurri.</p>
              <p>The text reads: "Michael, you have all been great players regardless
              of the loss to Manchester United. On Monday I will sign for Inter and I
              hope that one day you too will come to Inter."</p>
              <p>It seems as if Mourinho will take half of the Chelsea squad with him
              if he signs, as Inter are also interested in Frank Lampard and Didier
              Drogba.</p>
              <p>Mancini has been linked with moves to Chelsea and Manchester City
              and if he does leave San Siro then the door would be wide open for
              Mourinho to walk in.</p>
              <p>Inter are desperate to win the Champions League and Moratti would
              prefer someone who has experience of victory in the competition in the
              past to take the reins at San Siro.</p>

              <p>Going to Inter would give him the easiest challenge of all...
                                      Even an inexperience manager like Mancini can win it 3 times in a
                                      row I don't see how he can lose... Serie A would be an easy job
                                      considering Juve are still far from the form before they
                                      were relegated, Roma don't have much money to buy quality players,
                                      AC going through a re-building and may even lose Kaka... So it will
                                      take a very poor manager to lose the league title from Inter's
                                      point of view...</p>

              <p><br> mancini did not win it 3x in a row. the 1st 2 was given to inter
                                      cos of the match fixing scandal</p>
              <p>...............................................................................................................................................</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Just like Man United ya? First 2 given by Refs. Let see if they win the 3rd one!</span></p>

              <p><br> FC Porto was a one off... and that Porto team had lots of quality
                                      players that are playing across Europe now... The present Porto may
                                      be a lot harder with the gap of $ against European leading clubs
                                      widening...</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's not a one-off. Who knows in the future there may be a coach who's like Jose, &amp; lead the team to kick a diving team like ManU again to oblivion!</span></p>

              <h1>Mourinho Takes Over At Inter</h1>
              <h2>According to Portuguese sports daily 'A Bola', Jose Mourinho and
              Inter have come to an agreement for the former Chelsea man to replace
              Roberto Mancini as coach.</h2>
              <p>It was reported in the Italian press earlier today that
              Mourinho had made up his mind that he wanted the job at Inter, but had issued
              the club’s President Massimo Moratti a deadline of midnight tonight to make or
              break the deal.<br><br>Moratti, who was said to be having second thoughts about whether or not to keep Roberto Mancini on, has now, according to <em>A Bola</em>, decided
              that Mourinho is indeed his man.<br><br>The 45-year-old has apparently been handed a three-year
              contract at San Siro, and will earn €9m per-season.<br><br>As part of the deal, Mourinho will immediately be allowed to
              sign former players Frank Lampard from Chelsea,
              and Deco from Barcelona,
              while Luis Figo will be handed a one-year extension to his current contract that runs
              out next month.<br><br>The Mancini era, which yielded three successive Scudetti
              appears now to be over, although it must be noted that there is still no
              official confirmation.</p>
