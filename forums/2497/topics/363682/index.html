              *VALENCIA REJECT BLUES` VILLA BID*
              .
              .
              
              *Valencia have turned down a reported offer from Chelsea for David Villa, with the Spain international seemingly set to join Real Madrid instead.*
              
              Chelsea's Spanish scout, Juan Cruz Sol, met with Los Che president Manuel Llorente on Thursday in the club's headquarters to discuss the future of the 27-year-old striker. 
              
              Cruz Sol spoke to the Spanish media after the meeting, with Valencian newspaper Levante quoting him as saying: "Chelsea made an important offer for him (Villa). "But the answer (from Valencia) was 'no' because negotiations with Real Madrid are very advanced. 
              
              "Hence, there's no possibility that Villa will go to Chelsea because he wants to go to Real Madrid. "The purpose of the meeting was to have have some contact and know with certainty what Villa's situation is. 
              
              "Now we have clear ideas and we know that to expect." Valencia president Manuel Llorente revealed an offer for Villa had been received but refused to confirm whether it was from Chelsea. 
              
              He told regional newspaper Las Provincias: "Yes, we have an offer for Villa but not from Spain." Speculation has been rife Valencia could be forced to sell prize assets Villa and David Silva to ease their financial worries. 
              
              Madrid splashed out Â£59million on Kaka on Monday and then had a world-record Â£80million bid accepted by Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo on Thursday morning. 
              
              And it seems their summer spending, as new president Florentino Perez looks to re-establish his 'galacticos' policy, may not end there. On whether he had spoken to Perez regarding Villa, Llorente added: "We had another conversation on Tuesday and we have started talking about the matter."

              *David Villa Will Sign For Real Madrid - Chelsea's Chief Spanish Scout*
              .
              
              David Villa looks set to join Real Madrid after Chelsea's chief scout in Spain revealed that the Valencia star is in advanced talks with the capital clubâ€¦
              .
              .
              
              *Real Madrid are on the brink of signing David Villa from Valencia after Chelsea were told that they had no chance of signing him, according to the Blues' Spanish scout*
              
              Juan Cruz Sol is the English team's representative in Spain and he stated that Chelsea have been given a firm "no" to their offer for the player because the Mestalla club are "in advanced negotiations with Real Madrid".
              
              The former Valencia and Madrid player confirmed that the Blues "had made an important offer for him", but he insisted that it was not for â‚¬48 million as has been reported.
              
              "Villa wants to go to Real Madrid" and things are "well advanced" meaning that Chelsea "recognise that and are waiting to see what happens".
              
              "He wants to join Madrid because he wants to stay in Spain and that is normal.
              
              "There is no chance of Villa going to Chelsea because he wants to now go to Madrid," he said according to Marca.
              
              Valencia had insisted that  â‚¬35 million for their striker would not be enough and reports in the Spanish media that Madrid had agreed to add Alvaro Negredo to the deal appear to be true.
              
              Real Madrid have already signed Kaka and have had a bid for Cristiano Ronaldo accepted, so the capture of Villa could make it a huge week for the Bernabeu-based outfit.

              usually pay in instalments one lar for such a vast sums of money. probably pay the sum over a few or many years de :)
              
              I guess RM will be selling Ronaldo and Kaka shirts and renegotiate its television deals with TV companies. I am sure now, many RM fans will quickly buy the new jerseys and put Ronaldo and Kaka names behind their jerseys :)
