We have always had to do that in the past and we'll do it again.<br><br>"We had a positive summer against Albania, Brazil and Estonia (a qualifier) where we gave fringe players a game, and we did that without Wayne.<br><br>"We've still got Peter Crouch, Owen may be available and there is also the likes of Alan Smith, Darren Bent, Andy Johnson, Jermain Defoe and David Nugent, players like that who have played for England and have proved that they can play at this level."<br><br><strong>Owen and Beckham hope</strong><br><br>McClaren is hopeful he will have Michael Owen to call on for the game, adding: "I spoke to him on Tuesday, he was very buoyant, of course he is frustrated to be injured.<br><br>"He's got a few more days' training, I think he plays in a friendly behind closed doors today and at the weekend. There are a few of those players (in the same situation)."<br><br>Likewise, it is also hoped former captain David Beckham will link-up with the squad.<br><br>"We've got to assess it over the next few days. He'll be in the squad, we want him to come over and play a part against Germany but it all depends on what happens this evening (when Galaxy face DC United in the SuperLiga).<br><br>"We'll be keeping in close contact with him and the Galaxy medical staff to see his condition.<br><br>"If at all possible of course we'd like David to join us on Monday."<br><br>McClaren refused to confirm whether the likes of Sol Campbell or David James would be recalled after spending the past year in the international wilderness, simply saying: "I'm not ruling out anybody at the moment."</div>
