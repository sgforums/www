              <p><strong>The main outline figures for the accounting year of 2010-11 were posted on <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea's</span> website on Tuesday afternoon, with the club announcing only a marginally reduced annual loss of £67.7 million compared with £70.9 million the previous year. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p><em>The Daily Telegraph</em> can disclose, however, that almost half of that loss was as a direct result of the compensation that was paid to Porto, Ancelotti and other departing staff as a result of the Villas-Boas appointment.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>Although the exact breakdown will not be revealed in the club’s accounts, a total figure of almost £30 million will be listed as costs associated with the change in manager. Around £15 million was paid simply to release Villas-Boas from his Porto contract.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Although Chelsea’s figures showed a reduction in losses of £3.2 million, the extraordinary costs associated with sacking Ancelotti and recruiting Villas-Boas do at least explain the unexpected overall increase in expenditure.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>With Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich determined to give Villas-Boas time, Chelsea are confident that they will be able to show their commitment to the new Uefa financial fair play regulations when they release their accounts for 2011-12.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>The 2011-12 accounting year is the first that will be monitored as part of the new Uefa Financial Fair Play regulations that are designed, ultimately, to force clubs not to spend more than they earn.</p>
              <p>In the short-term, the FFP rules require clubs to have losses of no more than €45 million (£37.7 million) in the two accounting years from 2011-12. Chelsea clearly remain a considerable distance from that target, but the full accounts for 2010-11 will also show that the overall wage bill reduced even with the expensive additions in that period of Fernando Torres and David Luiz.</p>
              <p>The club took satisfaction last night from a record turnover of £222.3 million. “The club is focused on complying with the requirements of Uefa’s financial fair play regulations while maintaining its ability to challenge for major trophies,” said chairman Bruce Buck. “We would expect this to be reflected in our results for the current financial year.”</p>
              <p>The increase in revenue was achieved largely through higher receipts from the Champions League as well as the Premier League’s improved overseas broadcast deal.</p>
