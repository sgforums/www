              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">IN the red corner is Arsene ‘The Professor’ Wenger. In the blue corner is 
              Juande ’Rambo’ Ramos.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Arsenal and Tottenham managers are ready to slug it out in a heavyweight 
              contest to be North London champs.</p>
              <p class="article">And ‘referee’ George Graham, who bossed both clubs, reckons granite-chinned 
              Ramos could spring a massive shock by winning the 38-game contest on points.</p>
              <p class="article">Graham has been impressed by Ramos’ achievements so far at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p class="article">The Scot believes Wenger could struggle to perform another yearly miracle with 
              his youngsters — despite striker Emmanuel Adebayor last night agreeing a new 
              four-year deal to stay at the Emirates.</p>
              <p class="article">Graham insisted: “Ramos looks like a good rival for Wenger in that he is calm, 
              talented and devoted to fitness and discipline.</p>
              <p class="article">“He has a real granite face and is not the kind of coach you’d like to upset. 
              I like that.</p>
              <p class="article">“I’ve enormous admiration for the football Wenger produces but he is happy to 
              stick with the kids this year.</p>
              <p class="article">“I’m concerned you can’t keep developing a new side each season.</p>
              <p class="article">“At the very top level you need a settled, consistent, experienced side.</p>
              <p class="article">Perhaps there are still some financial restrictions and Arsene is expected to 
              keep on pulling rabbits out of that hat every season with cheaper, unknown 
              young talents. It’s very, very hard to do year after year.</p>
              <p class="article">“Everyone thought last season was the one where Spurs would overhaul Arsenal 
              and overtake them for a Champions League place.</p>
              <p class="article">“But Arsenal got off to a flier and it just didn’t happen for Spurs.</p>
              <p class="article">“If I were Ramos this season, I’d be making noises in public about needing 
              time to gel and how this is my first full season. Privately, though, I’d 
              definitely be telling the Spurs players they are what they are — world-class 
              players.</p>
              <p class="article">“I’d be convincing them there is no reason not to target Arsenal. They must be 
              ready and push for fourth place if the Gunners slip up.</p>
              <p class="article">“It’s a massive ask and fifth would be a good achievement for Tottenham but 
              they must be ambitious in light of the talent they’ve bought.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ramos is not willing to keep any player whose heart is not at White Hart Lane 
              and has already sold Robbie Keane to Liverpool for £20million.</p>
              <p class="article">Dimitar Berbatov looks poised to follow and Graham backs Ramos’ tough 
              approach. He added: “If Robbie and Berbatov don’t want to stay, then let 
              them go and take the cash.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ramos has also brought in Croatian midfielder Luka Modric — one of the stars 
              of Euro 2008 — and Mexican magician Giovani Dos Santos.</p>
              <p class="article">And Graham is sure new £17m signing David Bentley can make a difference at the 
              Lane.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “Bentley is someone who does want to play for Tottenham.</p>
              <p class="article">“Spurs have bought a guy who enjoyed a superb playing education at the 
              football machine which Wenger has built at Arsenal although he had to move 
              to get on.</p>
              <p class="article">“I’ve been watching Bentley closely since he left Arsenal and I realised right 
              away that maybe he was a bit arrogant. But if a player has the class to back 
              it up, then I like that.”</p>
              <p class="article">Graham reckons Bentley will be the new hero and is backing the Spurs fans not 
              to give him stick for his Arsenal connections.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “The first few weeks, OK, there will be some Spurs diehards who’ll 
              give him a bit of grief. But I don’t think it will be evil or nasty for 
              Bentley at White Hart Lane.”</p>
