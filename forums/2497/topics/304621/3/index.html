            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm... Saw some clones and also some non clones posting in Sports regarding this incident... Therefore thought i should shed some light on it... at least from my side whoever is interested to hear...<br><br>It seems like some are not very happy to see or hear negative but true reports about an incident that happen barely 2 days ago... Particularly a number member.<br><br>Sadly, some people can't see the difference between something happen from something didn't happen. Or otherwise choose to condone rather than condemn an act of violence for reasons only they can explain... which i will not get into... I know that there are many different kind of supporters in here and a mixture of supporters from different clubs... Different news will interest different members. Unfortunately, some will be unhappy but some rational ones will understand even tho its their club being mentioned but sadly, some will never see the other way.<br><br>I am not saying i am always right, But i don't see why i am not allow post a topic on something that is true, reported in many major sports press? without being accuse. It is not something i created or pluck out of the air... These are actual stories that not only are the Press carrying but there are videos footage of the incident as well. I find it really weird that this particular member, just yesterday asked for freedom of speech and of expression so that he can continue to use foul words not only on other supporters club but also on fellow members in here and yet want to prevent others from posting proper news reports?<br><br>Anyway, I like to thank that TS for linking this thread over at his post... As many of you here can see from the first page to the third, I only posted what was publish and my personal opinion wasn't that of an extreme unlike one member we can see who alway bring in unrelated subjects to the topic being discuss for whatever reasons only he will know.<br><br>This particular member also likes to accuse or should i say create trouble whenever he comes around here... I understand from the years in this forum about his deep hatred towards man united and i can accept as he is entitle to. But i also ask him not to disrupt others from posting proper reported news as this is a news folder, everyone has a right to post. He is more than welcome to join in the discussion if he chooses to or stay out if he isn't happy with it. But please don't come here and create trouble...<br><br>Like the Arsenal folder, this place also don't encourage the used of foul/ bad/ vulgar/ coarse/ obscene words... Therefore we will appreciate if everyone can help out and refrain from using such words in here. There are many young teenagers in here, no need to help them get hook onto this unneccessary habit... At least not from here... Nothing cool about it really...  Actually looked rather silly to me.<br><br>Lastly, i like to say again. I may be a united fan but that does not mean no one is allow to post negative reports about them. Anyone is free to post negative man u news here, like i have said before, if its true or publish in the press, by all means, post! No one is stopping you, I myself have done so too when they have big negative news... So some people should get their facts right before making unsubstantiated remarks...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=277547" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=277547</a></div>
