I feel that everythinig went against us. We had to take many risks and we were open to counterattacks.<br><br>"We were not mature enough to stop it. The score is brutal and high, but it does not reflect what happened on the pitch. "With the first shot they scored, the second was an own goal and then they scored again straight after half time.

Arsene Wenger's young Guns were thrashed by a rampant Tottenham - their first victory over their north London rivals in 21 attempts stretching back to 1999. </strong><br><br>But there were extraordinary scenes in the second half when first William Gallas and then referee Howard Webb had to separate Adebayor and Bendtner in the Spurs box after 83 minutes. Arsenal captain Gallas said: "I don't know exactly what happened. I think everyone was disappointed about the game. It was very difficult to accept. They were nervous. "They know they made a mistake and maybe they will have to speak to the boss and explain why they did that. They are young and have to understand, but we lost our calm."<br><br>But predictably Wenger said he had not seen the incident, which ended with the Danish striker nursing a bloody nose. "I don't know anything about it," insisted the Gunners manager. "I don't know what you are talking about."<br><br>The incident was also seen by Matthieu Flamini, who shouted pleas to his team-mates to calm down from the substitutes bench. But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insisted: "I did not know anything about it. I didn't see it."<br></div>
