            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Adebayor sorry for Bendtner bust-up</strong><br><br>Emmanuel Adebayor has apologised for his bust-up with Arsenal team-mate Nicklas Bendtner during the Carling Cup semi-final defeat at Tottenham.<br><br>Adebayor - who was handed a four-match ban after being sent off just minutes after coming on in last season's Carling Cup final defeat to Chelsea - accepts tempers were allowed to boil over in the heated atmosphere, and offered an unreserved apology for his actions.<br><br>"I think that we should have been more calm during the game and although I was pleased to get a goal back for the team when I came on, I am sorry for the disagreement with my team-mate Nicklas," Adebayor said on the club's official website.<br><br>"We are both passionate about this club and sometimes that can be projected in the wrong way.<br><br>"It was a mistake. We want to focus on the games ahead and rely on our squad's great togetherness to achieve a fantastic season."<br><br>The 23-year-old has been in fine form for the Gunners, with his goal on Tuesday night when coming off the bench a 16th of the campaign.<br><br>Adebayor firmly believes the events at White Hart Lane will not unsettle Arsene Wenger's squad, which remains very much in the hunt for honours.<br><br>The Togo striker said: "We are a strong unit and what happened last night against Spurs will strengthen our desire and determination to compete for other targets."<br><br>Skipper Gallas has called for "upset" Arsenal to unite from their disappointment - and knock revitalised Newcastle out of the FA Cup this weekend.<br><br>Wenger reflected afterwards the defeat was all part of the "learning process" and maintained he had "no regrets" about selection policy in a competition which is clearly not the Gunners' main priority.<br><br>However, the likes of skipper Gallas, Cesc Fabregas, Alex Hleb, Gilberto and Adebayor, all featured at some stage - but their experience could not, on this occasion, help bring the best out of the likes of Justin Hoyte, Abou Diaby, Bendtner and a particularly disappointing Theo Walcott.<br><br>Gallas, though, insists now is the time to look forwards and not reflect on what might have been as the Gunners saw their near nine-year unbeaten run against Spurs come to an abrupt end.<br><br>"All the young boys wanted to go to Wembley and I know it is difficult to accept," said the French defender.<br><br>"The fans are upset and we are upset. All the club are upset - and we have to accept it.<br><br>"Now we have to be strong and forget everything because on Saturday we have another big game which will not be easy."<br><br>Gallas declared: "We have to forget this game and we have to be focused.<br><br>"We have to be strong because Newcastle have a new manager and they want a result at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>"For us we have to win that game because we have some ambition."</div>

We want to focus on the games ahead and rely on our squad's great togetherness to achieve a fantastic season."<br><br>The 23-year-old has been in fine form for the Gunners, with his goal on Tuesday night when coming off the bench a 16th of the campaign.<br><br>Adebayor firmly believes the events at White Hart Lane will not unsettle Arsene Wenger's squad, which remains very much in the hunt for honours.<br><br>The Togo striker said: "We are a strong unit and what happened last night against Spurs will strengthen our desire and determination to compete for other targets."<br><br>Skipper Gallas has called for "upset" Arsenal to unite from their disappointment - and knock revitalised Newcastle out of the FA Cup this weekend.<br><br>Wenger reflected afterwards the defeat was all part of the "learning process" and maintained he had "no regrets" about selection policy in a competition which is clearly not the Gunners' main priority.<br><br>However, the likes of skipper Gallas, Cesc Fabregas, Alex Hleb, Gilberto and Adebayor, all featured at some stage - but their experience could not, on this occasion, help bring the best out of the likes of Justin Hoyte, Abou Diaby, Bendtner and a particularly disappointing Theo Walcott.<br><br>Gallas, though, insists now is the time to look forwards and not reflect on what might have been as the Gunners saw their near nine-year unbeaten run against Spurs come to an abrupt end.<br><br>"All the young boys wanted to go to Wembley and I know it is difficult to accept," said the French defender.<br><br>"The fans are upset and we are upset. All the club are upset - and we have to accept it.<br><br>"Now we have to be strong and forget everything because on Saturday we have another big game which will not be easy."<br><br>Gallas declared: "We have to forget this game and we have to be focused.<br><br>"We have to be strong because Newcastle have a new manager and they want a result at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>"For us we have to win that game because we have some ambition."[/b]</blockquote>well he has apologized and I hope both of them forgive and just forget.</div>
