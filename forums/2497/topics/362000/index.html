              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Chelsea are reportedly set to finalise the signing of CSKA Moscow's Yuri Zhirkov for £18.6million, with the Russian poised to pen a four-year deal.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Blues are known to have been long-term admirers of the 25-year-old, who can play anywhere down the left side.</p>
              <p>One of Zhirkov's representatives is quoted in Russian newspaper <em>Tvoi Den</em> as stating that the CKSA Moscow man has already signed a four-year deal.</p>
              <p>It is believed that Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich personally brokered the deal with CSKA owner, and close friend, Evgeny Giner.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's interim boss Guus Hiddink, who is leaving Stamford Bridge in the summer, has fully backed the move, as he knows all about the player from his role as Russian coach.</p>
              <p>Hiddink feels Zhirkov is a huge talent, saying: "I know that Yuri is not just a nice person but one of the best attacking left sided players in the world."</p>
              <p>CSKA always knew that Chelsea, who say it is currently paper talk, wanted Zhirkov and coach Zico admitted he would fit in well at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>"I will not stand in the way of this transfer," said Zico earlier this month. "A player of Zhirkov's quality could very well play in the English Premier League. "I see him as a player in the London club's starting XI."</p>

              <h1>Chelsea hand Malouda new deal as Zhirkov warns: I won't come join to be Florent's stand-in</h1>
              <p><img src="http://172.31.254.244/i.dailymail.co.ukk/i/pix/2009/06/03/article-1190519-052554A5000005DC-150_468x452.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="452"></p>
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti is set to offer new contracts to Florent Malouda and Alex as he shapes his <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html">Chelsea </a>side for next season.</p>
              <p>Malouda
              struggled after signing from Lyon for £13.5million in 2007, but has won
              over fans and the Stamford Bridge hierarchy in the second half of the
              season.</p>
              <p>CSKA Moscow star Yuri Zhirkov had been lined up to replace him and today warned he would not be happy to sit on the Blues bench.</p>
              <p><img src="http://172.31.254.241/i.dailymail.co.ukk/i/pix/2009/06/03/article-1190519-05222A78000005DC-831_306x316.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="316"></p>
              <p>Versatile Zhirkov, who tends to play left-back for Russia, said:
              'Clearly we are talking about one of the best clubs in the world, who
              regularly compete at the highest level.</p>
              <p>'It is very possible I would say yes (to Chelsea). But before that I would have to weigh up the pros and cons.</p>
              <p>'To sit on the bench and only get on the pitch from time to time doesn't interest me, not even at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>'Moreover,
              I have nothing to lose (by staying in Moscow), given that CSKA now have
              a very interesting team who will begin competing in the Champions
              League in the autumn.'</p>
              <p>Chelsea are understood to be close to an £18.6million deal for the 25-year-old, but face competition from Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>Malouda
              has only 12 months of his deal left to run but is expected to get a
              two-year extension with a pay rise from £50,000 a week to around
              £65,000 a week.</p>
              <p>'We will have a meeting at the beginning of June,' he told the <span style="font-style: italic;">London Evening Standard</span>. 'Both parties want to carry on.</p>
              <p>'It’s a wonderful experience but just the beginning. I hope in the next years you will see me win many, many trophies.</p>
              <p>'When
              you play so many high-profile games you get the experience and
              confidence that comes with it. I hope to share joy and happiness with
              the fans.'</p>
              <p>When asked if he is ready to compete with Zhirkov
              should he arrive, Malouda added: 'Of course. It’s just the beginning
              because with Ashley Cole on the left we have confidence so it gives us
              a lot for the next years.'</p>
              <p><strong>Alex is also going to be rewarded for a number of impressive displays this season with a three-year deal</strong> that will see his salary increase to £60,000 a week. His current
              contract expires next year but the new agreement will ensure the
              defender remains at the club until 2013.</p>
