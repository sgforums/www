              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger celebrated his 60th birthday on Thursday by telling the Arsenal General Meeting he was convinced his young side could end their trophy drought this season.</strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners boss addressed shareholders at Emirates Stadium on Thursday morning, when he used the platform to once again champion the potential of his youthful squad.</p>
              <p>Despite an appearance in the Champions League final, Arsenal have not got their hands on any silverware since the 2005 FA Cup.</p>
              <p>Wenger, though, maintains that can all change come May 2010, his team having won six from eight Barclays Premier League games so far and looking well placed to reach the last 16 of Europe's elite club competition.</p>
              <p>"I know that we haven't won a trophy for four years, but we have been very close and I believe that this year the team will do it," said Wenger.</p>
              <p>"When I say that, it is not to please you, it is because I am really convinced of it. "This season we are ready to go for it in the Premier League, the Champions League and of course both the cups as well."</p>
              <p>Wenger, whose side were hit by a stoppage-time equaliser against AZ Alkmaar on Tuesday night, added: "We are in October and we know it will be very tight - it will come down to how resilient, consistent, intelligent and united we are until the end.</p>
              <p>"There will be periods when it will be difficult, but we have to show our strengths that has always made this club special."</p>
              <p>Wenger has certainly put plenty of time and faith in his latest crop of talent, now led by the likes of captain Cesc Fabregas and Dutch striker Robin van Persie.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal manager firmly believes that can all start to pay off with consistent results on the pitch over the next seven months.</p>
              <p>"Its not just about pumping money into the team. There is a magic in our sport and our club," said Wenger, who recently became the longest serving manager in Arsenal's history.</p>
              <p>"We have developed the team in the last four of five years with a tremendous amount of training to develop them how we want.</p>
              <p>"I believe a team is easier to develop if they are grown up inside the club, from 16 even younger because they learn to love the club and what it represents."</p>
              <p>Wenger, who takes Arsenal to struggling West Ham on Sunday, added: "I believe it is essential that we maintain our values in the club.</p>
              <p>"It is important that we are proud of the Arsenal way, the way we play the game and develop players.</p>
              <p>"You cannot be a big club and have a small culture. You have to have a desire to see quality in what to do."</p>
              <p>Wenger received a standing ovation and was presented with a book of signed birthday messages from shareholders.</p>
