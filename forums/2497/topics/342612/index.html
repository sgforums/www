              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood has revealed he has turned down a transfer request from wantaway Gunners defender Kolo Toure.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The centre-back has failed
              to secure a regular spot in the first-team plans of manager Arsene
              Wenger this season and Manchester City are thought to be considering a
              bid.</p>
              <p>Hill-Wood is aware that the £10million-rated Ivory Coast
              international has indicated that he is keen to leave Emirates Stadium,
              but he insists the Gunners are not looking to sell.</p>
              <p>"I know about it (the transfer request)," Hill-Wood said in the Daily Star. "But we are not going to accept it.</p>
              <p>"We are not looking to let any of our players go and he is under contract - and we expect him to honour it."</p>
              <p>Toure joined Arsenal seven years ago and is the last member of
              'The Invincibles' squad, which remained undefeated for the duration of
              2003/04, still at the club.</p>

              <p>Toure is leaving cos he see the crack within the squad and there is not point staying in a losing squad.</p>
              <p>As for Gallas, I believe that he belong to the old school of hard knocks and expects every one around to do so.</p>
              <p>But, his hard core approach does not blend well with the new players who are more concerned about fun.</p>
              <p>You can see that although the squad have let him down, he is still a true professional as he play hard when he is fielded.</p>
              <p>You have to respect him for that.</p>

              <h1>Wenger declares Toure will stay</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/arsenal/toure-stoke.jpg" alt=""><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has dismissed suggestions that Kolo Toure could be
              poised to leave Arsenal following the defender’s decision to hand in a
              transfer request at Emirates Stadium.</strong></p>
              <p>Chairman Peter Hill-Wood confirmed on New Year’s Day that Toure had
              asked to leave the club, with reports claiming that he was
              disillusioned with a lack of playing time and that he had fallen out
              with fellow defender William Gallas.</p>
              <p>Manchester City has been mentioned as a possible destination for
              Arsenal’s longest-serving player but Wenger has firmly ruled out a
              January exit for the veteran of the 2003-2004 ‘Invincibles’ season.</p>
              <p>"The situation is that Kolo is a player who has two-and-a-half-year contract and will remain with us," said Wenger.</p>
              <p>"I am happy with players who are committed and Kolo is a big example.</p>
              <p>"There was a minor incident that you can multiply by 20. It happens
              every day in every club which is sorted out. Kolo is happy here.</p>
              <p>"We have a very young and compact squad and I don't expect anybody to leave."</p>
