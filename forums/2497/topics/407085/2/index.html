              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA are weighing up a move for South Korea World Cup star Chu-Young Park.</h2>
              <p>The Monaco striker's representatives met with Blues boss Carlo Ancelotti, sporting director Frank Arnesen and chief executive Ron Gourlay before their opening-day 6-0 win against West Brom.</p>
              <p>And Chelsea will decide within the next 48 hours whether to meet Monaco's £8million asking price for the 25-year-old - who started all four of South Korea's games at this summer's World Cup.</p>
              <p>The deal could give Chelsea a chance to break into the lucrative Far East market, where Park is second only to Manchester United's Ji-Sung Park in terms of stature.</p>
              <p>Chelsea will play against a Thailand All Stars XI in Bangkok next summer as part of their pre-season preparations and may go on to tour South Korea.</p>
              <p>If Park was playing then the club could charge up to £2m in match fees which, along with increased shirt sales, would make the deal virtually self-sufficient.</p>
              <p>And the Premier League champions also hope it would encourage sponsors Samsung - whose current deal runs until the end of the 2012-13 season - to extend their contract.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">BRAZILIAN wonderkid Neymar will be a Chelsea player in the future - according to his new international agent Pini Zahavi.</h2>
              <p>The Blues recently failed with a £23million move for the attacking midfielder and Neymar, 18, signed a six-month extension to his 4½-year contract with home club Santos.</p>
              <p>Neymar has also penned a two-year agreement with Zahavi to represent him outside Brazil, increasing his chances of a move to Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Zahavi told SunSport: "Neymar will stay with Santos but I'm sure he will become a Chelsea player eventually.</p>
              <p>"He loves Santos and wants to win the Copa Libertadores, South America's most important competition.</p>
              <p>"But Neymar also knows that for his career he needs to move to a big club."</p>
              <p>Neymar has a £37m release clause in his new deal. His possible move to Chelsea caused a storm in Brazil this summer with the likes of Pele campaigning for him to stay.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA defender Michael Mancienne has rejoined Wolves on a season-long loan.</h2>
              <p>The England Under-21 international spent last term at Molineux after impressing during a brief loan spell the season before.</p>
              <p>Wolves were keen to secure a permanent deal this summer but were unable to agree terms with the Blues.</p>
              <p>Mancienne, 22, said: "It didn't look like anything was going to happen with Chelsea and I want to play.</p>
              <p>"Wolves have been very good to me in the past and I'm delighted to be back.</p>
              <p>"In a way it feels like I'm coming back home and I'm really looking forward to the season.</p>
              <p>"There were other alternatives but the gaffer here has been really good to me, had faith in me and helped me improve my game.</p>
              <p>"That played a big part in my decision."</p>
              <p>Mancienne is a centre-back by trade but can also operate as a holding midfielder.</p>

              <p>It was claimed the Monaco striker's representatives had met with Blues boss Carlo Ancelotti, sporting director Frank Arnesen and chief executive Ron Gourlay to discuss an £8million move.</p>
              <p>Yet a Chelsea source insisted: "We did receive some correspondence with regard to Park but that is as far it went.</p>
              <p>"It is wrong to think we want to sign him or suggest there have been any meetings with his agents. He is not about to become a Chelsea player."</p>
