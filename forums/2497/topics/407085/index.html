              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="LINE-HEIGHT: 1.05em; FONT-SIZE: 1.05em">ASHLEY COLE was last night told to forget any idea of quitting Chelsea.</h2>
              <p>Boss Carlo Ancelotti said there was no chance Cole will be reunited with Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti was adamant the England left-back, troubled by private life problems, is not for sale at <strong>ANY</strong> price.</p>
              <p>And after the 2-1 defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt yesterday, Ancelotti said: "Ashley Cole is a Chelsea player and he will remain a Chelsea player.</p>
              <p>"Everyone can forget the idea he will leave this club.</p>
              <p>"There is no way that will happen. We believe he is the best left-back in the world and because of that he'll stay. There is no price that will make us sell."</p>
              <p>Cole, 29, has been under fire since his split with pop star wife Cheryl Tweedy last year following revelations of sordid text sex with other women.</p>
              <p>Now Cole, who signed a £100,000-a-week deal to 2013 last summer, is hoping ex-Blues boss Mourinho will make a £20million move for him.</p>
              <p>But Ancelotti said: "It is only normal that Mourinho has a good relationship with Ashley. But I'm not interested in the relationship any of my players have with other coaches. Cole is staying."</p>

              <p class="small bold">The Blues are among those interested in the Dutch international full-back, who was close to a move to Bayern Munich before talks broke down.</p>
              <p class="small bold">Carlo Ancelotti, also tracking Benfica's David Luiz, is intent on bolstering his defence for the new season.</p>
              <p class="small bold">But Van Der Wiel, 22, a player Ajax are willing to sell, will clearly cost him big bucks.</p>
              <p class="small bold">Ajax boss Martin Jol has been told players must leave if he wants to buy this summer.</p>

              <p>Chelsea boss Ancelotti coached the Brazilian playmaker during their time together at AC Milan.</p>
              <p>Reports have suggested new Real supremo Jose Mourinho is willing to cash in on the £65million forward, leading to speculation the Blues could swoop.</p>
              <p>But Ancelotti claims there is no chance of a reunion with his 28-year-old former protégé.</p>
              <p>He said: "Kaka cannot come to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"He was one player of mine and has done so much for Milan but now he belongs to Real Madrid and he will decide about his future along with his current club.</p>

              <p>The Portuguese club own just 20 per cent of the Brazilian World Cup star after selling third-party ownership to several investors, including controversial agent Kia Joorabchian.</p>
              <p>And though Benfica want to keep Ramires for another season, Joorabchian and his partners are pressing for the move to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Club president Luis Felipe Vieira admitted last night: "Ramires staying at Benfica does not depend solely on us. There is a partnership and we must respect it.</p>
              <p>"If there is a good proposal we will do everything we can to make it work for us. We are prepared for all eventualities and have options to fill all the positions."</p>
              <p>Ramires, 23, was left out of Benfica's friendly against Aston Villa on Sunday as negotiations continued.</p>
              <p>Now Chelsea are confident of signing the tough-tackling star ahead of Sunday's Community Shield clash with Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Blues boss Carlo Ancelotti has earmarked Ramires to take over the central midfield role vacated by Michael Ballack and Joe Cole.</p>
              <p>He will be Ancelotti's first major buy since taking charge last year and will represent Chelsea's most expensive deal since they spent £24.4m on Michael Essien in 2005.</p>
              <p>The arrival of Ramires, nicknamed 'The Blue Kenyan' for his running ability, will mean at least one of Chelsea's foreign legion - most likely Fluminense target Deco - will have to go to comply with new Premier League rules.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA have locked up a deal to sign Brazil midfield star Ramires from Benfica for £18.2million.</h2>
              <p>The Portuguese champions revealed the move will go through subject to the player passing a medical.</p>
              <p>Ramires, 23, only joined Benfica from Cruzeiro in May 2009 and a month later earned his first senior cap for Brazil.</p>
              <p>He then played a key part in the Benfica team which won the title in May - making a total of 26 appearances and scoring four goals.</p>
              <p>And the pacy Samba star has since earned another 15 caps, including four at this year's World Cup in South Africa.</p>
              <p>Benfica president Luis Felipe Vieira had raised concerns over the deal and said: "Ramires staying at Benfica does not depend solely on us."</p>
              <p>But any fears of the transfer hitting a stumbling block over third-party ownership have proved to be unfounded.</p>
              <p>Ramires is only the second Blues summer signing after Liverpool star Yossi Benayoun.</p>

              <p>The Brazilian was in two minds about leaving Benfica for the Premier League champions but the former Gunners, his World Cup team-mates, told him England was right for him.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Ramires, 23, said: "Gilberto, Julio Baptista and others gave me confidence by insisting I must accept this chance.</p>
              <p>"In the end the Chelsea proposition was impossible to reject - not just because of the money but the chance to spend every day at one of the best clubs in the world.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLO ANCELOTTI has dismissed reports he is planning a swoop for Portuguese full-back Fabio Coentrao.</h2>
              <p>Coentrao has been rumoured to be on Chelsea's radar as speculation continues over Real Madrid's interest in Ashley Cole.</p>
              <p>But boss Ancelotti said the stories were "complete rubbish" before reiterating that he does not intend to sell Cole, who he calls "the best left back in the world".</p>
              <p>Coentrao's Benfica team-mate Ramires is close to completing a move to Stamford Bridge, though Ancelotti refused to comment on the player until the move is completed.</p>
              <p>He said: "I don't want to speak about Ramires.</p>
              <p>"We don't want to speak about these players because Sunday, we will have a very important game against Manchester United."</p>
              <p>The lack of transfer activity at Stamford Bridge this summer signifies a new attitude from Ancelotti and owner Roman Abramovich with both men keen to introduce more young players into the squad.</p>
              <p>The Italian is confident this approach will help his side repeat their success of last season when they won the Double.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti added: "For us, after a fantastic season, it was very difficult to change this squad.</p>
              <p>"We were totally agreed to maintain this squad.</p>
              <p>"To put some young players in this squad from our academy, this was our aim."</p>
              <p>With this youthful approach, Ancelotti affirmed his support for the new Premier League rules.</p>
              <p>This season clubs are restricted to a squad of 25 with eight 'home-grown' players, although any number of under 21s can be used in addition.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti added: "I don't have a problem being given the opportunity to put home-grown players in the squad. It is a good thing for English football."</p>

              <p>The ex-Barcelona star, 32, has signed a two-year contract and joins for an undisclosed fee.</p>

              <p>"After intense negotiations, the player got his release from the English club and will sign a two-year contract with the Tricolor."</p>
              <p>Deco, who was born in Brazil, joined Chelsea from Barcelona in 2008, signed by Luiz Felipe Scolari.</p>
              <p>But he failed to shine during his two seasons at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>He won the Champions League twice, with Barca in 2006 and Porto, under Jose Mourinho, in 2004.</p>
              <p>He will link up at Fluminense with old Chelsea team-mate Juliano Belletti.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIDIER DROGBA insists he is not interested in a switch to Manchester City.</h2>
              <p>The Chelsea striker, who was the Premier League's top scorer last season, has been mooted as a £20million target for City.</p>
              <p>But he said: "Every summer there is speculation, you saw me in a Chelsea shirt on Sunday and I think that is how you will see me all season!"</p>
              <p>Ivory Coast star Drogba admits City will challenge last year's top four for the title this season.</p>
              <p>He added: "We saw last year that Tottenham were there fighting for fourth place.</p>
              <p>"Arsenal were there, so the league will be more open, with Manchester City spending more money and buying quality players."</p>
              <p>Drogba was doubtful for the start of Chelsea's Premier League campaign after a hernia operation.</p>
              <p>The surgery sorted a long-term problem for Drogba and he is now fit and firing.</p>
              <p>Drogba said: "For the last six years I was struggling and it was difficult sometimes.</p>
              <p>"I had to miss some training sessions but I am really happy because it's done and it is really good for me.</p>
              <p>"I learned how to play with it, and now maybe I will have to change my game again."</p>
              <p>Drogba scored 37 goals for the Blues last season and won Chelsea's Player of the Year award.</p>
              <p>"I don't know if I can do better than last year, this is a lot of pressure!</p>
              <p>"But the thing is I feel more free in my movement on the pitch, much better.</p>
              <p>"It is a strange feeling, but a really good feeling."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA have sold young winger Scott Sinclair to Championship side Swansea.</h2>
              <p>The move re-unites Sinclair with former Blues reserve team coach Brendan Rodgers.</p>
              <p>And Sinclair, 21, cannot wait to get started with his new club.</p>
              <p>He said: "I like the way Swansea play and I though it would be great to be part of that.</p>
              <p>"I had the chance to go out on loan again, but I felt it was in my best interest to go somewhere permanent.</p>
              <p>"I want to be at a club for the next few years rather than somewhere else for just six months.</p>
              <p>"I obviously know the manager from our days together at Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"He knows everything about me and hopefully I can do well for him and the club.</p>
              <p>"He was a major factor in me joining Swansea. He's a great man and a great manager; I can't say a bad word about him.</p>
              <p>"He's got a lot of knowledge of the game, especially from working under the likes of Jose Mourinho.</p>
              <p>"I have the utmost respect for him as a coach and manager."</p>
              <p>Sinclair made just five appearances for Chelsea in five years at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>His career so far has been dominated by loan moves. Last year he spent the season at Wigan - his <strong>SEVENTH</strong> different loan club in three years.</p>

              <p>Begovic arrived at the Britannia Stadium from Portsmouth during last season's winter transfer window.</p>
              <p>And Pulis has no intention of letting the 23-year-old Bosnian international leave.</p>

              <p>Pulis said: "He's a very talented young player, but whether we do the deal is another thing.</p>
              <p>"It's not just Stoke interested but three or four others."</p>

              <p>The Swedish striker joined the Spaniards from Inter Milan last summer in a £60million deal which saw Samuel Eto'o move the other way.</p>
              <p>But the arrival of £35m hitman David Villa could see Ibrahimovic's chances at the Nou Camp limited next season.</p>
              <p>Manchester City and Chelsea have both been linked with the 28-year-old but the former Ajax ace says he intends to stay put — for now.</p>
              <p>Ibrahimovic said: "I'm very happy there is an interest in me but I have four years more with Barcelona.</p>
              <p>"I will not leave because I am very happy there and I play with the best team in the world.</p>
              <p>"I'm very happy to stay but if clubs are interested in me, I take it as a compliment. It means I'm doing a good job."</p>
              <p>Ibrahimovic admitted he would be keen on a move to England later on in his career.</p>
              <p>He added: "To play in England one day — absolutely. I feel I can give much more and I can still develop.</p>
              <p>"You never know what happens in football, in 24 hours a lot of things can change."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CHELSEA stars kick off the new season today at war with owner Roman Abramovich.</h2>
              <p>The billionaire Russian has infuriated his Double winners by scrapping and slashing the squad's bonuses.</p>
              <p>A Chelsea insider said: "The players are furious and there is a huge row going on behind the scenes.</p>
              <p>"They're champions and are rewarded with a pay cut - it's hardly a great way to motivate them.</p>
              <p>"It was a big shock and they're not happy. Now they're going into the season under a cloud."</p>
              <p>Stunned Blues players - who face West Brom in today's Premier League opener - were given the news at a meeting with director Eugene Tenebaum and chief executive Ron Gourlay.</p>
              <p>They were told Rom has done away with all appearance bonuses and cash tied to performances and results.</p>
              <p>The only bonuses this term will be for <strong>WINNING</strong> the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup or Carling Cup. And they will get nowhere near previous season's figures.</p>
              <p>Our insider added: "They thought it was it was just a normal pre-season meeting.</p>
              <p>"But instead they were told it was all change and most of the bonuses they'd enjoyed had been scrapped or reduced."</p>

              <p><strong>German international midfielder Michael Ballack's woes know no end as it was revealed on Sunday he has been dethroned as the most marketable German player according to Wirtschaftswoche magazine.</strong></p>
              <p>The 33-year-old - who is in danger of being permanently replaced as German captain after missing the World Cup through injury - is ranked only the 11th most marketable player in German football according to consultancy firm Batten &amp; Company.</p>
              <p>Ballack - who has moved to one of his former clubs Bayer Leverkusen after being released by English Premier League champions Chelsea - has been replaced as the king of German football by his former Bayern Munich team-mate Bastian Schweinsteiger.</p>
              <p>Batten and Company estimate that Schweinsteiger's potential earnings per year in commercial and sponsorships is 20.7million euros ahead of Bayern team-mates Dutch star winger Arjen Robben (17.5million euros) and French playmaker Franck Ribery (15.8million euros).</p>
              <p>Ballack is rated with a value of 8.1million euros and in a sign of the changing fortunes of German football has been surpassed by young talents Mesut Ozil (12.2million euros) and Thomas Mueller (10.9million euros).</p>

              <p>The Chelsea striker's international career appears to be over as that rules him out of the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign - and he will be 33 when the tournament starts.</p>
              <p>Anelka was sent home from South Africa in disgrace for insulting coach Raymond Domenech at half-time in the 2-0 group-game defeat to Mexico.</p>
              <p>Le Sulk allegedly told Domenech: "Go f*** yourself, you dirty son of a whore."</p>
              <p>The entire Les Bleus squad went on strike at training in support of the hitman before they exited the showpiece a couple of days later.</p>
              <p>Anelka was one of five men called before the French Football Federation's disciplinary commission but did not appear at the four-hour hearing in Paris.</p>
              <p>Manchester United star Patrice Evra, who made the trip and was captain during the saga, received a five-match ban.</p>
              <p>Franck Ribery earned a three-game suspension while midfielder Jeremy Toulalan must sit out one match.</p>
              <p>Defender Eric Abidal escaped further punishment after being left out of Laurent Blanc's first game in charge against Norway last week, along with the rest of the 23-man party.</p>
              <p>Commission president Jean Mazzella said: "We wanted Anelka's sanction to set an example."</p>
              <p>Former France team director Jean-Louis Valentin, who quit when the players went on strike, said: "As a lover and supporter of the France team, I think everyone deserves a second chance.</p>
              <p>"The players seemed sincerely sorry for what happened."</p>

              <p>It is a stinging snub for Blues boss Carlos Ancelotti, a keen admirer of the striker who has agreed a new five-year deal with the Brazilians.</p>
              <p>The 18-year-old's get-out clause was £30m but Chelsea offered little over half that amount. The new deal comes with a new £38.5m release clause.</p>
              <p>Santos quadrupled Neymar's wages to £55,000 a week to stave off Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The striker said: "I spoke with my dad a lot and I decided to stay.</p>
              <p>"Money itself doesn't bring happiness. I am happy here at Santos and I want to go on being happy here."</p>
              <p>Santos president Luiz Alvaro said: "Chelsea refused to pay the release clause. The fact we have kept this boy shows Brazilian clubs are no longer hostages to Europe."</p>

              <p>Anelka, 31, was suspended by the French Football Federation after being sent home from the World Cup.</p>
              <p>The striker responded by claiming he had already retired from international football and branded the FFF as 'clowns'.</p>
              <p>But Ancelotti does not believe the punishment fits the crime.</p>
              <p>He said: "I think it was unfair for him — 18 games is too much.</p>
              <p>"I don't know what happened there but Anelka is an honest man and he didn't deserve the decision.</p>
              <p>"It is good news for myself because he can stay here to train during the international break, he can maintain a good condition.</p>
              <p>"But for him it is not good news because every player wants to play in the national team.</p>
              <p>"Anelka has reacted very well. He has taken it with good spirit."</p>
              <p>Anelka is set to retain his place in Chelsea's starting line-up when they visit Wigan tomorrow.</p>
              <p>But Ancelotti has warned his troops not to expect an easy ride at the DW Stadium — despite their 6-0 thrashing of West Brom on the opening day.</p>
              <p>The Italian added: "It is very important we make a good start, not just one game. Last year we won the first six games in the league and we want to do the same.</p>
              <p>"I will be happy if we win 1-0. It is important to keep a clean sheet. Winning 6-0 or 7-0 every week is not football.</p>
              <p>"It is important to win and to play well. We have to pay attention. The last game at Wigan we lost 3-1.</p>
              <p>"We have to prepare well for this game and be right mentally. They caused us a lot of problems there last season, it was our first defeat, and we want to continue our good start to the season.</p>
              <p>"They started the season badly and lost at home against Blackpool. They will want to be strong and have power tomorrow to produce a different game."</p>

              <p>Israel midfielder Benayoun, 30, has yet to make his full debut for the Blues after joining them from Liverpool this summer.</p>
              <p>But he staked a claim for a starting berth by scoring his first Chelsea goal after coming on in Saturday's 6-0 humiliation of Wigan.</p>
              <p>Benayoun claims his current bit-part role is no different from his early days at Liverpool, and he is confident of proving himself at Stamford Bridge, just as he did at Anfield.</p>
              <p>He said: "I know I can do it. I did it before in my career. When I arrived at Liverpool, I knew I had to wait on the bench and try to change games, and now I'm also doing it for Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"When you come to a big club you need to be patient because there are a lot of quality players, but I just want to prove that I deserve to be here every chance that I get.</p>
              <p>"I enjoy playing anywhere, and every minute I am on the pitch. I can play anywhere in the three in midfield or the three up front."</p>
              <p>Benayoun has played barely an hour of first-team football for his new club and scored just 11 minutes after coming on at the DW Stadium on Saturday.</p>
              <p>He said: "It's always a good feeling to get your first goal for a new club, but the most important thing was the win. To win 6-0 has lifted the confidence of the team.</p>
              <p>"It was very difficult at first. We know what to expect from the Premier League and knew that after Wigan lost 4-0 to Blackpool, they would be ready to fight.</p>
              <p>"But we are a strong team with a lot of character and quality. We will win a lot of games."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem are expecting to sign Chelsea youngsters Slobodan Rajkovic and Nemanja Matic on loan. A third Chelsea youngster, Jacob Mellis, is also being linked with Vitesse.</p>

              <p>The Blues have rejected a £3m bid to take the England Under-21 star to Molineux on a permanent deal.</p>
              <p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is digging in on his £5m valuation for the centre-half, who has been limited to just 10 appearances for the Blues in four years.</p>
              <p>Mancienne, 22, spent last season on loan at Wolves and is heading back there on another 12-month deal - and will be a key figure in Mick McCarthy's plans.</p>
              <p>He is behind skipper John Terry and Brazilian Alex in the Chelsea pecking order.</p>
              <p>But Portuguese centre-half Ricardo Carvalho leaving to join up with Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid has made Chelsea dig their heels in.</p>
              <p>And a recent cash squeeze with long-term plans to make Chelsea profitable and ease the burden on Abramovich's cash has made the club take a tougher stance in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>Blues' Serbian duo Nemanja Matic, 22, and Slobodan Rajkovic, 21, will spend the season on loan at Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem.</p>
