              <p>yes they have lost a game I think last month. ya their league form is incredible. best team playing good football at the moment. it helps when you have messi, the best player in the world and the duo in Iniesta and Xavi pulling the strings in midfield for you.</p>

              <p><strong>Franck Ribery has delivered a crushing snub to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>by insisting he will move to Spain if he leaves Bayern Munich this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>The France winger has put off contract talks with the German giants and admits he is struggling to make a decision about where he should play next season. But the 26-year-old is certain that he won't be the man to add a bit of fantasy to Chelsea's Champions League failures.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'Although Chelsea are obviously a big club, if I were to decide against Bayern, then I would certainly go to Spain,' Ribery told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sport Bild </span>magazine. </p>
              </div>
              <p>Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is understood to be a huge admirer of the former Marseille star and would have been prepared to bankroll a British-record bid, but Ribery's wife appears to have scuppered the move.</p>
              <p>Ribery revealed his Algerian partner Wahiba had struggled to make friends in Munich and is not fond of the cold winters, but he has not closed the door on signing a new five-year deal at Bayern.</p>
              <p>'I can assure you that no decision has yet been taken,' he said. 'I would be lying if I said I wasn't leaning in one direction, but I have to take into account several factors, not only what is good for me but for my wife and my children.</p>

              <p>'Here it rains and even snows. She (Wahiba) is often alone when I am not there. She doesn't have many friends, but it doesn't mean that we don't feel good in Munich.</p>

              <p>Bayern are desperate to keep their star man and had initially set a deadline for the end of March to conclude talks. However, the player has tried to stall negotiations and is ready to spark a scrap between Barcelona and Real Madrid for his signature.</p>
              <p>His employers have conceded they will be forced to sell this summer if they fail to convince him to pen a new contract, otherwise he could leave on a Bosman free at the end of next season.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United </span></a>also enquired about Ribery after selling Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid last summer, but they backed off at Bayern's request.</p>
              <p>'Real and Barcelona are, perhaps alongside Manchester United and Chelsea, above all other clubs,' said Ribery. 'I am also only human. If you have an offer from such a club you should be allowed to consider it. It's where the world's best players play.</p>
              <p>Admitting that a decision could be made 'very quickly' in the next few weeks, insisting that sporting considerations rather than money will prove the decisive factor.</p>
              <p>'Barcelona have built a team for the term,' he said. 'Everyone in the world knows how they play. Meanwhile, Real Madrid have invested heavily in superstars, but something is missing.</p>

              <p>Arjen Robben has comments that seemed to suggest Ribery should join Barcelona rather than Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>The Holland international, who spent two seasons at Madrid prior to his move to Bayern last summer, told Radio Marca: 'I never said that. He has the quality to play for<br>both teams, but what I prefer is for him to stay at Munich. Hopefully he will continue with us. I love playing alongside him.'</p>

              <p>cant believe barca is so strong. have they even lost a game this season??</p>
              <p>how come messi is unstoppable? and he never gets injured also. just get 2-3 players to mark him should do the trick i think</p>

              <p>iniesta and xavi is over-rated, his assist per game ratio is lower than that of fabregas. they are only good for enough for teams like Liverpool. Yaya toure is over-rated too. Essien and even Song perform better than toure</p>

              <p><br>huh I thought Iniesta is rather under rated and xavi started to get his well deserved recognition. these two helm barcelona's midfield. didnt u watch how these two combined and ran the show for barcelona vs man united in last season's CL final?</p>
