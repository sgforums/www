              <p class="small bold">RETURN OF THE KING ... Keegan hails the fans in January 2008 - and he may be back</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">KEVIN KEEGAN could make a sensational return to Newcastle if a Dubai tycoon succeeds with a £100million bid for the troubled club. And managing director Derek Llambias last night insisted the club could have new owners within the next <strong>WEEK</strong>.</h2>
              <p class="article">The latest twist in the Toon saga emerged as Newcastle drew 0-0 with Leeds in front of just 16,000 fans at St James' Park - and 5,000 of those were supporting the visitors.</p>
              <p class="article">It was a far cry from the days when the football-mad Geordies would turn up in their thousands just to welcome a new player.</p>
              <p class="article">Such was the gloomy air around the eerily-silent ground, club officials even had crowd cheers played through the Tannoy system when the players came out. But an upbeat Llambias claimed to be dealing with several interested parties, including Sirous Mahjoob who wants to install Keegan - and <strong>NOT</strong> Alan Shearer - as manager.</p>
              <p class="article">Llambias confirmed he is ready to meet Mahjoob in the next few days but that alternative deals are on the table. It means the end is in sight for controversial owner Mike Ashley, whose £240m investment in the Toon has been a nightmare, culminating in relegation to the Championship.</p>
              <p class="article">Llambias said: "We are dealing with several people and giving most of our time and attention to the sale. "You must remember that some parties make offers but when it comes to putting up proof of funds they are a long way from sealing a deal. "But I can say we are very close to completing a deal and it could happen next week."</p>
              <p class="article">On Tuesday, the Singapore-based Profitable Group, fronted by ex-Liverpool star Steve McMahon, pulled out. Whatever happens, it seems that caretaker-boss Chris Hughton will be in charge of Newcastle's opening clash at West Brom on Saturday week because there simply will not be time for new owners to appoint their own man.</p>
              <p class="article">Llambias added: "It's Catch 22 - anyone who signs a deal will want their own choice of manager. "Look what happened when Mike took over, Sam Allardyce was already in place and he didn't want him."</p>
              <p class="article">One of Mahjoob's intentions is to use the club as a global advertising vehicle for a new information website. Should his £100m offer be successful he promises to hand over £40m for new players.</p>
              <p class="article">His spokesman said: "The money is there. Mr Mahjoob has a healthy interest in football and is bidding to take over an ailing club with a great worldwide reputation. "He envisages a clean sweep with Kevin Keegan coming back as manager, this time with his own staff and control of players.</p>
              <p class="article">"Last time Keegan inherited a lot of people he didn't necessarily want and we don't want the same situation again. "He has nothing against Shearer. He just thinks Keegan retains greater global appeal."</p>
              <p class="article">Last night's game highlighted how far the club have fallen - 13 years to the day after Shearer joined from Blackburn.</p>
              <p class="article">Their expensive team of misfits was out-passed in the first half, with Leeds midfielder Fabian Delph looking head and shoulders above the opposition.</p>
              <p class="article">Joey Barton decided he had been made to look foolish once too often and took out Delph with a body check.</p>
              <p class="article">Obafemi Martins was not among the subs, paving the way for his £7.5m move to German club Wolfsburg.</p>
