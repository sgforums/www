              <h1><span>We're bigger than Arsenal! Tottenham's Rafael van der Vaart stokes up north London rivalry ahead of Carling Cup clash</span></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden"></div>
              <p>Rafael van der Vaart has stirred up the animosity between north 
              London rivals Tottenham and Arsenal ahead of Tuesday night's Carling Cup
               clash by claiming Spurs are the bigger of the two clubs.</p>
              <p>Dutch
               midfield master Van der Vaart netted his first goal for his new club in
               the 3-1 victory over Wolves on Saturday and then turned his sights on 
              the Gunners.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Gunner get ya! Van der Vaart believes Spurs are bigger than Arsenal</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The Dutchman is aware just how big the game is after talking to international team mate, Arsenal striker Robin van Persie. </p>
              <p>'I know Robin and he told me when we were together in the national
              team what a big game it is,' Van der Vaart said. 'But there was no
              banter over who is the bigger club. Spurs are the bigger club!'</p>
              <p>After impressing in his first three games for Spurs, Van der Vaart
              has admitted that it has been hard adjusting to the pace of the Premier
              League.</p>
              <p>He said: 'We are a team who love to play football. Although I have
              only been in England two weeks, I love it. The speed of the game is
              much higher than in Madrid. Teams like Wolves are really strong and run
              all the time. You don’t get a break.</p>
              <p>'Harry Redknapp is a great man with a great personality. I think he could do the England job.</p>
              <p>'He is different because in Holland, Germany and Spain you have a
              trainer. He is more like a manager, watching over the whole club.</p>
              <p>'The biggest problem in England is driving on the left-hand side. But I haven’t hit anyone yet!'</p>

              </div>
              <p>Arsenal star Denilson insists the Gunners are the best team in the Premier League, and will prove it by winning the title.</p>
              <p>Arsenal drew 1-1 at Sunderland on Saturday, with Darren Bent scoring an injury time equaliser for the hosts.</p>
              <p>The
               north Londoners are already four points behind rivals Chelsea, but 
              Denilson insisted: 'Arsenal are the best team. We have the players and 
              we have the touch. Chelsea have very strong players but they are old.</p>
              <p>'This
               was just one game, we are still in a good position - and we play like 
              Barcelona. Arsenal are going to win a trophy this season.'</p>
              <p>Following
               Saturday's draw, Denilson added: 'You can’t expect to win at 
              Sunderland. They have beaten the best sides here; it was always going to
               be a big game. It’s always difficult, it’s a tough place to play but I 
              still think we can win the Premier League. You can’t use this one result
               to say we’re not ready.</p>
              <p>'We have shown how well we can play and 
              the spirit is there. We have some very good young players, such as Jack 
              Wilshere, coming through.</p>
              <p>'We have dropped points here but I 
              am confident we will bounce back. I can understand the fans being 
              impatient but we have the best manager who tries not to put us under too
               much pressure. We all have to show him how much we want it.'<span><span style="color: #003399;"></span></span></p>
