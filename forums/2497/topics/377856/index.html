              <p>Two of the Big Four locked
              horns at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon in what, to be fair, was
              not a classic. But what did we learn from it all, ask Ian Cruise and
              Steve Anglesey?</p>
              <p><strong>1)</strong> Is Fabio Capello the new Sven Goran Eriksson? The Swede was reckoned to
              have a body double when he first moved to England such was the volume
              of matches he watched. Well, Mr Capello managed two yesterday as he saw
              both Arsenal-Blackburn and Chelsea-Liverpool. So over the next 12-18
              months or so, expect him to have an affair with an FA receptionist,
              oversee inglorious failure in South Africa next summer and then rock up
              at League Two Burton Albion as the new soccer Czar.</p>
              <p><strong>2) </strong>Talking
              of Capello, how the hell did he manage to get from north to west London
              in about 45 minutes - a genuine feat at the best of times, as anyone
              who's ever tried it will tell you.</p>
              <p><strong>3) </strong>Liverpool
              have long been regarded as a two-man team. Judging by Sunday's display,
              those maths might be a bit optimistic. Can Liverpool's fans, manager
              and - most importantly - owners really expect them to mount a serious
              title challenge while they trail in quality of personnel? Only three
              players - Gerrard, Torres and Reina - would have made Sunday's Chelsea
              starting line-up and the same will be true when the Reds play
              Manchester United in three weeks' time.</p>
              <p><strong>4)</strong> It didn't help that Liverpool's crucial three were all off colour at
              Stamford Bridge. And it doesn't help their Premier League aspirations
              that, arguably, Manchester City are also now well clear of them in a
              head-to-head talent count.</p>
              <p><strong>5) </strong>Patrick
              Vieira was in the crowd at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea and Liverpool
              huffed and puffed their way through a pretty uninspiring 90 minutes.
              His mate, Thierry Henry, was at Arsenal to see them hump Blackburn 6-2
              in a masterclass of passing football. Merde!</p>
              <p><strong>6) </strong>Didier
              Drogba's ball in for Nicolas Anelka's goal - sublime. Amount of time
              spent by Didier Drogba writhing on the floor - ridiculous. The
              invisible west London sniper strikes again.</p>
              <p><strong>7) </strong>David Pleat, released by ITV in pre-season, is back as an analyst with <em>Five Live</em>. And bless him, he still appears to believe Liverpool's Israeli midfielder is called Benny Noon!</p>
              <p><strong>8) </strong>Pepe
              Reina' all-yellow kit was something of an eyesore. But it was Jamie
              Carragher who was left looking a lemon on another uncomfortable
              afternoon. He was found wanting as Anelka ghosted away from him for the
              first goal, and then made to look a mug by Drogba as he created the
              second. We asked the question last week, but has Carra really lost it?</p>
              <p><strong>9)</strong> Are Frank Lampard's new responsibilities in the Chelsea midfield really
              benefiting him or the team? Or England? In a World Cup season, Lampard
              is no longer arriving late to penalty box situations as he has done so
              successfully over the past eight seasons and as a result, has scored
              only once this season from open play - and that was for England against
              Croatia.</p>
              <p><strong>10) </strong>The
              last team to win the title after losing three of its first eight games
              was Manchester United in 1966-67 - a massive 43 years ago. Liverpool
              will not be joining them on that list.</p>
