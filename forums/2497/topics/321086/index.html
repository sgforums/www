              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>David Bentley has spelt out his desire to leave Blackburn and play at a higher level.</strong></p>
              <p>Bentley has been at Ewood Park since 2005 and has emerged as one of the brightest young talents in England.</p>
              <p>He has already broken into the national side but he admits his ambitions can no longer be satisfied at Blackburn.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old has informed Rovers he wants to go and he now
                  hopes to secure a transfer to a club playing in the UEFA Champions
                  League.</p>
              <p>"I made it clear to the club what I wanted to do," Bentley told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"My situation is I want to move on, I want to be playing Champions League football, I want to be playing in Europe.</p>
              <p>"I have been there for three years, I love the club and I love
                  playing for them, but I feel like I've done everything I can and I want
                  to move on and try and push up the ladder and be as successful as I can</p>
              <p>"And I believe that lies elsewhere. I want a new challenge and I feel I want to push on somewhere else.</p>
              <p>"I hope I have repaid them with the way I have played but I need to be moving on somewhere else.</p>
              <p>"We'll see what the summer brings and hopefully in this transfer window something can be sorted out."</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>Blackburn are currently looking for a
                  replacement for Mark Hughes but Bentley insists his mind was made up
                  before the manager departed for Manchester City.</p>
              <p>And he maintains that he will still be keen to leave regardless
                  of who is appointed, as he looks to cement his place in the England
                  team and play regularly in Europe.</p>
              <p>Bentley has been linked with a number of clubs including
                  Liverpool and Tottenham but he has refused to be drawn on where he may
                  end up.</p>
              <p>He said: "I discussed things with the manager then (Hughes) and the chairman.</p>
              <p>"Their situation has changed but mine hasn't. I need to be pushing on and that's what I'll be looking to do.</p>
              <p>"I've got ambitions to play for England and I want to be playing
                  in the biggest games I can, and I believe that lies playing somewhere
                  else.</p>
              <p>"My decision is not money, it is purely based on football. I just want to be playing at the highest level.</p>
              <p>"There are clubs interested but it lies in Blackburn's hands.
                  Managers that come in want to keep their best players but my decision
                  has been made and nobody could persuade me to change my mind."</p>
