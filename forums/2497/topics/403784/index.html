              <div class="story-image"><br></div>
              <p>Former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> legend, and current Ipswich boss 
              Roy Keane, is scathing in his assessment of the underachieving England 
              squad.</p>
              <p>The Three Lions came into the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">World Cup</span></abbr> as one of the favourites but were sent 
              crashing home by Germany after a dismal 4-1 second round defeat on 
              Sunday.</p>
              <p>"To keep criticising the manager is crazy. Capello is a brilliant 
              manager," Keane told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"The players have to look at themselves. They get away with murder.</p>
              <p>"You say that the players are good individuals in the Premier League, 
              but tell me who they are?</p>
              <p>"I think Wayne Rooney had a brilliant season. You look at the 
              goalkeepers, I thought David James at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr>, they didn't have a good season and the 
              other one, Green, at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West Ham</span></abbr> [United] they just about stayed up.</p>
              <p>"Glen Johnson at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> did okay, they had a poor season. <abbr><span class="glossary-term">John Terry</span></abbr> had his issues, I don't think he had a 
              great season.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> won the double but that was down to some 
              world class attacking players. Upson, who played yesterday, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West Ham</span></abbr> didn't have a great season.</p>
              <p>"Ashley Cole's just come back from injury to be fair to the boy. 
              [Steven] Gerrard didn't have a great season at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>, James Milner had a good season.</p>
              <p>"[Gareth] Barry I thought was very average for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> this year. [Emile] Heskey started 
              the season up-front for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Aston Villa</span></abbr> and he got three goals.</p>
              <p>"You keep talking about these world class players, and they're not. 
              Wayne has the best chance but he still hasn't done it on the world 
              stage."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I think thats the best capello can do for england. I bet he wanted to avoid germany in the second round, but his players didnt perform to their task, so england had to meet germany and got thrashed. with the way england is playing, even if they were to meet ghana instead of germany, I think ghana may have beaten england as well.</p></div>

              <p>I think part of the fault also lies with Capello.</p>
              <p>For example, he picked both SWP and Lennon, but both of them had a disappointing world cup. SWP did not even play much of the WC except in the first match. And both of them are afraid to shoot. I think bringing walcott would be a much better choice, for he is more direct and faster than the SWP and Lennon, crosses better than Lennon and is definitely not afraid to shoot when given chances. Lennon sucks in my opinion and I am glad Capello notices that and benched him for the last group game and also against Germany.</p>
              <p>The other wrong choice that Capello made was to keep playing Lampard and Gerrard together. It has been proven so many times that these 2 cannot play together. Both are central midfielders and both like to roamed forward. Who is going to take the Left wing?? No one!! This is especially so when they play a 4-4-2 formation.</p>
              <p>The third mistake capello make was then he kept choosing heskey in the first 2 group matches. In my opinion Heskey is rather shitty. I would have preferred Crouch if i wanted to add so height in attack. I would rather have brought Darren Bent along and left Heskey behind. Heskey is a striker that cant score goals, simple!!</p>
              <p>The fourth mistake is the refusal to play Joe cole in a 4-4-2 formation. I would have swap Lampard for Joe cole, so as to add balance to the left wing. Simple!!!</p>
              <p>The fifth reason, is the inclusion of Ledley king. He only featured in 45 mins of englands WC campaign. A poor player, and should not have made the trip at all.</p>
              <p>The only good players that played well for england were Defoe, Gerrard and Milner. These 3 are the players that stood out for me.</p>
              <p>England should have actually played with a 4-3-3 formation with James as keeper, Terry and Carragher as the CBs, A.cole as the LB and Johnson as the RB. Defensive midfielder would be Barry, and in the midfield with Lampard and Gerrard both as the attacking midfielders.</p>
              <p>In attack with wayne rooney the main striker flanked by J.cole on the left and Milner on the right.</p>
              <p>This would be a much better formation.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>shouldnt have bring king and barry as they are both unfit. SWP also shouldnt have been selected on hindsight. I dunno why an average defender like upson is england material. heskey couldnt score goals, so why he is in the squad?</p></div>

              <p>Barry is the player who should not even play in the 3 matches. He is really average.</p>
              <p>Lennon, SWP and Walcott are really bad on the right wing IMO. both 3 has pace, but so what? none of them can cross properly. Millner is good, but again he was unfit.</p>
              <p>Heskey is shit as usual.</p>
              <p>The football England playing is just not FLUID enough. They knock the ball around, and especailly backwards to the defenders or goalkeeper, by the time they start the attack, the opposition have already organize themselves at the back.</p>
