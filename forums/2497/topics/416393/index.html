              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsene Wenger is ready to make a £10million bid for </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Bolton</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> centre-half Gary Cahill in January as he tries to shore up </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">'s leaky defence and prevent their title challenge from fading away in the new year. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners went top of the Premier League for two hours yesterday after winning 4-2 at Aston Villa, only to be knocked off by <span style="color: #0000ff;">Manchester United</span>'s 7-1 demolition of Blackburn.</p>
              <p>Wenger, though, is desperately short of experienced central defenders and the long-term injury to Belgian Thomas Vermaelen has exacerbated their problems.</p>
              <p>Cahill, 24, is now their No 1 target after his superb form this season has helped Bolton into the top five, a place cemented by their 2-2 draw at home to <span style="color: #0000ff;">Blackpool</span>.</p>
              <p>Arsenal are likely to to start the bidding at £10m though Bolton, whose debts have risen to £93m, will initially demand as much as £18m for a centre-half who made his England debut in September against Bulgaria.</p>
              <p>Wenger tried to sign <span style="color: #0000ff;">Everton</span>'s Phil Jagielka last summer and is believed to have bid £10m but the player has since signed a new contract at Goodison.</p>
              <p>Cahill, however, has thrived under manager Owen Coyle, whose insistence on passing football has demonstrated the player's ability to bring the ball out of defence as well as defend in a robust manner.</p>
              <p>All those attributes have commended him to Wenger as the best option to make an immediate improvement to his team.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have been unable to fill the gap created by Vermaelen's Achilles injury, with Laurent Koscielny and Sebastien Squillaci, who both arrived in the summer, struggling to settle in.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">are ready to turn to </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Bolton </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">defender Gary Cahill in January to tighten up their leaky defence. </span></strong></p>
              <p>The Blues have taken just one point from their last three Premier League games while £15million-rated Cahill has been in fine form as Bolton have climbed to sixth in the table.</p>
              <p>Stamford Bridge skipper John Terry has been sidelined with a niggling nerve problem in his leg while fellow central defender Alex is facing up to eight weeks out after knee surgery.</p>
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti's side have surrendered top spot in the table during their slump and the Londonders have sounded out Bolton about England international Cahill.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old was handed his international debut as a substitute against Bulgaria in September and has also been heavily linked with <span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal </span><span style="color: #000000;">and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></p>
              <p>Bolton are reported to have lined up Aston Villa's Curtis Davies, on loan at Leicester, as a possible replacement if they lose Cahill.</p>
