              <p>Of course the Carling Cup was not his priority but last night the Double winners lost their way. </p>
              <p>Shola Ameobi's 90th-minute winner was the final act of an amazing match which rewarded the punters who turned up.</p>
              <p>Salomon Kalou, on as a half-time sub, was carried off clutching his hamstring on 54 minutes.</p>
              <p>And he was followed to the treatment room nine minutes later by Yossi Benayoun who seemed to have a groin problem.</p>
              <p>Both are serious doubts for the Premier League clash at Manchester City on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Boss Carlo Ancelotti said: "I don't think Kalou will be available for the next few games. Benayoun also has a massive problem. Both need more time to rest."</p>
              <p>Benayoun's exit meant Chelsea, who were 3-1 down and had used their three subs, had to play 27 minutes with TEN men.</p>
              <p>They almost pulled off an unlikely win as Nicolas Anelka's brace made it 3-3. But Ameobi had the last word, powering in Jonas Gutierrez's 90th-minute corner.</p>
              <p>Toon boss Chris Hughton said: "This win speaks volumes for the spirit and players we have."</p>

              <p><strong>Liverpool's</strong> poor start to the season continued as they were sent crashing out of the Carling Cup by League Two side <strong>Northampton</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=307976&amp;amp;league=ENG.WORTHINGTON&amp;amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">4-2 on penalties</span></span></a> in a night of shocks.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Abdul Osman scored the winning spot-kick after Nathan Eccleston missed his for Liverpool. Michael Jacobs looked to have sealed an historic win for Northampton in extra-time before David Ngog forced the match to penalties at 2-2. Milan Jovanovic's opener was cancelled out by Billy McKay as the sides were level after 90 minutes.</p>
              <p>Shola Ameobi's last-gasp winner secured a <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=307975&amp;league=ENG.WORTHINGTON&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">surprise 4-3 win</span></span></a> for <strong>Newcastle</strong> to send <strong>Chelsea</strong> crashing out as well. Nicolas Anelka's two late goals looked to have been enough to force extra-time at Stamford Bridge, but Ameobi's glancing header from Jonas Gutierrez's cross sealed an impressive win for the Magpies.</p>
              <p>Chelsea looked set for a comfortable victory after Patrick van Aanholt scored his first senior goal after six minutes, but Nile Ranger, who was at fault for the opener, went some way to atone for his mistake when he equalised shortly before the half-hour mark. Just moments later Ryan Taylor's free-kick put the visitors ahead, and Ameobi scored his first to give Newcastle a 3-1 lead shortly after half-time.</p>
              <p>To add insult to injury, Chelsea lost Salomon Kalou to a hamstring injury, and when Yossi Benayoun hobbled off, Chelsea had no option but to continue the match with ten men with Carlo Ancelotti having already employed all three of his substitutes. But two late goals from Anelka, including a casual penalty with three minutes remaining, set up a tense few minutes, but Ameobi wrapped up a memorable victory for Newcastle with his late winner.</p>
              <p>Holders <strong>Manchester United</strong> were forced to come from behind to beat underdogs <strong>Scunthorpe</strong> <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=307977&amp;league=ENG.WORTHINGTON&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">5-2</span></span></a>. Josh Wright's long-range strike gave the home side a deserved lead, but it proved to be shortlived as Darron Gibson beat the offside trap to lob Joe Murphy from Chris Smalling's long ball just four minutes later.</p>
              <p>After his role in United's opening goal, it was Smalling's turn to get on the scoresheet, netting his first senior United goal to put the visitors ahead. Scunthorpe could have clawed their way back into the match when Kuszczak palmed Jonathan Forte's long-range effort away, but the ball bounced just in front of his right post before spinning wide.</p>
              <p>Scunthorpe battled valiantly, but the gulf in class and fitness began to appear, and the game soon ran away from them with two goals from Michael Owen and one from Park Ji-Sung before Martyn Woolford's 90th-minute consolation.</p>
              <p>Ashley Young scored two goals in three minutes as <strong>Aston Villa</strong> came from behind to beat <strong>Blackburn</strong> <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=307974&amp;league=ENG.WORTHINGTON&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">3-1 at Villa Park</span></span></a>. Gael Givet gave Blackburn the lead after 34 minutes before Emile Heskey equalised on the hour mark. And Young's double 13 minutes from time secured victory for Gerard Houllier on his first game in charge of Villa.</p>
              <p><strong>West Brom</strong> also came from behind to beat <strong>Manchester City</strong> <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=307978&amp;league=ENG.WORTHINGTON&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">2-1</span></span></a>. Jo's left-footed strike put the visitors ahead on 19 minutes, but two goals in quick succession from Gianni Zuiverloon and Simon Cox sent Roberto Mancini's men crashing out.</p>
              <p>Charles N'Zogbia's 90th-minute strike sealed a late<a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=307979&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;"> 2-1 win</span></span></a> for <strong>Wigan</strong> at home to <strong>Preston North End</strong>. Wigan looked to be heading out of the competition after Keith Treacy put the Championship side ahead after 23 minutes, but Jordi Gomez's 87th-minute equaliser looked to have been enough to force extra-time before N'Zogbia spared Roberto Martinez's men's blushes.</p>

              <p>Turnbull is shit. It is as if Chelsea played without a goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>Ferrari as usual getting caught out.</p>
              <p>Honestly, the youngsters played decently, except Sturridge...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think its a feat that Chelsea managed to get 3-3 at the last few minutes. Playing with 10men for the ending 30 minutes, nobody thought of equalising the scores.</p>
              <p>Obviously the stoppage time winner is unfortunate, and again expose the defensive mistakes. Turnbull's positioning is always wrong and concedes so much goals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly, I think it is better for Chelsea considering we got a smaller squad, then lesser matches for them to play... more time for them to rest and maintain fit.</p>

              <p>chelsea themselves need a good cover for cech.  it was really a mistake letting him go.</p>

              <p>like i mentioned in another thread, ancelotti always uses his 3 subs too early. then gets caught out later when somebody gets injured. ll have to play with 10 men like that.</p>
              <p>this bad habit of his last season already caused chelsea to play with 10 men a few times last season iirc. now again. he never learns. play with 10 men is an uphill task against any team.</p>
              <p>but considering they played with 10 men, mostly all reserve team, decent opponent; chelsea did well.</p>
              <p>i think currently malouda and drogba are the ones making chelsea very strong. esp drogba</p>

              <p>Terry's substitution was to preserve him for the game aganist City. <br>Kakuta substituted because of back pains.<br>Kalou - substitute substituted because of groin injury<br>Benayoun - you know...</p>
