              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/20/article-1244666-07EFC15F000005DC-781_233x520.jpg" alt="Jo, Everton" width="233" height="520">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Out of favour: Striker Jo</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Galatasaray are set to sign Jo on loan from Manchester City for the rest of the season.</p>
              <p>The Brazil striker is midway through a year-long loan at Everton, but the Merseysiders are prepared to let him move after poor form and discipline.</p>
              <p>West Ham United were
                  thought to be weighing up a move for the 22-year-old after wrapping up
                  their long-awaited takeover, but Galatasaray have beaten them to the
                  punch.</p>
              <p>The Turkish club's sporting director Haldun Ustunel has flown to
                  London for talks with City and are willing to put an attractive offer
                  on the table.</p>
              <p>Jo is out of favour at Goodison Park and was
                  recently suspended by boss David Moyes for making an unauthorised trip
                  back to his homeland.</p>
              <p>He
                  is also surplus to requirements at City at the moment after failing to
                  make an impact since a £19million move from CSKA Moscow in July 2008.</p>
              <p>Hammers
                  boss Gianfranco Zola is determined to strengthen his attacking options
                  and has missed out on loan moves for Brazil striker Adriano and Italy
                  international Luca Toni already this year.</p>
              <p>New Upton Park owners David Gold and David Sullivan admitted they
                  were keen to bring in forwards and defenders after completing their
                  takeover on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Zola continues to run the rule over Zenit St Petersburg striker
                  Sergey Kornilenko, who has been training with the Hammers since last
                  Friday.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/20/article-1244666-07ECBCD8000005DC-583_468x246.jpg" alt="West Ham's new owners David Sullivan and David Gold (foreground)" width="468" height="246">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Big plans: West Ham's new owners David Sullivan and David Gold (foreground)</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Reports that he could revive interest in Brazil
                  striker Adriano seem wide of the mark as the Flamengo star has indicated he is unwilling to leave his
                  hometown Rio de Janeiro club until the summer.</p>
              <p>Jo
                  is one of a number of players who ambitious Galatasaray are looking at
                  as they fight for the Turkish title with Istanbul rivals Fenerbahce.</p>
              <p>Blackburn's Benni McCarthy, Aston Villa's John Carew and Tottenham
                  Hotspur target Ruud van Nistelrooy are also options.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">DAVID MOYES decided to dump on-loan striker Jo after the Brazilian failed to 
                      turn up for training AGAIN this week.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Everton boss feared the 22-year-old, who had already been fined and 
                      suspended for returning to his homeland over Christmas without permission, 
                      was becoming too much of a disruptive influence.</p>
              <p class="article">Manchester City ace Jo returned to training at the beginning of last week but, 
                      when he failed to turn up at the club's Finch Farm complex on Monday, Moyes' 
                      patience ran out.</p>
              <p class="article">City immediately loaned him out yesterday to Turkish side Galatasaray.</p>
              <p class="article">Moyes said: "Jo didn't come in over Christmas so we fined and suspended him.</p>
              <p class="article">"I brought him back in, spoke to him and explained to the players I was going 
                      to give him another chance and he came and trained with us last week.</p>
              <p class="article">"And then he didn't turn up for training on Monday again so I don't know how 
                      many more chances I can give people.</p>
              <p class="article">"I thought it was only the going to be disruptive to the players, who thought 
                      it was the right thing to bring him back after his suspension.</p>
              <p class="article">"But when he never came in to work on Monday that was the final straw."</p>
              <p class="article">Meanwhile, Everton are in talks to sign Legia Warsaw and Slovakia keeper Jan 
                      Mucha, 27, at the end of the season</p>
