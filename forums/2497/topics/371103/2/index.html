              <p>Alberto Aquilani's move from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Roma</span></abbr> to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> is yet to be signed off.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says life is rarely without its complications at
              Anfield and any deal for Aquilani will hinge on the player passing a
              stringent medical in the next 48 hours amid concerns about the
              Italian’s troublesome injury record.</p>
              <p>The Italy midfield player will move from Roma for €20 million (about £17 million), rising to €23 million.</p>
              <p>Aquilani is recovering from surgery he had on his right ankle in
              May and his tenure at Roma has been blighted by injury problems. He has
              played only 73 games in three seasons for Roma and his last appearance
              came as a substitute on March 11, against Arsenal in the Champions
              League.</p>

              <p><strong>Former Liverpool midfielder Jan Molby, a two-time title winner with the Reds during the 1980s, believes that the decision to sell Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid will hurt Rafael Benitez's side.</strong></p>
              <p>Alonso was a key cog in the Merseyside outfit's midfield, being granted the ball following central midfield partner Javier Mascherano's break-up play and initiating his own forward motions from a withdrawn position. His playmaking credentials allowed players such as Steven Gerrard, Yossi Benayoun and Fernando Torres to fully flourish.</p>
              <p>Alonso is the alleged last piece of Real Madrid's second Galactico regime, and the deal is expected to see 'Pool pocket around €35 million (£30m).</p>
              <p>On the transfer, Molby told the <em>BBC</em>, <span style="color: #1a2732;">“He’s doing what he thinks is right for his career. When he retires he’ll look back and see Liverpool and Real Madrid on his CV, and that’s a big thing.</span><span class="text"> </span></p>
              <p>“If you look at what’s happening at Real right now, you can sense that there could be something big in terms of what they’re capable of winning over the next few years, and Alonso feels he wants to be part of that.</p>
              <p>“In the end he was desperate to go and join them, and I fully understand his decision.</p>
              <p>“But Liverpool will miss him a lot. Everyone talks about Gerrard and Torres, but I think just behind them, Alonso was a crucial part of the directional play of the team.”</p>

              <p><br>absolutely agree! Alonso is irreplaceable. 30million pound liverpool gets is not enough to mend the damage done.</p>
