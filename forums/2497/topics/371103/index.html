              <p>Liverpool's Xabi Alonso is poised to sign
              for Real Madrid on Wednesday after the clubs agreed a fee believed to
              be £30m for the Spain international.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/PH2/XabiAlonsoG275.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="275" height="200">

              <p class="photoDesc">Alonso: Real saga coming to an end</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The end of a summer-long saga over the 28 year-old's future ended when
              Liverpool issued a short statement effectively bringing to a close his spell on
              Merseyside.</p>
              <p>The statement read: "Liverpool Football Club this evening confirmed they had
              reached agreement for the sale of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid, subject only to a
              medical. The terms of the deal will remain confidential and undisclosed.''</p>
              <p>But although Liverpool will not reveal the details of the deal, privately
              sources were maintaining that manager Rafael Benitez had got his own way over
              the fee.</p>
              <p>It is believed that Madrid made another attempt to end the deadlock with
              an offer of £30m that will rise to £34m depending on Alonso's success over the
              first two years of what is believed to be a five-year contract.</p>
              <p>Alonso had trained with his Liverpool colleagues on Tuesday afternoon at the club's
              Melwood complex.</p>
              <p>But as the Liverpool party headed for John Lennon airport and a charter flight
              to Norway for Wednesday's friendly with Lyn Oslo, Alonso was heading back to
              Spain.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid issued a statement of their own, confirming he will have a medical on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Assuming all goes well, he will join his former Liverpool team-mates Alvaro
              Arbeloa - who moved to Real last week for £3.5m - and goalkeeper Jerzy
              Dudek at the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>Alonso and Dudek were part of the famous night in Istanbul when Liverpool
              lifted the European Cup after a penalty shoot-out victory over AC Milan.</p>
              <p>Now only Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher remain at the club from the 18
              players on the team sheet in Istanbul that night.</p>
              <p>Alonso's departure has been a long and painful experience for Liverpool fans,
              who had taken the Basque midfielder to their hearts.</p>
              <p>Benitez tried to sell him last summer in the complexities of his unsuccessful
              fight to sign Gareth Barry from Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>Alonso did not want to go then, and has always felt that he was being forced
              out of the club to finance the Barry deal.</p>
              <p>This summer it was Benitez who did not want to lose the player, who is believed
              to have told his manager on the final day of last season that he wanted to
              return to Spain.</p>
              <p>From that point on, Madrid waged a persistent war to sign the player as they
              assembled a new squad under president Florentino Perez.</p>
              <p>With the Alonso deal, Perez will have spent around £220m in two months on
              Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Raul Albiol, Esteban Granero, Arbeloa, Alvaro Negredo
              and Karim Benzema.</p>
              <p>That haul is Madrid's response to Barcelona's historic treble of Champions
              League, La Liga and Spanish Cup.</p>
              <p>But although Perez did not consider Alonso to be a player who 'will sell
              shirts', the Spain international has been almost as difficult to prise away from
              his club as Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Michel Salgado has ended his spell at Real Madrid after 10 years with the
              Primera Division club.</p>
              <p>The 33-year-old defender, who moved to the Bernabeu from Celta Vigo in 1999,
              has been released by mutual consent despite having one year remaining on his
              current deal.</p>
              <p>"Real Madrid would like to thank the until-now captain for his commitment and
              behaviour during 10 consecutive years of exemplary service to the club,'' said a
              statement on the club's official website.</p>
              <p>Salgado enjoyed a great deal of success during his decade with Real, winning
              four La Liga and two Champions League titles among other trophies.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Los Blancos’ director-general, Jorge Valdano, has lauded the Basque midfielder’s arrival, a signing that he says perfectly wraps up the club’s galactic spending this year.</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">“We are very happy because we have completed rebuilding our squad in the best possible way,” he said in an interview with the <em>Cadena SER </em>programme, ‘El Larguero’.</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">“Xabi Alonso was worth fighting for because he is an important part of our plans. Remember, when I was here in my previous stint, we had practically signed him. But what was not fulfilled all those years ago is fulfilled now and we have a much more mature Xabi.”</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Valdano then remarked that the 27-year-old, who will be in the Spanish capital to undergo his medical later on Wednesday, will join his new team-mates and begin pre-season training immediately.</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">“We will speak with [coach] Manuel Pellegrini on Wednesday to see if he wants to include Alonso in the US and Canada tour,” he revealed. </span><span lang="EN-GB">“But Xabi’s arrival concludes the matter of signings. The coach, before he left for his holidays, said that the team needed reinforcements in two positions, in defence and in midfield, and that is what we have done.</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">“Personally, I am very happy with the squad, mainly because of the fact that it has been rejuvenated and 'Hispanicised'.”</span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Ribery &amp; The Exodus</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Valdano’s declarations will put an end to rumours regarding Franck Ribery, for this summer at least, and the director also spoke about their next big undertaking: </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Operation Exodus.</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">“Bayern Munich made it very difficult for us right from the start. They did not want to sell the player and therefore he had to take a step back and wait for another opportunity,” the Argentine confessed.</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">“As for the exits, we are studying possible destinations for them, but it is evident that this season, they will not be key players within the squad. The [league] regulations do not allow us to have more than 25 players and we know clearly who we no longer need.”</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Objectives</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">Having spent close to €300 million in one single summer, the expectations are higher than ever at the Santiago Bernabeu, and Valdano readily acknowledged that the club’s objectives have been heightened.</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">He said, “The president [Florentino Perez] stated from the outset that this season, something new had to be done that has never been seen before, and he has delivered in a big way.</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">“No one will be able to criticise him in that respect but now it is up to us to honour and follow up everything that he has done.</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">“We aspire to be better each day and to fight for all the competitions that we will participate in. </span><span lang="EN-GB">Madrid</span><span lang="EN-GB"> have always had that obligation and because we have now shaped a great team, the goals will be magnified.” </span></p>

              <p><br>A good piece of business would be Rafa not losing Alonso... I think Alonso have done well over the years when he was younger but last year he really stands out and had an exceptional season... Which coincide with Pool having their best showing in years... Its Rafa's fault that Alonso is leaving... for touting him around last season the way he did...</p>
              <p>There is not much of a for sure in football but only likely... And in likely cases, it is said most players reach their peak or prime between the ages of 27 to 30... especially central midfielders... I am not referring to wingers though... Look at Lampard who is now 31... But his best years was these last 5 years rather than his earlier years...</p>
              <p>Many people made a lot of the Gerrard and Torres partnership which I feel is right to a certain extend but don't discount the Alonso factor... He was very important to Pool's last season's performance... Otherwise, the year before last Gerrard and Torres scored even more (35) but Pool didn't do as well compare to last season when they only scored (30)...</p>
              <p>Alonso will continue to improve, and given his age... I belief he is just about to reach his best form of his career...</p>
              <p>And I agree £30m would hav been a good price but in today's market, his rumour replacement Alberto Aquilani will not come cheap too... Like what they could probably got for £10m last season now it will be £17m... So it really makes no different...</p>
              <p>And the fee is said to be £27m... Real to pay an initial £27m, with a further £3m to follow depending on Alonso’s success during the first two seasons of a four-year contract.</p>

              <p>yes, Alonso has been a very influential player but I really think Aquilani is a much better player overall...but still not sure whether he can perform in BPL though. I have posted in this forum earlier saying that Alonso will be SURELY leave this season, and only let him go at £30m...well, for me as a Liverpool fans, I am quite happy with the deal but sad at the same time as Alonso has been one of my favourite player. But if a player change their heart, there is nothing you can do, best is to sell him when the price is right. Would Alonso have performed as well as he did last season if Rafa did not put him on sale? I also agree that the peak time for a midfielder is around 28 to 31 years old.</p>
              <p>I am sure SAF did not want to sell Ronaldo too, but if the player insisted, there is nothing you can do but to get the best price out of them.</p>
              <p>Aquilani will cost Liverpool £17m...at this time, £4 is very important to Rafa as the club really doesn't have the money...Rafa will get £10m + £3.5m for the sale of Arbeloa + possible £4m for the sale of Dossena. the total will be £17.5m..that is not much but to Rafa, thats hell of alot considering the club's current situation, every dollar counts. Rafa has his own target that was why he did not want a swap deal with Real.</p>

              <p>The 27-year-old Spain international arrived in the capital early after a fee was agreed between Liverpool and Real Madrid. Alonso then completed a medical and met his new team-mates for training in the afternoon.</p>
              <p>The midfielder is Madrid's eighth summer signing, taking the club's spending to more than £220m in two months. The Madrid president, Florentino Pérez, has brought in Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaká, Raúl Albiol, Esteban Granero, Alvaro Arbeloa, Alvaro Negredo and Karim Benzema as he attempts to build a team of <em>galácticos </em>capable of challenging Barcelona's treble winners.</p>

              <p><strong>"It's a very happy day for me," said Alonso. "It's an important step in my career to come to a club like Real Madrid. I'm very happy to be part of this club and I was very excited for this day to arrive. It's the best opportunity for me to develop as a footballer."</strong></p>
              <p>The transfer takes Alonso back to Spain after five years in England. The former Real Sociedad player admitted he had decided before the end of the season the time was right to move on.</p>
              <p>"I am very grateful to Liverpool fans, I really enjoyed those five years. But a few months ago I took that decision as I thought it was the right moment to find a fresh challenge, to look for a new club. That's when Real Madrid came along. Luckily a deal has been done and I'm very happy.</p>

              <p><strong>The story behind Alonso finally handing in a transfer request and booking a one-way ticket to Madrid, despite have a crucial role to play in Liverpool's 'to be continued' domestic resurgence, is a bitter one.</strong><br><br>The inside scoop appears to be thus: the relationship between Alonso and Anfield gaffer Rafael Benitez first soured when the boss fell out with former assistant Paco Ayestaran, who was axed upon embracing Jose Mourinho at the height of Rafa's feud with the ex-Chelsea tactician.<br><br>Ayestaran and Alonso were reportedly very close, and in the aftermath Benitez saw Alonso's support of the assistant as a further sign of disloyalty. Then came the infamous scenario wherein Alonso decided to attend the birth of his son rather than be with the Reds as they faced Inter in the Champions League, further infuriating Rafa, who had already been sending hints to the midfielder suggesting that he wanted him out.<br><br>Strike three, of course, was Liverpool's botched pursuit of Gareth Barry, and although time and the highs of last season have served to heal some of the damage between player and manager, the wounds would appear to have run too deep.</p>

              <p><strong>MADRID - Xabi Alonso expects to slot straight into the role of 'conductor' at Real Madrid after completing his desired move from Liverpool Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spanish midfielder passed a medical and signed a five-year contract with Real before training for the first time with his new colleagues in the afternoon. He was later presented at a news conference, where he predicted no great change from the role he excelled at during his five years as a Liverpool player.</p>
              <p>"I am going to try and do what I have always done in the centre of midfield, to try and set up my colleagues, and to conduct the play... That's what I know how to do," Alonso said.</p>
              <p>"I took the decision to leave a while ago. The chance to join Real Madrid came up and what an opportunity, and what better team could I join?"</p>
              <p>He could now join the club's tour to North America which leaves Thursday. Earlier Real Madrid director general Jorge Valdano spoke to radio station Cadena Ser, and said Alonso's signing was their last acquisition of the close season.</p>
              <p>"We understood Xabi Alonso was an important player to complete our squad, and it was worth Real Madrid fighting for him," Valdano said.</p>
              <p>"The club needed a shake up. Some very good players have come in to strengthen every position and the fans are very excited.</p>
              <p>"With this move we end the search for new players. We continue searching for an exit for those who are surplus to requirements."</p>
              <p>Having spent around 250 million euros to lure eight players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Karim Benzema to the Bernabeu, Real have until the end of August to cut Manuel Pellegrini's squad back to 25 players.</p>
              <p>Midfielder Rafael van der Vaart and forwards Klaas Jan Huntelaar and Alvaro Negredo have been linked with interest from clubs in Germany, Italy and England. </p>
