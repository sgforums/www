              <p>Chelsea captain John Terry says the players want to win the FA Cup as a going away present for manager Guus Hiddink.</p>
              <p>"We are not thinking about the new regime at all," said Terry. "We
              don't want to disrespect the current manager and so we are fully
              focused on the FA Cup. I am sure there may be a few chats after the
              game with the people upstairs, but they are the ones making the
              decisions. As a group of players, we get on with it and we do what we
              can on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"We will get this game out the way and go away in the summer. I
              am sure there will be loads of speculation. For us, as players, it
              would be lovely to win the Cup, go away and not read anything and not
              hear anything about Chelsea or football.</p>
              <p>"It has been a tough couple of years with different managers
              and it is important the players get their rest and we come back even
              stronger next year," he added. "We don't know who is coming in and we
              don't know what regime he is going to bring in. But at the minute we
              don't really care about that. We care about Guus Hiddink. He is the man
              in charge.</p>
              <p>"From day one he kept this group of players together. He has
              come in and reassured everyone that if they played well they would keep
              their place. When you see him around the camp and how he deals with
              players and people, he gets respect because he has an aura."</p>
