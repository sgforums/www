              <h1>Maxi Rodriguez signs for Liverpool: We'll get the best out of winger!</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of Rafa Benitez’s first acts as Gerard Houllier’s
              successor was to attempt to find a solution to Liverpool’s lack of
              quality on the flanks. Nearly six years later, he is still trying.</p>
              <p>Maxi
              Rodriguez is the latest to be hand-picked for the task of recreating
              the halcyon days of wing wizardry at Anfield, when Ian Callaghan tore
              down the right and Peter Thompson jinked his way down the left, and it
              is to be hoped he fares better than his predecessors.</p>
              <p>From Antonio Nunez to Albert Riera, Benitez’s judgment has been found wanting, almost without exception.</p>
              <p>Rodriguez
              arrived at Anfield yesterday to complete a £1.5million deal and
              Liverpool boss Benitez insists he has got it right this time.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/13/article-1242836-07D9D078000005DC-712_468x304.jpg" alt="Maxi Rodriguez " width="468" height="304">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Making waves: Maxi Rodriguez is introduced to fans before last night's match at Anfield</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>‘We were looking for players with character and a good mentality,’
              said Benitez. ‘He can play in three positions — on the right, left or
              as a second striker — and is someone with a very positive mentality.</p>
              <p>‘He knows Javier Mascherano and Fernando Torres and he can provide a
              lift for some players. I think he will adapt to English football
              because he is a clever player and takes up good positions on the pitch.’</p>
              <p>However, the fee seems bizarrely small for an established Argentina
              international who was once the jewel in Atletico Madrid’s crown and who
              lit up the last World Cup with one of the goals of the tournament,
              scoring a sensational volleyed winner in extra time against Mexico in
              the last 16.</p>
              <p>But the past few years have seen the landscape shift significantly
              for 29-year-old Maxi — the press and fans never use his surname in
              Spain or Argentina — to the point where Madrid were more than happy to
              take whatever they could for him before his contract expired at the end
              of the season.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/13/article-1242836-07D472A1000005DC-494_468x442.jpg" alt="Rodriguez" width="468" height="442">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>New signing: Rodriguez</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The problems started shortly after Germany 2006 when he suffered
              cruciate ligament damage to his left ankle during an Argentina friendly
              with Spain which put him out for six months. He was never the same
              player again.</p>
              <p>He once dominated games from the middle of the park and tore through
              defences with the sort of vision and execution which had sealed him his
              blue-riband move to Atletico from Espanyol.</p>
              <p>Lately, he has struggled to keep up with the pace of games and
              failed to pull his weight. That didn’t stop him being adored by the
              Atletico fans or being made captain after Torres’ departure in 2007.</p>
              <p>However, an act of petulance last March cost him both.</p>
              <p>After being substituted following a poor performance against
              Barcelona, Maxi flew into a rage, throwing his captain’s armband to the
              ground in disgust. The fans never forgave him, nor did his manager Abel
              Resino, who fined him and stripped him of the captaincy.</p>
              <p>The situation quickly became unsalvagable. Resino used Maxi less and
              less and the fans called for him to be sold. They appear to have got
              their way.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/13/article-0-07D7F2B5000005DC-925_468x306.jpg" alt="Rodriguez" width="468" height="306">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Rodriguez: set to join Liverpool</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But Liverpool supporters should not despair, thinking they have
              signed a has-been with a terrible temper. Maxi can play anywhere across
              the midfield and is a seriously<br> talented footballer.</p>

              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Liverpool have completed the signing of Atletico Madrid midfielder Maxi Rodriguez on a free transfer, the club has confirmed on their official website.
              </span></p><p>The 29-year-old Argentine winger has signed a three-and-a-half year
              contract at the club after completing a medical on Merseyside today,
              and the move will be confirmed subject to international clearance.</p>
              <p>Rodriguez, who was at Anfield to watch the Reds' FA Cup Third
              Round replay with Reading on Wednesday night, will wear the number 17
              shirt at Anfield, and could be available to make his debut against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium this weekend.</p>
              <p>The move will please Reds boss Rafa Benitez, as the Spaniard looks to strengthen his squad following a stuttering start to the season.</p>
              <p>Rodriguez, who can play on either wing or through the middle, will
              add competition to the right-wing position usually occupied by Dirk
              Kuyt, and is known to enjoy a strong relationship with both Javier
              Mascherano - his international captain with Argentina - and Fernando Torres - an ex-teammate at Atleti.</p>
