              <p><em>Toure de force: Manchester City's new signing Kolo Toure with manager Mark Hughes (right)</em> <br></p>
              <p><br><strong>Manchester City manager Mark Hughes insists players are coming to Eastlands for the prospect of medals, not big money. And he claims the club will not pay transfer fees above the odds as their blistering recruitment drive gathers pace.</strong></p>
              <p>City have made six major signings in the transfer window - Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, Roque Santa Cruz, Gareth Barry and Stuart Taylor - with the probability of more to follow.</p>
              <p>Hughes said: "We would like to think we have something different, something players can understand. Once we get the opportunity to speak to them, they very quickly get as excited as we are about what could happen at this club in the future.</p>
              <p>"It is about sitting down in front of these top players and telling them what we know will happen. These guys are all wealthy individuals. It's not about money at this level but about ambition, stimulation and giving them something to be really excited about, and we offer that at the moment.''</p>
              <p>City are debating whether to make an improved offer for Everton defender Joleon Lescott but Hughes said: "We have already walked away from situations where we feel our worth and the value we place on players has been exceeded.</p>
              <p>"It is about getting quality players through the door and that is what we have been able to do.''</p>
              <p>Former Arsenal defender Toure believes City's spending power is making managers nervous. He said: "You see people talking because they don't know what to expect. But it depends on us now, and we don't have to think about the others any more. When things are going well, and people are really happy, and say 'Yeah, blah, blah, blah, it's good'.</p>
              <p>"But when things are not good, they start talking. But we can't expect anything from the others - we need to focus on what we need to do.</p>
              <p>"We are going to have some hard days and some good days as well. We know what to expect. We are intelligent enough to know what to do. If we work hard and are as professional we can, we can get there.''</p>

              <p>But he is seen as the best young manager in the Premier League... Personally, must be fair also lah, I don't think its him, whoever is there will also have a difficult first year trying to gel all these newcomers with big egos together... Even if they had Pep Guardiola it still may not happen. It won't be easy but given 2 to 3 yrs, when the players are there and together longer, they will get it together just like Chelsea... Only thing is who will be the lucky one to be there by then to enjoy the benefits... And then people will call him the Special One cos he came and he won... lol</p>
              <p>Next guy could be the "Lucky One"... lol</p>

              <p>Actually its not that easy, If we see the spending from the top clubs. Since the Premier League started, Pool had spent a lot also but still have not won the league title... </p>
              <p>The history of the re-structured League spendings are...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Manchester United = £391.1m spent; recouped £190.5m with a net loss of £200.5m and averaging £11.7m a season</em></p>
              <p><em>Liverpool = £380.1m spent; recouped £177.6m with a net loss of £202.4m and averaging £11.9m a season</em></p>
              <p><em>Arsenal = £259.9m spent, £180.7m recouped with a net loss of £79.2m averaging £4.6m a season.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Compares with in the last five years...</strong></p>
              <p><em>Manchester United = spent £169.4m, £76m recouped with a net loss of £93.4m and averaging £18.6m a season.</em></p>
              <p><em>Liverpool = spent £212.4m; £102m recouped with a net loss of £110.4m and averaging £22m a season.</em></p>
              <p><em>Arsenal = spent £102m; £81.7m recouped with a net loss of £20.3m and averaging £4m a season.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>So we see if Rafa so experienced and have spent the most when we take away Chelsea in this last 5 years alone but he has still not brough the title back... So its not so easy for Hughes, who is totally new in the top level... So I don't think we can blame him if they can't win it in this next 2 yrs. But if he can do it within this 2 years... Then great for him.</p>

              <p>I would perhaps agree that money may buy you form but not eventual success.  Don't think MH was thinking of class re the recent transfers.  Is the implication that Man City has no class?</p>
