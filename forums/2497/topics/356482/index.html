              <h2>Arsenal 1-2 Chelsea</h2>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/domr/maloudaceleb412.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="232"></p>
              <p>Poland international Lukasz Fabianski had a birthday to forget as his
              error gifted Chelsea a 2-1 victory in their FA Cup semi-final defeat of
              Arsenal at Wembley.</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott put the Gunners ahead after 18 minutes when his volley took a deflection off Ashley Cole and beat Petr Cech.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              fought back and levelled through Florent Malouda, and sealed a return
              to Wembley when Didier Drogba latched on to a long ball ahead of the
              on-rushing Fabianski, and slotted into a empty net six minutes from
              time.</p>
              <p>Although Andrey Arshavin went close in stoppage time, there
              was no way back for the Gunners, allowing Chelsea to claim capital
              dominance, while also quietly keeping them on track for the Treble.</p>
              <p>And,
              as almost a side issue, there is bound to be a further clamour for Guus
              Hiddink to stay on as manager beyond next month, although it had not
              looked too good for the Dutchman earlier on.</p>
              <p>Having conceded
              seven goals in a week, the last thing Petr Cech needed was to see
              another flash past him in slightly dubious circumstances.</p>
              <p>In
              fairness, Cech was not the only one culpable. Nicolas Anelka was caught
              on his heels as Kieran Gibbs nipped past to reach Emmanuel Adebayor's
              neat pass.</p>
              <p>Gibbs' cross was decent, allowing Theo Walcott to let fly with a first-time volley that flicked off Ashley Cole's hand.</p>
              <p>The
              deflection did alter the direction of the ball. Yet the feeling
              persisted that the Cech of three years ago would have kept it out.</p>
              <p>Walcott's
              goal was just reward for a sparkling start. The young England star was
              the pick of an Arsenal side whose movement was a joy to watch, even if
              their end product was not always the best.</p>
              <p>Denilson and Abou
              Diaby had been asked to anchor midfield. Yet they still found time to
              push forward. Indeed, with a bit more composure, Diaby might have found
              the net himself.</p>
              <p>The Gunners' bench contained Arshavin, Samir Nasri and Aaron Ramsey. In other areas they were lacking, specifically goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>In all probability Manuel Almunia would not have been involved at Wembley even if an ankle injury had kept him on the sidelines.</p>
              <p>On
              Friday Wenger expressed his faith in Fabianski. It looked more like
              blind optimism judging by the Pole's first-half performance.</p>
              <p>On
              his 24th birthday, Fabianski was the one handing out presents, setting
              the tone barely two minutes into the game when he lost out in an aerial
              duel with Drogba, Gibbs forced to chase back and hack off the line as
              the Ivorian's header was about to bounce in.</p>
              <p>Fabianski was then
              fortunate to escape when he failed to get behind a fierce shot from
              Florent Malouda that skimmed under his body before flashing across goal.</p>
              <p>It
              all pointed to an equaliser, which duly arrived when Malouda cut inside
              Emmanuel Eboue and beat Fabianski at his near post, although it was
              hard to quibble with the Frenchman's accuracy.</p>
              <p>Anelka hit a post
              after robbing Diaby inside the Arsenal box just before half-time and
              Chelsea continued to look the more likely scorers after the break, even
              though their opponents were, in patches, the better team.</p>
              <p>An
              acrobatic clearance by Alex may have denied Walcott, who was involved
              in a fascinating duel with England team-mate Cole, but it fell
              perfectly for Robin van Persie, who could only fire disappointingly
              over.</p>
              <p>Anelka was off target with a header at the other end, before Lampard volleyed an excellent chance wide from Drogba's cross.</p>
              <p>Through all this, Fabianski had been relatively stable.</p>
              <p>All
              that changed six minutes from the end when he inexplicably raced out of
              his area as Drogba brushed off Mikael Silvestre to reach Lampard's long
              ball.</p>
              <p>What should have been a 50-50 duel turned into a walkover
              as Drogba skipped round Fabianski and tapped Chelsea into the final,
              where they will meet either Manchester United or Everton on May 30.</p>

              <p>Chelsea were deserved winners  in a good match. It was a very spirited performance by both sides, with Frank Lampard making some very good tackles in the match, which doesn't always happen.</p>
              <p>Arsenal was lucky though to finish the match with all 11 men with Denilson actually putting his hands on the referee. He didn't push the referee or hit him, but that wasn't like a friendly arm round the referee or something. A less lenient referee would also have sent him off.</p>
              <p>There was a bit of luck involved in the opening goal with a deflection off Ashley Cole. However, Adebayor did well on Chelsea's right flank to create the opening and Chelsea's defence was left open and exposed.</p>
              <p>Ivanovic didn't have a good match in my opinion and made a needless brash challenge that earned him a yellow card.</p>
              <p>At both ends, Adebayor and Drogba made use of their large size which made it hard for opposing players to get them off the ball. And it was their good touch that resulted in good chances.</p>
              <p>There was a bit of luck involved in the opening goal with a
                  deflection off Ashley Cole. However, Adebayor did well on Chelsea's
                  right flank to create the opening and Chelsea's defence was left open
                  and exposed.</p>
              <p>Drogba's goal reminds me of the one he scored against Man U in the FA Cup final two seasons ago. Quite similar in the sense that it involved a lob by Frank Lampard, a Drogba who outmuscled the last defender and good touch of the ball to beat the keeper and finish. Silly of him to concede the yellow for his celebrations though.</p>
              <p>Van Persie was subject to some rough treatment but to me, Arsenal really lost their attacking threat when Adebayor came off. Against lesser teams, Arshavin coming on late in the game might have made a difference, he is a not bad player but something special would be needed to beat Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Arsenal is left only with the Champs' League as most realistic chance of silverware this season and are infact lucky they are meeting Man U of the 3 other semi-finalists. Man U in europe seems like the most beatable and least convincing as compared to Barcelona and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>But with their back four changing so constantly and injuries having limited the seasons of players like Van Persie and today's goalscorer. it really seems like it isn't Arsenal's year so far.</p>

              <p><strong>“Yes [I feel sorry for him] because he is a great goalkeeper and I think it was not his greatest day,” Wenger told <strong>Setanta Sports</strong>’ Dan Roan after the game.</strong></p>
              <p>“But we have to take notes on board and he will learn a lot from today’s game.</p>
              <p>“Inexperience? Yes. It was a game of course during which every mistake could be costly.”</p>
              <p>“It is just disappointing because we had a good start, and we dropped a little bit physically,” he added.</p>
              <p>“In the second half we had a few chances and the game was tight. I think that today we gave away two cheap goals.”</p>
              <p>The Frenchman does not think that the Wembley pitch is good enough
              to play such a big game, and he said: “I believe as well that as long
              as the pitch is in a bad state you cannot see a great game in terms of
              technique. It is terrible.</p>
              <p>“I believe that when people pay to watch a football game you have to make sure the pitch allows you to play a good game.”</p>
