              <blockquote>
              <p>Arsenal will be looking to keep their Premier League title dream alive 
              with a win against Birmingham City at St Andrew's on Saturday afternoon.
              <br> <br>However, Gunners manager Arsene Wenger and his players have bad 
              memories of seeing their aspirations derail at the Midlands outfit in 
              the past.
              <br> <br>Ahead of their game with the Blues at the end of February 2008, they
               sat atop the table, but a 2-2 draw and a shocking leg break for Croatia
               striker Eduardo, proved to be their downfall.
              <br> <br>Three consecutive stalemates followed - against Aston Villa, Wigan 
              and Middlesbrough - and a defeat at Chelsea started their spiral from 
              the summit.
              <br> <br>Wenger will be hoping his side are made of sterner stuff this time 
              and he is likely to use their failings two years ago as his inspiration.
              <br> <br>Arsenal have won their previous five league fixtures and they sit 
              just two points adrift of leaders Manchester United and, with a 
              favourable run-in, the Emirates Stadium-based club will be confident of 
              going close this term.
              <br> <br>Birmingham's form has taken a turn for the worst following a 
              fantastic mid-season run that yielded seven wins and five draws from 12 
              fixtures.
              <br> <br>They have won just one in the last four - at Portsmouth - and 
              back-to-back defeats against Sunderland and at Blackburn Rovers on 
              Wednesday has locked Alex McLeish's men in ninth spot.
              <br> <br>Their unlikely European assault appears to be over, but a successful
               mid-table finish will be more than welcome for the side that won 
              promotion from the Championship last season.
              <br> <br>The visitors will be without Thomas Vermaelen through suspension 
              following his dismissal in last weekend's victory against West Ham 
              United.
              <br> <br>Long-term absentees Aaron Ramsey (broken leg), Kieran Gibbs 
              (metatarsal fracture), Robin Van Persie (ankle) and Johan Djourou (knee)
               are still sidelined.
              <br> <br>William Gallas' calf problem is easing, but the contest may come too
               soon for the Frenchman.
              <br> <br>Garry O'Connor (hip) and Lee Carsley (ankle) continue to be the only
               concerns for McLeish.
              <br> <br>Birmingham may still be hurting from their loss to Arsenal earlier 
              in the season in north London.
              <br> <br>The classy Gunners secured a 3-1 win thanks to efforts from Van 
              Persie, Abou Diaby amd Andrey Arshavin. Birmingham's sole reply came 
              seven minutes before half-time through Lee Bowyer.</p>

               has no new injury concerns or suspensions to deal with, but although he
               has largely kept faith with a familiar starting XI throughout the 
              season, he may opt to change things after back-to-back defeats. <br><br>However,
               Garry O'Connor (hip/thigh) and Lee Carsley (ankle) are both out of 
              contention, while Gregory Vignal, back on the bench against Blackburn in
               midweek following injury, is lacking full match fitness.<br><br>David 
              Murphy is still recovering from a hamstring problem. <br><em><br>Last 
              starting XI (v Blackburn): </em>Hart; Carr, Johnson, Dann, Ridgewell, 
              Gardner (Larsson 74), Bowyer, Ferguson, Fahey (Phillips 79), McFadden, 
              Jerome (Benitez 73). <em>Subs Not Used:</em> Taylor, Michel, Parnaby, 
              Vignal.<br><strong><br>Arsenal</strong><br><br>For 
              the first time in the League this season, Wenger is without centre-half 
              Thomas Vermaelen, a major success story following his arrival from Ajax 
              last summer. The Belgian serves a one-match ban for his controversial 
              dismissal against West Ham, after failing in an appeal to have the red 
              card rescinded.<br><br>His absence - and that of calf injury victim William Gallas - 
              means Wenger may pair the two veterans, Mikael Silvestre and Sol Campbell, in 
              central defence, although the versatile Alex Song could conceivably be 
              deployed as a centre-back; he showed typical composure and tenacity when
               switched there against the Hammers to fill the gap created by 
              Vermaelen's sending-off.<br><br>Striker Nicklas Bendtner has 
              overcome an ankle injury and will play, but Robin van Persie, whose 
              recovery from ankle ligament damage is progressing well, is not yet 
              ready to return. Johan Djourou, Kieran Gibbs and Aaron Ramsey are 
              also long-term absentees.<br><br><em>Last starting XI (v West Ham):</em> Almunia, Eboue, Campbell, Vermaelen, Clichy, Fabregas, Song, Denilson, 
              Nasri (Sagna 74), Bendtner (Diaby 58), Arshavin (Eduardo 84). <em>Subs 
              Not Used:</em> Fabianski, Rosicky, Walcott, Silvestre. </span></p>

              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><strong>PREDICTION</strong><br><br>Arsene Wenger has 
              insisted his players are "too intelligent" to allow next week's mammoth 
              clash against Barcelona
               to distract them from the job in hand: beating Birmingham. But Blues' 
              boss Alex McLeish
               has warned Arsenal
               that his team will play "hard but fair" against them. <br><br>With 
              memories of Eduardo's fate inevitably revived, McLeish stressed: "You 
              must be able to make tackles in football. I'll certainly say to my team 
              'don't stand back and admire them', but there won't be any rough stuff. 
              We know if we are open, Arsenal will rip us apart, but we believe we 
              have got players who can cause Arsenal problems as well."<br><br>He 
              added: "You've got to be competitive and, if you are brought up in the 
              British game, that is the style of play. Arsene has created a European 
              style in his team, with an international flavour, and they are fantastic
               to watch. But if we stand around and watch them we will get a battering
               so you've got to be making tackles. You must be able to make tackles in
               the game of football. It is a contact sport."<br><br>The Blues have 
              taken points off of Manchester United, Chelsea 
              and Liverpool
               already this season, so Arsenal know it will be 
              tough. Their challenge is to stand up to and overcome the physical stuff
               with their passing and technical ability.   <br><br>History is on their
               side - this will be the 130th meeting between the two teams, with Arsenal 
              having won 57 of the previous encounters to Birmingham's 38; there have 
              been 34 draws. And although the Blues have conceded just 10 league goals
               at home this season, a total only Manchester United (nine) can
               better, Arsenal have not failed to score at St Andrew's since May 1979.<br><em><strong><br>Birmingham

              <p>Kevin Phillips dented Arsenal's title hopes with a dramatic late 
              equaliser at St Andrews.</p>
              <p>Samir Nasri had come off the bench to fire the Gunners in front 
              10 minutes from time.</p>
              <p>But Blues substitute Phillips enjoyed a stroke of luck in 
              injury-time as the ball looped off him and over Manuel Almunia to level.</p>
              <p>Arsene Wenger was greeted with boos from the Birmingham fans as 
              he made his way along the touchline to the Arsenal dug-out, still 
              disgruntled by his reaction to Martin Taylor's challenge on Eduardo 
              which badly broke the Gunners striker's leg in 2008.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER lost his rag after a late goal from Birmingham striker Kevin Phillips dented his Arsenal side's title hopes. The Frenchman had already expressed anger at the challenge by Blues midfielder Craig Gardner on Cesc Fabregas, which left the Spaniard with a knee injury. And he uttered a four-letter-word response when asked whether there had been more than one bad tackle during the 1-1 draw.</h2>
              <p class="article">Wenger said: "How is Fabregas? I don't know. We will have to assess him tomorrow. But it was a bad tackle, one more. "He got tackled at the knee, kicked just under the knee. We tried to take him off but he said he was all right. "Am I suggesting there were a lot of bad tackles? Leave me alone with that, for f***'s sake.</p>
              <p class="article">"You are always looking for controversy, you do not need me to tell you what happened on the pitch. "I can give you my opinion about our game but you always create this controversy."</p>
              <p class="article">As regards whether Fabregas will be fit for the midweek Champions League game with Barcelona, Wenger said: " I don't know. We have to assess him tomorrow."</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger also felt that Phillips' equaliser, which cancelled out a goal from substitute Samir Nasri , was offside. But he admitted his team had enough opportunities to have wrapped up the three points</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "It is disappointing and a big blow to our title hopes because, in our position, we had to win all our games. "The pitch was difficult to play on but in the second half we were on top but then got caught at the end.</p>
              <p class="article">"Their goal was offside but in football you are never finished when two teams fight to the end and we had enough chances to have scored a second goal."</p>
              <p class="article">Birmingham manager Alex McLeish meanwhile insisted Wenger was wrong to believe there was a vendetta against Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "The tackle by Craig on Fabregas was robust. I know what Arsene was getting at because if you follow through, even if you have got the ball, then at that speed you can hurt a player. "But there were similar tackles by the Arsenal players and you have got to take it on the chin.</p>
              <p class="article">"I think we deserved it. It was a kick in the guts when they went ahead with 10 minutes to go. "But again we showed that never-say-die attitude and Kevin came up trumps again. "We have been giving him a cameo role this season and it was the sort of goal he has been getting all his career and he is a great credit to his profession."</p>
