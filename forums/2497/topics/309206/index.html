              <p><strong>Frank Rijkaard has no plans to leave Barcelona in order to take over at Chelsea, according to the Dutchman's brother and adviser. Chelsea manager Avram Grant has come in for criticism following Sunday's Carling Cup final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grant's team selection was condemned while captain John Terry appeared to orchestrate Chelsea's extra-time team-talk, with the Israeli left in the shadows of the England international. Grant has lost just three of his 35 games in charge, however reports have claimed that his days at Stamford Bridge could well be numbered if he doesn't secure a major trophy this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rijkaard has been linked with the Chelsea position in the past, with owner Roman Abramovich still craving football with verve and vigour. However, Rijkaard's brother, Herman, has played down rumours linking the Barca coach with a move away from Camp Nou.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Frank is having a very good time at Barcelona," Herman Rijkaard told <em>The Independent</em>. "This is his fifth year and it is going well at the moment. The team is growing and if they can keep growing they will win the championship. "He has one season left [after this one] and he has decided to fulfil his contract period with Barcelona. All the fuss is happening where you are in England.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Maybe they [Chelsea] would like to have him because he is a good trainer and a decent guy, but it is not an option at the moment. "He has still one year left and he's not the kind of guy who signs a deal and then doesn't fulfil it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"But we are happy at the moment. Barcelona is a big club with big players and it's a beautiful city. He and his family are very happy there. "Frank has money. He can eat two or three steaks a day if he wants to. He has a contract and he is happy."</p>
