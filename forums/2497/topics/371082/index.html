              <p>Most talented youngsters spend their lives
              hoping and praying that they may one day realise a dream of becoming
              professional footballers with the guarantee of fame, a full bank
              account and an Aston Martin in the driveway. This is the way the
              business and football world measures success but it does not always
              lead to a happy life. That's a lesson Sebastian Deisler quickly became
              familiar with as he began to learn the harsh realities of modern
              football.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>At
              the end of September, Deisler will launch a book that unveils some of
              the less glamorous sides of professional football that ultimately led
              him to bring down the curtain on a promising career already as a
              27-year old. This was an unlikely and unfortunate finish for the "most
              talented German midfielder since Günter Netzer" who, blessed with
              speed, dribbling ability and an eye for a cross, burst on to the scene
              with Borussia Mönchengladbach as an 18-year-old in 1998.</p>
              <p>Young
              girls were fainting in his presence and "Basti Fantasti," as the
              tabloids called him, was on top of Bayern Munich's list because he had
              a rare marketability as well as raw skill. So eager were the Bavarians
              to get this <em>wunderkind</em> that they paid Deisler a cool 10.2m
              euros (£7.3m) as a signing-on fee on top of the £6.6m that his club
              Hertha Berlin received when Franz Beckenbauer and co eventually got
              Deisler's name on a contract in 2001.</p>
              <p>In three seasons in
              Berlin, Deisler had set the Bundesliga alight despite being out for
              over a year with two nasty knee injuries. When he appeared for media
              interviews, the easy-going and eloquent Deisler gave no indication that
              he was slowly developing a serious depression. But behind the scenes
              Deisler was struggling to cope with the eternal quest for status, power
              and titles which according to himself were key symbols in a world
              dominated by huge egos.</p>
              <p>"I was at constant war with myself to
              keep myself afloat in a world of the rich and famous where I certainly
              did not feel at ease", said Deisler in an interview with <em>Die Welt</em>.</p>
              <p>"I
              was only interested in the joy of playing football and for me
              Gucci-glasses and Prada T-shirts were less important. At one stage I
              found myself sitting in my apartment in Berlin thinking "everybody in
              Germany knows your name, you have reached the top and outside your door
              is a Mercedes. Is this it? Is there not anything more than this?" You
              know, I was so unhappy. When I was writing autographs I tried to give
              the fans something personal. But the second question they asked me was
              always: What car do you drive or how much money do you make? This
              really made me depressed," said Deisler.</p>
              <p>Deisler also admits
              that there were issues in his childhood which combined with the extreme
              pressure of carrying the football hopes of a whole nation accelerated
              his disillusionment with the game.</p>
              <p>"When I was young playing
              football in the streets, the other kids would mock me for being small.
              We were of course kids but it hit me very hard. At the same time my
              home was not a place I could withdraw to for getting support as my
              parents had other problems to deal with. This made me wish to move away
              from home even though it was too early for me. At the same time my
              ambitions and talent made everything develop far too fast and I was
              thrust into a very harsh adult reality when I was still like a child.
              At that time the national team was doing very poorly, so even though I
              was only 19 everyone expected me to save Germany - the reality was that
              I was the one who needed to be saved. The expectations were simply too
              big to put on my shoulder," he said.</p>
              <p>When, in January 2007,
              Deisler suffered yet another ruptured knee ligament of the kind which
              limited his Bayern spell to just 62 league appearances in four and a
              half years, the German midfielder decided to call it a day, much to the
              frustration of Bayern's general manager Uli Hoeness who then claimed
              that "Bayern had lost the battle of Deisler" and that he felt baffled
              by Deisler's decision.</p>
              <p>Like Hoeness, most of the international
              football community has since Deisler's retirement struggled to come to
              terms with the background for <em>Basti Fantasti</em>'s decision but this will presumably be revealed when Deisler's book (<em>"Zurück ins Leben. Die Geschichte eines Fußballspielers."</em> - "Back to Life - The story of a Footballer") co-written by Michael
              Rosentritt is published on September 29. According to the publisher,
              the book will uncover Deisler's passion and love of the game as well as
              his paranoia and depression. But the book will undoubtedly provide new
              ground for criticising the social trauma inflicted on young footballers
              and the unbearable pressure put on their fragile shoulders.</p>
              <p>Former
              German national coach Rudi Völler earlier brought in a psychologist to
              work with the national team players in the wake of Deisler's nightmare:
              "You have to learn the lesson from what has happened to Sebastian."</p>
              <p>"The
              truth is that the pressure on the players are just getting bigger and
              bigger. It is getting out of hand," Völler said in a statement
              encouraging other coaches to follow suit. But according to chairman of
              the Danish Footballers Union and former Danish international, Thomas
              Lindrup, the international football community still has a lot to learn
              from the Deisler experience.</p>
              <p>"I am sure there are a lot of
              footballers walking around out there with the same problems as Deisler
              but without telling it to anybody because showing emotion is a sign of
              weakness in the modern football world", said Lindrup to <em>Soccernet</em>.
              According to Lindrup, there are three factors that combine in making
              professional football an extremely mentally challenging environment to
              venture into for young talents.</p>
              <p>"When some players go from being
              relatively unknown to earning a lucrative contract with a big club they
              go from one world into another. They have to deal with all the
              insecurities of turning from youngster into an adult and at the same
              time having to deal with all the dangers that follow in the wake of
              becoming famous and earning a huge salary. Many feel alienated because
              they have difficulties adapting to a world which may seem very
              materialistic and superficial. Perhaps they have earlier been the
              centre of a small group and suddenly they are only a small fish in a
              big pond where they feel they are being treated as a commodity and not
              as a person", says Lindrup.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Lindrup
              also points to the fact that too many bad agents create difficult
              scenarios from young and upcoming footballers: "Many agents only have
              an eye for how much money they can make on a deal instead of making
              sure the player will come to a club where his ambitions can be
              fulfilled and where it will be fairly easy to adapt socially for him.
              We have many players who call us only very little time after they have
              arrived at a new club because the coach has immediately thrown them off
              the team and at the same time they have big difficulties adapting to
              the culture of the country they have gone to. Problems like that often
              arise because the agent has not done his work properly."</p>
              <p>Lindrup,
              who was formerly regarded as one of the most talented wingers in
              Denmark while playing for Brøndby IF, also focused on the pressure in
              professional football which can turn young footballs love for the game
              into sheer frustration.</p>
              <p>"When you are traded for x number of
              millions, you are also expected to deliver the goods and usually
              youngsters are not given the time they need in order to be able to
              become a success. The club and the fans perhaps expect the youngster to
              get them out of hot waters but instead it is really the youngster who
              needs the support. How can anyone expect you to lead a club or a nation
              when you are only 17, 18 or 19?</p>
              <p>"Only very few have the mental
              skills to handle such a situation and if your head is not working your
              feet won't either." Deisler, sadly, lacked those mental skills and will
              be remembered as an object lesson rather than as a great footballer.</p>
