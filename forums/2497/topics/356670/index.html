              <p><strong>After Lukasz Fabianski’s
              disappointing performance in the FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea,
              Arsenal fans will be cheered by the news that Manuel Almunia expects to
              return from injury in time for Sunday’s game against Middlesbrough.</strong></p>
              <p>Fabianski celebrated his birthday at Wembley but the Poland
              international’s shaky afternoon took a disastrous turn late on when he
              rushed recklessly off his line, allowing Didier Drogba to round him
              easily and send Chelsea through to the final.</p>
              <p>The stand-in keeper has been handed a chance to impress in the first
              team following an ankle injury sustained by Almunia in the first leg of
              the club’s Champions League quarter final against Villarreal but the
              Spaniard is now closing in on a comeback.</p>
              <p>And while Tuesday’s game against Liverpool will come too soon for
              Almunia, he expects to be back for the Boro game and the first leg of
              the Champions League semi-final against Manchester United at Old
              Trafford next week.</p>
              <p>“The Liverpool game on Tuesday is a bit too early, but I’ll be totally ready for Boro on Sunday,” Almunia told the Daily Star.</p>
              <p>However, Wenger is more cautious over Almunia’s availability for the
              huge game against United, stating: “We don’t know. I don’t know, I
              don’t know, personally.”</p>
              <p>Wenger has also jumped to the defence of the under-fire Fabianski,
              claiming his 2007 signing from Legia Warsaw could yet to prove one of
              Europe's finest goalkeepers.</p>
              <p>"I would not like to put too much responsibility for this defeat on
              Fabianski. It would be unfair," said Wenger. "Let's see him recover and
              not speak too much about what he has done.</p>
              <p>"I believe he will be one of the best goalkeepers in the world.</p>
              <p>"He has the talent, he is brave, he is intelligent. Technically he is very good.</p>
              <p>"He was not at his best against Chelsea, but we have to accept that.
              It can happen to anyone - it happened to [Petr] Cech on Tuesday."</p>
