            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;"><strong>David Beckham believes his imminent move to America will have a positive effect on his fitness levels, and that his international aspirations should not suffer as a result of joining LA Galaxy.</strong><br><br>The Real Madrid star is widely expected to be named in Steve McClaren's England squad later on Saturday for the upcoming friendly against Brazil and Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia.<br><br>Beckham's inclusion would mark a dramatic turnaround for the player who was axed from the England setup following the World Cup finals and then told he would never play for Real again after agreeing his move to America.<br><br>However, an impressive run of form during Real's Primera Liga title bid has led to speculation that his international career could also be on the brink of a remarkable rejuvenation.<br><br>The former international skipper is just six caps short of a century of appearances for his country, and Beckham insists a more relaxed schedule in Major League Soccer could aid his quest to recapture his place in the England setup.<br><br>"The (MLS) season is shorter, we only play 30 games a year so we get more time off," Beckham told the British Radio. "I'll be a lot fitter, still as fit as I am now, maybe more fit.<br><br>"The training will be difficult in America, the humidity and weather is going to be a lot hotter and different to Europe.<br><br>"So I still feel I'll be able to play for England if it ever came up again."<br><br>Beckham has also revealed that he spurned approaches from two Italian sides and other English clubs when deciding to join LA Galaxy in January.<br><br>The Real star's quest to raise the profile of the game in a country enamoured with Basketball, Baseball and American Football has been the subject of intense analysis, and Beckham admits he is relishing the imminent challenge.<br><br>Indeed, the midfielder has now explained that he rejected rival offers from prestigious sides in order to pursue his American dream.<br><br>"I had offers from two big clubs in Italy and offers from clubs in England but I just felt it was the right time to pack up and leave," Beckham added.<br><br>"I was honoured to have played for Manchester United for so many years and obviously Real Madrid for four years.<br><br>"But I wanted a different challenge and to me the biggest challenge was going to America and playing in the MLS and living a different lifestyle. I'm looking forward to it."<br><br>Both Bolton and Milan are believed to have been interested in recruiting Beckham on a free transfer. </span></div>
