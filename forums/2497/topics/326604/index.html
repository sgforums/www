              <div><span><strong>Tottenham Hotspur target Andrei Arshavin has reportedly gone on strike at Zenit St Petersburg and his agent claims the playmaker is being treated like a 'slave'. </strong><strong>The Russia international impressed at Euro 2008 to spark a summer bidding war for his services, with Barcelona having two offers rejected.</strong> </span></div>

              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Tottenham are now believed to be in the box-seat to land Arshavin, but the move could be in jeopardy after the 27-year-old refused to play as Zenit crashed out if the Russian Cup on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>To Arshavin's frustration, the Uefa Cup holders are refusing to budge from their £27million valuation and White Hart Lane officials are unwilling to meet the price tag.</p>
              <p>And in an echo of the comments of Fifa president Sepp Blatter in the Cristiano Ronaldo transfer saga, Arshavin's agent, Dennis Lachter, claims the player is being mistreated, telling <em>The Independent</em>: "This is the Russian way.</p>
              <p>"Nothing will change because this is the old Soviet Union way. For the Russian sports establishment the desires of the player mean absolutely nothing. "They are the big bosses. It is a dictatorship. He is a slave."</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0;font-size:2.8em">Arshavin desperate for resolution to Spurs saga</h1>
              <p>Zenit St Petersburg forward Andrei Arshavin has revealed his frustration at the delay over his proposed move to Tottenham - and hopes his 'whining' will convince bosses to let him leave.</p>
              <p>The UEFA Cup holders have rejected formal bids from Barcelona and Tottenham for
                  Arshavin, whose inspirational performances led Russia to the Euro 2008
                  semi-finals.</p>
              <p>Zenit have raised Arshavin's price tag to a reported <strong>27 million euros</strong>, with the
                  27-year-old now fearing he has been priced out of the market.</p>
              <p>'My desire to leave is still as strong, but there is nothing more to do now
                  other than hope for a miracle. I understand perfectly well that if I don't move on now, I probably never
                  will.</p>
              <p>With the prospect of his dream move to Barcelona over for now after the
                  Catalans signed Alexander Hleb, Arshavin has turned his attention to the English
                  Premier League and reiterated his desire to work with Spurs coach Juande Ramos.</p>
              <p>'When Tottenham made their offer I was sceptical at first,' Arshavin
                  continued. 'But after Ramos called me personally and told me that that they were selling
                  Robbie Keane and that he wanted me in his side, the situation changed.</p>
              <p>'A short while later a representative from Spurs arrived to discuss my
                  personal terms and contract. The discussion didn't take long and we agreed on everything quickly. Only
                  then did my asking price go up.</p>
              <p>'Tottenham have a decent squad with (Luka) Modric, (Dimitar) Berbatov and
                  other players, and the club is fully capable of fighting for a place in the
                  Champions League.</p>
              <p>'The main thing is to try my strengths in a league like the English Premier
                  League and play against the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal on a
                  regular basis rather than once every five years.'</p>
              <p>Despite the breakdown in negotiations, Zenit coach Dick Advocaat believes the
                  club have not heard the last from Tottenham and is confident the deal can be
                  resurrected.</p>
              <p>The Dutchman told <em>Rossiskaya Gazeta</em>: 'I am sure Tottenham will be back to make
                  another, more suitable offer for Arshavin's transfer. There is no set time period or deadline for this. Zenit are doing everything
                  in the correct way.</p>
              <p><strong>'If Tottenham can sell Robbie Keane to Liverpool for 25 million euros then in
                  my opinion they should pay good money for Arshavin.'</strong></p>
              <p>Arshavin is currently preparing to fly to Kazan for Zenit's crucial Premier
                  Liga match against league leaders Rubin tomorrow despite reports in the English
                  press that the player is 'on strike'.</p>

              <p style="FONT-SIZE: 26px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; COLOR: #222222">Russia playmaker Andrei Arshavin said he would gladly take a pay cut to play abroad but Zenit St Petersburg were making his departure increasingly difficult, a Russian newspaper reported on Friday.</p>
              <p style="FONT-SIZE: 26px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; COLOR: #222222"> </p>
              <p>"I really wanted to, and still want to, leave. But my club, which didn't want to let me go in the first place, is doing everything possible so that it doesn't happen," Friday's Sport Express quoted Arshavin as saying.</p>
              <p>He led Russia to the Euro 2008 semi-finals and Zenit to their first UEFA Cup triumph in May but made no secret his desire to move to Barcelona. However, Zenit rejected a 15 million euro ($22.75 million) bid from the Catalan club in July.</p>
              <p>"I can only say that if I go abroad, I will earn less than I get in Russia," he said, adding he had not yet given up hope of joining Premier League club Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Zenit coach Dick Advocaat in an interview with Rossisskaya Gazeta newspaper said he wanted Arshavin to stay in Russia but a move to Europe was understandable and natural.</p>
              <p>"First of all, we all want him to stay at Zenit. But in general, of course, a good move could be a step forward in his career. Andrei has been playing for Zenit for seven years," Advocaat said.</p>
              <p>Arshavin earns three million euros per year at Zenit, the highest salary in Russia's league, according to local media.</p>
