            <div class='col-md body'>Just one burning question, which teams did the treble??<br><br>I mean the <strong>REAL </strong> treble - meaning Title, FA CUP plus European Champion Cup.<br><br>Of course I understand in the past, there were milk cup, now league cup, European Cup winners cup. But these don't really count, right?<br><br>In my knowledge, I thought, I repeat, thought, MUFC was the only english club to do it in 99. (and yes, we won it due to all the luck in the world on that night, but a win is a win).  However, I read that some other English Teams did it too..<br><br>I just wish for all other fans to clarify this for me if you could<br><br>**Rem, I am seeking historical clarifications, and not attacks on integrity of clubs.<br><br></div>

It consists of winning a country's top tier league and two cup competitions in the same season. The exact meaning varies from one country to another. The cup competitions may be either "domestic" (open only to clubs from one country) or "continental" (open to the best clubs from across one continent).<br><br>Only three teams have achieved this rare distinction:<br><br>AFC Ajax - The 1972 team won the Dutch Eredivisie, KNVB Cup, and the European Cup.<br><br>PSV Eindhoven - The 1988 team won the Dutch Eredivisie, KNVB Cup, and the European Cup.<br><br>Manchester United - The 1999 team won the English Premier League, the FA Cup, and the Champions League.<br><br>Celtic also achieved The Treble as part of their Quadruple in 1967.<br><br>P.S. you could wiki the article if you want to, don't need to ask people for it,there are also other examples of trebles hat do not adhere to the stricter definition - team winning three trophies as opposed to winning a league and two cup competitions.<br><br></div>
