              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ROBINHO insists that next year’s Manchester derbies will feature TWO sides battling for the Premier League title. The Brazilian star is confident City’s mega-bucks Middle Eastern owners will buy a ‘super team’ this summer. And he predicts that United will soon have more than Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal to worry about. </h2>
              <p class="article">In the meantime, the brilliant £32.5million former Real Madrid midfielder is hell bent on stalling United’s rush to claim a third successive championship tomorrow by helping City to repeat last season’s triumph at Old Trafford. </p>
              <p class="article">Robinho, 25, arrived at Eastlands in a blaze of glory last summer and did lead City into the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. But that is nothing to rival the adulation surrounding United’s Ronaldo — or the achievements of the team in red across the city, who this week booked their place in Rome for the Champions League final with Barcelona. </p>
              <p class="article">In contrast, Robinho has enjoyed a topsy-turvy season. He has banged in 15 goals and put in some match- winning performances. But he has also got plenty of stick for those lacklustre displays that have infuriated fans and team-mates alike. </p>
              <p class="article">He recently went 17 games without a goal but has come back with three on the trot. And he is adamant that this is a sign of things to come, starting in the Manchester derby. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: “I admit I am a little envious of United’s success, but that is only normal. But I intend to help change all that and I think that City will fight for the title next season. “I am convinced things will change. Historically City are one of the great English clubs, we need to be top of the table and I am sure the owners’ objective is to buy a super team this summer. </p>
              <p class="article">“It’s up to the owners but from what I hear there has been some interesting contact with superstars.” City targets include Barcelona’s Thierry Henry, Sporting Lisbon’s highly-rated midfielder Miguel Veloso and Everton central defender Joleon Lescott. </p>
              <p class="article">It is a sign Manchester’s second club aim to mount a serious title challenge for the first time since they last captured the old Division One crown in 1968. Robinho is convinced that it will all happen under Mark Hughes — and four successive victories have certainly done the manager’s case to remain in charge no harm. </p>
              <p class="article">The late-season charge of the Light Blues brigade has put the Eastlands outfit in with a shout of beating West Ham, Fulham and Tottenham to the seventh spot that will guarantee more European football in 2009-10. </p>
              <p class="article">Despite their differences — notably when Robinho bunked off to Brazil without permission in mid-season — the kid who started out at Pele’s old club Santos, remains a big fan of City boss Hughes. He said: “The situation has not always been easy this season. “But I believe Hughes is an excellent coach. I haven’t suffered any big problems with the coach — it was because of him I finally decided to join City.</p>
              <p class="article">“He was very decisive about wanting me and because of this I accepted the challenge.” But Robinho does accept that some supporters might argue he has not lived up to his phenomenal price tag and £160,000-a-week wages. </p>
              <p class="article">He conceded: “It is certain that in my first season I have not always been 100 per cent and people have still not seen the ‘Robinho of Real Madrid’. “Some physical problems and private questions have impeded me but now I am offering my best performances. </p>
              <p class="article">“This season I wanted to be the top scorer in England and, although I would prefer success for the squad and not personal glory, next season this is one of my objectives. “The money I earn does not influence my game. A player always desires to win whenever he goes on the field. “And my dream on Sunday is to beat United and score a beautiful goal. I’ve played in other derbies in Brazil and Spain, and they are always special for players and fans.”</p>

              <h3>CARLOS TEVEZ today issues a come-and-get-me plea to Manchester United's Premier League rivals by insisting: My Old Trafford career is over. </h3>
              <p>The on-loan striker is angry at being left on the bench for long periods and claims United boss Sir Alex Ferguson hasn't tried to sign him permanently.</p>
              <p>Tevez's shock bombshell will alert Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton and Aston Villa - while Iranian businessman Kia Joorabchian's company, which owns the player, has also received a £45million offer from a foreign club.</p>
              <p>In an exclusive interview, Tevez, 25, declares:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00038/516-TEVEZ-2_38597a.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="506"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>AS his Manchester United team-mates danced with joy across the Emirates turf, Carlos Tevez celebrated alongside them. </h3>
              <p>But behind the smiles was anguish. Because joy for a return to the Champions League final was tempered by a sadness that this was one of the last moments of real pleasure he would share with his United brothers. </p>
              <p>It had been coming for months. Frustrated and disappointed at the way he has been treated, Tevez now knows he has to quit. And in a remarkable Sport of the World interview, the Argentinian pulls no punches, laying bare the facts about his two-year United tenure. His revelations will stun Old Trafford on the morning of today's Manchester derby and with United still chasing an unprecedented quadruple. </p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson last week claimed he thinks of his players as part of his own family. But Tevez feels like an outsider. Twice South American Player of the Year, a national hero in Argentina, reduced to a bit-part, an afterthought. </p>
              <p>"Me? I have not been treated as a member of the family," he said. "I do not feel wanted. I feel bad over my situation, I do, but it's very, very difficult to stay any longer. I guess what I'm saying is goodbye. </p>
              <p>"I don't think I will be a Manchester United player next season. I have done everything I possibly can but they have never made me an offer or given me a contract so I have to leave. I don't think I deserve to be in this position but you realise if your time is up you have to go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="inline-image-516"><img title="FINAL FLOURISH - Alex Ferguson hugs Carlos Tevez after the 2008 Champions League victory over Chelsea" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00038/tevezspread2_516x416_38249a.jpg" alt="FINAL FLOURISH - Alex Ferguson hugs Carlos Tevez after the 2008 Champions League victory over Chelsea">
              <div class="caption"><em>FINAL FLOURISH - Alex Ferguson hugs Carlos Tevez after the 2008 Champions League victory over Chelsea</em></div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p><strong>Realistically, my time is over and I think I will be at another club next season. It's very, very difficult to stay any longer, so I have to finish this season the best I can and move on.</strong></p>
              <p>"I still have the same hunger and I will give my all to win the last two trophies we are chasing so I can move on knowing I have done everything for the team. "The fans treat me like family, but United have not signed me so they do not respect me as a footballer.</p>
              <p>"It makes me feel good when Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick talk well about me but they are not the manager. I train very hard, play well and then I'm dumped. When I play I feel good, then when I don't I am upset. </p>
              <p>"Things have changed dramatically this season. I was dropped - yet I didn't perform badly. Sir Alex never gave me an explanation but I never asked him for one because it is not in my character.</p>
              <p>"I accepted it but maybe Sir Alex didn't feel the same way about me. Maybe he didn't have confidence in me any more." Tevez has become frustrated this season at his lack of appearances. Despite being involved in more games than Rooney or Dimitar Berbatov, he has either started or finished on the bench an astonishing 27 times. He has been an unused substitute on 10 further occasions. </p>
              <p>He has also been substituted 12 times in all competitions and has played the full 90 minutes in just 20 games, five of them in the Carling Cup. He added: "I scored four goals against Blackburn in the Carling Cup but then got dropped for the next game.</p>
              <p>"I came on and scored against Porto in the Champions League quarter-final but was dropped for the away leg. I scored two against Fulham and was dropped for the next game. </p>
              <p>"Whether I come on and play well or whether I come on the pitch and play just OK, I know I am going to get dropped. It has a negative impact - your mentality is affected and you get demoralised."</p>

              <p><em>Ferguson has had to juggle Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Berbatov and Tevez into just three forward places.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Tevez feels he has been the one who has missed out most. But he refused to be drawn into a slanging match over the £31.75million summer signing of Bulgarian striker Berbatov from Spurs. "It's not about Berbatov," he said. "People keep comparing me to Berbatov but it's not Berbatov's fault. It's just the way I've been treated I'm upset about.</strong></p>
              <p>"I played last season and was the second top scorer. We won the Champions League and the Premier League. I helped to achieve that success and then I was dumped for no real reason."</p>
              <p>Tevez finished top scorer for his clubs in Argentina and Brazil, for his country at the Olympics and second for United behind Ronaldo last season. He has still scored 13 goals this term, but explained: "I've started every game in the Carling Cup and some in the FA Cup but only a few in the League. </p>
              <p>"I'm disappointed not to get more games but it's been the choice of the coach. "If I run my a*** off, if I score or don't score, I know that after 60 minutes I'm going to be taken off. If I don't start I know I am only going to get 15 or 20 minutes. </p>
              <p>"I enjoyed playing with Rooney, Ronaldo and Berbatov. They are all excellent players. "But this season I can only recall playing with Rooney up top about five times. It's not been like last year, when we played that formation a lot." </p>
              <p>Tevez has been a fans' favourite since joining United on a two-year loan deal two years ago. He hoped Ferguson would agree a deal with Kia Joorabchian to sign him permanently. But discussions have never taken place. </p>
              <p>Tevez insisted: "When I played regularly last season I scored. I did everything I could but there was never any attempt to sign me permanently. United did not take up the option at the end of the first year and up until now I've never had any discussions about my contract. </p>
              <p>"If ever there was a time to sign me it was at the end of last year but there was no effort to sign me. "The major concentration was to sign other players and by January there was still nothing. They signed other players but still there was no bid for me. </p>
              <p>"United have never offered me any contract. So I guess I have to finish the season the best I can and move on. The fans have been great with me, I love them. And every time I put the shirt on I fight for the club. I have done everything I possibly can at United but circumstances are forcing me to leave. </p>
              <p>"I also want to make it very clear that it's not about money. I have read stories claiming I've asked for £6m, £9m and £12m. But I have never asked Sir Alex or David Gill for money. </p>
              <p>"When I sign for another club if anyone says 'It was impossible for Carlos to sign for Man United because he was asking for £8m' it is not true." </p>
              <p>Tevez also set the record straight about his family. He said: "It's not true my family are unhappy in England. It's not true I want to leave England for Spain. My four-year-old daughter Florencia is learning English and my wife is very happy living in England.</p>
              <h4>Accept</h4>
              <p>"We want to stay. I want to play in England because it is the best League in the world and it suits my style. "Any club I join, whether it be Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool or Everton, will be a rival of Manchester United. I would like to thank the United fans for their support. They will always have a special place in my heart. </p>
              <p>"If I was a United fan I wouldn't want to see their player in any other shirt but I think they will accept I've done everything I can." </p>
              <p>Tevez's economic rights are owned by a group of investors headed by Joorabchian, who said: "There are a lot of Premier League clubs interested in Carlos but it would be unprofessional to start talking to them before the season has ended.</p>
              <p>"There are also foreign clubs interested in him but since Carlos' preference is to stay here then that is the first place we have to look. "We received a formal offer in January from a foreign club for a figure in excess of £40m, although out of respect for United we have not spoken to them yet. </p>
              <p>"Carlos' final destination will be made solely on what's best for Carlos and his family." For Tevez, the realisation that he has to walk out on United is painful. He concluded sadly: "I've given everything for United. I can leave with my head held high."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">SPURS are fighting Manchester City, Chelsea and Real Madrid to land Carlos Tevez. The Argentinian striker believes his time is up at Manchester United but wishes to stay in the Premier League. </h2>
              <p class="article">Sources close to Tevez have told SunSport that Spurs boss Harry Redknapp loves the player so much he will try to buy him from his owners for around £25million. </p>
              <p class="article">Wheeler-dealer Redknapp is planning a major clearout at White Hart Lane in a bid to raise substantial funds for new players. He wants rid of Russian striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, England attacker Darren Bent and midfielder David Bentley — and will also consider offers for others. </p>
              <p class="article">Redknapp can guarantee Tevez first-team football and is convinced the popular striker would be a major hit in North London. He reckons Tevez could take Spurs to the next level and give them a chance of competing for Champions League places. But he recognises Tottenham would be outsiders with so many clubs after Tevez. </p>
              <p class="article">Tevez insiders insisted: “There are lots of different clubs all over Europe who want Tevez and each one is being considered carefully. </p>
              <p class="article">“Spurs would really like him but there are questions about whether they can raise the money quickly enough. “Tevez would like his future sorted out soon and Spurs will have to do a lot of work if they want to get him.”</p>

              <p><br>Of course he will have lots of clubs interested on taking him... No doubt about that. Anyone who is willing to pay $30m should be... But it's still Fergie's call to keep or let him go. Fergie will have to decide if he is worth it... or if they can afford it...</p>
              <p>And I won't say his workrate, dedication to United, teamwork is second to none really... I can name Rooney as a much more devoted player than him anytime... Then there is also Fletcher as well, he is just as dedicated... Just as Vidic has been too... They are all very much team players...
