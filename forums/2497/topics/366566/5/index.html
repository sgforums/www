              <p>Kinda also reflects how much Owen meant to them. They could've gotten him at an even lower price. I'm pretty sure if they'd have offered him 20-30k per week along with incentives he would chosen Liverpool. But sadly they did'nt so he did'nt have much of a choice did he?</p>

              <p>Once with Liverpool....so u mean he cannot play for Liverpool's rivals? Dont forget he is out of contract this summer What's stopping Pool from bringing him back? And has been out of Pool so many years oredi. Its not as if he is currently with Liverpool and then decide to go to Man Utd.</p>
              <p>I believe some of the posters here have a very cloudy meaning of traitor. I would call Scholes eg. a traitor id he is still contracted with Utd and decides to go to one of Utd's rivals but he is not a traitor is he has left Utd for another club then decided to join a rival when his contract is up when a rival club wanna sign him.</p>

              <p>We fans are sometimes to eager and quick to criticise. The guy needs a job, he needs to be at a club that matches his talents and ambitions. So among all the clubs that have approached him, it is a no-brainer he will go to the club that can mos likely resurrect his career. Futhermore, next year is the World Cup.</p>
              <p>So if we are real football fans, we should know its for his best nd accept it just like we accepted Ronaldo's switch coz we know he have given his all and its his lifelong dream to play for Utd. Im keepng my fingers crossed it wont be the last time we see him in a Utd shirt.</p>

              <p>Well, its still unclear how Fergie will utilise Owen.</p>
              <p>Rotation like Tevez? or sub like Solskjaer.</p>
              <p>Either way, he probably wont be playing as often as in Allardyce's team. So that should also mean lesser chance of getting injured lor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/michael-owen"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Michael Owen</strong></span></a><strong> has admitted to being as surprised by his move to </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> as many onlookers were after putting pen to paper on a two-year deal at Old Trafford, but believes he is joining a team of 'winners'.</strong>Â </p>
              <p>At 29, Owen realises his best days are behind him but still thinks he can prove his doubters wrong by playing a part in helping Manchester United to continue their success next season.Â </p>
              <p>"Manchester United, you automatically think winners, you think trophies, you think the stadium, the massive fan base, but until you sign you don't really let yourself get carried away," said Owen. "There's so many top players here, obviously it's a very exciting time for me.Â </p>
              <p>"Right throughout the squad they are obviously a fantastic team with fantastic players, that's why they've all won so much throughout their careers, and hopefully I can jump on the bandwagon, score a few goals, and help us to further success."Â </p>
              <p>And even he - scorer of 40 goals in 89 England internationals - admits he is excited about playing in the same team as the likes of Wayne Rooney, Dimitar Berbatov and Ryan Giggs.Â </p>
              <p>"A few days ago I never really had it in my wildest dreams," said Owen, who seemed set to be fought over by Hull and Stoke before Ferguson made his move. "I probably won't sleep at night thinking about all the top players I'm going to be playing alongside, so there's a lot to think about and a lot to get excited about."Â </p>
              <p>Owen will also benefit from the full backing of Ferguson, having known for some time his new manager was an admirer of his talents. "In the last few years I had an idea that the manager obviously thought I had something, so I always clung to that hope that he would ask me to come and play for him one day," he added.Â </p>
              <p>"I'm not silly, I know there will be some people saying maybe the manager shouldn't have signed me. That gradually goes in time and as soon as the first game kicks off, I can do my talking on the pitch."</p>

              <p>Owen have a habit of scoring important goals so I belief if he plays, he will be very useful against the bigger sides... But I am not expecting him to be used every match or for theÂ full 90 most of the time... Fergie knows how to control it and will keep him hungry and eager...</p>
              <p>One more thing that I find surprising is,Â Owen scored 23 goals in 62 games in a poor Newcastle team, at a ratio of one every 2.69 games. Tevez scored 34 in 99 games in a magnificent Manchester United team, a rate of 2.97. Last season, his ratio was 3.4.</p>
              <p>And during his time at Real, Owen scored his 13 La Liga goalsÂ ending the campaign with the league's highest ratio of goals scored to number of minutes played andÂ it was mostly from the bench too...</p>
              <p>Like I have said, whatever happens, it won't matter as he is free, came without a transfer fee... Fergie has been a fans of his for a long time already and almost bought him 1 or 2 yrs ago when it became known he had a buy-out in his contract...</p>
