              <div id="news05LeftStory">
              <p><strong>Manchester United is delighted to
              announce that it has signed Michael Owen on a two-year contract. The
              striker was out of contract, so no transfer fee is involved.</strong><br><br>Sir
              Alex Ferguson said: "Michael is a world class forward with a proven
              goalscoring record at the highest level and that has never been in
              question. Coming to Manchester United with the expectations that we
              have is something that Michael will relish.”<br><br>Michael Owen said:
              "I had just begun to talk to other clubs when out of the blue Sir Alex
              phoned me on Wednesday afternoon, invited me to have breakfast with him
              the next morning during which he told me that he wanted to sign me. I
              agreed without a moment's thought. <br><br>"This is a fantastic
              opportunity for me and I intend to seize it with both hands. I am now
              looking forward to being a Manchester United player and I am fortunate
              that I already know so many of the players here. I missed pre-season
              last year and am pleased that I will be starting at Carrington from day
              one. <br><br>"I want to thank Sir Alex for the faith he has shown in
              me and I give him my assurance that I will repay him with my goals and
              performances.”</p>

              <p><strong>His
              arrival at Old Trafford may have raised a few eyebrows, but in Michael
              Owen, United have signed one of the finest goalscorers in the history
              of English football.<br><br></strong>The former Liverpool, Real Madrid
              and Newcastle United striker has scored over 200 goals at club level,
              and 40 goals in 89 England internationals.<br><br>Owen burst to
              prominence at his boyhood side, Liverpool, where he scored on his first
              team debut aged just 17. His lightning pace, untraceable movement and
              clinical finishing made him a Premier League revelation, and it wasn’t
              long before he took the international stage by storm.</p>
              </div>
              <p><br>The
              1998 World Cup in France was Michael’s springboard, as he scored an
              incredible solo goal in England’s second-round encounter with
              Argentina. While red-carded United winger David Beckham was left to
              carry the can for the Three Lions’ penalty shootout exit, Owen was a
              national hero.<br><br>His Liverpool career went from strength to
              strength, and in 2001 his part in the Merseysider’s triple cup haul of
              UEFA Cup, FA Cup and League Cup – together with international
              exertions, which included a hat-trick against Germany – earned him the
              Ballon d’Or and FWA Player of the Year awards.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MICHAEL OWEN vowed to prove his doubters wrong after completing a shock move to Old Trafford last night. </h2>
              <p class="article">Owen signed a two-year deal as Manchester United fans filled internet message boards questioning the capture of the injury-prone former Liverpool star. </p>
              <p class="article">But the striker promised to start next season with a bang and prove Alex Ferguson was spot-on to take a gamble on him.</p>
              <p class="article">Owen said: "I know there will be people out there saying 'maybe the manager shouldn't have signed me'. But when the first game kicks off I can do my talking on the pitch - and I want to start with a bang." </p>
              <p class="article">The 2001 European Footballer of the Year also wants to prove he is not a crock. He said: "A lot has been made out of it - but I certainly do not think I'm injury-prone. </p>
              <p class="article">"I'm 29 and played more than 500 games at the highest level for clubs, and with England at international level, so I can't have been on the treatment table all the time. </p>
              <p class="article">"I want to improve on my injury record and, hopefully with the staff here, I'll be ready for every game. Everyone would have got injured had someone stamped on their foot." </p>
              <p class="article">Owen went through two rigorous medicals in London and Manchester - and then serious fitness tests at United's Carrington training ground. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I would like to think everyone was surprised at how the medical was. "But I have passed them before and my fitness is fine." </p>
              <p class="article">Owen said the move was a dream after only Hull had made their interest public until the striker received a call from Ferguson on Wednesday. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: "A few days ago I didn't have this in my wildest dreams. Now I don't think I'll be able to sleep, thinking about all the top players I'll be playing with here. </p>
              <p class="article">"I had just begun to talk to other clubs when out of the blue Sir Alex phoned me on Wednesday. He invited me to have breakfast with him the next morning, during which he told me that he wanted to sign me. I agreed straight away. </p>
              <p class="article">"This is a fantastic opportunity for me and I intend to seize it with both hands. "I'm now looking forward to being a United player and I'm fortunate I know so many of the players here. </p>
              <p class="article">"I missed pre-season last year and am pleased I'll start here from day one. "I want to thank Sir Alex for showing faith in me and I gave him my assurance I'll repay him with my goals and performances." </p>
              <p class="article">Fergie made his dramatic move for Owen after losing out on Lyon's Karim Benzema to Real Madrid. But the United boss believes he has still landed a top-class signing who will grab the opportunity presented to him in the twilight of his career. </p>
              <p class="article">He said: "Michael is a world-class forward with a proven scoring record at the highest level. That has never been in question. </p>
              <p class="article">"Coming to Manchester United with the expectations that we have is something that Michael will relish." </p>
              <p class="article">Owen will earn a basic salary of £50,000-a-week - plus huge bonuses depending on goals and appearances. And the former Real Madrid and Newcastle ace is aiming to grab some silverware after his days at the very top level looked over. He said: "Everything happened so quick and now I think 'wow!' </p>
              <p class="article">"You think Manchester United, you think winners and trophies." Owen admitted that he always felt that one day he might play for United, having represented them as a kid.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "I came here a couple of times as a youngster. I competed in a tournament for them and met the manager. </p>
              <p class="article">"Over the last few years I've spoken to other players and had the idea that Sir Alex still thought I had something to offer. </p>
              <p class="article">"I was always clinging to the hope that he would ask me to come and play for them one day."</p>

              <p>Dear Owen,</p>
              <p>I won't lie to you; I'm one of the sceptics who think that your signing for Man U is a very big mistake on the part of Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>At the same time, though, I hope you'll prove me wrong and regain the form that you once had ten years ago.</p>

              <p>What traitor? He left Liverpool long ages ago for another club before Utd bought him now. Anyway, what's stopping Pool from snapping him up?</p>
              <p>Anyway, being a Utd fan, i can say im pleasantly suprised we came in for Owen. I believe he will be an astute purchase by Ferguson.</p>
              <p>As i mentioned before in my preivious post, he will be a valuable member of the team. But i believe Utd will not stop at Valencia and Owen. Expect 1 or 2 more arrivals soon.</p>
              <p>I am excited for the new season to kick-off.</p>
