              <p>owen has had all the services he could have gotten and yet couldn't even get a sniff of the ball, he left pool cos' he was washed out by then, madrid was quick to dump him, no performance there....sure there were the odd flashes.....as for rooney, he has publicly said he should be the striker and not the 'feeder'.......as for owen, sure he will perform but it isn't going to be this one, it's the one with the first name owen.....lol</p>

              <p><br>First of all, we have to look at the big picture... United do need a back-up striker in case the youngsters like Macheda and Wellbeck are not able to cope with the demands of the long season...</p>
              <p>Secondly, even though you may think his time at Newcastle was poor, but statistics showed he scored more goals than Tevez in terms of match played and goals scored... Something like a ratio of one goal every 2.69 games as reported... He scored a total of 23 goals in 62 games in a poor Newcastle team. Not bad I would say... If we look at Tevez, he scored 34 in 99 games at a rate of 2.92... Not that Tevez is a poor player... We know he is a good player or Chelsea won't be going all out trying to get him from City... His price we all know would be in the nearer reach of $30m. </p>
              <p>So, now we look at Owen... The best thing about the deal is... Its totally free! Nothing to lose, No transfer fee required. In this current market, when Tevez is going for close to $30m, it represent an amazing deal... I am not expecting Owen to be great but 10 goals by the end of the season would be good enough for me... He is there not for the money, he is there to play and win... And I believed thats the thing that will make him worth United's while...</p>
              <p>Shevchenko would probably be closer to a 'has been' and I am not referring to just now... I think the time he signed for Chelsea for a premiership record fee he already was a 'has been' but yet they paid a record fee for him...</p>
