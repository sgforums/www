              <h2>Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant has been added to the casualty
              list at Anfield this summer, as Rafa Benitez prepares a summer overhaul
              of his squad.</h2>
              <p>The 25-year-old was told yesterday that he is free to leave and can
              start talking to other clubs, joining the likes of Andriy Voronin,
              Peter Crouch and Scott Carson on Rafa’s scrapheap.<br><br>The former
              Arsenal man is a long-term target of both Newcastle and West Ham, and
              they may have to fork out in the region of â‚¤7 million as Benitez seeks
              to recoup what he paid Birmingham City for the player in 2006.<br><br>Pennant
              has impressed in spurts during his time on Merseyside, an excellent run
              of form during the second half of the 2006-07 season culminating in a
              brilliant showing during the Champions League in Athens, where the Reds
              lost 2-1 to AC Milan.<br><br>But injuries have ravaged Pennant’s
              season, as he suffered dual stress-fractures in his shins earlier in
              the term and has struggled to regain his place since due to the
              all-action efforts of Dirk Kuyt on the right side of attack.<br><br>The
              former Notts County youth did impress recently in Liverpool’s lame-duck
              league fixtures, putting in a match-winning performance against Fulham
              and a match-saving turn against his old club at St Andrew’s.<br><br>But
              he was absent from the squad for the final two games of the season
              against Manchester City and Tottenham, signalling the almost-certain
              demise of his Anfield career.<br><br>Pennant has been offered as a
              makeweight in Benitez's bid to bring Gareth Barry to Anfield, but his
              exit could also facilitate a move for fellow Arsenal product David
              Bentley, who has long been linked with Liverpool.<br><br>Blackburn
              Rovers boss Mark Hughes remains steadfast in his desire to keep hold of
              his star winger, and Benitez may have to devote a hefty portion of his
              transfer budget to secure the England international, â‚¤15 million being
              touted as the going rate.</p>
