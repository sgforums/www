              <p><strong>Liverpool defender Daniel Agger has conceded title rivals Manchester United are looking scarily strong.</strong> </p>
              <p>The Reds currently trail United by two points at the top of the table as they battle for their first title in 19 years. </p>
              <p>United's run of eight straight wins has helped them overhaul Liverpool at the summit and Agger admits he has been impressed by Liverpool's arch-rivals. </p>
              <p>"I take my hat off to United. They have showed scary strength and have many strings to play on," Agger told <em>Ekstra Bladet</em>. </p>
              <p>"They are the most stable and they win the close games. </p>
              <p>United can move five points clear if they overcome Fulham in their game in hand and Agger admits Liverpool cannot afford any more slip-ups and must beat United in their clash at Old Trafford next month. </p>
              <p>"If we want to keep our chances for the trophy alive we can't draw in so many games," added Agger. </p>
              <p>"Manchester United could be five points ahead of us if they win next Wednesday's game against Fulham. </p>
              <p>"Because of that we will have to beat them at Old Trafford."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Reds defender <span style="color: #000000;">Fabio Aurelio</span> believes Manchester United will suffer a slip-up in the title race before the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>Aurelio is confident Liverpool can win their first Premier League title by overhauling United's two-point lead at the top of the table, despite the fact the champions have a game in hand.</p>
              <p>United's record-breaking run of 13 league games without conceding a goal has been impressive, but Aurelio believes the reigning champions will suffer a sticky patch and that Liverpool must capitalise on any stumble.</p>
              <p>"I don't think they will get positive results right until the end of the season, plus we've also got to go to Old Trafford," said Aurelio. "So, if we keep getting our points we'll have a chance to beat them.</p>
              <p>"Every game is a final now if we want to fight for the title at the end. If United don't lose then they'll finish a few points ahead, but we still have to make sure we do our part."</p>

One is smart enough to know that traditionally Utd are always stronger in the 2nd half of the season while the other is dumb enough to hope that Utd start to lose momentum so that his team can gain the upper hand. I think the Fools need to look at themselves in the mirror and ask how the hell they cannot beat Stoke, West Ham, Wigan and a few others... Teams that Utd beat without having to get into third gear... Now that is "SCARY"...</p></div>
