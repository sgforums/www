              <p>Personally I agree with the fact that the players, rather than Grant, organised themselves and got Chelsea to the UCL final and BPL runners-up spot. Most of the players I feel do not respect Grant. Did you see their match with Man Utd? Ballack and Drogba were arguing with each other in front of TV cameras and in front of Grant and Grant didn't/couldn't do anything about it. Do you think other successful managers like Ferguson, Wenger or even Mourinho would stand for such behaviour?</p>
              <p>Obviously the big name players do not respect the muppet. If Chelsea want to attract big names to replace those who are expected to leave, they'll need a manager with a more solid reputation than Grant.</p>

              <p>Grant is just crap.. what difficulties? what taking them far??? he is just a person whom Roman install purely to show Jose that with the money that he had invested on, anyone, yes just about anyone can take them to the same level as what Jose did.. but IMO Grant fail, Chelsea ends the season without any silverware which is whats counts as failure in a team of Chelsea current class</p>
              <p>Grant had the same group of players plus another couple of new players but he cant win the league, can't win the league cup, can't win the FA cup, can't win the ECL on a night when ManU didn't really played well.. also his so call Tactics which he keeps reminding the press that its what that helps them win the game, true as it seems but its just the same thing over and over again, putting another striker in when they are level or losing don't really says much IMHO, any manager would have did so with the among of talents in a team like Chelsea..</p>

              <p>When we talk about the league... Chelsea lost the league title by 2 points... But when Grant took over, they were already behind United by 2 points... Grant didn't get a chance to start on a level playing field... He didn't get a chance to bring in his own players... If anything, Its more like Jose lost them the title when his team fell behind early in the season... Jose also lost to United on penalties in the Community Shield (with a worse score result)...</p>
              <p>And when it comes to the Champions League... You can say Terry lost it for them rather than anything else...</p>
              <p>I like to see if the next guy can bring them as close next season... lol</p>
              <p>Huge mistake...</p>
              <p>This probably rank up there with the Real sacking of Del Bosque...</p>

              I am thinking people should respect other people religions. This is too flaming. So what he is a jew, respect him for that. Target him as a poor manager and not as a jew.

              <h2>Former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has labelled his recently sacked
              successor Avram Grant a ‘loser’ following the club’s first trophyless
              season in four years.</h2>
              <p>Mourinho has stuck the boot in, claiming the Israeli was destined to fail due to lack of a winning mentality.<br><br>“In my philosophy it was a very bad one because in football ‘almost’ means defeat,” he said.<br> <br>“Chelsea almost won the Carling Cup, almost won the Champions League, and almost won the Premier League. Almost is nothing. <br>“After two titles per season for the last three years there were zero titles this season. <br><br>“In my philosophy that means a really bad season. <br><br>“Maybe in the philosophy of a loser this was a great season, which I respect.”</p>

              <p><strong>FOR all the money swilling around in Chelsea's coffers, the one commodity they cannot buy is class.</strong></p>
              <p>Everybody in football knew that Avram Grant was no Special One. He was merely a decent and dignified man who deserved to be treated with a modicum of respect.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>But Chelsea don't seem to do respect — they do only heartless, cruel and vicious. Grant was thrown into the middle of a crisis when Jose Mourinho was axed.</p>
              <p>But not only did he steady the ship, he took Chelsea to within a penalty kick of the Champions League crown.</p>
              <p>So how is he rewarded? With betrayal and a knife in the back. The sickening thing is, we expected nothing less from Chelsea.</p>

              does not have UEFA badges, won exactly zero trophies this year, lost to
              Barnsley and Spurs in cup competitions. He lost 8 games in 37 matches
              in all competitions. Chelsea played a very boring style of football
              under his "guidance". He did manage to beat powerhouse clubs like
              Olympiakos (very impressive), Fenerbache (barely) and Liverpool (Thanks
              Riise!) so that makes him one of the best coaches in the world? Chelsea
              has one of the best squads on the planet and these kind of results are
              unacceptable. This guy was hired against Mourinho's wishes and caused
              all kinds of problems behind his back with his whisperings of sweet
              nothings in Roman's ear. He essentially got the job by kissing A** and

              <p><br>Not really lah... He had Anelka but felt Drogba was still a better choice upfront and rightly so too... And on Ballack, I have never seen him play so well untill Grant took over... How ironic he was made one of the "untouchables" by Jose himself during his time...</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Former Chelsea manager Avram Grant claims he rejected the director of football role at the club after being sacked.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ex-Israel head coach was dismissed by The Blues last weekend
              after missing out on the Premier League and UEFA Champions League
              trophies to Manchester United.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Grant had been the club's director of football prior to Jose
              Mourinho's exit last September which then saw him take charge of
              first-team affairs for the remainder of the campaign.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The 53-year-old understands why Chelsea wanted to retain his
              services, although he did not see the move as the right way forward at
              this stage of his career.</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p>"I understand the offer and why it was made but I thought that from my point of view it was not the correct move," he revealed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"What I discussed (privately) will stay private but let's say that I saw that it was not a good move for me at this stage."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It had been mooted Grant was angered by the club's decision to
              sack him, although, following a chat with owner Roman Abramovich, he
              has nothing but love for the club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Roman (Abramovich) gave me the opportunity and what I had to
              say to him was that I love the club and now each of us goes his own
              way," he continued.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It was a great time, I enjoyed very much to be at Chelsea, I breathed the club 24 hours a day during the time I was in charge."</p>
