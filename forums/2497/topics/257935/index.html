Poll sent off John Terry at Tottenham, infuriating Mourinho. Chelsea were reported for intimidation Â— but the FA took no action.</strong><br><br>Poll said: Â“Mourinho is a really great coach and away from the touchline a personable and nice man. Â“How frustrating that he sinks lower than his dogÂ’s belly when dealing with referees. Come on, Jose, next season show us some class.Â” Mourinho also believed Poll had sent him off in last monthÂ’s clash against Manchester United.<br><br>The Blues boss admitted: Â“I told him a couple of things I had in my heart since the Tottenham game.Â” But Poll held back, fearing if he did banish him the FA would be scared to act against Mourinho. He also believes bosses continually criticising refs is leading to fans taking action for themselves.<br><br>Poll, 43, has been in- sulted with his family in a restaurant while another ref had to drive through a red light to escape fans kicking his car. Hertfordshire whistler Poll returned home early from Euro 2000 as well as the last two World Cups.<br><br>Poll said: Â“IÂ’ve had three major championships and none worked out for me. Â“In life if one thing goes wrong youÂ’re unlucky. Two, maybe really unlucky. Â“Three, you have to admit somethingÂ’s not right.Â”<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Former top referee warns at inaction on complaints<br><br>Some 7,000 officials leave the game every season</span><br><br>More referees will follow Graham Poll out of the game unless they receive significant backing from the Football Association, a former Premiership referee warned yesterday. Poll revealed that he retired from officiating early because the FA failed to support him after he dismissed John Terry last November and there are fears many of his colleagues are also disillusioned.</strong><br><br>"I have heard moans and groans from many referees," said the former referee, who is still involved at all levels of the game. "They are getting uptight because they're asked to report things and nothing seems to be done about it. The FA has got to do something regarding what referees are saying because there are a lot of referees that are going to go out of the game. It has been happening for years at local level. Out of all those that pass the referees' course, less than 50% are refereeing within 10 weeks."<br><br>There are 7,000 referees trained every season but the same number give up during that period, currently leaving an 8,000 shortfall. Among those officiating at the top of the game, there is a belief that power has been eroded. "Referees have lost some of their authority and I don't think there is any doubt about that," continued the source. "Andy D'Urso in one game issued two cards to a player and didn't send him off and got demoted from the Premier League to the Football League. But when he was surrounded by Manchester United players [in a previous match], what happened to the players and the club?<br><br>"This is a current classic case. If you referee in Europe and the benches do not adhere to the regulations, for example players stand up or the manager goes out of the technical area, you can be fined. In England every week, there are benches and managers being reported for abusive behaviour and not conforming with regulations but nothing seems to be done about it. I think that is part of what Graham is talking about and it's the same on the field of play." The FA did not respond to the retired referee's comments, referring only to remarks made by Neale Barry, the FA's head of senior referee development, earlier in the day.<br><br>Graeme Murty, the Reading captain, believes the problems start at grassroots level. "It comes down to what you see in junior football," said the Scotland international. "Referees in kids' football get a hell of a raw deal. They get stick from everywhere and I'm surprised that some of the matches go on because of the level of abuse they get from players, fans, parents and coaches. In fact, it surprises me that people are willing to put themselves through that situation."<br><br></div>

The countryÂ’s top ref announced his retirement this week and will certainly not take charge of any more games in the Premiership or abroad. But the 43-year-old has registered for next season with his local Hertfordshire FA and is considering making himself available for matches on the pitches where he began refereeing as a teenager 27 seasons ago.</strong><br><br>Officially, PollÂ’s final game Â– the 1,554th of his career Â– was the promotion play-off final between Derby and West Brom at Wembley on Monday. The following day Keith Hackett, the man in charge of professional referees in this country, confirmed he had received PollÂ’s resignation.<br><br>UEFA were also told Poll had resigned and so, contrary to some reports, he will not officiate at next weekÂ’s Euro 2008 qualifier between Finland and Belgium in Helsinki. Poll burned a few bridges by attacking the FA. He accused chief executive Brian Barwick of betraying him by allowing his integrity to be questioned during the past season. Yet Poll is thinking of refereeing near his home in Tring. He has paid Â£15 to the Herts FA to retain his registration as a ref.<br><br>He has doubts about the idea of refereeing local games because of fears that players would try to get themselves booked or sent off by him to gain notoriety. The fact that he is contemplating the notion at all, however, underlines that he has not fallen out of love with football, despite feeling so let down by the FA.<br></div>
