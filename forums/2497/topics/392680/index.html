              <p><strong>Ryan Shawcross has received almost 300 sympathetic 
              emails from </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Arsenal" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><strong>Arsenal</strong></a><strong> supporters despite 
              Arsène Wenger's outspoken criticisms of the tackle on Aaron Ramsey that left the 
              teenage Arsenal midfielder with fractures to the tibia and fibula in his right 
              leg.</strong></p>
              <p>While Wenger has not retracted his allegation that Shawcross was guilty of a 
              "horrendous" and "unacceptable" challenge, Stoke's manager Tony Pulis argued 
              today that "99.9% of people can see it was awkward rather than malicious or 
              vindictive". Shawcross left the pitch in tears after being sent off, but his 
              distress was for Ramsey rather than himself, and the 22-year-old centre-half was 
              "hugely touched" by the correspondence he has had from supporters of the London 
              club.</p>
              <p>"Ryan has had nigh on 300 emails from Arsenal supporters sympathising with 
              him and expressing their respect for his reaction coming off the pitch," Pulis 
              reported. "I think that's absolutely fantastic when people are getting 
              slaughtered at times. The attitude of the Arsenal supporters has been 
              brilliant."</p>
              <p>Shawcross and Pulis have both sent Ramsey text messages to express sympathy 
              and wish him a full recovery, and Shawcross has asked whether it would be 
              possible to visit the Wales midfielder in hospital. The defender was called into 
              the England squad for Wednesday's friendly against Egypt and admitted it had 
              been a week of vastly differing emotions.</p>
              <p>"I had a tough weekend, but to come and join such a great team was absolutely 
              fantastic," Shawcross said. "Just to have been involved with the squad has been 
              great. All the England players have been fantastic about what happened with 
              Aaron Ramsey. They've got my mind on football really, nothing else. I've enjoyed 
              their company and it's been a good experience."</p>
              <p>Ramsey is not expected to play for at least six months and Wenger talked of 
              the 19-year-old being "as low as you can be". Arsenal's fans will unveil a 
              banner in support of the former Cardiff City player during Saturday's home game 
              against Burnley and Wenger added: "The one thing we can do now is give him all 
              the support it takes. The good news is the surgery went well and it is not a 
              career-threatening injury. But it is two breaks and to get back to your best you 
              need not only to practice again but time to recover your co-ordination. He is a 
              young boy and will recover from this, but it is a bad injury."</p>
              <p>Wenger did not make any further comment about the challenge but has not 
              retracted his criticism of Shawcross, as he did after calling for Birmingham 
              City's Martin Taylor to be banned from the sport for the tackle that shattered 
              Eduardo's leg two years ago. Pulis, preparing for an FA Cup quarter-final at 
              Chelsea, suggested that Wenger's comments came from being "emotional after the 
              game" but said there had been widespread support from football people including 
              Shawcross's previous manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"If Arsène says it, Arsène says it, and you have to respect him as an 
              individual and as a football man," Pulis said. "He's got to say what he's got to 
              say. But the most important thing is the reaction of the public and the Arsenal 
              supporters."</p>
              <p>Theo Walcott, the only Arsenal player involved in the England set-up this 
              week, agreed there had been no malice in Shawcross's challenge. "He's a very 
              humble lad, and a great defender," said Walcott. "Obviously he knows what's 
              happened and feels very bad about it. He's apologised. He's not a player to do 
              those sort of tackles – he'll put his head down and work very hard for club and 
              country.</p>
              <p>"But there are no hard feelings, not at all. He's sent a few text messages to 
              Aaron. I'll let them get on with it. I've been texting Aaron every day. He got 
              out of hospital the other day, so I'll give him a call before the weekend. It's 
              hard to tell what spirits he's in. His phone is probably mental at the moment. 
              I'm texting him now and again, not trying to bomb him too much because the 
              amount of support he's been given is fantastic. We all just want to see him back 
              on the pitch again soon."</p>
              <p>Taylor, now with Watford, has spoken of the Eduardo incident affecting him 
              mentally because of the psychological effects of having injured an opponent so 
              badly, but Shawcross said he would not change his style. "What happened will not 
              be a factor when I next play again for Stoke. Whenever I pull on the Stoke shirt 
              I have to be 100% committed and the same as ever. Hopefully, when I am back from 
              the suspension, I can do well again."</p>
