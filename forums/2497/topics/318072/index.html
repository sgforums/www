              And so the mind games/childish jibes begin in the lead-up to the Champions League final. <span style="color: #0000ff;">Petr Cech</span> has hilariously suggested that Manchester United winning the league - therefore proving themselves to be a better side - will give Chelsea the edge, while <span style="color: #0000ff;">Salomon Kalou</span> reckons Nemanja Vidic is United's weak link.</div>

              <p><strong>Petr Cech believes that winning the Premier League title may be detrimental to Manchester United's European aspirations. The Chelsea keeper is hoping that domestic success will see the Red Devils take their foot off the gas in Wednesday's UEFA Champions League final.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Czech Republic international is adamant that focus can be lost once silverware has already been secured, and is tipping the Blues to upset the pre-match favourites during their midweek showdown in Moscow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Football is sometimes a game with no logic," Cech said in <em>The Sun</em>. "Having won the title, you would say it was a big boost for them because they finished above us and celebrated. "But that can be destructive. When you know you've won something you can relax more because in the back of your mind you have already succeeded.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Maybe they will be more relaxed and this could be the advantage for us because we have to remember the feeling of going so close and ending up so disappointed."</p>

              <h1>Manchester United are running scared after we pushed them so close in the league, claims Chelsea's Cole</h1>

              <p><em>Worried: Cole says United will be concerned because Chelsea nearly won the title</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Joe Cole says Manchester United are scared of Chelsea because they did not win the Barclays Premier League by a greater margin. United only clinched the title by two points on the final day of the season, despite Chelsea's squad being ravaged with injuries to key players for most of the campaign.</strong></p>
              <p>Cole said: "They will be going into the game as champions and are very happy, but they will look at Chelsea this year and worry because we only finished two points behind them. "They know we missed players like Lampard, Terry, Ballack, Essien, Drogba, Kalou and Cech for massive parts of the season and they will be concerned because, despite that, we still nearly won the championship.</p>
              <p>"The two teams know each other inside out and it's a case of who can play their game best. "We both know how to win big matches."</p>

              <p><strong>PETR CECH reckons winning the Premier League could destroy Manchester United’s chances of being crowned kings of Europe. Alex Ferguson’s side are warm favourites to topple Chelsea in Wednesday’s Champions League final after pipping their rivals to the domestic crown.</strong></p>
              <p>But Blues’ No1 Cech insisted: “Football is sometimes a game with no logic. “Having won the title, you would say it was a big boost for them because they finished above us and celebrated. “But that can be destructive. When you know you’ve won something you can relax more because in the back of your mind you have already succeeded.</p>
              <p>“Maybe they will be more relaxed and this could be the advantage for us because we have to remember the feeling of going so close and ending up so disappointed.”</p>
              <p>Chelsea beat Manchester United 1-0 in last year’s dreary FA Cup final. And keeper Cech, 26 on Tuesday, warned punters to brace themselves for another drab clash. He said: “If you ask me if we can surprise each other, I will say no. We have played them so many times and both teams haven’t changed much.”</p>
              <p>But Cech hit out at critics of their style of play under boss Avram Grant. In an interview with BBC’s Inside Sport to be shown tonight, the Czech star said: “It’s difficult to say you play brilliant football when you finish the season with no trophies.</p>
              <p>“Chelsea fans will not be happy if we played brilliant football this season and did not win a trophy. “For our supporters, it is important we entertain. But they will only remember the years when we won trophies.</p>
              <p>“I use Arsenal as an example of playing brilliant football without winning trophies. “In 10 years people will not remember the Arsenal squad of 2004-08 because they played brilliant football. “Maybe in 10 years’ time they won’t remember them because they did not win any trophies.”</p>
              <p>Cech also pledged his future to Chelsea, adding: “I have two years left on my contract and I am very happy here. “This club is one of the best in the world and this league is the best in the world. And if you take this combination there is not really another place to move to.”</p>
