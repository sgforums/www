              <p><strong>Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson dismissed Chelsea's Premier League title hopes on Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The title race now is going to
              be between ourselves and Liverpool," Ferguson wrote in the programme
              for the home match against Fulham that sent the champions five points
              clear of Liverpool and 10 ahead of fourth-placed Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"However I shall be keeping a
              wary eye on Aston Villa, who seem to have picked up the baton from
              Arsenal," continued the 67-year-old in United Review.</p>
              <p>Villa are third, eight points behind United, while Arsenal are fifth and 15 points off the pace.</p>
              <p>The Scot said he had been
              shocked by Chelsea's decision to sack Brazilian manager Luiz Felipe
              Scolari after only seven months in charge but added that the move had
              "played into our hands."</p>
              <p>"Their haste is a reflection of
              the sad way the game is going, with everyone from owners, the board
              members, the supporters and the media demanding instant success and
              showing absolutely no patience in the pursuit of their ambition," said
              Ferguson, who has been at Old Trafford since 1986.</p>
              <p>"I would have thought it
              self-evident that winning prizes comes with stability and long-term
              planning," added the league's longest-serving manager.</p>
              <p>"Yet so often, when a club is
              faced with a few problems, wisdom flies out of the window in the hope
              that a new man can bring about a quick fix."</p>
              <p>Ferguson expected Dutchman Guus
              Hiddink, the Russia national coach who has taken over at Chelsea to the
              end of the season, to make an impact.</p>
              <p>"At the same time, he has to
              start from scratch, perhaps putting together his own staff and
              gathering round him players of his choice which may take him some
              time," he said.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's former England defender Jamie Carragher agreed with Ferguson's assessment of the run-in to the title.</p>
              <p>"We finished fourth last
              season, but we have overtaken Chelsea and Arsenal and even though
              everyone at the club understands that it's not over yet by a long way,
              at the moment it looks like it is going to be us and Manchester United
              for the title," he told the club website.</p>

              <p>I think Fergie is trying to demoralize the Chelsea players further to make sure they don't come back up... Cos if they start winning from now till the end of the season, they still stand a very good chance of winning... He probably expect Guus to have a decent showing while he is there, so a little more of his mind games to add some self doubt to the Chelsea players could be his real intention... lol</p>
              <p>And if they drop any more points this weekend against Villa, then the fighting spirit will go too... Even Guus will find if tough to lift them to the top again... Maybe 3rd or 4th place not a problem though...  </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yea..its a mind game from SAF and i think his mind games are more effective than the ones from mourinho.Speaking from my point of view i think that Chelsea need Guus to produce a miracle if they were to win the BPL but i would worry more about Arsenal than Man Utd because with eduardo coming back,Fabregas and Walcott coming back soon,Rosicky lurking around the corner,and Arshavin waiting for a debut i would say Chelsea will need to worry about qualifying for Champions League next season.</p></div>

              <p class="article">Despite Dirk Kuyt’s late leveller at home to Manchester City, Rafa Benitez’s side are now seven points adrift of Alex Ferguson’s table-toppers. </p>
              <p class="article">Bookies William Hill slashed the odds on United bagging a third title in a row to 14-1 ON. And although chief Benitez refused to throw in the towel, City boss and United old-boy Mark Hughes said: “It is obviously not in Liverpool’s hands and that is not how you would want it at this stage of the season. </p>
              <p class="article">“There are still a lot of games to go and Liverpool will certainly feel they can come back. “But they are probably looking at United slipping up — and they don’t do that too often!” </p>
              <p class="article">Benitez insisted his team could put a different complexion on the title race by taking maximum points from their next three games — climaxed by a visit to Old Trafford. </p>
              <p class="article">The Spaniard said: “The situation is clearly more difficult so we have to win against Middlesbrough and Sunderland and start thinking about if we can win at Old Trafford. </p>
              <p class="article">“Obviously, it’s not easy but there are still 12 games so we don’t feel everything is finished.” Kuyt pounced on 78 minutes to earn a point after former Kop striker Craig Bellamy had opened the scoring for City. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I was quite surprise Rafa sent out his first team against City in their home match last night... Cos normally before an important CL match, Rafa would have put out a sub side or rest his star players like Torres, Carragher and probably Kuyt too... Guess he really wants the Premier League title too this year having come so close...</p></div>

United will have a very difficult April and May, And they haven't play Liverpool, Arsenal, City and Villa yet too... And away to Wigan and Boro won't be easy as well... With so little time and so many matches to play, anything can happen should more players starts to get injure due to too many matches... Playing a match every 3 days for 3 months could take its toll...</p></div>
