              <p><strong>Chief executive Ron Gourlay has read the riot act to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong>'s misbehaving stars in a tough-talking showdown with the squad at the club's training ground this week.</strong>  </p>
              <p>Gourlay, who was speaking on behalf of the club's owner Roman Abramovich, organised the meeting together with coach Carlo Ancelotti in response to weeks of lurid headlines involving club captain John Terry and his England team-mate Ashley Cole.  </p>
              <p>Gourlay reminded the players of their responsibility to protect the image of the club and warned of 'severe disciplinary consequences' should any player step out of line in the future.  </p>
              <p>The meeting, which lasted around 10 minutes, was the club's response to weeks of headlines that have tarnished the Blues' image and led to Terry being stripped of the England captaincy by national coach Fabio Capello.  </p>
              <p>The message from Gourlay was blunt and to the point and it was made clear to all the players that the club would not tolerate any further public embarrassment.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/19/article-1252267-08511EA5000005DC-477_468x473.jpg" alt="john Terry and Ashley Cole" width="468" height="473"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Playing away: Terry and Cole have been warned on their future conduct</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Gourlay's speech was followed by a talk from coach Ancelotti, who reminded the squad and the staff of the need to protect the image of the club.</strong> </p>
              <p>'We had a meeting this week with the players,' revealed Ancelotti. 'It was a good meeting. Ron Gourlay was there as well. We spoke to the players and explained to them the behaviour that is required of the players in this club.  </p>
              <p>'Now they know very well what they have to do and what behaviour is expected of them when they're in the Chelsea shirt.  'We are interested, me and the club, in protecting the image of this club. Not only the players and the manager, all the staff - the people who work in this club - have to protect that image.  </p>
              <p>'That is one of the most important things, the image of the club. We want to carry that forward. And I think the players and all the staff know very well what they have to do. </p>
              <p>'All the players were there. Ron spoke for the club, for the owner, and the players listened. </p>
              <p>'It was a private meeting and I don't like to speak about what exactly was said. But, to confirm, the most important thing is that everybody has to pay attention to protect the image of the club.'</p>
              <p>Players who are found guilty of tarnishing the club's image will be dealt with severely by the club, although no punishments were set out in the meeting.  </p>
              <p>It is a clear indication that Abramovich has had enough of his club being in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons and although Gourlay arranged the showdown, it is understood he was speaking on behalf of the Russian billionaire. </p>
              <p>Although it is unlikely Chelsea would sack any player found guilty of tarnishing the club's image in the future, it is understood that disciplinary action would be harsh and immediate.  </p>
              <p>The club's stance clearly has the support of Ancelotti, who in previous weeks had gone out of his way to insist he was not bothered what his players did in their private lives as long as it did not affect their performances on the pitch. </p>

              <p>Football fans named her in internet message boards yesterday and now tabloid newspapers have published her picture.</p>

              <p><strong>It is claimed she spent two nights with Ashley in a hotel rooms in Lincolnshire and Birmingham in late 2008. Football forums also claim she had been linked to two other premiership stars in recent months.</strong></p>
              <p>Three weeks ago, she was allegedly spotted leaving a trendy Liverpool restaurant with a top striker. When the allegations emerged last week, the woman attempted to keep her identity a secret over fears she would lose her job. But she was outed by Birmingham City fans, where she used to work, who named her on the online forum The Small Heath Alliance.</p>
              <p>One wrote that Cole's secret fling was with 'our old football sec Vicki Gough,' adding: 'I feel a new chant coming on. She works at Liverpool now. Pop in and ask for her.'</p>
              <p>The secretary, said to be a valuable member of Liverpool FC, spoke to The Sun last week on condition of anonymity. But after her picture was published in today's Daily Star, The Sun also followed suit.</p>
              <p>In her interview with The Sun, Gough described how during her second encounter with Cole at the Radisson Hotel in Birmingham in December 2008, Ashley turned up the television so their antics couldn't be overheard by Chelsea team captain John Terry.</p>
              <p>She is the second woman to be linked to Cole in recent weeks. Topless model Sonia Wild said she received naked photographs of the England player on her mobile phone in June 2009.</p>
              <p>Ashley publicly admitted taking the photos on his phone, but denied he had sent the lewd images to Wild. After taking the images while 'larking about', he claims he gave the unregistered, pay-as-you-go phone to a friend, who must have sent the photos pretending to be him.</p>
              <p>Ashley said: 'I can't believe I gave a phone away that still had stuff in its memory. I thought I'd deleted it. It seems I was wrong as someone has used it to pretend to be me.' But his denial was undermined when Gough came out of the woodwork and it was reported he had sent her similar messages and more than 300 texts nine months earlier from the same phone.</p>
              <p>It light of the allegations, his humiliated wife flew to Los Angeles on Wednesday after giving a performance at the Brit Awards in London the night before.</p>
              <p>Her spokesperson declined to comment on the singer's private life, but said Cheryl planned to record some extra tracks for her album 3 Words with The Black Eyed Peas.</p>
              <p>Friends of the X Factor judge said she is planning to divorce her husband after the recent allegations.</p>

              <p><strong>The couple experienced a previous rocky patch in January 2008 when hairdresser Aimee Walton claimed she had a drunken sex with Ashley.</strong></p>
              <p>Friends of The X Factor judge claim that a split will be announced 'within weeks' after she flew to Los Angeles without her wedding ring, the Mail has learned.</p>
              <p>They say the 26-year-old Girls Aloud singer has gone beyond the point of 'riding out' the storm over their relationship  -  and could soon fire the starting gun on a fight over the couple's assets.</p>
              <p>The couple failed to sign a pre-nuptial agreement before their lavish wedding in July 2006, meaning a split is likely to result in a costly divorce battle.</p>
              <p>She said at the time: 'I think that's defeating the point. We're getting married because we're committing ourselves to spend our lives together. No ifs and buts.'</p>
              <p>Although a millionaire in her own right, Cheryl is significantly less wealthy than her husband. Last year, the Sunday Times Rich List estimated their joint worth at £13million  -  almost all of it accrued after their wedding.</p>
              <p>That figure is likely to be much higher now.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Ashley Cole" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/ashley-cole"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Ashley Cole</strong></span></a><strong> intends to fight any disciplinary action taken against him by </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Chelsea" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> over allegations about his off-field behaviour. The left-back believes he is being victimised by the club, which has summoned him to a meeting this week with the chief executive, Ron Gourlay, and may consider leaving Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>Cole could face sanctions up to and including the possibility of being transfer-listed, although a hefty fine is a more likely punishment following allegations about extramarital relationships. He is said to feel he is being unfairly singled out after no action was taken against Chelsea's captain, John Terry, for an alleged affair with the former partner of Wayne Bridge which cost the central defender the England armband.</p>
              <p>There are indications that Cole is so incensed at the prospect of being punished that he could look to leave Chelsea in the summer. He is expected to make his feelings known to Gourlay when they meet, most likely on Thursday or Friday rather than before tomorrow's Champions League game at Internazionale, which Cole will miss because of injury.</p>
              <p>Terry has received public support from the manager, Carlo Ancelotti, and was given time off to travel to Dubai to try to patch up his marriage, missing an FA Cup fifth-round tie against Cardiff City. Chelsea feel there is a difference, though, with Cole's alleged indiscretions, which are said to have occurred while away on official club business.</p>
              <p>Ann Corbitt, the latest woman with whom Cole has been linked, is said to have been transported back to the team hotel on a pre-season tour of the United States in the official bus. Another woman told how an aide in an official tracksuit had escorted her to Cole's hotel bedroom.</p>
              <p>Chelsea's decision to call Cole to account comes after Gourlay warned the squad last week – at the prompting of the owner, Roman Abramovich – that any further controversies which tarnish the club's reputation would not be tolerated and would bring severe disciplinary action. Cole's alleged indiscretions were subsequently reported in Sunday's newspapers.</p>
              <p>If Cole goes as far as to seek a move from Stamford Bridge, there is likely to be interest from Real Madrid, Barcelona and Inter among others. He joined Chelsea in 2006 after falling out with the hierarchy at Arsenal, where he felt undervalued.</p>

              <p><strong>Ashley Cole seems to be playing a dangerous game at Chelsea. Could this scandal and his reaction to it really lead to his departure from the club? </strong></p>
              <p>It is certainly possible but at this stage I would say it remains unlikely. It is hard to rule anything out given Cole's attitude. He is notoriously stubborn and pig-headed and he has already shown he is prepared to leave a club on a point of principle. He left Arsenal for Chelsea because he felt he deserved more money and he followed through on that even though many people thought he was wrong.</p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea appear determined to clamp down on these problems to almost an unprecedented extent. Is this their way of preventing player power from getting out of control? </strong></p>
              <p>There is certainly an element of that but the bottom line is that Roman Abramovich, the owner, has had enough. Last week he told Ron Gourlay, the Chelsea chief executive, that something had to be done to protect the club’s image, which led to Gourlay reminding the entire first-team squad of their responsibilities and has increased the club's determination to punish Cole.</p>
              <p>Abramovich is sick and tired of waking up to be told that Chelsea are on the front page again. It has been going on for three or four weeks now and the owner hates scandal and controversy and he feels that he pays his players enough money to stay out of trouble.</p>
              <p><strong>Does the move to punish Cole smack of double standards after the club's relatively sympathetic stance towards John Terry's domestic problems? </strong></p>
              <p>The club views the two incidents very differently. For all the embarrassment caused by the lurid headlines involving Terry, his indiscretions were private matters carried out in his own time. Cole, on the other hand, stands accused of breaking club rules by bringing women back to the team hotel on at least three occasions.</p>
              <p>In some ways you do have to have some sympathy with Cole because Chelsea's clampdown has come in the wake of Abramovich's warning. When you examine the way the club swept aside allegations that Terry was conducting tours of the training ground for money then their behaviour does smack of double standards. Those tours were on club time and on club property but the club's hierarchy sided with Terry and believed that he was doing a friend a favour rather than anything more sinister.</p>
              <p>Cole's problems have come after weeks of tabloid headlines and the timing is certainly unfortunate.</p>
              <p><strong>What happens next for Cole and Chelsea? </strong></p>
              <p>The player is going to have a disciplinary hearing later this week, possibly on Friday where it is thought that he will say that he feels victimised by the way the club have handled the situation. He has yet to apologise to Steve Atkins, the club’s head of communications, who is alleged to have been misled into organising an attempted cover-up in the wake of these allegations.</p>
              <p><strong>Why are Chelsea imposing such a heavy fine, the limit is usually two weeks' wages? </strong></p>
              <p>Senior figures at Stamford Bridge want to fine Cole £400,000 because they say he broke club rules and tarnished Chelsea’s image. The fine is bigger than you would normally see but the club are keen to push for it to set an example to the rest of the squad. It may depend on the terms in his contract whether they are successful or not.</p>
              <p><strong>The problems seem to be stacking up for Fabio Capello and England's World Cup bid. Is Cole likely to be given a talking-to when he reports for international duty? </strong></p>
              <p>Fabio Capello does not have any interest in this. Cole is not going to be in his squad for the friendly against Egypt and he is not going to be in any squad until the World Cup - if he is at all. Capello has more pressing issues to deal with, such as the relationship between Terry and Wayne Bridge - in many ways Cole is the least of his concerns.</p>

              <p>cole slept with a colleague, that is very wrong, for Terry, it is out of the organisation periphery, so next time anyone who wants to flirt, make sure you dun flirt with the man or lady of your own organisation, it can turn nasty.</p>
