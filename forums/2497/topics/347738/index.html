              <p>"All three roads are very important: the next game [in the FA Cup tomorrow at] Watford, and then Aston Villa and Juventus, and then you go on the path of the Champions League and that is so attractive. The club has the experience to go to the final. When I was at Real Madrid we did not win the league title. I haven't worked in England, which is considered the biggest league in the world, so [winning the title] would be a huge achievement. We try to go for this title, yes. I am not just here to add to my experience with the club and the Premier League. I want to see results as soon as possible."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>My personal thoughts are... He will do ok or maybe quite well this season but if he stays longer, then I feel he will be another Scolari...</p>
              <p>In the short term, he will do well cos Chelsea have the players to get the job done and he being a new manager, the players will be more keen to prove themselves but in the long term, I feel he is also like Scolari, inexperience in the Premier League...</p>
              <p>Hiddink, like Scolari for all his worldly experience may find the premier league a step higher... He, like Scolari has been managing national sides for too long as well. True he may have manage PSV in the Dutch league not too long ago, and even won them the title but the Dutch League is not like the EPL where the intensity is so much higher...</p>
              <p>In the Dutch Eredivisie, apart from Ajax I don't think the rest can measure up. But in the Premiership, even those in the middle or near bottom have a different mind set these days... The fear of falling of the premier league is far higher and a huge difference to the Championship league... $30 over million to be more precise... This drive those mid table or near bottom clubs to play "lock down style" where they defend like their lives depend on it just to get that 1 valuable point against the big teams. These will take lots of patience to breakdown and not to panic when it doesn't go your way...</p>
              <p>Another area I think may all be new to him is the continue intensity of the Press coverage... I don't think in his last 20 yrs in management he has seen anything like what he is about to experience... In the news almost everyday. The interviews he has to give before and after each match... And make a mistake and the Press will jump on it adding more pressure to his job. And it doesn't help his cause when the Press seems to always get their inside stories on Chelsea regularly... It seems like they have insiders who are willing to feed the Press on whats bad happening within the club... All the troubles and bad news always leaks out to them rather easily...</p>
              <p>But I still think he will do well if its a 4 months job... At least the difficult part is over. Scolari was inexperience to the Premiership, he started off very well and lead the table in the first 3, 4 months with Pool but when it came to the Dec to Jan period where they started playing more games, he didn't seem to know how to rotate and balance his squad, always going out with his full team (like international matches)... even in cup matches and made some players look jaded later. Well, at least Hiddick won't have this problem now.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, I belief Hiddink is better tactically... Have seen him made good use of his sub players during a match over the years. So I guess this area he is better than Scolari...</p>
              <p>Just my take lah...  </p>

              <p>already people are complaining about his preferred treatment when in charge of russia, so I expect more pressure if russia team can't perform..</p>
              <p>anyway, it is not easy to manage so many egos but guess the blues players will united under him cause he is Roman's favourite.. and going up against big boss means you are "fired", right?</p>

              <h1 class="heading">Guus Hiddink: Chelsea can still win treble</h1>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p class="heading"><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00486/hiddink_360_486156a.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="360"></p>
              <p><strong>Guus Hiddink pledged last night to transform Chelsea’s season and keep his new club in the hunt for all three leading trophies until the end of the campaign.</strong></p>
              <p>The Dutchman has vowed to make an immediate impact and demonstrated his supreme confidence by claiming that Chelsea are capable of overturning Manchester United’s seven-point lead to regain the Premier League title, returning to the Champions League final and putting up a strong challenge in the FA Cup, beginning with tomorrow’s fifth-round tie against Watford.</p>
              <p>Hiddink met his players for the first time as they returned from international duty yesterday and in a short introductory meeting outlined his expectations for the remainder of the season. The new manager is understood to have told a silent dressing-room that he was aware of their recent problems but still expected to lead them to success during his 15-week stay, a message that he expanded on during an interview with the club’s television channel.</p>
              <p>“I haven’t worked in England, which is considered the biggest league in the world, so it would be a huge achievement, but we will try to go for this title,” Hiddink said. “Chelsea are in several races, the FA Cup is there, the Champions League and also the league.</p>
              <p>“There is a ten-point difference [in fact the deficit is seven] but if you look in the past of this league and other leagues, things can happen in the final stages of the championship.</p>
              <p>“All the three roads are very important. The next game against Watford, then Aston Villa and Juventus, then you go on the path of the Champions League, and that is so attractive. The club has the experience to go to the final.”</p>
              <p>“What happens after May is clear because it is rather difficult to do the two jobs, and I have my obligations in Russia,” Hiddink said. “It is rather difficult because the Premier League is very challenging. We can do it now because there are only one or two games until June with the national team of Russia. That is why we said we can do it now, and we can do it full-hearted and committed.”</p>

              <p><br>Mourinho was on his way down... His 3rd year he was going downhill already... His start on his 4th year was very poor... That why he got the sack...</p>
              <p>Its not easy for a manager to be successful over a long period of time with one club... A lot of things needs to be renew, you even need to know when to drop your most loyal and favour players who have done so much for you over the years when they are no longer performing... Thats why its always easier to keep it going for a short period then move on or fail... Jose never stay at a club longer than 3 and a half years...</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>insist they will break even next year despite announcing massive pre-tax losses yet again. Since Roman Abramovich took over in 2003, the Blues have posted a string of staggering  financial results.</strong></p>
              <p>The latest revelations show that they made a £65.7million pre-tax loss for the year ending June 2008. And yet chief executive Peter Kenyon continues to tell onlookers that they remain hopeful of becoming self-sufficient by 2010.</p>
              <p>Kenyon's claims have been met with raised eyebrows given the club's history under Abramovich. And Sportsmail has compiled his key quotes on their financial results from the past five years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/02/13/article-0-04AA96DF0000044D-897_306x423.jpg" alt="Peter Kenyon and Andriy Shevchenko" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Big buy: Kenyon with £30m flop Andriy Shevchenko</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2003-4 (£88m pre-tax loss)</span></p>
              <p>'Two years ago we were seen as streets paved with gold. That is over. Chelsea is now being run properly. Roman is at Chelsea for the long run. He has bought in completely to the vision of making this club one of the biggest and best in Europe. This was not a vanity purchase for the owner. It's a serious investment with a long-term business plan.'</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">2004-5 (£140m pre-tax loss)</p>
              <p>'These figures reflect the continuing restructuring of the business which we began in 2003-4. The rise is down to some exceptional items that were necessary to help us in our aim to break even by 2009-10.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">2005-6 (£80.2m pre-tax loss)</p>
              <p>'These figures demonstrate the business is moving in the right direction. That positive trend will only continue as, for example, this year end does not take into account the benefits of our adidas deal. Last year we took some painful decisions in order to help us achieve our long-term business aims. This year's figures prove that was the correct decision. With increasing sponsorship income, television revenue, and ongoing success on the field, those positive trends are projected to continue.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">2006-7 (£74.8m pre-tax loss)</p>
              <p>'Everything we've been doing at Chelsea over the past four-and-a-half years is predicated on the owner being supportive to Chelsea - he clearly has been and he continues to be. We've spent an awful lot on our academy and one of our longer-term business plans is to ensure we have this mixture of home-grown talent along with buying some of the best footballers from anywhere in the world. Our long-term target of operating profit break even by 2009/10 remains ambitious but we are determined to meet it or get as close as we can.'</p>
              <p> </p>
