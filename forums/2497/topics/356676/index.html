              <h2>The goal-scoring midfielder insists that nothing good can come from talking up his side's treble chances.</h2>
              <p>Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard was quick to play down talk of his side winning a historic treble after their FA Cup semifinal win over Arsenal.<br><br>The
              Blues have made it all the way to the final four of the Champions
              League and still have a shot at overhauling Manchester United in the
              league, whom they will also contest the FA Cup final against next month.<br><br>Despite
              their dramatically improved prospects since Guus Hiddink took over as
              interim manager, the England star has shown himself very keen to keep
              the lid on expectations.<br><br>"I hate talk of the treble," Lampard
              told local reporters on the heels of their come-from-behind victory
              against city rivals Arsenal on Saturday.<br><br>"When you talk about it
              the pressure gets even more so we must keep our heads down and take
              each game and competition as it comes and if we do that then we will
              have a chance.<br><br>"It will be very difficult to win three but if we can win something then that would be great," he added.<br><br>"We are now in a position where we can potentially be very successful this year.<br><br>"We must keep doing the good things we are doing at the moment - playing together and playing with spirit," he boomed.<br><br>"We must carry that on until the end of the season. We cannot afford to slip in the league.<br><br>"We
              want to keep going and keep putting the pressure on. We want to win all
              our games because you never know what might happen. It is important we
              do that and try and keep our form."<br><br>Chelsea are four points
              behind a wobbling United going into their midweek game against Everton
              though crucially they still have played a game more than the champions.<br><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>
