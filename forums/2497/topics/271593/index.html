Boss Alan Curbishley could complete a Â£10m move for Gudjohnsen this week and has made an enquiry for Â£7m-rated Smith. Reading left-back Nicky Shorey is also still a target. If Curbishley lands all three, he would take his summer spending to Â£45m, already having landed Scott Parker, Julien Faubert, Craig Bellamy and former Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg. Eggert Magnusson has talked to both Barcelona and Gudjohnsen and is confident of tying up the signing of his Icelandic countryman.</strong><br><br>The playerÂ’s father and agent, Arnor, has hinted he would agree to the switch. Â“It would be something Eidur would consider as there are some Icelanders at West Ham, with the owners and all,Â” said Arnor. Â“Barcelona have always told him it is up to him what he wants to do and they will not stand in his way if he wants to go.Â” West Ham made their initial move for former Chelsea forward Gudjohnsen last month, but he was not keen on a move to Upton Park at that stage. The lure of Â£90,000 a week, however, looks to have changed his mind.<br><br>Despite possibly having Gudjohnsen, Bellamy, Dean Ashton, Bobby Zamora and Carlton Cole at his disposal, Curbishley has also entered the race for Smith who, ironically, is surplus to requirements at United because of Carlos TevezÂ’s proposed move to Old Trafford. Newcastle and Manchester City are also interested in Smith, but the Hammers are confident they can offer the best deal.<br><br>Curbishley is desperate for a left-back because after selling Paul Konchesky he has only George McCartney for that position. Reading still hope Shorey will sign a new contract, but the Hammers could double any offer and are prepared to pay Â£5m for the England international. Discussions were last night continuing over an out-of-court compromise between West Ham and Kia Joorabchian that would allow Tevez to complete his transfer to United.<br><br>Sources close to Joorabchian suggest a deal is likely, with the Hammers receiving Â£6m to release the strikerÂ’s registration. If agreement cannot be reached today, Joorabchian will issue his writ to the High Court tomorrow.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Strange but somehow i got a feeling that WH may go for one of Man u's player and maybe try to settle their Tevez problem with Kia Joorabchian...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cos since Kia Joorabchian is only willing to pay WH $100 thousand for Tevez whom he considers his "own" player... and the Premier League insistence that WH must get a reasonable transfer fee before they can release him... WH are stuck in the middle, cos on one hand they won't want to go to court and risk being expose and even sue by Sheff Utd and on the other The Premier League are watching them...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So the conspiracy theory could be Kia Joorabchian "agrees" to pay WH a reasonable sum, WH in turn uses the money to buy a player from Man u at a slightly higher price... And Man u in turn pay Kia Joorabchian a little more for Tevez... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>This way everyone is happy, WH gets to avoid going to court, Kia Joorabchian gets his money, Man u get their man and the Premier League bosses and its chief executive Richard Scudamore gets to keep their face... Perfect plan ah? But just a conspiracy theory lah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Curbishley is particularly keen on the 26-year-old as he can play as a striker or a central midfielder and can provide cover while Scott Parker recovers from a knee injury. </strong><br><br>Talks took place in London and the deal could depend on whether Â£6m-rated Smith, who has also attracted interest from Newcastle, Middlesbrough and Everton, is tempted to relocate to the south of the country. Smith, who has found opportunities hard to come by since his return from a broken leg earlier this year, has just two years left to run on his contract at Old Trafford and his wage demands are unlikely to pose a problem for Hammers chairman Eggert Magnusson.<br><br>The probable addition of Carlos Tevez to the United ranks is set to push Smith further down the Premier League champions' pecking order and he now looks certain to move on. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson said: "There have been a few enquiries and Alan wants first-team football, but at the moment nothing has been decided."<br><br>Meanwhile, Newcastle boss Sam Allardyce has told the Hammers to up their Â£4m bid for Kieron Dyer. The midfielder, who has also been linked with a move to Tottenham, has become the target of abuse from some Toon fans since he decided to leave and move closer to his family in Suffolk. But Allardyce said: "Â£4m is too low in today's prices. In today's market, for a player like Kieron who is 27 [sic] years old, a top, top player in the Premier League and an England international. It's a gross under valuation by West Ham."<br><br></div>
