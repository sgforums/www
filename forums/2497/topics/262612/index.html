            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Manchester City board has accepted an Â£81.6million takeover bid by former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.</strong><br><br>Shinawatra has confirmed to the Stock Exchange his intention to take over the Eastlands club, a move unanimously backed by the City board.<br><br>The deal will now be put to the club's shareholders. The Thai premier has already been pledged 55.0 per cent of shares by board members and former chairman Francis Lee.<br><br>Should Shinawatra go on and see his plans come to fruition, his first task will be to appoint a new manager with Sven-Goran Eriksson believed to be in the running to succeed Stuart Pearce.<br><br>Current City chairman John Wardle is to remain on the board under the new regime.<br><br>Announcing the takeover deal, Wardle said: "Following our significant progress over the last few years, this offer provides an exciting opportunity to take Manchester City forward to the next stage of our development and to deliver the on-field success weÂ’ve all been striving for.<br><br>"I'm delighted to have been asked to remain on the board together with our chief executive Alistair Mackintosh. IÂ’m equally pleased that the management team who have worked relentlessly during my time as chairman will also remain."<br><br>Shinawatra was also delighted to confirm his takeover of the club. He said: "I'm delighted that the board of Manchester City has recommended my bid for the club and I look forward to continuing the excellent work of John Wardle and his team.<br><br>"We share a determination to take this club back to its rightful place in both the Premier League and European football.<br><br>"I am in no doubt of the responsibility associated with leading Manchester City and pledge my support to the club, players and fans."<br><br>The move comes after the protracted takeover at City took another twist after Thai prosecutors filed corruption charges against the ousted Prime Minister.<br><br>These are the first formal charges lodged against the exiled former premier and involve allegations of wrongdoing in a land deal.<br><br>The Thai Supreme Court will decide on 10th July if they will hear the case.<br><br>Thaksin has been living overseas since he was overthrown in a military coup in September while he was abroad.</div>
