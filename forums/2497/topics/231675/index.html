            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i133.photobucket.com/albums/q60/zocos/Rio1.jpg"><br><br><strong>RIO FERDINAND reckons Arsenal powerhouse Emmanuel Adebayor has been his toughest Premiership opponent this term.</strong><br><br>So news the Togo strike ace is set to replace crocked Robin van Persie at The Emirates on Sunday would have gone down like a lead balloon for the Manchester United defender. Adebayor gave United a real run around at Old Trafford in September and bagged the winner to hand the Gunners a surprise victory.<br><br>Ferdinand, 28, and the United back line were caught off-guard by AdebayorÂ’s brute strength Â— but they are not alone as he has done that to a few other Premiership defences this season. And England star Ferdy believes Adebayor could stand in UnitedÂ’s way of becoming the first team to beat the Gunners in their new backyard.<br><br>He said: Â“Arsenal controlled the game earlier in the season and I thought Adebayor played really well for them. Â“IÂ’d say he is the toughest player IÂ’ve faced this season. Â“HeÂ’s certainly the player to have given us the most problems because heÂ’s got good movement and skill.Â”<br><br>ArsenalÂ’s well-deserved win at Old Trafford was one of the few setbacks United have suffered as they aim to topple ChelseaÂ’s Premiership stranglehold. Arsene WengerÂ’s men may be 15 points off the title pace but Ferdinand knows you can never underestimate the Gunners.<br><br>He added: Â“If youÂ’re complacent going into any game then youÂ’re in for a rude awakening. Â“You canÂ’t be like that at a club like this because there is always someone waiting to take your place. Â“And with the quality we have here, once somebody is in, it can be very difficult to displace them.Â”<br><br>Alex FergusonÂ’s table-toppers may have the Premiership crown in their sights but Wenger likes nothing more than getting one over on his arch-rival. With Chelsea taking on Liverpool 24 hours earlier at Anfield, United know this could be a massive weekend for their championship ambitions.<br><br>Midfield star Paul Scholes said: Â“We knew we needed to go into the game against Arsenal feeling confident so it was pleasing to keep a winning run going against Aston Villa. Â“The Arsenal game is big and will be difficult Â— but we couldnÂ’t be more confident going into it.Â”<br><br>United last night finally received clearance for China international Dong Fangzhou who has been at feeder club Royal Antwerp in Belgium for the past 2Â½ years. The striker, 21, has signed a contract which lasts until 2010 and is now able to make his competitive debut having received a work permit.<br><br>Boss Alex Ferguson said: Â“WeÂ’re all excited he has eventually arrived and can start playing. Â“He sacrificed 2Â½ years at Royal Antwerp, which showed great patience and determination. Â“He is quick and athletic and he can only improve by training with the first-team squad here.Â”<br><br>United signed Dong from Dalian Shide three years ago in a deal worth Â£3.5million but he has been restricted to just playing on pre-season tours. During his time in Belgium, he has impressed and scored 36 goals in 61 games for Antwerp.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gunners to blow title race open</strong><br><br>TIPPING an Arsenal win against Manchester United at any time is a recipe for disaster. ItÂ’s based largely on egg Â— most of it ending, like pizza sometimes, all over your face. Prior to their unlikely 1-0 victory at Old Trafford earlier in the season, the last time the Gunners had managed to take all three Premiership points was when Sylvain Wiltord scored the title-clincher back in May 2002.<br><br>That, though, was followed by an eight-game run spread over four seasons which saw United win four and draw the rest. At the time, Alex Ferguson had the Indian sign over Arsene Wenger and both clubs knew it. But ArsenalÂ’s victory on September 17 broke the stranglehold.<br><br>It was a strange result with United top of the table after four straight wins and the Gunners down near the bottom with just two points from three games, including a 1-0 defeat at Manchester City. Yet there was nothing fortunate about ArsenalÂ’s win. They passed United to death and could have scored three or four.<br><br>Four months later, the two old leviathans meet again at The Emirates on Sunday in a fixture that could have a seismic effect on the championship. Twenty-four hours earlier, Liverpool have another grudge meeting with Chelsea at Anfield. As weekends go, they donÂ’t come much bigger.<br><br>As an adventurous though, no doubt, foolhardy punter, IÂ’m going for a London double that will cut UnitedÂ’s lead over Chelsea to just three points. While few will argue with Jose MourinhoÂ’s team getting a result on Merseyside, siding with Arsenal is fraught with danger.<br><br>Yes, the patient has perked up in spectacular style recently but there are still obvious weaknesses for a United side, wonderfully quick and inventive on the break, to work on. While Emmanuel Eboue is a fabulous full-back going forward, he does have certain defensive liabilities.<br><br>And no one will exploit them more than Ryan Giggs, a key omission from the United side beaten by Arsenal at Old Trafford. Then there is Philippe Senderos. Such is his fallibility on the ground Â— especially on his left Â— Wenger would surely be better going with Johan Djourou against the pace of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Louis Saha.<br><br>You also wonder about an Arsenal midfield lacking the suspended Gilberto. The Brazilian, man of the match in Manchester, has long been the defensive shield that gives Cesc Fabregas the freedom to launch his deadly arrows.<br><br>The Spaniard played a pivotal role at Old Trafford. But that was against a misfiring United midfield that included Darren Fletcher and John OÂ’Shea.<br><br>Since then Paul Scholes has reinvented himself and his battle with Fabregas will be the highlight of an enthralling afternoon. If there is one player who has hijacked the old Muhammad Ali ability to float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, itÂ’s Ronaldo.<br><br>Well, apart from Thierry Henry. Another notable absentee from Old Trafford, the Frenchman has returned from his time-out with legs and lungs replenished. So there we have it. UnitedÂ’s first trip to The Emirates on the stand-out weekend of the season.<br><br>IÂ’m still backing Arsenal. Crucially, unlike United, they have nothing to lose. ThereÂ’s no better environment for a team that can play football to perform in.<br><br></div>
