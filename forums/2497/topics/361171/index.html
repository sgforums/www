              <p>Â </p>
              <p><strong>Sunderland manager Ricky Sbragia has revealed he has been
              texting friend and Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, asking
              the Red Devils to do the Black Cats a favour this weekend.</strong></p>
              <p>The Wearsiders host Chelsea on the final day of the season knowing a
              victory against Guus Hiddink's side will guarantee their league
              survival.</p>
              <p>However, should they fail to do, all eyes and ears will turn to
              Villa Park and the KC Stadium, where fellow strugglers Newcastle and
              Hull will be bidding to avoid the drop against Aston Villa and
              champions Manchester United respectively.</p>
              <p>And Sbragia has admitted he has been sharing texts with fellow
              countryman and United midfielder Fletcher, who is set to feature in a
              much-changed line-up for the Old Trafford outfit as he is suspended for
              next Wednesday's Champions League final in Rome.</p>
              <p>"I sent Fletch a few messages on Monday and he said they are
              confident about Hull. The fact is you never come up against an easy
              Manchester United team," he said in <em>The Sun</em>.</p>
              <p>"I remember years ago, Man U came here and people said it was their reserves and they beat us 3-0 with a young team.</p>
              <p>"Man United will play a team that can beat Hull, it's as simple as
              that. Alex won't put out a team of youth players, I will tell you that
              now.</p>
              <p>"Whatever team he puts out, I think it will be enough... hopefully.</p>
              <p>"They have got a lot of depth in their squad and some very good
              young players as well. They will totally believe they can win the game
              and that's all we can ask for."</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink praised Sunderland's fans after winning at the Stadium of Light yesterday.</p>
              <p>Hiddink told <em>chelseafc.com</em>: "It was good to hear after
              the last whistle the public applauding a team losing at home, that's
              rather curious but I understand it because of the salvation for the
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>"Tremendous atmosphere, it is a good club, tremendous support
              applauding not winning. It's a signal the people support it very much
              and it's nice to have that experience.</p>
              <p>"I think the approach from our side was serious and it should
              be like that. It was an honest game, because we knew they had to get
              one point for being safe, although you could expect other favourable
              results for Sunderland elsewhere.</p>
              <p>"We had a good game, some periods a little bit sloppy when they
              made it 1-1 but overall I think we dominated control of the game rather
              well."</p>

              <h1>Sbragia stands down as Sunderland manager</h1>
              <div id="storyBy"></div>
              <p>* Sbragia stands down after keeping Sunderland up</p>
              <p>* Chairman Quinn offers him "job for life"
                (updating with job offer, quotes, adds byline)</p>
              <p>By Mike Collett</p>
              <p>LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Ricky Sbragia stood down as
              Sunderland manager on Sunday after his side narrowly escaped
              relegation on the final day of the Premier League season.</p>
              <p>He was immediately praised by chairman Niall Quinn for
              keeping the club in the top tier of English soccer.</p>
              <p>Quinn told BBC Radio Five Live: "We are elated here today.
              Ricky stood up when I needed him. The players were in a bad way
              and were in the bottom three when he took over.</p>
              <p>"He has been absolutely superb, was given one task to keep
              Sunderland in the Premier League and he has achieved it.</p>
              <p>"He should be toasted tonight and has given this club a
              lifeline. He has agreed to work behind the scenes with me and
              kick this club on. He has got a job for life at this club."</p>
              <p>Sbragia, a former Manchester United reserve team coach, took
              over after Roy Keane resigned in December and confirmed his
              decision to stand down to media following a 3-2 defeat at home
              to Chelsea which ultimately did not prove too costly.</p>
              <p>"I felt the time has come for them to have a bigger name,"
              Sbragia told Radio Five Live.</p>
              <p>"I could have been selfish and stayed in the job but I have
              a lot of belief in Sunderland. I've been here for the last 13 or
              14 years and felt it was the right thing to do. I had a brief to
              keep the club up and I have done that.</p>
              <p>"The club can move on and be a threat, but I think they need
              a bigger name."</p>
              <p>Sunderland, who entered the final day of the season in
              danger of the drop, ended fifth from bottom on 36 points, two
              above north-east rivals Newcastle United who went down after a
              1-0 defeat at Aston Villa. Their other north-east rivals
              Middlesbrough were also relegated after losing 2-1 at West Ham.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Celtic boss Strachan favourite for Sunderland job</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Celtic boss Gordon Strachan is emerging as favourite for the vacant manager's job at Sunderland.</p>
              <p>The <em>Mirror</em> says Frank Rijkaard, Martin Jol and Slaven
              Bilic have all been linked with the job but Sunderland could be ready
              to make a move for Celtic boss Strachan in the next few days.</p>
              <p>Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn is keen to land the experienced
              Strachan to put the Black Cats on the map and his hopes were raised
              when Celtic missed out on the Scottish title yesterday.</p>
              <p>:<br>Strachan may be interested in a return to the Premier
              League after his trophy-laden stint in Glasgow - and the money on offer
              for new players should appeal to him.</p>
              <p>Sbragia will stay on in a coaching capacity but Strachan is
              expected to bring his trusted No.2 Gary Pendry who has been with him at
              Celtic and previously at Southampton and Coventry.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              why would strachan quit celtic and join a relegation candidate Sunderland?
              
              at celtic, he is fighting with rangers for SPL title and cups and also play in CL matches.
              
              even if sunderland and hull were not relegated this season, they will join the newcomers as relegation candidates for next season, plus portsmouth, blackburn and maybe bolton.
