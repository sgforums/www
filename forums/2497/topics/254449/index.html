Ex-Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra reckons Blackburn chief Hughes is the man to lead City towards the top end of the Premiership.</strong><br><br>Stuart Pearce was sacked yesterday after two years and two months in charge. And Hughes is sure to relish the prospect of taking on his old boss Alex Ferguson in the same city. Sparky will have Â£50million to spend once Shinawatra completes a Â£58m takeover in mid-June.<br><br>Former Wales boss Hughes is seen as a name who can attract star players to the club. The Thai group have inspected CityÂ’s books and will put in a formal offer on Friday which the board will recommend to shareholders. Stock market rules mean there will be a gap of 30 days to allow any rival offers before the sale goes through.<br><br>The Â£58m bid includes Â£20m in repayments to chairman John Wardle and business partner David Makin for the loans they gave City. Shinawatra, 57, was impressed after going on a tour of the clubÂ’s facilities yesterday. And he is now even keener for the takeover to go ahead.<br></div>

On a remarkable day of Premiership activity yesterday, City brought PearceÂ’s two-year tenure to an end after another disappointing season, while Paul Jewell resigned as manager of Wigan.</strong><br><br>Pearce was sacked at lunchtime and City chairman John Wardle immediately held talks about a replacement with former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was visiting the club for the first time ahead of his proposed takeover. It is understood that City have not yet identified a No 1 target, but the Thai party are convinced a foreign coach is the best way forward and have pencilled in Koeman as a candidate.<br><br>The former Holland international has expressed an interest in English football and is known to be seeking a way into the Premiership. Koeman, formerly with Benfica and Ajax, said: "I am a person who likes to go outside of Holland, it is good for your experience. I like the way they play in England, how the people react. "I think it is a pleasure to work there. The possibilities for most English clubs are much bigger because of their money. So, maybe."<br><br>City sources have indicated that a Thai takeover may not be far away and although former Ajax boss Co Adriaanse and fellow Dutchmen Louis van Gaal will be considered, they have ruled out moves for Sven Goran Eriksson and Claudio Ranieri.<br><br></div>
