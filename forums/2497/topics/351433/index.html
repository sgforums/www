              <p><strong>The violence that has marred the Italian game flared again in Rome last night as two Arsenal fans were injured when the coach taking them to the Stadio Olimpico was attacked by Roma supporters before the match. One of the Arsenal supporters was stabbed in the leg, according to reports. One Roma fan was arrested.</strong></p>
              <p>The coach carrying Arsenal supporters, who had travelled independently but had tickets, came under a hail of stones thrown by a group of Roma “Ultras” as it was approaching the stadium. Windows were smashed and at least one Roma fan entered the vehicle, in which a flare was let off. The two wounded Arsenal fans were “lightly injured”, police said, and had refused an offer of transport to hospital for treatment. They received on-the-spot aid from paramedics.</p>
              <p>Arsenal said last night that in addition to the coach incident there were two other attacks that left fans with head injuries. “We deplore the incidents as the safety of our supporters is our highest priority,” a statement from Arsenal and the Metropolitan Police, which sent officers to Rome, said.</p>
              <p>In a separate incident, police said two Arsenal fans, described as “completely drunk”, were arrested for vandalism on Via Veneto in the city centre. The supporters were taken to a police station, where one attempted to escape but was caught. A policeman was injured in the scuffle with the fan. Police also said that an Arsenal supporter was stopped from entering the stadium after he was found to be carrying a small hammer. He is likely to be charged with carrying an offensive weapon, but had not been arrested.</p>
              <p>Arsenal had stated their fears before the match of the possibility of incidents outside the stadium because of the Ultras’ reputation for violence. Sixteen Manchester United supporters were stabbed in the city when the English side faced Roma twice in the Champions League two years ago.</p>
              <p>Uefa had threatened to relocate this season’s Champions League final on May 27 away from the Italian capital if trouble persisted. Extra police were drafted to ensure the safety of the 3,000 Arsenal fans, with police vans surrounding the bars in areas where Roma’s Ultra fans meet before and after matches. The North London club sent booklets to fans last week asking them to be vigilant.</p>
              <p>The violence came after two Chelsea supporters were stabbed in Turin on Tuesday night before their team’s Champions League game against Juventus. The fans were slashed in the buttocks and were released from hospital after treatment.</p>

              to give Uefa their full support if there is to be an investigation into
              claims that Didier Drogba was subjected to racist abuse in Turin. </strong></p>
              <p>The Ivory Coast international was allegedly the
              victim of 'monkey chants' from a small section of the crowd as Juventus
              drew 2-2 with Chelsea on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>The case has yet to be proven but Chelsea would be happy for Uefa to look into the allegations.</p>
              <p>"Our record against fighting racism is clear," a Blues spokesman said in <em>The Sun</em>.</p>
              <p>"At this stage, we do not have sufficient evidence to back up these claims.</p>
              <p>"It would be up to Uefa to investigate them and we would do everything in our power to assist them."</p>
              <p>Uefa is waiting on reports from the referee and their delegate at the game before deciding whether to take any further action.</p>
              <p>"If what is alleged is true, there will be an investigation," said Uefa director of communications William Gaillard.</p>
