              <p><strong>Gianfranco Zola praised West Ham fans for their support for him
              following his first game in charge of the club, in which he led The
              Hammers to a 3-1 win over Newcastle.</strong></p>
              <p>The Italian took the reins at Upton Park earlier in September and
              has had just over a week to prepare his side for their first game under
              his guidance.</p>
              <p>Things could not have gone any better for Zola, with David Di
              Michele bagging a brace in his first start and Matthew Etherington
              adding the third.</p>
              <p>"The reception was fantastic. The fans were shouting my name but I
              couldn't hear a thing - my mind was completely crossed!” Zola said.</p>
              <p>"The fans were very supportive and they have made me feel very
              welcome here since I arrived. Hopefully we will get better and better
              for them.</p>
              <p>"I have been nervous - every single moment of the week, to be
              honest, but that is normal because this is the beginning of a new
              adventure for me.</p>
              <p>"In the beginning you don't know how the players will react to what
              you are telling them, But to be honest, they made me feel very
              comfortable since I arrived here.”</p>
              <p>Commenting on the display of his side, Zola said he was pleased with
              the result first and foremost, but that he still had plenty of work to
              do with his squad.</p>
              <p>"It was okay, as a performance,” he said. “I have to say that for 70
              minutes we were very good, but then we had to concede something because
              we were playing a very offensive game, we had run a lot.</p>
              <p>"But I am very pleased with the victory and some good football as
              well. We are on the way and I am very proud of the players - they have
              been fantastic."</p>
              <p>Zola continued: "David could have had a hat-trick and he played very
              well. He should share the credit with the other strikers, though.</p>
              <p>"(Carlton) Cole was occasionally up against two defenders today and he was unbelievable.</p>
              <p>"He started playing with me when I was at Chelsea and I feel he can become much better.</p>
              <p>"There are things he can improve on, but he has all the qualities to play for the national team."</p>
              <p>Looking ahead to the rest of the season, the diminutive Italian said: "We know that it will be a very tough season.</p>
              <p>"The top four are really top teams, but it's important that we improve on what we achieved last season.</p>
              <p>"If the players continue working as they have been, they can achieve that."</p>
