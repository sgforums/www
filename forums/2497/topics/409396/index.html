              <p><strong>
              </strong></p><p><strong>Liverpool are poised to complete the signing of 
              Portuguese international midfielder Raul Meireles from Porto as a direct
               replacement for Javier Mascherano, who is joining Barcelona.</strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              <br>
              <p>The move represents something of a coup for the Reds, with 
              Meireles previously linked to Pep Guardiola's side, as well as 
              Manchester United and Inter Milan.</p>
              <p>Meireles will be available for Stg10.7m. The 27-year-old only has two
               years left on his Porto contract and the club wants to cash in now 
              rather than wait until the end of his deal, when he can leave for 
              nothing.</p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson is hoping that he can sign the player before the game against Birmingham City on September 12th.</p>

              <h2>LIVERPOOL COMPLETE RAUL MEIRELES DEAL</h2>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Liverpool have completed the signing of Porto midfielder Raul Meireles on a four-year deal.</strong></p>
              <p>Roy Hodgson moved quickly on Saturday to land Meireles and bolster the Anfield engine room following the recent departures of Alberto Aquilani and Javier Mascherano.</p>
              <p>The Reds have paid 14 million euros (around £11.5million) for the services of the 27-year-old midfielder, who has won four titles with Porto and been capped 38 times by Portugal, including in all four of his country's games in this summer's World Cup.</p>
              <p>Liverpool agreed a deal on Friday to send Mascherano to Barcelona after the midfielder, whose family could not settle on Merseyside, was reportedly unprepared to play for the club.</p>
              <p>Aquilani also departed for Juventus in a loan deal which brought to an end and underwhelming and injury-hit spell in the city in which he failed adequately to replace Xabi Alonso.</p>
              <p>On the pitch Liverpool have started the season in uninspiring fashion under new boss Roy Hodgson, with last week's 3-0 defeat by Manchester City particularly dispiriting.</p>
              <p>They at least have a Europa League campaign to look forward to after overcoming Trabzonspor this week.</p>
              <p>Meireles, at home in the centre of midfield, is well decorated in Portugal, having claimed four league winner's medals.</p>
              <p>He is an established international and scored in Portugal's 7-0 win over North Korea in South Africa this summer.</p>

              <p>The 27-year-old Portugal international has signed a four-year contract and will add weight to a Reds midfield which was looking short on numbers following the departures of Mascherano and Alberto Aquilani.</p>
              <p>He was introduced to the Anfield crowd ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League match with West Bromwich Albion.</p>
              <p>'Roy Hodgson was key to me coming here because he worked so hard to sign me,' Meireles said in the Sunday Express.</p>
              <p>'I am Meireles and not Mascherano and that will be clear to the fans. I hope one day the Liverpool fans will remember me for being successful.'</p>
              <p>Meireles has won four titles with Porto and been capped 38 times by Portugal, playing in all four of his country's games at this summer's World Cup.</p>
              <p>Liverpool on Friday agreed a deal to send Mascherano to Barcelona after the midfielder, whose family could not settle on Merseyside, was reportedly unprepared to play for the club.</p>
