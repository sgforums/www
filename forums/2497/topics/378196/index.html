              <h1>Rafa's £12m 'war chest': <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail's</span> picks the men Benitez can sign with his limited Liverpool budget in January</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/07/article-1218799-06A23771000005DC-623_468x340.jpg" alt="Liverpool coach Rafal Benitez" width="468" height="340"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption">Money to burn: But who should Benitez spend £12m on? <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Sportsmail </span>suggests...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez has been handed £12m to make improvements to his squad when the January transfer-window opens, a figure that falls well short of what is needed if </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> are to resurrect a faltering season.</strong></p>
              <p>The club's American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett have made the money available after the Reds suffered three defeats in their opening eight games.</p>
              <p>However, Benitez will know that £12m is a mere drop in the ocean when it comes to the fees that clubs can demand for the top players he needs - with the money he has been offered he could afford to buy half a Joleon Lescott!</p>
              <p>Still, the Spaniard can start splashing the cash in 85 days, so <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/index.html"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"><span style="color: #003580;">Sportsmail</span></span></a> gives the Reds boss some ideas for his January shopping-list.</p>

              <p>We're not entirely sure what is happening with Jamie Carragher, is he shrinking or are strikers getting bigger? Either way, the ease with which Drogba rolled the former England defender was frankly worrying.</p>

              <p>I do believe that it was a mistake to sell crouch.</p>
              <p>For Bellamy it was different. He was very disruptive and everyone team knows that one rotten apple can spoil the team morale. Just look at Adebayor for example. He is good but his attitude sucks.</p>

              <p>Rafa should keep the money. Save it till the end of season. Let's be pragmatic. The current crop of players are already good enough to last through the season and still be in contention for the Title. Why waste 12M now when it can be snowballed for better effect next?</p>
              <p>If anything, there's a shortage of hungry players. I see jaded players on the field. It's true and Rafa has got to start motivating/cajoling his players, instead of playing hardball management.</p>
              <p>This January, anything less than a David Silva is a major disappointment, imho. Otherwise, save that $12M. Why not reward it to the clubs top goalscorer/assist? Haha. That should spur the players. ; )</p>
