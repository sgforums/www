              <h1>David Sullivan dubs West Ham United flops 'fat, lazy and

              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> According to <em>The Mirror</em>, West Ham 
              United co-owner David Sullivan has continued his tirade against the 
              club's players by telling them that they are all "fat, lazy and 
              useless".<br><br>The former Birmingham City overseer made waves earlier 
              in the week when he dubbed the team "pathetic" in an open letter after 
              their embarrassing 3-1 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers.<br><br>And
               while he and his partner David Gold have thrown their support behind 
              manager Gianfranco
               Zola, the Hammers' underperforming stars have had to deal 
              with still more criticism from the top.<br><br>It is said that Sullivan 
              interrupted a team meeting on Thursday to tell the players first hand 
              just what he thought of them, an act that sent Upton Park into an 
              uproar.<br><br>Only the intervention of Steve Clarke prevented the 
              spectactle from turning into an altogether uglier scene, with the 
              assistant manager ushering Sullivan away from the enraged players.<br><br>Of
               the incident, Zola is quoted as saying: “It’s not necessary to get into
               the details. It’s important we focus on what we have to do in the game 
              [this weekend] rather than anything else.”<br><br>West Ham, who are 
              diving towards the relegation zone, will face Stoke City on Saturday
               afternoon.</span></p>

              <h2>Potters pile pressure on Hammers</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"></div>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></p><blockquote>
              <p>West Ham's Premier League future is hanging by a thread after they 
              crashed to a sixth straight defeat as Stoke grabbed a 1-0 win at Upton 
              Park.  Stoke striker Ricardo Fuller came off the bench to score a 
              brilliant solo goal after 69 minutes to send West Ham spiralling towards
               the relegation trap-door.</p>
              <p>Hull's victory over Fulham at the KC Stadium meant West Ham's 
              cushion has been lost with only goal difference keeping them out of the 
              bottom three.</p>
              <p>West Ham co-owner David Sullivan had blasted the midweek 3-1 
              defeat to Wolves as "pathetic" and "appalling" and there was little 
              evidence of an improvement today.</p>
              <p>In an open letter to supporters Sullivan also pointed to West 
              Ham's lack of quality players and, Scott Parker and Carlton Cole apart, 
              that was clearly evident as they once again lacked passion and ideas.</p>
              <p>Gianfranco Zola made five changes from the Wolves defeat, a 
              couple of which raised more than a few eyebrows around Upton Park.</p>

              relegation zone.<br><br>The Italian watched his side slump to another 
              home beating, this time losing 1-0 to Stoke City at Upton Park.<br><br>With
               Hull City winning at home against Fulham, Zola's men are now level on 
              points with Iain Dowie's side, who occupy the third and final relegation
               place.<br><br>"I have to find out what the problem is," Zola said,

               dubbed the performance 'pathetic'.<br><br>Saturday's loss against Stoke
               leaves the Hammers in 17th place, level on points with Hull City one

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Final act: West Ham boss Gianfranco Zola looks 
              dejected as he consoles Scott Parker following their 1-0 defeat by Stoke
               City</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Gianfranco Zola was considering quitting as West Ham manager last 
              night after the club's sixth successive Premier League defeat put them 
              on the brink of relegation.</p>
              <p>The Italian said he was ready to 
              sacrifice himself if it would help rescue the club, who are kept out of 
              the bottom three only on goal difference.</p>
              <p>Hull beat Fulham 2-0 to
               draw level on points with a game in hand, while Ricardo Fuller's 
              69th-minute strike condemned West Ham to a 1-0 home defeat by Stoke.</p>
              <p>Walking away now, with six games left, would allow the club to install a
               short-term replacement in a bid for Premier League survival. Glenn 
              Hoddle, David O'Leary and Graeme Souness have been considered for that 
              role, but Birmingham boss Alex McLeish is the man co-chairmen David 
              Sullivan and David Gold want in the summer if West Ham are still in the 
              top flight.</p>
              <p>It is understood that former Birmingham owners 
              Sullivan and Gold have run out of patience with Zola, but the 
              possibility of going back to their old club to approach 
              McLeish is bound to stir up trouble with 
              their successors, with whom they have a 
              difficult relationship.</p>
              <p>Zola has three years left on his West Ham 
              contract and earns £1.9million
              a year. Sacking him and assistant Steve Clarke could cost £3.5m, a huge
              sum for a club already massively in debt.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Asked if he was walking away from the job, Zola said: 'If the 
              problem is me, why not? I will have to think about it a lot overnight. 
              The players are trying very hard and the bottom line is to see whether I
               can help them or not.</p>
              <p>'It would be difficult to walk away. I 
              have a big bond with the players. Losing today was very painful and 
              there is a lot to think about. It will be a weekend where I will be 
              talking to the owners a lot.'</p>
              <p>Gold, who went to see Zola after 
              yesterday's defeat, said as he left Upton Park: 'We had a meeting with 
              him, we assured him that we were right behind him.</p>
              <p>'We've got six
               very difficult games and he's got to get some results for us. But we're
               absolutely 100 per cent behind him.</p>

              manager as we speak. We don't 
              have a replacement in mind.'</p>
              <p>The defeat by Stoke and the humiliation by Wolves last 
              Tuesday has undoubtedly 
              pushed Zola towards the exit 
              door, but the writing has been 
              on the wall for the Italian since 
              Sullivan and Gold took control 
              in January.</p>
              <p>Sullivan launched a scathing 
              attack on West Ham's players, 
              the team's tactics and 
              organisation after the 3-1 
              defeat against Wolves at Upton 
              Park, which upset Zola.</p>
              <p>There were further problems 
              at the training ground when 
              the co-chairman is thought to 
              have clashed with players and 
              been told to leave a meeting 
              by Clarke.</p>

              <p>However, Zola insisted they did not 
              add to those difficulties last night. 'The owners are behind us,' he 
              said.</p>
              <p>'I don't know if they will sack me. I don't think so, but 
              it is not a problem. I know my duties and know the situation is not 
              going the way it should. I accept that.</p>
              <p>'I don't think the 
              players are playing against us. Obviously, looking at the results, I am 
              not getting the best out of them.</p>
              <p>'The fans have been great and I
               am sorry we couldn't give them a better response.</p>
              <p>'I am here 
              just to do a good job for this club and will consider overnight whether I

              <p>However if any one of them does not perform well, it will just mean the team results will be bad.</p>

              <h1>West Ham boss Gianfranco Zola vows to fight on after handing his 
              losers a three-day break</h1>

              </div>
              <p>Gianfranco Zola has vowed to remain at West Ham and fight the battle against relegation.</p>
              <p>Manager
               Zola made his decision to stay at Upton Park after a dramatic day which
               saw him fly home to Sardinia to consider his future in the wake of his 
              side's dismal 1-0 defeat by Stoke on Saturday.</p>
              <p>It came just hours
               after his seemingly-astonishing move to reward his beleaguered players,
               his assistant Steve Clarke, and himself with three days off, despite a 
              sixth consecutive defeat.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/28/article-0-08E4CF43000005DC-615_468x286.jpg" alt="Gianfranco Zola and Steve Clarke" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Defiant: Under-fire Zola has returned to Italy 
              but has vowed to stay at West Ham</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A friend of the Italian told <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>that, despite the criticism he
              had suffered, the West Ham boss was determined not to walk away from
              the situation with just six Barclays Premier League matches to go.</p>
              <div id="ext-gen2375" class="moduleHalf"></div>
              <p>Zola was publicly criticised by joint chairman David 
              Sullivan in the
              wake of last Tuesday's humiliating home loss to fellow strugglers Wolves, but co-chairman David Gold visited the 
              dressing room on
              Saturday evening and gave the manager his backing.</p>
              <p>Sullivan would have sacked Zola earlier but has been swayed by Gold 
              to allow him to stay until the end of the season.</p>
              <p>The feeling in the boardroom after the Stoke defeat was more
              supportive of Zola than of late, with Sullivan, Gold and vice-chairman
              Karren Brady praising an improved performance after the 'shambolic'
              display of four days earlier.</p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>West Ham are reluctant to sack Zola and assistant Steve 
              Clarke as it
              would mean they had to pay off a percentage of the pair's indulgent
              annual salaries.</p>
              <p>Zola signed a new three-year contract worth £1.9million a year last
              summer and Clarke earns £900,000 a year, more than double Mike Phelan,
              his counterpart at Manchester United.</p>
              <p>The board's other problem is the lack of credible alternatives.
              Former Liverpool and Rangers boss Graeme Souness has already turned
              down the chance to take over for West Ham's remaining six games and
              Sullivan and Gold have also ruled out the possibility of Sir Trevor
              Brooking returning to the dug-out.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/28/article-0-08E4F7BA000005DC-463_468x310.jpg" alt="West Ham" width="468" height="310">

              <p>If Zola had decided to walk away, they would have needed 
              someone who is available immediately.</p>
              <p>Former England and Spurs boss Glenn Hoddle would have fitted the
              bill, perhaps with a former West Ham favourite working alongside him in
              an attempt to appease the fans.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #888888;">                              Zola confirms he will remain West Ham manager</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Zola's future has been the subject of sustained debate in recent days following a public dispute with co-owner David Sullivan and a run of poor form, and a 1-0 loss to Stoke at Upton Park on Saturday saw Zola return home to Italy to contemplate his future.</p>
              <p>But with West Ham only sitting above the relegation zone due to a superior goal difference than Hull City, Zola is intent on preventing the London club from sliding into the Championship.</p>
              <p>"I am determined to carry on," read the statement. "Losing on Saturday was emotional for everyone but I know we can turn it around and we have the ability to achieve our objectives."</p>
              <p>Zola, who is expected to return to London on Tuesday to take training having given the team three days off, became involved in a spat with Sullivan last week after the co-owner described a performance against Wolves as "shambolic" and "pathetic".</p>
              <p>Zola had warned Sullivan his words could have a damaging impact on the team and further tensions were exposed when Sullivan was asked to stay away from a team meeting at the training ground. But the manager says both Sullivan and David Gold are supportive of his leadership and that the club are now focused on staying in the top flight.</p>
              <p>"They have backed me and I am grateful,'' added Zola. "My only thought for now is to keep this club in the Premier League and that remains my goal. I'll give everything I can to make this happen between now and the end of the season.</p>
              <p>"I have had time to think and we will have to work harder than we have before. I know we can get the results we need and it is just a question of making it happen. The performance was better on Saturday but it is still not the level we should be at. We can, and will, do better as a team.</p>
              <p>"I have a great staff and we will work together to find the solutions. We have a responsibility to turn things around and that is what we will do. I am here and I am ready to do what I need to do to get the results. There is no doubt about that. We have seen before we are capable of playing at a high level.</p>
              <p>"We will go to Everton determined to get a result. People might not expect us to get something from the match but we will be positive. No-one should write us off. Although we are in a serious position we have time to sort things out and be in control of our destiny at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>"We said before Stoke that one game would not define the season but we know each of the games left will be cup finals. They will be massive and I know the fans will once again get behind us starting with Everton and we will give everything to reward their support. They have been brilliant and we owe them.''</p>
