              <p>well, to be fair, he did get who he wanted in Torres, not too sure about Keane, and Barry. To be fair, I feel the Barry saga got messy and hence compromised the transfer. Ultimately, he lost Xavi.</p>
              <p>yes, he got 20m. On one hand, i feel he has to know how to utilise what he got, and know where to sell/buy. No point challenging the rich A** right?</p>

              <p>problem is who will buy liverpool rejects? n it has been said that sale of bellamy contributed to the purchase of torres...n if u gt lousy and cheap players, most likely they r either old or rejects, so hw the hell is benitez be able  to improve their technical skills and physical fitness in such a short time?</p>

              <p><br>sure...u r not wrong.. the problem is when u r given a budget abt 20 million per season n u r expected to beef up the squad, do u rather get one  very gd player and get nobody else or one normal player and some squad player ? n it has been shown sometimes he's  forced to gt his 2nd choice as shown in the robbie keane and gareth barry saga..</p>

              <p><br>I feel your comment is a bit off... $20m isn't exactly peanuts also... I think it's his overall squad that is being questioned and how he spent the money. Its his purchased that are looking normal rather than the $$$ spent. He paid $7m for Dossena, $8m for Riera... United also paid $7m for Vidic and Evra cost $6.5m... The thing was they develop into able players while quite a large number of Rafa's purchased turn out to be bad choices...</p>
              <p>How do you put it... Its like Rafa was going all out to get Heinze when United were already trying to discard him... Here was a player United feel he cannot perform as well in the premiership already and here was Rafa fighting to pay $6, 7 million pounds for him... I think many Pool fans would probably feel happy Heinze didn't join them cos he went on to prove that in Spain with Real... their defence were leaking goals during his time there...</p>
              <p>And I don't know how many times some Pool fans still want to believe Keane wasn't his choice as well... Do not forget it was Rafa who went on to comment about being interested in getting Keane first and forming a dream partnership with Fernando Torres at that time that got Spurs all upset and wanted to report them to the FA...</p>
              <p>From an earlier much lower offer to Spurs, Pool eventually willing to pay the full $20m Spurs demanded, we can see how much he wanted him... And what a waste of a $20m buy just like that by not knowing how to use him.</p>
              <p>On Barry, I think its because Rafa couldn't offload Alonso that was more the reason. He was touting him around Europe like an old car and also partly Villa were so upset with Rafa's approach of making it public that they were prepared to let Barry run down his contract and not sell him to Pool. Pool made 4 bids for Barry but O'Neill turn all down...</p>

              <p>yes, i agree that 20 million is ain't peanuts, but when u want to buy gd players, the clubs will inflat the price to give themselves a profit, so if they quote silva to be in 20 million, then wat u expect RB to do? bust the whole transfer budget on a single player?</p>

              <p>of course, it is never wise to put all your eggs in one basket.</p>
              <p>but is Silva worth 20M, I think he does. I am unsure how this transfer thingy works, but I would suggest a cash offer plus players swap. What's the point of spending 5m on 4 players, when they can't contribute as well as a one 20M player?I think there is a delicate balance and the manager has to be the one holding the responsibility.</p>
              <p>Lastly, any club will inflate the prices when they know the big fishes are interested, cause they do have to either settle some debts or get replacement players or etc. So that's common sense, already.</p>
