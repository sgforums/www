              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Let's dance: Peter Crouch and Jonathan Woodgate in full party mode at Movida on Saturday night</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Peter Crouch has risked the anger of hardline England manager Fabio Capello after looking worse for wear in a London nightclub during the early hours of Sunday morning.</strong></p>
              <p>Crouch was photographed inside the Movida club, dancing with his shirt unbuttoned and his jeans soaked either by sweat or a spilled drink. The England striker then continued the antics by poking his lanky frame through the sun-roof of a moving people carrier after leaving the club at 2am.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Crouch, along with team-mates Jonathan Woodgate, Robbie Keane and Jermaine Jenas, were celebrating Tottenham's win at Portsmouth with wives and girlfriends.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The images of a dishevelled looking Crouch are unlikely to endear him to Italian Capello, who has made all of his England squad aware of their responsibilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/19/article-1221471-06DE0CEA000005DC-676_233x286.jpg" alt="Spurs striker Peter Crouch and girlfriend Abbey Clancey arrive at Movida nightclub" width="233" height="286">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Crouch's two goals against Belarus edged him ahead of Carlton Cole in the race for a World Cup place in South Africa. But Capello is renowned for his strict disciplinary approach and the pictures of Crouch do not fit with the suited and booted image the Italian has demanded since taking charge of the national side.</strong></p>
              <p>Crouch's behaviour could also land the striker in trouble with Spurs boss Harry Redknapp, who hit out at partying players in an exclusive interview with Sportsmail in the summer.</p>
              <p>Redknapp said: 'The nightclub reputation that was around this club when I arrived is something we've had to get rid of. It's hard but I've given them all a warning. I've told them I don't want to see them in nightclubs or pubs. I don't think there is any need for it.</p>
              <p>'These boys are highly-paid athletes. I've said go and have a glass of wine with the wife or partner in a nice restaurant on a Saturday night after a game. That's not a problem. But I've told them I don't want to see them rolling out of nightclubs at three in the morning.</p>
              <p>'There's no need for it. If you can't dedicate your life to something for nine months of the year when you're earning 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 grand a week, there's got to be a problem. These lads have to make sure they are in great condition.'</p>
              <p> </p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/10/19/article-1221471-06DE99C7000005DC-552_468x439.jpg" alt="Peter Crouch" width="468" height="439">

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Redknapp added: 'They can't do it any more anyway because they always get caught. There's always someone waiting outside with a camera or there's someone who wants to have a go.'</strong></p>
              <p>Crouch's antics come on the back of Ledley King's arrest in May for allegedly assaulting a man outside a Soho nightclub after an evening which the Tottenham defender described as: 'A night out with friends which went too far.'</p>
              <p>The misdemeanor earned King a £120,000 fine and a telling-off from Redknapp, who then vowed to impose a booze ban on his players. But in August, David Bentley was banned from driving for one year after crashing his Porsche into a lamp-post, having drunk four pints and two spirits at a London gig.</p>
              <p>Bentley was also fined two weeks' wages and has yet to start a Barclays Premier League game for Tottenham this season.</p>
              <p>Crouch and Tottenham were unavailable for comment last night.</p>
