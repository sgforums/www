              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>

              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/19/article-1267353-09346CD6000005DC-439_306x487.jpg" alt="Gianfranco Zola" width="306" height="487">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Borrowed time: Gianfranco Zola </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Gianfranco Zola will be sacked at
              the end of West
               Ham’s increasingly
              desperate bid to avoid relegation from
              the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>The under-pressure manager saw his struggling
              side’s survival hopes suffer another setback at
              Anfield last night, apparently unaware that his
              fate had already been sealed.</p>
              <p>Alarmed at the way West Ham 
              folded at key
              moments, such as the recent home game with
              Wolves, Upton Park bosses have decided a change
              is needed at the end of the season.</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> understands Zola has yet to be
              informed, though the news will not come as a
              surprise after his team put up little resistance and
              were undone by Yossi Benayoun, David Ngog and an own goal by Robert
              Green.</p>
              <p>West Ham want former
              England coach Steve
              McClaren to take over but
              will have to stay up to
              stand any chance of
              landing him after the way
              his reputation has been
              restored at FC Twente.</p>
              <p>McClaren’s Twente team
              are one win away from
              clinching the Dutch title.</p>
              <p>Travelling West Ham fans
              taunted their own team
              with chants of ‘It’s just like
              watching Brazil’ after
              they finally went close in
              injury time, and Zola
              admitted: ‘We can’t
              pretend it was our best
              performance and the
              players know that.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Looking down: West Ham keeper Robert Green feels

              </div>
              <p>‘The first goal changed
              everything and, for some
              reason, they didn’t seem
              to think they could come
              back from it. But this isn’t
              the moment for dwelling
              on things, because we
              need a reaction against
              Wigan on Saturday.</p>
              <p>‘How do I cope with the
              pressure? By working
              even harder. That’s what
              we did when the pressure
              was on against Everton,
              and we will do it again on
              Saturday.’</p>
              <p>Liverpool
               manager Rafa
              Benitez admitted he was
              surprised by West Ham’s
              lack of fight, saying: ‘It
              was comfortable in the
              end. Once the first goal
              went in, it was easy, and
              perhaps we should have
              scored more.</p>
              <p>'We have a
              long trip coming up for
              the Europa semi-final in
              Madrid, so it was
              important we were able
              to control the game.</p>
              <p>‘We will be going by train
              to London and it will be a
              case then of seeing if the
              airports are open. It is not
              ideal, but there are not
              too many options.</p>
              <p>'It is just
              a pity that it may cause
              some difficulties for our
              supporters. I will be really
              disappointed for them if
              they cannot travel.’</p>
