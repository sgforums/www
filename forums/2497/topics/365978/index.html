              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Luiz Felipe Scolari claims a
                  number of Chelsea players did not respect him and his training methods
                  during his eight-month stint at the Bridge.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>The 60-year-old Brazilian,
                  who is currently coaching Bunyodkor in Uzbekistan, singled out the
                  behaviour of Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, Germany midfielder
                  Michael Ballack and Czech Republic goalkeeper Petr Cech as
                  unacceptable.</p>
              <p>Scolari, who took over the Blues hot-seat last July and was
                  sacked in February, told O Globo newspaper: "The real owners of
                  football at the moment are the players. The coach, in most European
                  clubs, has no strength to contradict them.</p>
              <p>"The people sacked are always the coaches. The main players
                  already know this. That was my problem at Chelsea. Drogba, Ballack and
                  Cech did not accept my training methods or my demands."</p>
              <p>The former Brazil and Portugal boss, meanwhile, believes
                  Cristiano Ronaldo will get on well with fellow Real Madrid new boy Kaka
                  but reckons Raul is still the main man at the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>"Kaka is a strange player because of what he does both on and off the field," Scolari said of his countryman.</p>
              <p>"That guy is a strange jewel. Despite having gained big fame and money, he keeps doing his best on the pitch like a youngster.</p>
              <p>"I am sure Cristiano Ronaldo and he will get on very well with
                  each other. Cristiano has nothing to do with the conceited image
                  everybody has of him. I think both of them will be big friends.</p>
              <p>"The problem Real Madrid have is Raul. He is a veteran and is
                  still the boss in the dressing room, so woe betide anyone he doesn't
                  like - including the coach."</p>
              <p>Scolari wants to return to Brazil after the end of his
                  Bunyodkor contract in December 2010. He plans to coach there for a
                  while before retiring, and claims he has already had interest from his
                  homeland.</p>
              <p>"My contract lasts one year and a half, but every six months
                  we'll sit down and discuss things," he said of his deal with the Uzbek
                  outfit.</p>
              <p>"Both they and I can decide not to continue. They want me to coach their national team but nothing is decided yet.</p>
              <p>"Rivaldo, the big player of our team, told me it was great to do
                  a very good job because he knows the Under-20 team of the country and
                  he told me there are a few players who are very good on the ball, who
                  have good futures," he said.</p>
              <p>"I'll be back (in Brazil) in one year and a half. I will work
                  there as a coach for two more years and that's it. I'll change job or
                  retire.</p>
              <p>"Palmeiras wanted me to sign a pre-contract for the day I
                  return to Brazil, but I rejected it. When I am back, I want to be free
                  to decide the best thing at that moment.</p>
              <p>"Also, there was a Sao Paulo director who called my agent because he wanted my phone number."</p>
