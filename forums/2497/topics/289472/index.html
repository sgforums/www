            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/09/bridge150906_228x334.jpg"><br><span class="small">Bridge has spent much of the season on the sidelines</span><br><br><strong>Wayne Bridge's long-running battle with Ashley Cole is entering crunch time at Chelsea, with the former Southampton defender hoping to establish first-choice status before the January transfer window opens. The 27-year-old has been out for most of the season through injury and suspension but is available to face Wigan tomorrow and impatient to put down a marker for the rest of the season. </strong><br><br>Bridge played second fiddle to Cole under Jose Mourinho and had to accept the position because his rival was one of the Portuguese's major signings. But new manager Avram Grant has brought a fresh start and Bridge is optimistic of moving ahead of his rival in the pecking order after earning rave reviews from team-mates and fans when he played last season.<br><br>His only start of the season came against Schalke last week after a hip operation and a ban from a reserveteam sending-off sidelined him. Bridge looked like he had never been away and his ProZone statistics highlighted his deceptive speed and the many runs he makes.<br><br>The ankle injury Cole sustained with England last month means he will not be ready to play tomorrow but could be fit for the Champions League return to Schalke next week, forcing Grant to show who he favours at left-back. Bridge said: Â“I just want to play and I am going to be battling for a place. I want to make up for lost time. Â“It was brilliant to come back against Schalke and I think the manager was pleased with me. It has been really frustrating on the sidelines but the suspension killed me because I could have played three more games. With Ashley injured it was a nightmare.Â”<br><br>Bridge's suspension did not apply to Champions League games but it prevented him from playing against Middlesbrough, Manchester City and Leicester when Chelsea didn't have another recognised left-back available. He was sent off for a high challenge in a reserve match last month and claimed the decision made this the most frustrating start to a season in his career.<br><br>Bridge said: Â“It was a bad decision by the referee and the timing of it killed me. It would have been nice coming back from injury to get playing again with a new manager.Â” Grant has made it clear the squad will have to get used to his penchant for rotation. However, Bridge is aiming for an extended run in the team and, even though he has three years left on his contract, is in great demand outside Stamford Bridge, with Manchester City and West Ham preparing to move for him in January.<br></div>
