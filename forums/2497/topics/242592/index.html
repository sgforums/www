            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/n1_09.jpg"> <img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/n1_01.jpg"><br><br><strong>Five months after denying "incorrect and hurtful" reports of an imminent split, Russia's richest man, billionaire Roman Abramovich, has confirmed his 16-year marriage to wife Irina is over. In what may be one of the most costly divorces in history, the pair issued a statement saying Abramovich's corporate interests - which include the Chelsea Football Club -- would not however be affected.</strong><br><br>"Mr and Mrs Abramovich have divorced in Russia on a consensual basis and have agreed terms in respect of arrangements for their (five) children and a financial settlement," the statement said, without giving any details. The divorce follows newspaper reports that Abramovich has been seen with a young Russian model, Daria Zhukova.<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/Dashazhukova.jpg"><br>Dasha Zhukova<br><br>Newspapers, many of which ran the story on their front pages, said Irina Abramovich could get as much as half of her husband's estimated $18.7 billion (10 billion pounds) fortune and said it was the biggest divorce settlement in the world.Experts on divorce law said a 50/50 split of wealth accrued during the marriage would be normal procedure in Russia.<br><br>"Russian divorce law is pretty straightforward. You must equally split all property and assets which have been amassed since you have been married," said a lawyer at a major Western legal firm in Moscow. But a source who worked with Abramovich for several years told Reuters Irina Abramovich was unlikely to get 50 percent.<br><br>"I'm pretty sure it is not going to be a 50/50 percent split. She will simply get some money, but whether it will be dozens of millions, hundreds of millions or billions -- that's something that only a very small group of people will know," the source said.<br><br><img src="http://content.answers.com/main/content/wp/en-commons/thumb/8/8d/138px-RomanAbramovic.jpg"><br><br>Abramovich, an orphan, split from his first wife, Olga, in 1990 and married Irina in 1991. The 40-year-old, who built up his fortune mostly from oil and aluminium businesses during the chaos that followed the fall of the Soviet Union, has become the poster boy for Russia's oligarchs, known for savvy business deals and sumptuous living.<br><br>Listed by Forbes magazine as the world's 16th richest person he is a source of fascination for the tabloid newspapers, who regularly splash photos of him and his former wife. The tycoon, who is notoriously shy of the media, denied a newspaper report last October that his wife had been talking to divorce lawyers amid reports of her husband's close friendship with Zhukova, 25.<br><br>Abramovich's spokesman described the reports at the time as "incorrect and hurtful" and said suggestions the Abramoviches were facing serious difficulties were "similarly untrue". The divorce news broke too late for Russian newspapers, but Moscow radio stations and Web sites had it as the top story on Wednesday.<br><br>Some Web sites showed pictures of Abramovich next to Zhukova, saying the strikingly beautiful daughter of an oil magnate and former girl-friend of Russian tennis star Marat Safin has been the main reason for Abramovich's divorce.<br><br><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/RA.jpg"></div>

His fortune took off in 1995 when he teamed up with Boris Berezovsky to take over oil giant Sibneft at a fraction of its market value. (When Berezovsky fled Russia in 2000 to escape fraud charges, he sold out to Abramovich.) In 2003 to 2004 sold his stake in Russian Aluminum to Oleg Deripaska. In Fall 2005 liquidated his biggest asset, selling his 72.6% stake in Sibneft to Gazprom for $13 billion. Last year got back to business in Russia, buying a stake in the country's largest steel maker Evraz Group. Sent a letter of resignation to Vladimir Putin, asking to be relieved of the post of governor of the remote northern province of Chukotka, where he has raised living standards and earned a set of passionate supporters; Putin refused. He's reportedly building a private hospital in Moscow .<br></div>
