            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>to say making rafael the scapegoat is wrong. his first yellow card was unnecessary, it wasn't even any danger to utd. he's so stupid aka no soccer brain aka no experience to know that it's early in the game and with no danger, there's no need to get a card like that. the second yellow card was near the half way line towards man utd and there are a few man utd players covering behind him, to get another card was completely dumb. but the ref wasn't going to give a card until all the BM players crowded around him it seems. i don't think rafael can play at the highest level, he's shaken easily to pressure. should have put oshea or neville.</div>

              <h1>Manchester United 3 Bayern Munich 2: Arjen Robben sends United 
              crashing out of Champions League with stunning volley<br></h1>

              <h2>Aggregate score: Manchester United 4 Bayern Munich 4 - Bayern Munich
               win on away goals<br></h2>
              <p>Wayne Rooney's surprise recovery could not
               prevent a night of Champions League misery for Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Bayern Munich's away-goals
               victory over United made it the first time since 2003 that an English 
              club had not made it to the semi-finals.</p>
              <p>Rooney, surprisingly in 
              the starting line-up after overcoming an ankle injury. had looked to 
              have inspired a famous win when United went 3-0 up but the match swung 
              at the start of the second half when Rafael was sent off for a second 
              booking and a flare-up of Rooney's ankle saw him substituted.</p>
              <p>Bayern
               then dominated and triumphed when Arjen Robben volleyed home the vital 
              second away goal in the 74th minute.</p>
              <p>Rooney's crucial importance 
              to Manchester United's ambitions was underlined after the England 
              striker was named in the starting line-up just a week after it looked as
               though an ankle injury may have ended his season.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/07/article-0-090A6B13000005DC-120_306x442.jpg" alt="Wayne Rooney" width="306" height="442">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Shock starter: Wayne Rooney gets the ball past 
              Bayern Munich's Argentinian midfielder Martin Demichelis </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Rooney's remarkable recovery allowed Sir Alex Ferguson to select his 
              preferred 4-3-3 line-up with Nani and Darron Gibson providing the 
              firepower alongside the United talisman.</p>
              <p>Dimitar Berbatov dropped 
              to the bench while John O'Shea and Federico Macheda were also named as 
              substitutes.</p>
              <p>Bayern Munich coach Louis van Gaal had the luxury
               of naming both Arjen Robben and Bastian Schweinsteiger in his starting 
              XI after they missed last week's first leg.</p>
              <p>Hamit Altintop and
               Danijel Pranjic dropped to the bench as the Bundesliga side aimed to 
              protect their 2-1 advantage.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's selection paid 
              dividends within three minutes as United seized the lead with the goal 
              made by Rooney and scored by Gibson.</p>
              <p>Rafael started the move with a
               pass infield and Rooney's lay-off to Gibson was<br>perfectly weighted 
              for the Republic of Ireland man to strike a low shot from 20 yards past 
              Hans-Jorg Butt for his fifth goal of the season.</p>
              <p>If that sent the 
              Old Trafford crowd into early ecstasy, there was near-delirium when 
              Nani's extravagant back-flick made it 2-0 in the seventh minute.</p>
              <p>Antonio
               Valencia was the creator, teasing Holger Badstuber before finding 
              enough space to fire in the cross with Nani unmarked in the six-yard box
               and able to finish with a flourish.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/07/article-1264293-090A6974000005DC-532_468x286.jpg" alt="Darron Gibson " width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>What a start: Darron Gibson puts Manchester 
              United ahead</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Michael Carrick drove wide from the edge of the box as United went in
               search of a third and then Rooney's snap-header from a corner looked 
              promising but soared over the crossbar.</p>
              <p>Rafael then went into the 
              referee's notebook for a silly retaliatory foul.</p>
              <p>Rooney's 
              ankle started to be a cause for concern again however when he started 
              limping after going over on his ankle in a challenge with Daniel van 
              Buyten.</p>
              <p>He stayed on the pitch to try to run it off though, 
              while Nani was next to threaten but his wild shot from 25 yards was 
              hopelessly wide.</p>
              <p>It was 25 minutes before Bayern managed an effort
               on target but Thomas Muller's<br>fiercely-struck drive was blocked by 
              Darren Fletcher, and in the next move the<br>Scottish midfielder was 
              hacked down by Mark van Bommel earning the Dutchman a<br>booking.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/07/article-1264293-090A909B000005DC-93_306x423.jpg" alt="Nani " width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Two goals: Nani celebrates</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Rafael then blew a glorious opportunity after a breakaway saw him put
               clean through on goal, with the young defender screwing his shot wide 
              after being caught in two minds about whether to pass.</p>
              <p>Bayern 
              finally put together a good passing move and United for once were left 
              chasing shadows when Muller put in Ivica Olic but the Croatian's touch 
              was heavy and Edwin van der Sar was out quick to block.</p>
              <p>Another 
              fabulous goal by Nani made it 3-0 four minutes before the break. 
              Valencia burst down the right and hit a low cross that Rooney allowed to
               run for Nani to drill with glorious precision into the roof of the net.</p>
              <p>It
               may have looked all over for Bayern but Olic secured a precious 
              lifeline two minutes later after Carrick was unable to deal with his 
              strength and the striker beat Van der Sar from a tight angle.</p>
              <p>Another
               goal for Bayern would put them ahead on away goals and only Van der 
              Sar's stunning save from Robben's curling shot prevented that happening.</p>
              <p>Rooney
               was last out of the tunnel for the second half and there were cheers of
               relief when he finally did emerge. It was Bayern who made the only 
              change, with Muller - who had been arguably their best player - making 
              way for Mario Gomez.</p>
              <p>There was a body blow for United five minutes
               into the second half when Rafael was given a second yellow card for 
              pulling back Franck Ribery. The young Brazilian could have little 
              complaint but looked disconsolate as he trudged off the pitch with head 
              bowed.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/07/article-1264293-090A6E34000005DC-180_468x286.jpg" alt="Nani " width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Second string: Nani puts United 2-0 up</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Badstuber was the next player cautioned after a late tackle on 
              Valencia who had given him a torrid evening.</p>
              <p>Rooney had been 
              looking increasingly laboured and it was little surprise when Ferguson 
              tried to shore up his team by bringing him off and sending John O'Shea 
              on for his first appearance since November.</p>
              <p>Bayern suddenly looked
               brimming with confidence however and Ribery hit a terrific volley that 
              Van der Sar managed to parry.</p>
              <p>Nani could have sealed it when put 
              through by Patrice Evra but Butt managed a one-handed save at his near 
              post and from the corner Carrick steered a chance<br>over.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/07/article-1264293-090A9821000005DC-104_468x260.jpg" alt="Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben" width="468" height="260">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Killer goal: Arjen Robben scores Bayern's second</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Gomez had United hearts in mouths with a flicked header that just 
              cleared the<br>crossbar.</p>
              <p>Schweinsteiger tested Van der Sar from 20
               yards before Gibson shot straight at the Bayern keeper when he should 
              have done better.</p>
              <p>It proved a telling moment as Bayern went down 
              the other end and scored to put themselves equal on aggregate but ahead 
              on away goals.</p>
              <p>Ribery's corner picked out the Dutch winger 
              unmarked on the edge of the box and he produced a technically-perfect 
              volley that flew into the corner of the net.</p>
              <p>Ferguson threw on 
              Berbatov and Ryan Giggs as a last roll of the dice, but it was Ribery 
              who nearly provided the grandstand finish with an exocet of a shot that 
              whistled past the post.</p>
              <p>A final half-chance for Nani drifted wide 
              and that was it as United were left to reflect on just how this one had 
              got away.</p>

              <p>When I watched nani score those 2 goals, my hair stood up to be honest. It was a confidence he never had when ronaldo was around. What a pity and united really deserved to lose cos they only had themselves to blame. I wouldn't credit bayern at all either.</p>
              <p>Let's examine the line-up, well I mean the midfield. Carrick was totally off form, he was casual on the ball, didn't hold on to it despite his strong and big size, was nudged off the ball before ivica olic scored the goal, was guilty for the second one as he lost posession in midfield which resulted in the eventual corner from ribery that led to robben's goal. Argh!!</p>
              <p>Darron Gibson was brilliant when outside the penalty box but then again, that's about it. He still lacks the creativity and ability to tackle. The first 20 minutes, man u played like champions, quick to close down, accurate passes, lively down the wings. After the 3 goals, they probably had a false sense of cushion and let bayern come at them. They lost it there.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't fault rafael if I were u pple. He was brilliant and his petulance was what many great players had down the years when they were young. Rooney had his fair share of red cards too. The one really to blame was the entire man u 11. And of course with the chief culprit, Carrick.</p>

              I've watched the entire match on mio tv last night and read all comments posted in this thread after kick off. Agree with most of the remarks on how Rafael cost united the tie, that bayern are undeserved winners, and that the manner of the defeat will be a bitter pill to swallow for most united fans.
              
              The saddest man from the united camp must be nani, who must have thought that he has carried his team through to the semis with his scoring heroics. Let's hope that this match provides him the experience and platform to become a better and more consistent player for united. I remember C.Ronaldo once said that he has the potential to become the 2nd best player in the world.
              
              Rafael cost his team the game, no doubt about it. But he's still young and this would be a very valuable lesson for him in his growing career. He will become a great full back (his ability to join in the attack is invaluable) for united in years to come and i look forward to see his growth in the team.
              
              I've seen comments here that put the blame on carrick for the first goal conceded to Bayern, but in the first place why is Carrick marking Olic (or being the nearest man to Olic) rather than the centre halves or other defenders? Where have they gone to? 
              
              Lastly, United once again proved in the 2nd half that without rooney, their attack are in shambles. They are not able to cope without rooney, yet. Hope the ankle injury wasn't too serious. Good luck to United for the remaining premiership matches and also all the best to Lyon in their Semis against the lucky germans.
