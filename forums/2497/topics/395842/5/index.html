              <h1>Sir Alex Ferguson lost his dignity after we beat United in Champions
               League slams Bayern chief Uli Hoeness<br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson was last night accused of being a sore loser in the
               wake of  Manchester United’s Champions League exit to Bayern
               Munich.</p>
              <p>The Reds manager reacted to Wednesday’s dramatic setback 
              at Old Trafford by accusing Bayern of being ‘typical Germans’ and 
              encouraging the match referee to send off Rafael da Silva early in the 
              second half.</p>
              <p>But Bayern president and German legend Uli Hoeness 
              told Ferguson to remember how the Bundesliga club reacted with dignity 
              after United beat them in the 1999 Champions League Final in Barcelona.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>A winner again: Sir Alex Ferguson celebrates his
               horse What A Friend's victory at Aintree </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Hoeness said: ‘We lost in 1999 but we lost like gentlemen. Now it 
              would be nice if Manchester could do the same. It’s an over-reaction on 
              Ferguson’s part, maybe because he is disappointed to lose.</p>
              <p>'What
               he has said is not right. We were honest and cool in Barcelona and they
               should be the same.’</p>
              <p>Ferguson got over his disappointment by 
              visiting Aintree yesterday. His horse What a Friend won the day’s big 
              race.</p>
              <p>But the fallout from Wednesday continued as the scorer 
              of the decisive goal, Arjen Robben, said United got off lightly.</p>
              <p>Robben,
               whom Fergie once tried to sign, said: ‘If anything there was a case for
               more yellow cards for United.’</p>
              <p>United are trying to get 
              Wayne Rooney fit for Sunday’s Barclays Premier League game at Blackburn,
               but the 24-year-old faces an uphill battle after a recurrence of his<br>ankle
               injury against Bayern.</p>
              <p>Rooney received treatment at United’s 
              Carrington training centre yesterday and although he is not on crutches 
              or wearing elaborate protection, he is unlikely to start<br>at Ewood 
              Park.</p>

              </div>
              <p>United midfielder Darren Fletcher last night accused Bayern players 
              of kicking Rooney’s weak ankle on purpose.</p>
              <p>Fletcher said: ‘I 
              think it was inevitable. People do different things to win a game. He 
              was targeted a little bit. There were a few tackles from behind but you 
              expect that. ‘It’s not war but it’s like that. Teams do what they can to
               win.’</p>

              <p>Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness has blasted <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> as the fallout from Wednesday 
              night's controversial Champions League clash continues.</p>
              <p>Furious Fergie claimed his side's quarter-final defeat was down to 
              'typical Germans' getting Rafael sent off for two yellow cards.</p>
              <p>But Hoeness told <em>The Sun</em>: "We lost in 1999 like gentlemen. Now 
              United should do the same."</p>
              <p>Ferguson claimed full-back Rafael only received a second yellow card for
               pulling back Franck Ribery because Bayern players surrounded Italian 
              ref Nicola Rizzoli.</p>
              <p>He also accused the Germans of targeting Wayne Rooney's bad ankle and 
              insisted United would have won comfortably with 11 players.</p>
              <p>Hoeness said: "It's an over reaction on his part maybe because he was 
              disappointed to lose.</p>
              <p>"Normally he is a fine gentleman but I think what he has said is not 
              right.</p>

              <p>1) BM lost like gentlemen?? hmm.. more like cry baby right? and they dun have much time to react actually on that lost... it's too shocking already... and those 2 ball nothing much to dispute on what..</p>
              <p>2) they did pressure the referee to give the 2nd card... and the referee was useless just give... it's a foul but not so bad.. especially he must remember the next one will be a red one....</p>
              <p>3) for those that got watch... BM player really seems like attacking rooney's leg alot at the start.....on purpose or not no one will know...</p>

              <p>to be really objective, SAF does sound like a sore loser.</p>
              <p>I guess he is trying to deflect the spotlight from Rafael/MU back to others.</p>

              <p>I think he is right. the german defenders targeted rooney right ankle all night, no doubt about it. only those who fouled rooney know what they were doing.</p>
              <p>the ref should have used common sense. that foul by rafael is not like tackle from behind or a crunching tackle. its just a nudge by rafael on ribery and its a freekick alright. the ref really spoiled the spectacle of the match really. just like the ref spoilt the CL 2006 final between arsenal and barcelona, when lehman was sent off so early in the match for handling the ball outside the penalty area. european refs really lacked common sense or the lack of it.</p>
