              <h3>ASHLEY Cole was busy taking his mind off his extranged wife Cheryl's brush with death yesterday - by partying into the early hours with a string of girls. </h3>
              <p>The love-cheat England and Chelsea star - on holiday in California - refused to answer questions from worried fans concerned about his ailing wife. Instead he carried on drinking and dancing, telling Los Angeles clubbers: "I'm having a great time!"</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Callous Cole, 29, bragged to an American reveller how he was loving his booze-fuelled break with pals.</strong> </p>
              <p>The footballer has spent much of this week enjoying the company of 20-year-old Sheffield party girls Melissa Naik and Ellie Hartley after England's World Cup debacle. </p>
              <p>But yesterday he showed his bully boy side as he SHOUTED at another customer at the trendy Les Deux nightclub in Hollywood. </p>
              <p>Flanked by an 18-stone bouncer, pint-sized Cole snarled: "Leave me and my girls alone or I'll put you in a brace!" </p>
              <p>And the worm's mates ordered bouncers to THROW OUT any clubbers he suspected were members of the media. </p>
              <p>The nasty scenes came just 24 hours after grinning Cole upset yet more fans by refusing to talk about Cheryl's condition. </p>
              <p>He'd emerged from his £450-a-night hotel at around 3pm, sunk frozen strawberry daiquiri cocktails at £10 a go and enjoyed a Japanese sushi dinner. </p>
              <p>As he strolled back with a grin on his face and lollipop in his mouth his mood suddenly changed when he was asked by a photographer how Cheryl was doing. And his hot-headed England pal Shaun Wright-Phillips angrily confronted the snapper for daring to ask. </p>
              <p>The mad-eyed Manchester City midfielder screamed: "Just shut the f*** up! Leave the f***er alone! What is wrong with you?" </p>
              <p>Cole's party-packed break started last Sunday when he was pictured cavorting with Wright Phillips' student pals Melissa and Ellie at a beach party. </p>
              <p>Later another brunette flashed her boobs at him during a night out at Guys and Dolls club in West Hollywood. </p>
              <p>And on Tuesday he was snapped gawping at Ellie and Melissa in their skimpy bikinis. </p>
              <p>Later we spotted him dancing in Les Deux surrounded by NINE women. One who danced close told us: "He was very giggly and flirty. He and his friends seemed very excited about heading off to party in Las Vegas." </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <h3>STRICKEN Cheryl Cole was just HOURS from death in her shock battle with malaria - and last night a close friend revealed: "She's not out of the woods yet." </h3>
              <p>The struggling X Factor judge is still on oxygen, on a drip and unable to talk as her brave fight against a deadly strain of the tropical disease continues in a top London private hospital this weekend. </p>
              <p>Last night Cheryl's close friend told us: "We nearly lost her and the battle is far from over. She is so weak and this horrible illness has taken complete hold of her. </p>
              <p>"It got so bad she was literally only hours from death's door. Thank goodness she was diagnosed in time. </p>
              <p>"Even now she can't talk. She drifts in and out of consciousness and when she comes round all she can do is sob. </p>
              <p>"There was no news coming out of the hospital because it was all so touch and go. We couldn't give any assurances to fans because there weren't any to give. </p>
              <p>"The fact is, we came close to losing someone very special. She can't even speak at the moment and doesn't know what's happening to her. All she can do is sob. It's terrifying. And there's no end in sight." </p>
              <p>Although Cheryl's malaria plight has been widely reported, almost no-one was aware of the near deadly consequences of her sickness. </p>
              <p>For the first time the News of the World is revealing the true extent of her illness - picked up on holiday in Tanzania with close friend Derek Hough three weeks ago. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheryl's condition is so serious that:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>HER SKIN and eyes have turned YELLOW with jaundice. </strong></li>
              <li><strong>HER BUDDY Derek has stayed constantly by her side. </strong></li>
              <li><strong>HER WORK schedule for next few months - including live shows and X Factor appearances - has been axed. </strong></li>
              <li><strong>HER FRIENDS are appalled that cheating ex-husband Ashley has not been in touch with even one word of sympathy or support.</strong> </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fans' hopes that Cheryl would make a quick recovery were raised on Friday when she was released from the specialist tropical diseases unit at London's University College Hospital and moved to a top private clinic nearby. </p>
              <p>But our source said the star was still seriously ill with the killer plasmodium falciparum strain of malaria and is expected to remain that way for some time. </p>
              <p>The jaundice is a common side- effect. And there are growing fears the disease - which can cause kidney failure, seizures and coma - could quickly return if weak Cheryl doesn't take care to recover properly.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Her worried pal said: "Seeing Cheryl like this is so painful. She could easily have died. And she's not better, she's not even close. It's still a very serious situation and she's really going to have to battle.</p>
