              <p><strong>Arsenal have joined the list of admirers of Ghanaian midfielder Anthony Annan following his recent trial with Blackburn.</strong></p>
              <p>The 22-year-old – currently playing for Norwegian side Stabaek on
              loan from IK Start – has been attracting interest from across Europe,
              with French and Spanish clubs as well as Italian side Milan being
              mentioned as potential suitors.</p>
              <p>Now IK Start sport and media director Svein Mathisen has revealed
              that The Gunners have invited the promising star to North London to see
              if he suits their ideals.</p>
              <p>“He is invited to Arsenal for training as well,” Mathisen was quoted
              as saying by VG Nett.”This is, however, poor timing as he has a game
              for Stabaek on Sunday.”</p>
              <p>It now remains to be seen whether Rovers will make an offer for the
              player, or if indeed he will travel to Emirates Stadium. Either way,
              Mathisen says his club have not received any firm offers for Annan yet.</p>
              <p>“No, we have not had any bids yet,” said Mathisen. “Currently, it is only agents who have enquired about prices.</p>
              <p>“We are demanding nothing though.</p>
              <p>“We are awaiting bids and will of course get as high a price as we can.”</p>

              <h1>Annan's Dream Move Would Be United</h1>
              <h2>IK Start’s in-demand Ghana midfield star Anthony Annan would jump at the chance to join Manchester United</h2>
              <p>Anthony Annan, who recently completed a trial with Blackburn Rovers,
              who were expected to sign him, has confirmed that Arsenal and Racing
              Santander are also in the race for his signature. But the 22-year-old
              says his dream move would be to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Annan is currently with Norwegian side IK Start. He had a trial with
              Blackburn and was set to sign for Rovers if they could agree a deal.</p>
              <p>But that was before several other clubs became alerted to Annan’s
              availability and joined the hunt to sign a player described as the new
              Essien.</p>
              <p>Annan was a Manchester United fan as a boy and although he is not
              aware of any approach from United, joining them would be his dream move.</p>
              <p>“I know that Racing Santander, Blackburn and Arsenal are interested,” he told fvn.no.</p>
              <p>“I have not heard anything about the United interest myself. I let my agent manage this.</p>
              <p>“United was my favourite club as a child. If I get the chance, it
              would be a dream for me. I cross my fingers that something will happen
              in the next days.”</p>
