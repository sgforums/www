Jose Mourinho addressed all of the contending teams in the EPL, including his own Blues side.<br><br>Never one to shy from over-the-top statements, Mourinho seemed to tone it down when speaking about the non-Anfield contenders, spreading praise around the top of the Premiership side in a way only he can.<br><br>Beginning with his own club, of course, he was not shy to say how good he thinks it is.<br><br>I believe Chelsea have the best players in the world - that's the way I work. To win is to be the best, and I will always believe in my team. Who should have won the Golden Boot last season? Didier Drogba.<br><br>On last year's champions, he was surprisingly complimentary when discussing their title win last season.<br><br>They are contenders for the title, of course. Sometimes last year, after Henrik Larsson had gone, they were playing with a lone striker, so they did their work well. They have two talents in Nani and Anderson, who will give them more options.<br><br>He also pointed out that Arsenal is a quiet contender following the loss of Thierry Henry.<br><br>No Thierry, but last season they had almost no Thierry. They have very good young players, mixed with some important ones: William Gallas, Gilberto, Robin van Persie, Emmanuel Adebayor. They are without pressure, and this can be in their favour.<br><br>The Chelsea skipper even took time to address what some believe is the fifth team to come to the EPL title party - Tottenham.<br><br>They have more England internationals than anybody, they have spent money, and they have kept all their best players - even Berbatov. Everyone said he was leaving, so with Berbatov staying, I think this shows what they want.<br><br>So now you know what Mourinho thinks heading into the new season.<br></div>
