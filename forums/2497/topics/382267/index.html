              <p><span class="byline">REUTERS 19 November 2009, 06:22am IST</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <p>PARIS: France captain Thierry Henry
              admitted he had handled the ball in the build-up to a controversial goal that
              sent France to the World Cup at</p>
              <p>the expense of Ireland on Wednesday.
              
              <br><br> Henry appeared to handle the ball twice before feeding defender
              William Gallas, who bundled home from close range on 103 minutes to give France
              a 1-1 draw in the return leg of their playoff and a 2-1 aggregate win.
              
              <br><br> The forward first stopped the ball from going out with his arm, then
              controlled it with his hand in a crowded penalty area and crossed for Gallas to
              give France the edge in extra time after they had struggled for most the game.</p>
              <p>"Yes, there is handball but I am not the referee," Henry said. "I'm
              in the box, there are two defenders in front of me. The ball bounced off my
              hand, the referee did not see it and I played on. 
              <br><br> "It doesn't change
              anything to the fact that I'm happy we have qualified. 
              <br><br> Ireland were
              devastated after missing out on the World Cup because of what coach Giovanni
              Trapattoni called a "great mistake" by Swedish referee Martin Hansson.
              
              <br><br> "I told the referee that it is possible to make great mistakes,"
              Trapattoni told a new conference after the game at Stade de France. "It is a
              bitter evening." 
              <br><br> Trapattoni said he felt the referee should have
              talked to his assistants and to Henry before awarding the goal. 
              <br><br> "I
              am sad because the referee had time to ask the linesman and I am sure he should
              have asked Henry as well," the Italian said. 
              <br><br> "All the European
              people saw the game and what happened. France played a good game in Dublin but
              this time we played better and over the two games we deserved to go to South
              Africa," Trapattoni added. 
              <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"> "NOT
              VALID" </span><br><br> France defender Sebastien Squillaci said he realised
              the decisive goal was not valid but said such incidents just had to be accepted.
              
              <br><br> "It's part of the game, it played in our favour tonight, maybe some
              other time it will play against us. 
              <br><br> "Of course Ireland will not he
              happy but we are happy the referee awarded the goal. We're competitors and we're
              there to win. The goal may not be valid but we'll take it." 
              <br><br> France,
              who won the first leg 1-0 at Croke Park on Saturday, indeed looked nervous and
              clumsy until the closing stages while Ireland kept pushing and had the better
              chances but were denied by a string of great saves by France keeper Hugo Lloris.
              
              <br><br> France coach Raymond Domenech, whose job was on the line, said he
              had not seen the controversial goal properly. 
              <br><br> "I didn't see the
              replay," he said. "From where I was, I couldn't see anything. All I know is the
              referee awarded the goal." 
              <br><br> Domenech, under heavy criticism since
              France's Euro 2008 flop, praised Ireland for a spirited display. 
              <br><br> "I
              would like to pay tribute to the Ireland team and to their fans," he said. "It
              is regrettable in a way that they did not qualify because they would have
              deserved to go to the World Cup"</p>

              <p>I would have far rather seen France not go into this World Cup than to qualify via such a disgraceful manner.</p>
              <p>This is not the France that were the heroes of 1998.</p>
              <p>What really disgusts me is Henry's apparently nonchalant attitude over the handball.... the message he's sending is that if you can cheat and get away with it, then you should cheat.</p>

              <p><br><br>France 1 Rep of Ire 1 - (aet; France win 2-1 on agg)</p>
              <p> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">FURIOUS Ireland branded Thierry Henry a cheat, after Le Hand of God sent France to the World Cup. </h2>
              <p class="article">The Arsenal legend did a Maradona by <strong>TWICE</strong> using his hand to set up William Gallas' extra-time clincher. </p>
              <p class="article">Even Henry admitted: "The ball hit my hand and, I will be honest, it was a handball. "I played it, the ref allowed it. It would have been better to do it another way, but I am not the ref." </p>
              <p class="article">Irish defender Richard Dunne, asked if Henry had cheated, replied: "I think it is quite blatant that he did. It's not even a hard decision." </p>
              <p class="article">Striker Kevin Doyle raged: "It is sickening. I am sure Henry did not expect to get away with it because it was so obvious. "The linesman had the best view, apart from Shay Given. </p>
              <p class="article">"It is difficult. We are all gutted. You do not blame the player if he can get away with it. It's nearly a natural reaction." </p>
              <p class="article">Centre-back Sean St Ledger rapped: "We feel cheated. It has cost a lot of us our dreams. As a boy, I used to dream of playing in the World Cup finals and now I will not." </p>
              <p class="article">The goal echoed Diego Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' goal for Argentina against England at the 1986 World Cup. </p>
              <p class="article">Irish boss Giovanni Trapattoni said: "All of Europe saw what happened. I am sure if the referee had asked Henry, he would have admitted to the handball. </p>
              <p class="article">"I would prefer to go out on penalties than this." Robbie Keane's first-half strike cancelled out France's 1-0 first-leg lead and forced the qualifying play-off into extra-time. </p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal defender Gallas said of his decisive strike: "It happened so quickly. I received the ball from Thierry but I couldn't see if it hit his hand." </p>
              <p class="article">France boss Raymond Domen- ech said: "It was miraculous."</p>

              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><strong>Millions last night saw one of the world's most famous players callously control the ball with his hand to rob the Republic of Ireland of their rightful place in the World Cup finals. It was as blatant as it was repulsive — and Henry is certain to pay a heavy price for his moment of insanity.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Instead of being fondly respected for his legendary skills, the former Arsenal striker will be forever branded with the one word that probably appals him more than any other. Cheat. </p>
              <p class="article">Just like that other one — Diego Maradona.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Remember Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' goal, which knocked out England in Mexico in 1986? Of course you do. Well, this was every bit as bad. Henry is now the cheat who has handed Les Bleus a ticket to South Africa they did not deserve. And, because of that, he is going to start hearing people say the words Maradona and Henry in the same sentence — the World Cup cheats. </p>
              <p class="article">The Barcelona star clearly used his hand to control a long free-kick in extra-time before squaring for William Gallas to head in. Shay Given and his Irish team-mates all saw it. In fact, everyone did apart from Swedish referee Martin Hansson, who was chased all round the Stade de France, and the relevant linesman. </p>
              <p class="article">Henry, though, shamelessly ran off to celebrate with Gallas. Surely it is inconceivable he will be able to look at himself in the mirror this morning. </p>
              <p class="article">Irish eyes will certainly not be smiling today, or any time soon, and the bad taste will take a long time to go away. </p>
              <p class="article">They have every right to feel robbed and this will go down as one of the great travesties of international football.</p>
              <p class="article"> France, not Ireland, will be in South Africa next June - and unpopular French coach Raymond Domenech has probably been saved from the guillotine.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet it should have been the magnificent Irish marching through, after they dominated normal time and took a first-half lead through Robbie Keane. </p>
              <p class="article">They will just be kicking themselves for wasting a host of second-half chances to kill off the tie and kick out the 1998 winners. Keane, Damien Duff and John O'Shea all had golden opportunities to book Ireland's ticket to the biggest show on earth. But it was not to be and they crashed out in disgraceful circumstances. </p>
              <p class="article">Ireland dampened the home team's confidence with an impressive start, as Keane and Kevin Doyle missed early opportunities. But the away goal the fabulous Ireland followers dreamed of arrived on 33 minutes, after Kevin Kilbane - winning a record-equalling 102nd cap — fed Duff down the left. </p>
              <p class="article">He pulled the ball back for Keane, who slotted past Hugo Lloris to send Giovanni Trapattoni's men into wild celebrations. The Tottenham hitman had promised there would be another twist to the tale and things could have got better still within a minute of the restart.</p>
              <p class="article">Liam Lawrence floated over a free-kick and full-back O'Shea was left completely unmarked at the back post only to volley over. Trap must have been wondering if his team would get a better chance but they did when Duff was sent racing clear by Doyle.</p>
              <p class="article">The Fulham winger was clean through with just Lloris to beat, yet the keeper saved with his legs and Ireland had wasted another brilliant opening.</p>
              <p class="article">France broke quickly and Henry shook off Richard Dunne before seeing his shot from a narrow angle saved by Given.</p>
              <p class="article">Soon after that, Nicolas Anelka glanced a header wide from Bacary Sagna's cross. But Ireland threatened again as another pass from Doyle put Keane away. He skipped round Lloris but his touch was too heavy and he ran the ball behind.</p>
              <p class="article">Lassana Diarra then gifted Keane the ball in the 90th minute, only for Ireland's skipper to blast his shot high over when he had more time than he realised.</p>
              <p class="article">Into extra-time it went and, with the possibility of penalties looming, France could well have been awarded a spot-kick. Anelka raced clear down the right before seeming to be upended by Given. Ref Hansson gave a goal-kick. </p>
              <p class="article">The French were furious but laughing their heads off soon after as Hansson allowed the shocking decider to stand. Irish stars like Duff were clearly distraught. And after that, Trap's heroes had no way back.</p>
