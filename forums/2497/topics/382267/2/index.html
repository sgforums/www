              <p>well, quite harsh comments..</p>
              <p>from what I seen from henry over the years, he is not like that.</p>
              <p>I think it was purely concidentally that it happens, and in that split second, he reacted. I don't think he went with the mindset to cheat.</p>
              <p>He has won almost everything so.. maybe, we should not be so quick to judge.</p>

              <p>Though many belief Barce is already looking for a new striker (Robinho) to replace Henry... But I feel after this incident, Thierry Henry can never come back to England to play normally ever again...</p>
              <p>He will always be branded a cheat by the British Press. Whatever great work he had done over the years at Arsenal before last night... I am afraid will all be wipe out and be replaced with his one moment of deceit...</p>
              <p>Its an unfortunate way to be remembered for a good player coming to the end of his career but as they say, since he made his bed, he should now lie in it... And I feel he not only brought shame upon himself with his dishonest act, but unfortunately to his whole nation whom many now feel is undeserving of a place in SA let alone win it.</p>

              <p>why everybody say that Ireland cheated out of World Cup slot? Even if France never score I think would have gone to penalty shootout? And seeing how unsteady the Irish shooters are (from the match miss so many open goals) I think France would still have gone in.</p>
              <p>Anyway karma will come back. France will be eliminated in the first round. hopefully by an opponent also hand ball inside. The way they play is really CMI already.

              <p><br>this is not a question of ireland qualifying. it is a question of fairplay. if france go on and score thru a legitimate goal or via penalties, then all is happy.</p>
              <p>some absolved henri's blame, but i think he is the equal guilty party here. a player of his stature cannot state that he will commit the offence and let the referee decides. this is a blatant disregard to the rules of the game. fifa should ban him from the WC for bringing the game to disrepute.</p>
              <p>if one remembers the eccentric paolo di canio during his west ham days, he abruptly stopped play twice during games. one was due to an everton goalkeeper pulling a hamstring during the game. instead to scoring an easy goal, he picked up the ball so the keeper could get medical attention. on another game, he `over-ruled' a referee's decision to give a penalty in his favor because he didn't deem that he was fouled by his opponent. for his former heroics, he was given fifa's fairplay award.</p>
              <p>as for henri, he will now be remembered for this instead of his scoring exploits. as the french captain, he disgraced his country.</p>
              <p>fifa should ordered a replay as the irish has requested. at least if france win, they can go to south africa fair and square with pride intact.</p>
              <p>if not, i hope a small irish contingent can make the trip to johannesburg during the WC and unfurled a banner during france's first game that reads, "YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE. YOU DIDN'T EARN IT'.</p>

              <p>It's not so much about whether or not France would have qualified. It's all about <em>how </em>France would have qualified.</p>
              <p>If the game had gone to penalty shootout and France won because of it, then no one would be complaining. The French team would have qualified fair and square, and no one will be disputing anything.</p>
              <p>Reading Henry's comments, the message I get is 'It's okay to cheat, so long as the referee doesn't see it'.</p>
              <p>Seriously, go and die, Henry. He used to be one of the players I respected the most. France used to be one of the teams I would watch at international competitions. I would have far rather that France not have qualified at all, than to have qualified in such a pathetic way by depending on cheating.</p>
