              <p>If it had then gone to penalty shootouts, and Ireland won, then..... perhaps. 1x blanket party after lights off, at least. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>the world is now a cynical mess.. few care for fair play because the result is the be-all and end-all of everything..</p>
              <p>which is why the world is a mess..</p>
              <p>and there is diving in football..</p>
              <p>and there is ball-tampering in cricket..</p>
              <p>and there is steriod abuse in the locker room..</p>
              <p>even Fowler when he tried to refuse the penalty for the incident, his coach was close to admonishing him for not shutting up..</p>
              <p>so there..</p>
              <p>sometimes, all this makes me want to stop watching sports</p>

              <p>people are over-reacting.</p>
              <p>I don't see such a big reaction for any diving or simulation or shoving that happens. It's the same offence. I don't see people complain that a defender didn't protest/clarify to the referee that it wasn't an offside when the wrong call is made. It is still cheating to win in different forms.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying it is right to cheat. But why are you only complaining so violently about henry doing it and not the 1001 other footballers doing similar things? I don't see the divers being called  a national disgrace or demands for replays for that.</p>

              <p>Nay, I'm saying they should get as worked up over all forms of cheating and not this one alone. Not that they should just accept it as part of the game.</p>
              <p>There should be consistency in their reaction. They should not condone the general cheating and then come along to blast 1 specific act.</p>
