His successor, who leads the side into the Carling Cup against Leicester City tonight, has made it clear that no such group exists at the club now. "I only know about the movie Untouchables, it is a great movie, I saw it three times," he said. "The only people who are guaranteed a place here are those who play good."<br><br>Grant, though, said that he will rotate his squad in order to keep them fresh for all four competitions they are playing in. That will mean more time away from the pitch from Shaun Wright-Phillips who has not taken part in Chelsea's last two matches, the 2-0 Champions League win against Schalke and the 6-0 thrashing of Manchester City.<br><br>Wright-Phillips had become a regular under Mourinho and the England winger was deeply upset at losing his place. "What is important is Shaun Wright- Phillips attitude on and off the pitch," said Grant. "I want him to be happy, but I don't think I can make everyone happy.<br><br>"I can't make everyone happy unless I play with one team in the first half and a different one in the second. All the players knew before they signed that Chelsea has a big squad and that they will not play all the time. But we pay their wages and we want them to make a contribution to the team. If there is a problem players now know that they can knock on my door and we will try and find a solution."<br><br>Grant refused to say if Wright-Phillips will appear in the match against Leicester at Stamford Bridge tonight. There will be changes, however, with Carlo Cudicini expected to replace Cech in goal.<br><br></div>
