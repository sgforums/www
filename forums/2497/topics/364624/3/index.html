              <p class="caption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Rafael Benítez</strong></span><strong> has defended his decision to pay over the odds for the right-back Glen Johnson, even though the </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><strong> manager admitted the deal has cost him more than he had hoped.</strong></p>
              <p>Johnson yesterday agreed to move from <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/portsmouth"><span style="color: #005689;">Portsmouth</span></a> to Anfield and he is expected to sign a contract in the next couple of days. Reports suggest the transfer is costing £17m, although much of that will be written off because of money still owed by Pompey after Peter Crouch's move to Fratton Park last summer.</p>
              <p>Chelsea tried to take their former player back to Stamford Bridge but Benítez was always confident the England international would choose Anfield — even if it was at a premium.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes you have to spend a little bit more," said the Liverpool manager. "You can't compete in the top four of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> unless you spend some money.</p>
              <p>"We were looking for a player of quality and also somebody who is British because of the new Champions League rules. Glen Johnson fits both categories."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2009/1/9/1231543767897/Rafa-Benitez-002.jpg" alt="Rafa Benitez" width="300" height="180"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Benítez has criticised the Uefa rule that says clubs must have at least eight home-grown players in their squads for all Champions League games.</strong></p>
              <p>The rule specifies that clubs can have a maximum of 25 players and that eight of them must be home-grown – defined as someone who was trained for over three years by a club from the relevant national association between the ages of 15 and 21.</p>
              <p>The fact that Benítez has been able to make his first summer signing will help fend off claims the club are in financial trouble.</p>
              <p>Kop Holdings, the club's parent company, posted a £42.6m loss in the year to August 2008 but concerns over the £350m loan taken out by the American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett to buy Liverpool appear to have lessened after reports today suggested that a refinancing package had been agreed.</p>
              <p>Benítez is confident he will make other signings, although he may spend more of his time trying to hang on to the likes of Xabi Alonso, Alvaro Arbeloa and Javier Mascherano who have all been linked with moves to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid"><span style="color: #005689;">Real Madrid</span></a> and Barcelona.</p>
              <p>"We have a plan. We can sign one more player if necessary, but that's without any players leaving," he told the Liverpool Echo.</p>
              <p>"Alvaro Arbeloa has had a very good season but he has one year left on his contract. If he signs that will be good because we will have more competition, but if we get a good offer we will have to consider it."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Real Madrid still hope to prise the Spanish midfielder Alonso away from Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Real's director general, Jorge Valdano, told the sports daily As: "We have possibilities there but I don't want to say anything that will make the negotiation more difficult. We will wait a reasonable amount of time."</p>
