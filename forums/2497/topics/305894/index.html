              <p><strong>ROME (AFP) - AC Milan players have rallied behind team-mate Alberto Gilardino ahead of Wednesday's trip to lowly Reggina.<br></strong> <br> Gilardino looked a disconsolate figure on Sunday when he spent the
              entire match against Genoa on the bench, even suffering the ignominy of
              stripping off and waiting on the touchline only to be told at the last
              moment that Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti had changed his mind and would
              not be introducing him to the fray.<br> <br> A lot has been made of Gilardino's dissatisfaction in the Italian
              press with some suggesting his days at Milan are numbered.<br> <br> But his team-mates have jumped to his defence, including injured
              forward Filippo Inzaghi, who himself has often faced long spells on the
              bench.<br> <br> "I would advise Gilardino to stay, he knows what I think," Pippo
              told Sky Sport. "He and I are great friends, also off the pitch.<br> <br> "He and Pato are the future of Milan and they will make us dream.
              Sometimes you have to have hard times, I had them too when I was at
              Juventus.<br> <br> "Despite scoring in one match I could find myself on the bench the next game.<br> <br> "He has to believe in his potential and know that everyone wants him to succeed.<br> <br> "No one is happy sitting on the bench, it's normal to feel angry, but always in the right way.<br> <br> "He has played his part, he has the numbers (good goal-scoring
              record), he doesn't have anything to prove to anyone, he should stay
              and I'm sure he will."<br> <br> Gilardino came off the bench 10 days ago to score a vital
              injury-time winner against Udinese and followed that up a week ago by
              starting against Atalanta.<br> <br> But he failed to shine and did not even get off the bench against Genoa.<br> <br> One reason for that is the fine form of new teenage striker Pato,
              who has bagged three goals in his first four games for the club,
              including both goals in the 2-0 win over Genoa on Sunday.<br> <br> He is likely to get the nod again on Wednesday as Milan try to
              take another step closer to their ultimate goal of finishing fourth by
              winning one of their two remaining games in hand.<br> <br> They will have to do so without Brazilian forward Ronaldo once
              again as he is still suffering from a muscle problem in his leg, his
              third different leg injury this season.<br> <br> "At this moment in time, if I can I will try to be ready for the
              match next weekend against Fiorentina," said 'Il Fenomeno'.<br> <br> "I hope this will be the case because in this period we have many
              important matches and Milan needs everyone and I want to be ready to
              play."<br> <br> Ronaldo also had some words of encouragement for Gilardino.<br> <br> "Anyone can have good or bad times but we always have to remember
              that the important thing is the good of the team," he added. <br> <br> "Milan started the season really badly and now we're trying to
              recover, with the help of everyone, also with Gilardino's help who came
              on to score the winner against Udinese."<br> <br> A win would see Milan move above Sampdoria into sixth place and
              close to within three points of fifth-placed Udinese.<br> <br> Reggina could put some daylight between themselves and the relegation zone if they pick up the three points.</p>

              <p>Gilardino scored the only goal of the game to put us 1-0 above Reggina taking back the 3 points with us before our visit to Florence this weekend.</p>
              <p>He has been bringing home all the away points for us and I don't see why people should disregard him as a Milan player.</p>
