              <p>By Harry Harris, Football Correspondent</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Intermediaries have put together a world record £100 million "package" deal to take Argentine international superkid <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=44927&amp;cc=4716">Sergio Agüero</a> to Chelsea in the January transfer window.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2009/1105/sergioaguerocelebvcfc20091103_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Sergio Aguero celebrates against Chelsea" width="275" height="155">

              <p class="photoDesc">Sergio Aguero rose to the occasion in scoring a brace against Chelsea in a recent Champions League encounter</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The £100 million includes the player's salary which will be scaled up
              to reach nearly £250,000-a-week in the final years of the proposed
              Chelsea playing contract, the £40 million transfer plus near-£10m
              add-ons related to Chelsea's success, meaning a near £50 million
              transfer fee, with added agents' fees.</p>
              <p>The
              21-year-old Atlético Madrid striker Sergio Leonel Agüero del Castillo,
              has privately indicated "yes" to a move that will make him one of the
              highest paid players in the world, with a transfer fee that will smash
              the British record of £32.5m for Robinho by some distance.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              almost signed the boy who is engaged to Diego Maradona's daughter,
              Giannina, with whom he has a son, in the summer, but the deal broke
              down over the players £6m-a-year wage demands on top of Atletico
              demanding a £60m transfer fee.</p>
              <p>However Chelsea know they have to
              meet the player's wage demands to make a spectacular signing in the
              January window while their FIFA ban is still suspended.</p>
              <p>Talks
              have been on-going for several weeks between a host of middlemen intent
              on making the deal happen, and there is now room for optimism that it
              will advance sufficiently in the next four weeks to be in a position
              for the move to take place in January.</p>
              <p>ESPNsoccernet has been
              told by one of the insiders involved with the deal that there is far
              more flexibility on all sides than there was been in the summer when
              the deal broke down.</p>
              <p>My source revealed: "There is still more
              talking to do, but let's see. There is now a possibility, although with
              so many complications involved you would have to say its still 50-50
              whether it will finally go though."</p>
              <p>Chelsea are keen to capture
              one of the best young players in world football at a time when their
              transfer ban has been suspended pending a FIFA hearing. They urgently
              need to make significant signings at a time when the big clubs usually
              only make interim moves and wait for the summer.</p>
              <p>Roman Abramovich
              cannot take the risk of waiting until the end of the season in case
              Chelsea are banned from making any signings, so needs to act now, and
              intermediaries have stepped up the process of attempting to bring
              Aguero to the Bridge.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are not as reluctant to invest in
              Agüero's salary as much as they are about Atletico's asking price of
              £60 million, which has dropped to £55 million. Talks are aimed at
              trying to get the fee below £50 million and closer to £40 million.</p>
              <p>A
              compromise of money offered up in relation to Chelsea's success is the
              logical route to resolve the differences in the transfer fee valuation.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              would be prepared to hit the £50 million mark, if it included add-ons
              related to success, given that Real Madrid paid £80 million for
              Ronaldo, and the Argentine is a few years younger.</p>
              <p>Chelsea would
              ideally like to sign Aguero for six years, but five years is normally
              regarded as a long-term deal, but as the player is so young at 21, they
              be might be able to stretch to six years or more, even if the final
              years are optional.</p>
              <p>While Chelsea might start to pay the
              youngster £6 million-a-year, that will rise quickly to £10 million and
              that will go even higher in the final year of his deal.</p>
              <p>Overall,
              including bonuses, and given Chelsea's propensity for silverware, he
              can realistically expect to yield £50 million from his personal terms
              and image rights, to add to the near £50 million transfer fee, totally
              an eye watering £100 mllion.</p>
              <p>The player's agent Bruno Satin, head
              of the football division of IMG, one of the world's biggest sports
              agencies, based in Chiswick in London, is one of a number of agents
              working on negotiating an acceptable fee with Athletico.</p>
              <p>A
              transfer of £40 million plus a near £10 million add ons based on
              Chelsea's success during the duration of the players contract would be
              one of the biggest deals in world football. The entire financial
              package won't be far short of the Real Madrid deals for Kaka and
              Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>My source added: "Money was the problem the
              deal fell through in the summer, and the money is the problem now, but
              we shall see, as I said, the talks are on going and everyone seems to
              want to find a solution."</p>
              <p>Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti has
              targeted Agüero as his only major signing during the January transfer
              window. The club have been given permission to buy and sell after the
              Fifa-imposed transfer ban, following the Gaël Kakuta affair, was frozen
              pending an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
              <p>Agüero
              scored two spectacular goals during the recent 2-2 draw with Chelsea in
              the Champions League. After the match Ancelotti joked that
              he would like to sign the exciting striker. But before that
              Ancelotti admitted Chelsea have been "monitoring" this player for some
              time.</p>
              <p>Chelsea
              also remain interested in Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery, who would
              command a similar hefty investment in fees and salaries, and who is
              also greatly admired by Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>But my source indicates that
              Ribery will be hard, if not impossible, to prise from Bayern in
              January, but will be a far more realistic target in the summer, if
              Chelsea win their appeal with FIFA. Chelsea's determination to secure
              the Aguero deal as they are aware that if their CAS appeal fails, they
              cannot make another signing for some time.</p>
              <p>Agüero will not be
              eligible for Chelsea in the Champions League this season, having
              already played for Atlético, but Abramovich wants to win back the
              Premier League title from Manchester United, and the club are concerned
              about losing Didier Drogba and Solomon Kalou to the African Nations in
              January.</p>
              <p>At 15 years and 35 days Aguero beat Maradona's record as
              the youngest player to make debut in Argentinean top flight. In May
              2006, he joined Atlético Madrid for £16m.</p>
              <p>He lost his place in
              the Argentine attack during the chaotic final stages of qualification,
              and needs to be playing at the highest level to play in the World Cup
              finals in South Africa, rather than with struggling Athletico, a factor
              that Maradona has made clear to him, and one of the reasons the player
              is keen to move to the Bridge.</p>
