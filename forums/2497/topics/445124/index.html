              <p>This is ridiculous, she talk to his friend and he gets angry and hit her and now he walks away a free man while his ex-gf, the mother of his child ends up getting arrested instead.</p>
              <p>The law looked away cos he is the town's (Middlesbrough) only famous son so they let him go? Same as Gerrard, he lead his group of 6 and smashed a bottle onto a DJ's head cos he won't allow him to sing and he walks free while his 5 friends go to prison. Weird, where is the justice?</p>
