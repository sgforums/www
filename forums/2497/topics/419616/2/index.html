              another small time one as well but the guy said he had 'big club'
              experienced with Inter... And I pointed out he was in charge of an
              Inter side that wasn't successful, meaning a mid table club 'big
              club' as well and not a recently improved reputation
              Inter side after Jose Mourinho...</p>

              Inter started winning league titles under Roberto Mancini. When Mourinho took over, they have already won consecutive league titles, but he did led them to European success.

              <p>"why would this Andre see Pool as a step-up from Porto?"</p>
              <p>This is quite true. Not to be sound arrogant...but if you
              are a football manager, would you like to manage
              Liverpool or Porto? Now at least the club management has
              stabilised, Liverpool can attract more candidates for the job liao.
              Andre is a very young coach, only 33 or 34 years old but has been
              impressive so far although not in the toughest league like
              EPL...although he worked as Mourinho's assistant prior to that.
              Just my opinion.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>not to offend, but if I am not wrong, one player scouted by Pool did make the comment on why he should step down and join pool, hence I quoted from there.</p>
              <p>well, if I am a young manager, looking for some silverware to add to my resume, I won't choose Pool. This legacy club, with its rich history, suffocates, a youth development that needs a massive job, plus, i am not sure how the new owners would work out, in a tough league that is already dominate with rich clubs and I have to turn the club around with only 2 superstars fast. It may be a big challenge, but it may most likely break me.. It is not a place where my name will be most likely added to the has-beens.. so I rather walk alone.</p>

              <p>i think it is wrong to say liverpool doesnt have money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IN fact during rafa times, he spent alot of money, almost comparable to man utd who spent to wrestle the title back from chelsea. But look at liverpool. who did they buy? they probably bought 30+ players all over the continent and what happen? besides torres, alonso, maybe mascherano, reina...all are flops.</p>
              <p>at the sametime, teams like arsenal, are spending less but remain in UCL year after year for restructure knowing this is gona be a billionaire market.</p>
              <p>liverpool problems</p>
              <p>1. management problem. they should start focus attention on youth rather pure buying from market. when money is dry, they simply can buy and no youth to back up. can you name any youth coming from liverpool academy recently and playing for liverpool now?</p>
              <p>2. wrong manager. rafa simply make too many bad signing. he should have left years before . instead they retain him and make good liverpool wonder what wrong with this guy. benayoun once said, even if i play well, he dont play him. babel once touted as new henry, simply lost all his confidence at liverpool, now become a bit part player who could not play for holland.</p>
              <p>at the sametime, he sold player like peter crouch, robbie keane who could have been impact players and offer more attacking option than ngog. besides torres, what stiker do you have?</p>
              <p>3. fans, be realistic, ousting hogson would not solve your problems. with all the players available at your disposal, you are mid table team. </p>
              <p>liverpool is a team that has done total wrong!!</p>

              <p>well, if I am a young manager, looking for some silverware to
              add to my resume, I won't choose Pool. This legacy club, with its
              rich history, suffocates, a youth development that needs a massive
              job, plus, i am not sure how the new owners would work out, in a
              tough league that is already dominate with rich clubs and I have to
              turn the club around with only 2 superstars fast. It may be a big
              challenge, but it may most likely break me.. It is not a place
              where my name will be most likely added to the has-beens.. so I
              rather walk alone.</p>

Curbishley was credited for the revival of a club's fortunes and took an unfancied Charlton on a double promotion and into the Premier league on a low budget if you are not aware of... Just like what Roy achieved last season with Fulham... Cos these clubs are not expected to do that well especially in Europe. So all the more it was remarkable in its own right...</p>
              <p>I suggest you read up on how they came about being honoured by their fellow peers before questioning them as George Burnley (who?) in '01 cos for your info... He was also the FA Manager of the year on that same year if you must know. It kind of make one feel or at least looked silly didn't it?</p>

              <p>depending on how you look at it, he could have 4 good seasons (roy had 1 good season with fulham) or he took leicester to 'the next level' - from avoiding relegation to cementing a place in the top half of the table - this is why many (including myself) rated o'neill higher</p>

              <p><br>Wow... That's many years of failing isn't it? And finally out of the top 4 despite spending more than Fergie and most other managers like Wenger... If you are still not aware, under Rafa, Pool was reported to have the biggest squad. 69 if I am not wrong... But what good was it? One thing for sure, they took up more funds to unkeep i belief...</p>
              <p>Look, no one is trying to justify Roy here ok... All is being said is the way he was treated and only given 6 months to pull a sinking ship out of the water... Like I already said earlier, I already questioned his credential long before this with a Pool fan here... But it is still a fact that he is the Current Manager of the Year, Pool did poached him from another club while he was still under contract and had to pay a compensation... No?</p>
              <p>Then for someone who seems not to know what the LMA meant, belittled it to some magazines/websites/associations (like those run by reporters and fans) and questioned a winner not knowing this same manager was also the winner of his (better) FA version... It's just so silly...</p>
              <p>What i want to say is the Pool fans treated Roy badly, he didn't get the support he needed... 6 months is just too short a time to turn the club around... When I mention support, we can see for ourselves... If Kenny continue this poor form, the fans won't blame him, He can even lose at Old Trafford playing poorly and the fans will find excuses for him. Hell Kenny can take them to the Championship League and the fans will still find someone else to blame for their problems... There was an acticle i read which i thought was very well suited to the current Liverpool situation... Maybe I will post it here later...</p>

              <p>Look, no one is trying to justify Roy here ok... All is being
              said is the way he was treated and only given 6 months to pull a
              sinking ship out of the water... Like I already said earlier, I
              already questioned his credential long before this with a Pool fan
              here... But it is still a fact that he is the Current Manager of
              the Year, Pool did poached him from another club while he was still
              under contract and had to pay a compensation... No?</p>
              <p>Then for someone who seems not to know what the LMA meant,
              belittled it to some magazines/websites/associations (like those
              run by reporters and fans) and questioned a winner not knowing
              this same manager was also the winner of his (better) FA version...
              It's just so silly...</p>
              <p>What i want to say is the Pool fans treated Roy badly, he didn't
              get the support he needed... 6 months is just too short a time to
              turn the club around... When I mention support, we can see for
              ourselves... If Kenny continue this poor form, the fans won't blame
              him, He can even lose at Old Trafford playing poorly and the fans
              will find excuses for him. Hell Kenny can take them to the
              Championship League and the fans will still find someone else to
              blame for their problems... There was an acticle i read which i
              thought was very well suited to the current Liverpool
              situation... Maybe I will post it here later...</p>

              <p>my argument is that roy caused the sinking ship =P</p>
              <p>or to put it another way, many would rate jose as a good manager (i think he's a cunt though), but not many would expect him to do good at a club void of funds and fighting relegation battles</p>
              <p>the inverse is also true for managers like roy &amp; mclaren</p>

              <p><br>Hahaha... The term 'sinking ship' was used by one of Rafa's very own player he brought in... Who, you will need to find out for yourself... He said he wanted to get out of the "sinking ship" referring to Liverpool the club he was at during the time he was still there and Rafa was still in charged... To be precise last season actually... 7th place remember?</p>
              <p>And since you said Liverpool are a top club, a 3rd, 3rd, 4th &amp; 2nd finish should still be ok but 7th and out of the CL after being given so much time and money there?</p>
              <p>See what happen to Inter... Roy didn't had much to work with Rafa had the current European champions squad of players to work with and yet... What happen? lol...</p>
              <p>I don't even know if other Pool fans can agree with you on this... So many said Rafa had to go before the end of last season...</p>
