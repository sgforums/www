              <p class="first"> </p>
              <p class="first"><strong>Two goals from Benjani heaped more pressure on under-fire Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson as his side were comprehensively beaten at Ewood Park.</strong></p>
              <p>Blackburn struck first, Martin Olsson coolly driving through Pepe Reina's legs before Benjani smashed a second. And Rovers drove on against hapless Liverpool, Benjani tapping in a close-range third after David Hoilett's run.</p>
              <p>Steven Gerrard managed a consolation goal but then blazed a penalty over the bar with six minutes to go.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Liverpool's failure to string a run of results together this season has put Hodgson, whose side have only won once on the road, under significant pressure.</p>
              <p>The Englishman came under heavy fire after losing to Wolves over Christmas but their subsequent 2-1 win over Bolton appeared to have bought him some time.</p>
              <p>However, this will rank amongst one of Liverpool's worst setbacks this season, along with the 3-1 loss against Newcastle, and 2-0 defeats by Stoke and Everton, and it is difficult to see how he will be able to avoid more negative headlines after a disastrously below-par display which will leave the doom mongers sharpening their knives.</p>
              <p>It could have been so different, had Liverpool built on a promising opening five minutes during which Fernando Torres headed wide after a clever one-two with Paul Konchesky.</p>
              <p>But inconsistency has dogged both these mid-table sides this season, with each starting the game on 25 points. And Liverpool showed their incredibly flaky nature by losing their momentum almost immediately.</p>
              <p>Blackburn boss Steve Kean has also been under pressure after replacing Sam Allardyce, who was fired by Venky's, the club's new owners.</p>
              <p>But despite that sacking and a seemingly failed bid for Brazilian star Ronaldinho this week, there is an air of optimism beginning to circle around Ewood Park, with talk of big money being made available by their Indian owners.</p>
              <p>And the players fed off that, showing constant endeavour and creating a series of chances on the counter attack.</p>
              <p>Mame Diouf had the best of these when Olsson's wicked cross flashed beyond Martin Skrtel but it took the striker by surprise and he could only shin the ball into the hands of Pepe Reina.</p>
              <p>Even with Gerrard, Torres and Joe Cole in the starting line-up, Liverpool attacks were in short supply and Rovers took a deserved lead on the half-hour mark.</p>
              <p>Ryan Nelsen's long ball found Diouf who played in the overlapping Olsson and the Swede drove his finish through the legs of Reina.</p>
              <p>And Blackburn heaped more misery on Liverpool before half-time when Benjani picked up the ball inside the box, spun Sotirios Kyrgiakos expertly and smashed a fierce effort past Reina and into the roof of the net.</p>
              <p>Hodgson looked on crestfallen from the sidelines, with his hands planted in his coat pockets and that was a mood echoed by his players' body language on the pitch.</p>
              <p>Almost inevitably, Benjani, who had only scored one goal this season before the start of the match, made it 3-0 on 56 minutes.</p>
              <p>Hoilett skinned Martin Skrtel as he hit the bye-line and broke into the box before squaring to Benjani who tapped into the net easily to leave the crowd cruelly singing: "you're getting sacked in the morning" in the direction of Hodgson.</p>
              <p>Liverpool did manage to dominate possession in the second half but that was primarily a product of Blackburn sitting back on their healthy lead and relying on the superb centre-back partnership of Nelsen and Christopher Samba, who Rovers will be desperately keen to keep at Ewood Park.</p>
              <p>Joe Cole's 25-yard drive was well saved by Mark Bunn as Liverpool finally fired a warning shot.</p>
              <p>And they did pull one back when Gerrard, playing his 550th game for Liverpool, lashed into the corner from close range.</p>
              <p>Gerrard was then handed a chance to make the remaining six minutes extremely tense when he was brought down by Michel Salgado in the box.</p>
              <p>But the Liverpool captain blazed his penalty well over the bar to compound the Reds' agony.</p>

              <p>Pool fans have to be realistic lah... Forget the yester-years where they top the league table with little effort... Blaming Roy isn't going to change their standing this season or maybe even the next or a few after it cos the league has changed since they last won it and by a great deal too...</p>
              <p>Pool fans have to realize that as long as there isn't fresh funds coming in, they are going to remain a mid-table side and their fans have to accept that and stop blaming the manager who ever he is when they lose matches... </p>
              <p>The league is such that even the top sides are losing matches so what is so special that Pool cannot lose?  Is their team more superior to City, Spurs, Chelsea? No so just learn to accept the fact that they are no longer good enough...</p>
              <p>When I watched fanzone and some of the Pool fans that come on just sounds ridiculous to me... They feel that given their history, they should be right up there challenging for the title and losing to 'smaller club' is unacceptable and this and this are not "Pool quality" players kind and are not good enough to wear the shirt...</p>
              <p>It just all sound so ridiculous to me... What Pool need isn't a new manager. But a new owner that is willing to spend big. And I don't think these 2 present Yanks are those guys... They are taking the long long road which might not prove anything more than   them just in to make some tidy profit in the long run at the expense of just keeping Pool in the Premier League but not necessarily wanting to win it...  If anything, I think this new guys are maybe worse than G&amp;H.  Cos at least G&amp;H spent big when they came masch was signed. It's just that Rafa blew it for them... That is why I was glad Peter Lim didn't get Pool all along and these another 2 Yanks got them...</p>
              <p>If Pool fans are serious about the title, forget about blaming the manager all the time... I feel Roy is the unfortunate one here, and he is being used like a buffer... Their poor manager is put there to take away the heat from the new owners I feel... That's why they are so reluctant to sack him...  Cos once you get rid of the buffer... The heat will fall right on them right? </p>

              <p>Zocoss - the fans not blaming the manager blindly. He is just not up to the job. 3 away wins in PL in 5 years says it all. The fans do not expect him to win the title...but 4 points from relegation zone is not good enough! Mike Ashley will tell you that..</p>
              <p>Although getting a rich sugar daddy is nice but ask most Liverpool fans, they will tell you they do not want that, including myself. The financial fair play will take effect next season anyway. It certainly needs time to build a strong team, you need to have a good foundation for that. It starts with the management (stability) and manager and then the players.</p>
              <p>The manager job is more to just set the tactic. He can only give instruction but it depends on the player to follow his instruction on the pitch. He must be able to motivate the players, make them work as a unit and instill confidence in the team (Roy tend to play down expectation before the game starts!!). Mourinho is the best person for this...the sense of togetherness and teamwork.</p>
              <p>What did Roy do when the team not performing? Rubbing his face and nose and blaming the players! He doesnt have good man management skills there. And don't make me start on his press conferences...</p>

              <p>On the financial fair play thing, I am guessing there might be a way around it if you are very very rich and powerful with connections as City do as they don't seemed to be bother with it... Perhaps they can get some "unrelated companies" to pop up their sponsorship deals whereby increasing their turnover and allowing them to spend more... lol. Oh well, it's worth a thought just like there are many ways to skin a cat they say... lol.</p>

              <p>He still is and not was. So he is as current as they get... or in tech terms the "latest gizmo"... And as you said it yourself he did it against all odds... Probably even Rafa couldn't have done it...</p>
              <p>The Pool board didn't just go out and got anybody... They thought long and hard and went for the Manager of the Year and even paying a compensation to Fulham for poaching him...</p>
              <p>If the Pool jobs becomes available during close season like when they employ Roy, lots of people will want the job...</p>
              <p>And I still belief getting rid of Rafa was correct... Saw how he destroyed Inter... But they need a willing to spend owner more than a good manager right now... Just see how City are flying and many still think Mancini is just average although I think he is good...</p>

              <p>When can Pool players wake up from their dreamland??? Even if Mourinho takes over Pool still no use, unless they decide to do so and continue their past glories....</p>
              <p>But as other mid-land teams, Pool had managed to win Chelsea, narrowly lost to Man U by 3-2 at OT. IMO, only Anfield matches sgainst strong team, they will fight hard, just like they won Man U 2-0 last season. So, Pool need to work out on winning those weaker teams (same as Man U facing those opponents at away from home)</p>

              <p>hodgson has never won any major trophy in his life? He is a good manager no doubt but i wonder if he's the right person to take liverpool forward. Having said that, he could have stamped his work on the squad much earlier, buying the right players etc. Look, he brought in joe cole and it didn't pan out. Either he doesn't know that joe cole's a spent force or he couldn't evoke the best out of him.</p>
              <p>Even if these players aren't your own but now liverpool sit 4 points above the relegation zone in the new year, something is not so right, isn't it?</p>
              <p>I think to save hodgson and pool, better change a new manager. Hodgson should try his hand at west ham and revive his reputation again.</p>

              <p>This is quite true. Not to be sound arrogant...but if you are a football manager, would you like to manage Liverpool or Porto? Now at least the club management has stabilised, Liverpool can attract more candidates for the job liao. Andre is a very young coach, only 33 or 34 years old but has been impressive so far although not in the toughest league like EPL...although he worked as Mourinho's assistant prior to that. Just my opinion.</p>

              <p>Hahaha... I have never ever think of him as a great coach or manager at all. In fact, if anyone remember, from the beginning i already questioned his credential to a Liverpool fan in here who seem to thought Roy was good... In fact, during that time... Anyone other than Rafa was good it seems... I had mentioned very early what has he ever won, some Danish league and another small time one as well but the guy said he had 'big club' experienced with Inter... And I pointed out he was in charge of an Inter side that wasn't successful, meaning a mid table club 'big club' as well and not a recently improved reputation Inter side after Jose Mourinho...</p>
              <p>But, him being the Manager of the Year is indeed true is it not?</p>

              <p>Yes indeed I recalled there was reports that then Managing Director Christian Purslow seeked adviced from <span lang="EN-GB">Kenny Dalglish to add some input in the selection choice but the guy himself wanted the job so how could he be impress or unbiased towards the other candidates? Simply put, he wanted the job himself so would he recommend someone else for it? No.</span></p>
              <p>Liverpool wasn't the only club interested on Deschamps, his former club Juventus too were keen to replace theirs... But the guy prefer to stay back in France. And I guess Kenny wasn't impressed by him either? </p>
              <p>Anyway, whatever it is... since so much unhappiness is being felt with Roy... Then just let him go to some other club to prove himself again... But if he leave, the Pool owners will badly need a new buffer to take the heat from the fans if they continue not to invest big...</p>
