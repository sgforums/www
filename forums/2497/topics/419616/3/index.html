              <p>but o'neill did more than 'perform in europa league', right
              after he won promotion with leicester, he took leicester to 9th,
              10th, 10th &amp; 8th the next 4 seasons winning 2 league cups along
              the way (and he never won lma manager)</p>
              <p>depending on how you look at it, he could have 4 good seasons
              (roy had 1 good season with fulham) or he took leicester to 'the
              next level' - from avoiding relegation to cementing a place in the
              top half of the table - this is why many (including myself) rated
              o'neill higher</p>
              <p>also, i'm lazy to count, but a quick glance seems to tell me
              that o'neill alone won more trophies than the other 4 (mclaren,
              curbs, burnley &amp; roy) combined.</p>

              <p>so curbs didn't take charlton through two promotions and cement them in the premier league?? he didn't take charlton to the next level?? he didn't save west ham from relegation and then finish top ten the next season??</p>
              <p>Sure he didn't win the league cup or the other managers didn't win as many as o'neill did but mon won the bulk of his trophies at celtic which isn't a hard thing to do, just ask strachan</p>
              <p>I'm not asking curbs or mcclaren to be rated higher than o'neill, i'm just lamenting the fact that they don't come anywhere close to o'neill</p>

              <p>One more thing is dalglish won titles at a time when the EPL was probably 3rd best in europe. 1988-1990 and 1995......The Serie A and La Liga were way ahead.</p>
              <p>Well fergie also steamrolled the EPL during that era, when chelsea came along, the story became a little different. Nevertheless he fought back and continued to win titles again. And what's more, he won the 2008 European cup......things like these are what seperates greatness and mediocrity.</p>

              <p><br>I think it was anyone other than Rafa at that time... and maybe even now... There is no need to question whether they are really 'pool fans' cos I have been here long enough to know they are true blue pool fans... And I didn't see anything wrong with their opinion either... Rafa was taking them downhill... fact, 7th place. </p>
              <p>Again, like i said earlier... Their <span lang="EN-GB">Managing Director Christian Purslow went out and 'head-hunted' </span>the Current Manager of the Year... Isn't that good enough?</p>
