              <p> </p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>THE race for Andrei Arshavin is hotting up after an unnamed Premier League club bid £19million for the Russian ace. Barcelona were the favourites to snap up the Zenit St Petersburg forward but they recently failed with an £12m offer. And now an English club have seen a massive offer for the star rejected as Zenit hold out for £24m.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Arshavin's agent Dennis Lachter said: "Barcelona failed with a £12m bid for Andrei and now an English club have had a £19m offer rejected by Zenit. "Zenit want £24m, so clubs who want to sign Andrei will have to get closer to that figure. "I believe they will because there are clubs interested in Andrei who are trying to sell players first.</p>
              <p class="article">"The figure is not easy to reach but the transfer activity is beginning to happen and I am optimistic he will join a big club. "I don't know exactly when Andrei's future will be resolved but we have until the end of August, so we are both fairly relaxed."</p>
              <p class="article">Arshavin is in huge demand after impressing for Russia on their way to the Euro 2008 semi-finals.</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal and Chelsea are set to battle it out for Andrei Arshavin with Barcelona preparing to pull out of the race for the Russian. Barcelona are poised to sign Alexander Hleb and a source close to Arshavin confirmed the Spaniards will no longer pursue the Zenit St Petersburg forward once a £15million deal with the Gunners for Hleb is completed.</strong></p>
              <p>That leaves Arsenal, who are believed to have had a £19m offer turned down this week, and Chelsea to fight for the 27-year-old, rated at £24m by his club. Chelsea maintain they are not interested but owner Roman Abramovich is thought to want a Russian star at his club.</p>
              <p>Arsenal will need to strengthen should Emmanuel Adebayor leave north London and manager Arsene Wenger is an admirer of Arshavin's talents.</p>

              <p><br>Well, Hleb + $15m, Adu's sale more or less done deal... only thing left is for Arsenal to buy a replacement first then let Adu go... Adu $30m...</p>
              <p>Together they have $45m without even using a single cent of this season's budget...</p>
              <p>So why not? with Samir Nasri only costing around $12m... Still got $33m + their own budget to spend... Easily another $50 million can be use.</p>
              <p>Last heard they were also very keen on Huntelaar... which will still be well within teir budget...</p>

              <p>quite not like arsenal if they sign Arshavin's. coz he is 27, arsenal seldom sig  player that is at that age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i think chelsea is more likely his destination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if adu leave, i would place my bets on martins or huntelaar who are much younger than arshavin. even if martins or huntelaar at the end of 4 years contract at arsenal would only be 27 max. and they would still have resale value.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>arshavin by then would be 30/31 and would have no resale value.</p>

              <p>Andrei Arshavin's agent has claimed that the Russia star’s decision on his future club will be influenced by the ongoing transfer sagas of Arsenal duo Emmanuel Adebayor and Alexander Hleb; and Manchester United star winger Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Zenit St Petersburg star Arshavin is looking to move to a new club with Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, Barcelona and several other sides linked with the 27-year-old attacking midfielder.</p>
              <p>However, the picture is yet to be clear over who holds the key to the decision and agent Dennis Lachter has revealed that it may take time to resolve the matter with suitors in battle to retain their players.</p>
              <p>Forward Adebayor and midfielder Hleb are linked with Barcelona, while Ronaldo is a target for Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>"The push for Andrei Arshavin has only just got going," he told Spanish newspaper El Mundo Deportivo.</p>
              <p>"The summer transfer window doesn't close until August 31 and the clubs who are following him are only just warming up their engines."</p>
              <p>"Arshavin's future depends on what happens with Hleb and Adebayor, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo," he added.</p>

              <p>Zenit St Petersburg's Russia international is one of this summer's hottest properties after helping his side claim last season's Uefa Cup and impressing at Euro 2008.</p>
              <p>Although the likes of Chelsea and Barcelona have also been linked with the dangerous 27-year-old playmaker, it appears as though Arsenal are in pole position for his services if they plan on making a bid.</p>
              <p>Arshavin's agent Dennis Lachter has told <em>Sky Sports News</em> his client is a great admirer of French tactician Wenger and the team's exciting attacking football.</p>
              <h4>Gunners advantage</h4>
              <p>"The stable situation in the club and the influence of Arsene Wenger to Arsenal to English football is huge. I think this is an advantage," said Lachter.</p>
              <p>"If Arsenal go for Arshavin it could be really good for both parties. Arsenal is a very young team and Arshavin is 27. There's something about combining young and older players, they propagate attacking football."</p>
              <p>When asked if Alexander Hleb's proposed switch to Barcelona would aid Arshavin's potential move to the Emirates, Lachter said that was a question that should be directed elsewhere.</p>
              <p>"That question should be to Arsene Wenger and not for me," he said.</p>
              <p>Barcelona have already seen a bid for Arshavin rejected by Zenit this summer, although Lachter says Pep Guardiola's lack of experience as a manager could impact on his client's desire to join the Camp Nou giants.</p>
              <p>He concluded: "Guardiola was an excellent player, but no one knows what kind of a manager he is."</p>
