              <div class="content">
              <p>Manchester United’s longest serving player Ryan Giggs has told <em>Inside United Magazine</em> one of his football idols was Liverpool legend John Barnes.</p>
              <p>"I always used to look out for left footers and John Barnes and
              Diego Maradona were always the ones that I looked up to when I was a
              kid.</p>
              <p>"Barnes because he played in the same position as me – whenever
              Liverpool played United in the 80’s I’d watch John Barnes pretty
              closely.</p>
              <p>"During that period, at the end of the late 1980’s he was probably the best and most exciting player in Britain."</p>
              <p>In addition to Barnes, Giggs also reserved special praise for Argentinean idol, Diego Maradona.</p>
              <p>He said: "And Maradona just because he was such a great player.</p>
              <p>"I remember Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. That goal he scored
              against England – not that Hand of God goal – was absolutely amazing."</p>

              <p>friend, seriously, this is a good thread till your inputs.</p>
              <p>For a MU legend to openly admire an ex-Liverpool player is quite a feat.</p>
              <p>but you just have to destroy it, hence, I seriously doubt your intent and integrity.</p>
              <p>And given U are a mod, you are simply a shame/joke. And worse still for the one who made you a mod, for he must be cleaning his eyes with acid now, for they are filled with BS.</p>
              <p>Hence, I would suggest you to lay low and just reclaim what little integrity you may have. And maybe surface when EPL starts..</p>

              <p>halo sir,</p>
              <p>Given the flame U are getting, it seems U need tons of improvement in telling jokes. To be fair to you, let's see it from your angle, that you just trying to be funny. Then why you can't endure when others are just trying to be funny? Can't tahan a taste of ur own medicine?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, I hope u enjoy taunting me on my nick, having a blast @ your end?? Hey, enjoy..</p>

              <p>Back to main topic, I do admire John Barnes, but sadly, he was ahead of his time, and didn't do as well as expected in England Shirt.</p>
              <p>He was here in Sg I think, a while ago, and some fans did catch up with him.</p>
              <p>I read he is going into management, I do hope he can bring his silky touches on field, onto his new job.. Kudos to him..</p>

              <p>ya he was exceptional. he can go pass a defender and then made a pinpoint cross to the striker in the Penalty box. he scored a solo goal against brazil in 1984 friendy in rio de janeiro while he was still at watford. fergie tried to sign him when he joined man utd in 1986, but he choses liverpool as liverpool was the more successful team of the two.</p>

              <p>great player doesnt make a good manager.</p>
