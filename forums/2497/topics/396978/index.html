              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">In the electric atmosphere of the Stadio Olimpico, Tommaso Rocchi gave Lazio a 14th-minute lead and Sergio Floccari had an opportunity to score the <em>Biancoceleste's</em> second from the spot early in the second half but his penalty kick was saved by Roma goalkeeper Julio Sergio.</div>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"> </div>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">Vucinic then stole the show. The Montenegrin forward equalised in the 53rd minute from the penalty spot after Aleksandar Kolarov fouled substitute Rodrigo Taddei inside the area and shortly after the hour mark, Vucinic's stinging central free-kick from 20 yards left Lazio goalkeeper Fernando Muslera rooted to the spot to put Roma in front.</div>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"> </div>
              <p>Roma were forced to sweat in the final stages but held on for a vital win in the race for the <em>Scudetto</em>. Lazio ended the game with just ten men after Cristian Ledesma was sent off for a second bookable offence in injury time.</p>
              <p>Roma coach Claudio Ranieri admits his players must learn how to cope better under pressure as the Serie A title race hots up. Roma trailed 1-0 at half-time and Ranieri took the bold decision to substitute skipper Francesco Totti and his vice-captain Daniele De Rossi.</p>
              <p>"Why did I substitute Totti and De Rossi? They feel the derby too much,'' Ranieri said. "They don't play like they can when they face Lazio and were too heated up in the first half. That is why I took them off.</p>
              <p>"In my career, I have taken many decisions like this one. For example, in Valencia I brought off Romario. I do it all for the good of the team. As it is, we are up there (top of the standings) and my players are not used to that pressure. We just have to enjoy it and wait to see where we finish.''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sampdoria</strong> practically ended <strong>AC Milan's</strong> slim title hopes with <a href="/report?id=278401&amp;cc=4716"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">a 2-1 win</span></span></a> which puts them on course for Champions League football next season.</p>
              <p>Marco Borriello put the visitors ahead against the run of play in the 20th minute, but a red card for central defender Daniele Bonera early in the second half, which led to Antonio Cassano levelling from the penalty spot, tipped the scales in the home side's favour.</p>
              <p>They left it late to net a winner, though, with Giampaolo Pazzini nodding in their second in stoppage time to boost their hopes of playing in the Champions League next season.</p>
              <p>With four games of the season remaining, they lead fifth-placed Palermo by two points while Milan find themselves six adrift of league leaders Inter Milan and unlikely to now challenge for silverware.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>This match was very good... I watched it last night and Lazio tried their very best to stop Roma from winning and there were moments when hell was about to break loose, players going for one another, fighting about to erupt and of course a sending off... But it was a good and entertaining match and I thought the referee made it very difficult for Roma and favouring the home side a lot more... But Roma came out on top cos of a player call Vucinic.</p></div>

              <p><br>It's far from over cos Roma still have some tricky matches to mid table sides while Inter's are mostly at the lower half of the table sides which shouldn't give them too much problems... But Lazio away, a derby match was Roma's toughest last few matches on their fixture... It was like watching City trying to do their all to hinder United... or Spurs on Arsenal...lol...</p>
