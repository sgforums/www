              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1281256" rel="1281256|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1281256/Barcelona-threaten-prolong-chase-Arsenal-skipper-Cesc-Fabregas.html"></a> </p>
              <p><strong>Barcelona have warned </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal </strong></span><strong>they will not be panicked into raising their bid for Cesc Fabregas - threatening to drag out the saga to the final day of the summer transfer window.</strong></p>
              <p>The Catalans feel they have the upper hand in negotiations because the Spain midfielder has told Arsene Wenger he wants to leave the Emirates Stadium. And despite the Gunners demanding £80million for a player who Barca value at £30m, Nou Camp director general Joan Oliver insists he is prepared to play a waiting game.</p>
              <p>'The worst thing we can do is fix ourselves a deadline,' he said. 'The only time limit we have is when the window closes, at the end of August.'</p>
              <p>Arsenal have scuppered hopes of an early deal and sources in Spain suggest Joan Laporta has now decided not to get involved with negotiations before he leaves office on June 30.</p>
              <p>His successor, elected on June 13, will have to complete the deal, though Nou Camp insiders will continue to work on it. It seems increasingly unlikely that the impasse will be broken before the World Cup, especially as Fabregas is now turning his full attention to the tournament in South Africa.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old is said to have told friends that he is '500 per cent' sure of re-joining the club where he came through the youth ranks, but it is suggested he will not come out and make public a demand to leave Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Barca insiders hoped Fabregas would make a declaration to strengthen their hand further, though they are confident it is a case of when and not if the deal is concluded.</p>
              <p>Oliver said: 'All there is right now is interest that the player has shown in Barcelona and our initial contact with Arsenal.</p>
              <p>'There hasn't been an official offer from Barca yet or a price from Arsenal. Everything is just speculation. Barca have of course put a limit on what we are willing to spend I'm not telling you what it is.</p>
              <p>'If we reach an agreement, he'll come and if not, he'll stay at Arsenal.</p>
              <p>'There is money to buy him because the club's finances are strong and we have credit from other clubs. For example, we're paying for (David) Villa in installments.'</p>
              <p>Fabregas's father has upped the pressure by calling on Arsenal to understand his son's desire to return home.</p>
              <p>'Arsenal have to respect the decision and the will of the player,' said Francesc Snr.</p>
              <p>'Negotiations between Arsenal and Barcelona will be very long. Both sides are going to have to sit several times because the issue is complicated.</p>
              <p>'Cesc is now focused on the Spanish team but what he wants is to close the signing soon. 'He has always responded to Arsene Wenger with his work and we are also grateful to Arsenal because they made my son a great player. We just want this to end soon.</p>
              <p>'At the moment he has a contract with Arsenal. I get the feeling that the English club do not want to sell but in the end will finally give in and let Cesc go.'</p>
              <p>However, Alexander Hleb, who regrets making the move from Arsenal to Barcelona two years ago, has advised his former team-mate to stay in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>'I stay in touch with Cesc a lot,' the Belarus midfielder told the Daily Mirror. 'He and Gael Clichy are both very good players who must make their own decisions about their future. But I would advise them to stay.</p>
              <p>'It didn't work out for Arsenal this season but, if Arsene Wenger keeps the side together, they can really go far next year.</p>
              <p>'They play great football.I think they have a very good chance of the title next season.' </p>

We will do everything for him to come, but it must be at a logical price.<br><br>"We will not pay over the odds, but we will make a special effort for him because he has made his position clear and has said that he wants to come.

              <p><strong>Barcelona are ready to renew their interest in Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano but it could yet be hindered by their move for Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas.</strong></p>
              <p>Barca courted Mascherano a year ago and their need is greater now with defensive midfielder Yaya Toure destined to leave - with Chelsea among his admirers.</p>
              <p>However, they know that Liverpool will be looking at close to £30million for the 25-year-old Argentina captain and that will put enormous strain on their budget as even though Toure is expected to command £20m, Arsenal would want more than £40m for Fabregas.</p>
              <p>Liverpool also have interest from Chelsea in Mascherano but do not want to sell to Premier League rivals and accept Mascherano's sale may be the easiest solution to their financial troubles.</p>

              <p><strong>Barcelona will play a waiting game over Cesc Fàbregas in the hope that the Arsenal captain’s frustration at being denied a transfer works to their advantage.</strong></p>
              </div>

              <p>The Spanish champions saw a formal offer of £29 million rejected by Arsenal on Wednesday. The North London club’s valuation of their star player is much higher and, in any case, they remain hopeful of keeping the 23-year-old, who is under contract at the Emirates Stadium until 2015. But senior figures at Barcelona are undeterred and believe that the desire of Fàbregas to join them will eventually change Arsenal’s stance because they will not want to keep an unhappy player.</p>
              <p>Barcelona are certain to return with an improved offer, but are inclined to wait for Fàbregas’s reaction to Arsenal’s unwillingness to negotiate before committing to a second official bid. Fàbregas, who played for Spain in a 1-0 victory over South Korea in a friendly in Innsbruck last night, informed Arsène Wenger, the Arsenal manager, last month of his wish to return to his home-town club this summer.</p>
              <p>David Villa arrived at the Nou Camp from Valencia last month for £34.2 millions and leading figures at Barcelona hope to secure Fàbregas for a similar price. Despite the possible sale of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Sweden forward, bringing in funds it is understood that the present Barcelona regime are not willing to pay more than £40 million.</p>
              <p>The strategy could be changed, however, with the election of a successor to Joan Laporta, the club president, on Sunday week. Sandro Rosell, the club’s former vice- president, is standing against Marc Ingla, the favoured candidate of Laporta, and the former could sanction higher levels of spending if he wins.</p>
              <p>Josep María Bartomeu, a close aide of Rosell, confirmed his camp’s interest in Fàbregas yesterday. “Whoever goes into the negotiations will find themselves in the best conditions to seal the deal,” he said. “The price of a player is always in relation to the number of years he has left on his contract, but in this case it seems that the wind is blowing in our favour.”</p>
              <p>While the Fàbregas saga unfolds, Arsenal have moved to strengthen their defence with a £6.5 million offer for Laurent Koscielny, the Lorient defender. The French club have rejected the bid but expect Arsenal to return with a higher offer.</p>
              <p>Wenger is set to lose three central defenders with William Gallas, Sol Campbell and Mikaël Silvestre all out of contract at the end of this month. Koscielny, 24 and 6ft 1in, is eligible to play for France or Poland.</p>
