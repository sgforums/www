              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Roman Abramovich may not attend as many Chelsea matches as he used to but chairman Bruce Buck insists the Blues owner's passion is stronger than ever. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Abramovivch took over at Stamford Bridge in 2003 and his cash helped establish the Londoners as one of the world's leading clubs. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Buck, in an interview for former Mail on Sunday journalist Ian Ridley's upcoming book There's a Golden Sky, extracts of which have been published in the Daily Telegraph, also highlighted Abramovich's tremendous knowledge of the game. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He said: 'I would say that his passion for Chelsea has increased not decreased. His passion for football has increased, not decreased. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'His knowledge of football has increased exponentially. I'm not talking about what goes at the megastore, I'm talking about football. It would be pretty hard to name a current footballer that he couldn't give you statistics for. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'He doesn't miss a game in the sense that wherever he is in the world he watches the Chelsea game. He calls Eugene Tenenbaum (trusted club director and associate) or whoever after the game and they talk about it. He is very much on top of things.' </span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Buck remains close to the Russian and remembers when Abramovich hired investment bank UBS Warburg to write a feasibility study, which listed a number of possible options as he looked to take his first steps in the Premier League. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'It said that Manchester United would be expensive and the fans would go crazy. Aston Villa was for sale but was in Birmingham and the long-term opportunities were limited,' he explained. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Tottenham was on the list along with Chelsea. They were in London; they were in financial trouble. Roman's advisers tried to arrange meetings with Tottenham and Chelsea but for whatever reason, they couldn't set up a meeting with Tottenham, or Tottenham didn't want to meet.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Manchester City have overtaken Chelsea with the financial clout of owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan but Buck added: 'That's why we aren't complaining about some of the things City are doing.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'We started it after all but, having said that, it is a free world. Obviously what we have done has not pleased the fans of West Ham or Manchester United, but they sure have pleased the fans at Chelsea.' </span></p>

              <h1>Buck: AVB could do a decade</h1>
              <p>Bruce Buck admits Andre Villas-Boas could be "the right guy" to bring some stability to Chelsea by remaining as manager for over a decade.</p>

              <p><strong>Villas-Boas is the seventh boss of the Roman Abramovich era, but Buck believes the club may finally have found their Sir Alex Ferguson figure.</strong></p>
              <p>Ferguson will celebrate 25 years in charge of United next month, while Arsene Wenger last week marked 15 years as Arsenal manager.</p>
              <p>Buck told BBC Sport: "We do envy Arsene Wenger at Arsenal and Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United in terms of longevity, but it shouldn't be longevity for longevity's sake.</p>
              <p>"It has to be the right guy in the job for 10 or 15 years and, in light of Andre's age, he may well be that guy."</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas turns 34 this month and is only his third season of full-time management.</p>
              <p>The Portuguese has previously said he only wants to remain in the profession for between 10 and 15 years.</p>
              <p>Buck added: "Everyone thinks his age might have been a negative but it's a positive.</p>
              <p>"He has really been able to relate to the players. He is a very organised guy who really understands football."</p>
              <p>Buck this week announced Chelsea's plan to buy back the parts of Stamford Bridge they do not already own in what is being seen as a precursor to a stadium move that could earn the club an extra £50million per year.</p>
              <p>He also admitted they need to improve their youth development policy to make further savings in the light of UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations.</p>
              <p>"The problem has been transfer fees paid to other clubs for new players and that's probably our biggest expense," he said.</p>
              <p>"The way we've tried to attack that - not as successfully as we'd have liked to be honest - is by putting a lot of money into the academy.</p>
              <p>"The maths is pretty simple. If you can bring a player or two through the academy every couple of years, then you're saving £10million, £20million, £30million of transfer fees."</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The club reported a £70million loss last year and chairman Bruce Buck admits they face a tough period trying to meet Financial Fair Play rules that could see teams thrown out of the Champions League from 2014. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Even before [financial fair play] we were of the view we couldn't rely on Mr Abramovich for ever,' said Buck. 'We had to figure out a way over the medium term to stand on our own two feet. Maybe financial fair play is making us do that a little bit quicker.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'An academy costs maybe £5m a year to run, so if you can get maybe one player every year or 18 months into the first team, look at the transfer fees you've saved. The economics are pretty clear. Implementing it is much more difficult.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Chelsea are also trying to increase sponsorship. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>An office has already been opened in Singapore to exploit the Asian market and Buck added: 'We have to up our sponsorship income. We have to reduce our transfer fees, reduce our payroll and up our match-day revenues if we can. Naming rights could also be important.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Some Chelsea fans have been threatening a boycott of the next Champions League game against Genk on October 19 because of ticket prices but Buck urges caution.</span></p>
