He has since bought Manchester City football club.<br><br>"The court approved an arrest warrant," Pornchai Asavawattanaporn of the Department of Special Investigations (DSI) said.<br><br>The DSI is investigating allegations that Mr Thaksin and his wife Pojaman had concealed their assets in a firm, SC Assets Co Ltd.<br><br>The department said it had sought the warrant as the couple had repeatedly failed to appear in Bangkok to hear the charges.<br><br>The couple were served with their first arrest warrant last month by the Supreme Court after failing to appear to hear the first in a series of corruption cases being brought against them.<br><br>In that case, Mr Thaksin is accused of abusing his power while in office, by helping his wife buy land from a state agency at a favourable price.<br><br>Mr Thaksin and his family have denied all allegations of corruption against them, and say the charges are politically motivated.<br><br>His lawyer Noppadol Pattama told the BBC recently that Mr Thaksin feared his life would be in danger if he returned to Thailand.<br><br>"He would consider going back after the next Thailand election and with the return of full democracy," Mr Pattama said.<br><br></div>
