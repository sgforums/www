            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ROY KEANE won seven Premier League titles and four FA Cups at Manchester United Â— but he cannot remember them.</strong><br><br>Despite helping United dominate in the 1990s, Keano does not have a clue in which year he won what.<br><br>All he can remember are the crushing memories of defeat which have become the driving force behind his battle to keep Sunderland up.<br><br>Whether it was seeing Arsenal pip him to the title or being turned inside out as a 12-year-old playing in a boysÂ’ final, the will to put it right burns deep.<br><br>And there is plenty the Mackems boss needs to put right at the moment Â— especially with Alex Ferguson taking on his old United skipper and sparring partner today with the Black Cats in the drop zone.<br><br>Sunderland are in trouble but Keane remains calm.<br><br>He said: Â“I moved on from success as a player very quickly, but the defeats were always the ones that kept you going.<br><br>Â“You donÂ’t look back and think of wins. I read and hear about players talking about when they won titles and cups, but I havenÂ’t got a clue what year I won anything.<br><br>Â“But I do know when I got relegated. I do know when I lost cup finals. I do know when I lost leagues.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good stuff</span></strong><br><br>Â“I do know when I lost to Clyde in the cup. I do know when I lost to Luton in the league cup.<br><br>Â“I remember all those things, but I donÂ’t remember the good stuff. IÂ’m motivated by those defeats.<br><br>Â“So you can say that IÂ’m as motivated now as at any time in my life, without a doubt.<br><br>Â“The hatred of defeat goes back to when I was a kid, definitely. We won most things then, too. But even from back then, itÂ’s the defeats I remember.<br><br>Â“We lost a big cup final to Belvedere 3-2 and I remember it as if it was yesterday.<br><br>Â“We were 2-0 up and the lad I was marking scored a hat-trick.<br><br>Â“He ended up at Luton, a left-back. His name was Ken Gillard.<br><br>Â“Did people realise I was upset? Well, we were only 11 or 12, werenÂ’t exactly hitting the town. It was just going to the shop and getting a can of Coke and a Mars bar.<br><br>Â“I moved house the other day and found one or two medals in boxes. But they were losersÂ’ medals. IÂ’ve lost a few but the winnersÂ’ medals are in the bank somewhere.<br><br>Â“I remember Gary Neville talking about winning leagues Â— and Gary is a good lad.<br><br>Â“But I donÂ’t remember when I won what. I suppose we won most years!<br><br>Â“They probably thought I was miserable but then they would probably say the same about me now. There are three of four lads I keep in touch with and theyÂ’d still say the same. They know I donÂ’t like losing.<br><br>Â“If they come over for a game and we lose, then they wonÂ’t meet up with me. TheyÂ’ll consciously keep away Â— and IÂ’ve known them since I was nine or 10.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t know what it is about me. IÂ’m from a big sporting family. IÂ’m from Cork which is the rebel county in Ireland Â— a lot of history there, very much a sporting environment.<br><br>Â“I did a lot of boxing and defeat just wasnÂ’t accepted.Â”<br><br>KeaneÂ’s legendary Old Trafford career will never be forgotten but the Irishman admits he is feeling more like a Mackem every day.<br><br>Working with Fergie and Brian Clough at Forest helped him.<br><br>He said: Â“I think you take defeat 100 times more personally as a manager. You are picking the team.<br><br>Â“As much as I could get upset as a player and could have a go at other players and staff, now the responsibility comes back on to me as a manager.<br><br>Â“I enjoy it, thatÂ’s why I started doing it. YouÂ’ve got to have the good and bad stuff.<br><br>Â“I do think about Fergie or Clough and what they would have done. Maybe some of that DNA has passed on.<br><br>Â“You look at why you make certain decisions Â— 99 times out of 100 it will be my gut feeling.<br><br>Â“I donÂ’t speak to Fergie that much now. What have I got to speak to him about?<br><br>Â“Managers are busy. I donÂ’t speak to Mick McCarthy or Brian Kerr, my managers in Ireland.<br><br>Â“Will we have a glass of wine afterwards? Well, I donÂ’t drink but weÂ’ll see.<br><br>Â“I loved my time at United but the kids will be wanting Sunderland to win. They wouldnÂ’t want to see their dad unhappy.Â”</div>
