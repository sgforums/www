              <p>Sunderland midfielder Yorke told <em>The Sun</em>: “The problem is that Carlos has arrived at a time when Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo are flying.</p>
              <p>“Ole Solskjaer used to come in and score goals and when crunch games came he could be back on the bench.</p>
              <p>“Ole was not happy but he accepted it and, when he was called up, he was ready to go.</p>
              <p>“The boss doesn’t think, ‘Poor lad, let’s give him a game’.</p>
              <p>“It has to be justified and fit into his planning.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Man City owners would love to rock Man Utd with Tevez signing</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Manchester City's owners love the prospect of rattling Manchester United with the capture of Carlos Tevez.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says City cannot offer Champions League football, but
              the appeal of signing the forward has grown on Garry Cook, the chief
              executive, and Mark Hughes, the manager, since it was first proposed in
              January.</p>
              <p>Backed by the enormous wealth of Sheikh Mansour, the owner,
              the club believe that they can offer Tévez a scenario in which he would
              be the leading player in a team who plan to be contenders in the
              Premier League next season.</p>
              <p>The prospect of stealing an established player from United
              holds a strong appeal for City, but it would also be a deal that could
              take them to a higher level on the pitch and potentially attract other
              signings.</p>

              <p>Problem is that Manure doesnt even want to sign him. He did complain about lack of matches but even then, he still want to stay at Manure.</p>

              <h1>So, what happens next to Manchester United striker Tevez?<br></h1>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Tevez: Out of Old Trafford? </em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em></em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1180650" rel="1180650|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1180650/So-happens-Manchester-United-striker-Tevez.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Just remind us, who owns Carlos Tevez?</p>
              <p>A group of investors, with Kia Joorabchian as their trusted front man.</p>
              <p>He spots the talents, mainly in South America, advises on value, makes the deals and negotiates the sell-ons to clubs. He’s the ringmaster and has a very close relationship with Tevez and his family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">How much is the player worth?</p>
              <p>The asking price is anything upwards of £25million. There is a credit crunch, you know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Who gets the money?</p>
              <p>Joorabchian and his investors share the profit. They originally signed Tevez from Argentinian side Boca Juniors, for around £12m. Since then, he has won a host of South American trophies (three times South American Footballer of the Year), an Olympic gold, a Champions League and a Premier League title, among other trophies. He is on course to become the most decorated Argentinian footballer of all time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Worth it then?</p>
              <p>Not if you’re <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a>, it seems. But there are lots of others ready to break the bank. The bidding starts soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Such as?</p>
              <p>Liverpool and Manchester City lead the way. Everton and Spurs can dream and Joorabchian flew from the Manchester derby to Milan versus Juventus at the weekend.</p>
              <p>Milan like the look of Tevez the terrier, but he wants to stay in England. With the right club.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">How about another loan?</p>
              <p>It’s not allowed. The Premier League have changed their rules and third-party ownership is outlawed. So that rules out United negotiating a fresh short-term deal. Or anyone else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">What about his wages?</p>
              <p>The going rate. Around £100,000 a week should do the trick and a four-year deal is the most likely outcome. For that, you get a ready-made all-action hero.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">When does all this happen?</p>
              <p>His deal with United runs out in June. He has been free to negotiate with other clubs since January, but has said he wanted to concentrate on reaching the end of the season. Now, let battle commence.</p>
