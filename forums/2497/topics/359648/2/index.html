              <p>Its quite true leh... I see Tevez running around a lot but sometimes like a headless chicken with little scoring impact most of the time recently... I read the goal he scored against City was his first league goal at OT this season, don't know true or not...</p>
              <p>His hardworking style will make many fans like him whichever club he plays for but... Somehow I feel he don't get you enough goals or the way he plays not that attractive...</p>
              <p>People should stop looking at Berbatov because Tevez isn't happy... They are 2 different individuals. If Tevez is playing like the way he played against City week in, week out, maybe he will start more matches...  </p>

              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Carlos Tevez looks certain to
              quit Old Trafford after his agent claimed Manchester United have no
              interest in keeping hold of the Argentine for next season. </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/man-utd/tevez-ferguson-fatherly-480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has previously insisted the club are keen to
              retain the 25-year-old striker, despite failing to push through a deal. </strong></p>
              <p>But agent Adrian Ruocco has dismissed these claims and says United
              have made no moves to secure a permanent transfer for the player or
              prolong his loan agreement.</p>
              <p>Ruocco told Argentinian newspaper Ole:  "There was no will from the
              directors and the coach (Sir Alex Ferguson) to sign a new contract.</p>
              <p>"On May 31, he will have no club and no contract. I don't know why,
              but Manchester (United) have not asked for any renewal (of the loan)
              nor signing him for next season."</p>
              <p>He added: "The directors and the coach do not seem to want him, while on the other hand fans love him."</p>
              <p>But Ruocco confirmed there is no shortage of offers for the player who is attracting interest from clubs across the continent.</p>
              <p>Manchester City are thought to be lining up a summer swoop for the
              striker, while Rafa Benitez and Liverpool have also been mentioned as
              potential suitors.</p>
              <p>Ruocco added:  "He might move to Spain, Italy or stay in England. There are interested clubs from all those countries.</p>
              <p>"He has already said he would like to stay in The Premier League
              because he likes the football in the country, so fortunately he will
              decide where he will play. He is lucky to have the chance to choose."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">MANCHESTER UNITED could try to sign Carlos Tevez on a Bosman-style free transfer. SunSport understands the Red Devils are exploring whether there are legal loopholes in the striker’s contract. </h2>
              <p class="article">In particular, the third party ownership agreement which ties Tevez with the investment company MSI is under scrutiny. Leading sports lawyers are looking at whether the ownership of Tevez’s registration by MSI could be challenged under the same terms as Jean Marc Bosman took on the old transfer system. </p>
              <p class="article">Tevez is currently on loan at United and is a free agent when that dealn expires next month. His advisor Kia Joorabchian says MSI are demanding a fee of £32million for the 25-year-old but United have refused to pay. </p>
              <p class="article">Any legal move to challenge the contract Tevez has with MSI would mean the player having to decide whether to sever ties with his advisor. That in turn would lead to a sensational legal battle which would pitch United and Tevez against Joorabchian and MSI. </p>
              <p class="article">Joorabchian said once again yesterday that no deal is close with United and that Tevez is willing to sign for one of their Premier League rivals. He said: “What he wants to do is to go to a club which has real ambition, a real focus, to be champions of England, champions of Europe, champions of everywhere. </p>
              <p class="article">“Obviously, leaving United he would have to go to a rival in order to achieve that target. “But he understands it’s not in his control.” But lawyers might move in if Tevez were ever to opt to take ‘control’ of his own destiny and break his contract with MSI. </p>
              <p class="article">In 1995, Bosman won the right of players to move for free at the end of their contract with a club. The European Court of Justice ruled that players could move without a fee being paid or the interference of the club which held his player registration. </p>
              <p class="article">Third-party ownership of the player registration was the crux of the old system and it’s the same principle which binds Tevez to MSI. It remains possible Tevez, who has 43 caps for Argentina, could now be heading for another huge European legal battle.</p>

              <p>the worst is Tevez who fell into MSI trap... and juggle like a piece of meat infront of these clubs... Seriously, I don't think he deserves it..</p>
              <p>as I like to believe, MSI is a nightmare to even neg, so things are slow.</p>
              <p>and given he is going to cost another 25M for MU, and 32M for any other clubs, it is not going to be cheap sale.. so potentially, only ManCity is in with a shout..</p>
              <p>if he goes to Poo and plays off Torres, he will be running into Gerrard a lot like Keane, and soon, he will be sitting on the bench again.. if he goes to City, they are not even sure of Europe, meaning, it will still hurt his WC ambition. if he even think of Spurs, who have to sell half their first team to afford him, he may be a success.</p>
              <p>End of day, he may have talked his future out of United, and it is a sad day for all.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Carlos Tevez’s advisor, Kia Jorabchian, expects him to leave Manchester United and sign for cross-town rivals Manchester City.</p>
              <p>The Argentine’s contract expires at the end of this season and it looks almost certain that he will move on from Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Joorabchian believes Tevez is looking for a new challenge.</p>
              <p>"He feels there is a very big chance that his time has come to an end and it is time to move on," Joorabchian told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"He loved his time there, he mentioned that, and the glory he has had there has been very special to him.</p>
              <p>"But the fact that they have not offered him a contract or made any
              effort to sign him up means that he probably has to move on and think
              about his own future."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CARLOS TEVEZ can sign for Manchester United today if he wants. There would be no transfer fee because he is not registered with another club. There would be no negotiations as long as he is happy with his personal terms. All it needs is the player, a contract and the agreement of the club and it’s done.</h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">United could even try to get out of paying the agent’s commission, though it’s almost certain they would find themselves with a legal row in court. If Tevez were willing to break his contract with MSI — the company that owns his registration — then he could become as famous for not playing football as Jean Marc Bosman.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The Argentina striker is out of contract with United at the end of this season, when his loan deal expires. In that situation, normally a player will simply choose which offer to accept from any interested clubs and go without a bye or leave.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Not Tevez. His contract with MSI means he cannot agree anything without their permission and, more pointedly, their demands being met first. Or can he? Some might like to see that same contract tested to the full under European Union law.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">It was Bosman back in 1995 who successfully argued that the transfer system, where a third party governed a player’s right to move, was unlawful. So if Tevez did want out of the MSI deal, might he just then simply sign for United and get himself a good lawyer?</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Or perhaps even ask the club to get Jean Louis Dupont to defend him against the case which would likely be brought by MSI? Dupont was the legal brain behind Bosman’s victory in the European Court for Justice, which changed the face of football for ever.</p>
              <p class="article">He has since become a familiar face at United, representing the club in cases involving the complexities of football and European law. And, given his experience in the field, Dupont would be the obvious man to advise them on the Tevez situation.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">The lawyer’s greatest victory is that in the name of the little-known Belgian defender in the European Court of Justice. While the action took five years to complete, the argument in the Bosman case was very simple. Dupont claimed any third party (a club) which governs the movement of a player between jobs is a restraint of trade.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">That being the case, it violated the individual’s freedom which is protected by the Treaty of Rome, which is at the heart of the EU. MSI might claim their contract with Tevez was signed outside of Europe but since Tevez wants to play in Europe it’s likely that the terms would be at least open to challenge within the EU.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">And the fact that MSI is a company and not a club could be seen as irrelevant as their third-party role would likely be the crucial point in question. Third-party ownership of a player is not disallowed by FIFA but its terms could violate EU law if successfully challenged in the courts.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">United, by exploring all the possible legal ramifications of Tevez’s contract with MSI, appear to have signalled they have no intention of paying the fee which is being asked. But, if United were to choose this route, the first hurdle to making a free agent of Tevez would be persuading the player to part ways with MSI.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Some may argue it wouldn’t be too difficult. If the club do not want to pay the £32million fee MSI are demanding, they could easily offer a fraction of that sum to the player in return for his signature and a possible court case.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">After all, if this happened, Tevez wouldn’t be the first player in the history of football to have his head turned by an offer. At the same time, MSI would then have to weigh up the consequences of going to war with one of the world’s biggest football clubs.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">And suing Manchester United wouldn’t be the easiest move — if it came to that. His adviser, Kia Joorabchian, obviously knows it’s getting close to D-Day in the handling of the player.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Recently, Tevez has been man-marked closer by his agents than at any time on the pitch this season. His relationship with Joorabchian is close but it might not always have been that way.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">When he arrived in England two years ago he and Javier Mascherano were billeted in a London hotel while the agent fixed them up with a club. Both players initially thought their destination might be Liverpool, Manchester or Arsenal.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">On the morning they were sent to East London, Tevez called a friend from Argentina and asked innocently: “Where is West Ham?”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Now, if Tevez, 24, sticks with MSI and things fall through with United he will not want any uncertainty over where he will end up. On the other hand, could he just sign a contract at United — and get himself a good lawyer?</p>
