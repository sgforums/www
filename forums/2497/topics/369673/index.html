              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez has held talks with Real Madrid target Xabi Alonso and has urged the midfielder to stay at Anfield.</p>
              <p>Spanish giants Real have made no secret of their
              desire to take the £35million-rated Reds star to the Bernabeu as they
              look to continue lavish summer spending.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have stood
              firm and refused to budge from their valuation of Alonso, despite the
              Spaniard admitting he was flattered by Real's interest.</p>
              <p><span class="lingo_link" style="cursor: pointer; display: inline; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12.1667px; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal;">Benitez</span><img id="lingo_icon" class="lingo_icon lingo_icon_black" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 0pt; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 12px; height: 12px; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline; cursor: pointer;" src="http://static.lingospot.com/spot/image/spacer.gif" alt=""> held talks with the 27-year-old on Friday during the Reds pre-season
              tour of Asia and has used supporters' admiration as an example of why
              he should stay.</p>
              <p>"I talked to Xabi yesterday and told him, as he
              can see here, that the fans love him and I said to him, 'maybe you have
              to stay," Benitez said on Saturday.</p>
              <p>"You can see he is a really
              good player and I'll be really pleased if he stays. All the players and
              his team-mates want him to stay. If we keep Xabi I will be very
              pleased."</p>
              <p>Alonso has received rapturous support from fans in
              Singapore and he is expected to play some part in Liverpool's game
              against the national team on Sunday.</p>

              <p>As things stand, Los Merengues last offer of €27 million has still received no response from Anfield but the paper has reported that negotiations between the two clubs reconvened yesterday.</p>

              <p>Xabi has already returned to San Sebastian in Spain to go on a three-day vacation with his family as Liverpool do not resume training until Thursday. He is expected to sort out his future by then.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>have reportedly given Real Madrid a 48-hour deadline to come up with the cash for Xabi Alonso. The Spain midfielder looks increasingly close to sealing a move to the Bernabeu and was photographed at Madrid's Barajas airport on Monday evening, hours after flying into England following Liverpool's Asian tour.</strong></p>
              <p>Madrid's long pursuit appears to have paid off, with reports in Spain suggesting Liverpool will accept less than £30million to sell both Alonso and right-back Alvaro Arbeloa to the club.</p>
              <p>Liverpool had started the summer demanding at least £40m for 27-year-old Alonso and had hoped to claim £8m for Arbeloa, 26, who has just a year left on his Anfield contract.</p>
              <p>But Madrid have dug in their heels and have warned they would not pay silly money despite splashing out almost £200m on Kaka, Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Raul Albiol.</p>
              <p>The Spanish giants' president Florentino Perez said: 'Some people obviously thought that because we said we wanted more Spanish players, they could ask for fees which don't correspond to reality.</p>

              <p>The two clubs are thought to be about £2.5m apart on Alonso after Liverpool dropped their demands to about £26m after the warnings from Perez.</p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez has grown tired of fielding questions about the transfer tug-of-war. Spanish newspaper <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">AS </span>says the Liverpool boss took Alonso to one side before they left Singapore and told him: 'I want you to resolve your situation as soon as possible, for better or worse.</p>
              <p>'Ideally the transfer is resolved in 48 hours. I need some time to find a replacement.'</p>
              <p>After Alonso reiterated his desire to leave, Benitez reportedly said he would not stand in the way and Madrid are confident of signing the former Real Sociedad player on a four-year deal.</p>
              <p>While Liverpool want to quickly resolve the issue, Madrid's difficulties in offloading players could prove a stumbling block.</p>
              <p>General director Jorge Valdano last week said there would have to be departures before anyone else was signed and that stance was reiterated on Monday by Perez, who pointed out they already had 29 first-team players vying to get in a squad of 25.</p>
              <p>Madrid fear <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham </span></a>will not follow up interest in Klaas-Jan Huntelaar following Harry Redknapp's capture of Peter Crouch from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/portsmouth.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Portsmouth</span></a>, while buyers have also not been forthcoming for Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Royston Drenthe, Alvaro Negredo, Mahamadou Diarra or Gabriel Heinze, among other out-of-favour players.</p>

              <p>Liverpool may already have seen the last of Alonso, who had been told not to report for training till Thursday. He quickly took the opportunity on Monday to leave for Spain, shortly after 16-hour trip from Singapore to England.</p>
              <p>Alonso flew into Barajas, apparently stopping there en route to San Sebastian where he has a home. Reports in Spain and Italy say Benitez has already lined up Roma's Alberto Aquilani as a replacement, with the cash-strapped club ready to sacrifice the 25-year-old international.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have also been linked to Inter Milan's Esteban Cambiasso and Marseille's Mathieu Valbuena, among others.</p>
