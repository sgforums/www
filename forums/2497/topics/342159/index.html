              <h2>Following Ajax's 3-0 win over ADO Den Haag in Holland today,
              Klaas-Jan Huntelaar bid farewell to his former club, as he prepares for
              life in Madrid.</h2>
              <p>It's been a long time coming but Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has finally said goodbye to Ajax, as he prepares to move to Real Madrid.<br><br>The
              Dutch striker has been rumoured to be moving for years now, and finally
              he will leave Holland, with the Spanish capital his destination.<br><br>Fittingly,
              he bid farewell to his former club today as they won 3-0 in the
              Eredivisie, and said the only regret is that he can't win silverware
              with them this season.<br><br>"It is a shame that I cannot finish the season with Ajax, because I wanted to win the title with the club," he told <em>Goal.com</em>.<br><br>The
              striker also spoke about his future club, saying that whilst he might
              have been signed when Bernd Schuster was in charge, he has had contact
              with the new coach.<br><br>"I have already spoken with Juande Ramos and that was nice," he mused.<br><br>"I
              also did so with Bernd Schuster but the interest from Madrid was not
              just from him, because they were interested in the past as well."<br><br>Huntelaar
              is set to play in the first game of the new year for Real Madrid, that
              pits them against Villarreal, but there has reportedly been problems
              regarding his participation in the Champions League.<br><br>With the
              side having to decide who to reigster for the competition he is
              apparently fighting for a place with Lassana Diarra, and today he
              talked briefly about the subject.<br><br>"I have to convince the club that I am the one who should play in the Champions League," he declared.<br><br>"I can play from the 4th January, so I have the whole month, because the deadline is not until the end."</p>
