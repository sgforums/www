              <p><strong>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has admitted he wanted to kill
              English referee Howard Webb after he awarded Austria an injury-time
              penalty in their Euro 2008 Group B match - though he said he was
              speaking as a fan and not in his political capacity.</strong></p>
              <p>'Today, I must speak as Prime Minister but last night my
              conversation was very different: I wanted to kill somebody...You know
              very well who, like every other Pole,' said Tusk.</p>
              <p>Webb's decision, which was called totally unjustified by Poland
              coach Leo Beenhakker, saw the co-hosts Austria pull off a 1-1 draw.</p>
              <p>The result severely dented Polish hopes of making the last eight as
              they and the Austrians have just a point and both need to beat Croatia,
              who have already qualified, and Germany on Monday if they are to have
              any chance.</p>
              <p>'Refereeing errors happen, of course, but this was especially galling. It was totally unjust. It wounded us all.</p>
              <p>'It would have been better to have lost this match in the first-half, when the Austrians had several good chances.</p>
              <p>'A heavy defeat after a normally refereed game is not as bad,' added
              Tusk, who is a keen football supporter and plays it regularly.</p>

              <p><strong>UEFA officials have backed Howard Webb following the Premier League referee's eventful first match at the European Championships. Webb awarded co-hosts Austria a last-gasp penalty at Ernst Happel Stadium when Mariusz Lewandowski wrestled with Sebastian Prodl, a decision Poland coach Leo Beenhakker believed was inconsistent with the rest of the tournament.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beenhakker revealed that each country was given a DVD telling them grappling would be targeted but Poland were the first in Euro 2008 to concede a penalty in that way. 'We don't think it is controversial that a player is pulled down by the shirt and a penalty is given,' said UEFA director of communications William Gaillard. 'It (Webb's decision) was certainly within the laws of the game.'</p>
              <p>Beenhakker accused Webb of trying to prove he was a 'big boy' following the 1-1 draw in Vienna, although Austria also had reason to be unhappy with the English officials as Poland's goal appeared to be offside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>UEFA's disciplinary body will judge whether Beenhakker faces action for his comments, while the referees' committee will decide if Webb and assistants Darren Cann and Michael Mullarkey will take charge of another game at the tournament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Given that England are not at the tournament, it was seen as an opportunity for Webb's team to stay at the tournament until the latter stages. Gaillard added: 'The referees' committee analyses all the games and makes the appointments according to its own analyses and we don't interfere with the way they are managing officials in this tournament.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'For sure there is a better chance to referee the final matches as his national team is not there but that is a statistical chance. 'I wouldn't speculate about the decisions of our referees' committee.'</p>
