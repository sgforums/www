Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer told German newspaper Bild that if an offer of that size was tabled "we would have to think about it". Beckenbauer added: "That is a figure that would allow us to be active in the transfer market."<br><br>Hargreaves has just been told that he is not ready to return to full training as he recovers from a broken leg. The 25-year-old sustained the injury in a league match against Arminia Bielefeld in September and had hoped to return in January. But he is now unlikely to be ready to play against Borussia Dortmund when the Bundesliga restarts after its winter break on 26 January.<br><br>Hargreaves had hoped to return to full training with his Bayern team-mates, who are on a training camp in Dubai. However, tests on his leg revealed the healing process was not as advanced as previously predicted and he will instead only take part in light training.<br><br>Hargreaves has been repeatedly linked with United over recent months - with the player admitting he would relish a move to Old Trafford. Bayern had previously stated that they would not sell a player who last season signed a contract to keep him at the club until 2010. And Beckenbauer added: "It is normal to want to keep a player who has just extended his contract and who only wants to join another club because they will pay him better."<br><br>Hargreaves has always maintained that his desire to play in the Premiership is not motivated by money. The England midfielder said: "It's about the opportunity to possibly play in another league I haven't played in before, which is also the country I represent and where my family lives.<br><br>"It's not like I'm saying I want to go to AC Milan or Inter Milan because they're offering me more money. "It's because it's England and because Britain is where my family is. My parents and my brothers are in Canada, but the whole of my dad's side of the family is in Bolton and my mum's side is in Rhyl.<br><br>"I think some people don't realise that. They think I'm half-German or something, but I'm not. I was brought up by a British family. It just happened to be in Canada."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just pay whatever they want and get it over with... Hargreaves will be worth the money if not this season, next year for sure... If a player can out perform Lampard and Garrerd in the England midfield... should be good enough, just need time to settle into a new team thats all. Its not as if they can't afford him... just use the money they got from that john guy to chelsea to offset it and pay the balance only what...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

But he could leave at the end of the season.<br><br>Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer hinted the England midfielder would move to Old Trafford in January if United came up with Â£20million for him. But sporting director Uli Hoeness told a German newspaper a switch was not on the cards.<br><br>When asked if he would let Hargy go, Hoeness said: Â“Definitely not in this winter transfer window. Â“WeÂ’ll have to wait and see about everything else. Â“WeÂ’re working on putting together a new team for next season. Â“And, at some point, the question will be raised whether Owen is indispensable. In any event, weÂ’ve got all the aces.Â”<br><br>Hargreaves, 25, broke his leg in September but is on the mend. He wants a move after United boss Fergie made a bid to sign him following the World Cup, despite only recently signing a new deal to stay until 2010.<br><br></div>

Hargreaves said: Â“It is a lot of money they are talking about. Is it even realistic? But football is a crazy world and ridiculous sums are paid.  Â“Right now, I donÂ’t want to think about that. I just want to think about playing football, working hard and doing well.Â”<br><br>Bayern general manager Uli Hoeness insists the club would struggle to replace Hargreaves if they sold him this month. He said: Â“At this moment, Hargreaves will stay. But then it is up to the board whether we sell him. We donÂ’t want to lose him.  Â“We are not a bank and we want success with our best players.<br><br>"Owen is a very skilful defensive player and there are not many of his calibre around. It would be crazy to sell him at this moment as he is not replaceable.  "We would have to start buying players and nobody knows how much it would cost to get the same.Â”<br><br>Hargreaves, 25, is in Dubai at BayernÂ’s winter training camp as he continues his recovery from a broken leg. He added: Â“All the other things will take care of themselves Â— it is not down to me. Â“Everything will fall into place but at the moment I have other priorities and that is to get healthy. I just want to come back and play football.Â”<br><br></div>
