            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/2001_smith_header.jpg"><br><br><strong>A TEENAGE model has revealed how she romped with soccer ace Alan Smith in a toilet at a wild England bash the night before the crucial Croatia game. Sophie Bovington-Kerr was one of a group of beauties who secretly partied with the squad that flopped in front of millions in the Euro 2008 qualifier 3-2 defeat at Wembley.</strong><br><br>And she tells how Â£6 million Newcastle midfielder Smith's mind wasn't on the biggest match for yearsÂ—or his on-off girlfriend Holly WorthingtonÂ— when he homed in to score with the 18-year-old. "He was still wearing the England kit he'd trained in that day when he took me into the loo. He pushed me into the cubicle, pulled his shorts down and had oral sex with me," says Sophie.<br><br>"We'd swapped numbers and even after I'd left the hotel later he bombarded me with texts far into the night asking me to come back and go to bed with him."<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/slidecenter/2001_smithgirl/smith_slide_polaroid.jpg"><br><br>FA bosses have tried to draw a veil over the scandal after sacking coach Steve McClaren and ushering in a new era with Italian Fabio CapelloÂ—but last night Sophie broke her silence to tell the News of the World: "It was the night before the biggest game of some of these players' lives and all they were after was sex with me and my friends.<br><br>"I couldn't believe the way they were behaving. All I could think was, Â‘In less than 24 hours you lot will be at Wembley with the whole country willing you on to win'." Sophie and her pals had just finished a photoshoot at Watford's five-star Grove Hotel where the team were based on November 20.<br><br>They sneaked into the VIP area reserved for superstars. Smith was among other bored squad players hoping some girls would turn up. When Â£50,000-a-week star Smith, 27, saw Sophie he made a beeline for her. "I'd met him in the players' lounge after the Brazil game last June and just thought he was really arrogant and rude. He was so full of himself," said Sophie.<br><br>"He'd strutted around and gave the impression he could sleep with me just because he's a footballer. But that night we talked properly and I really liked him." He then asked the pretty brunette for her phone number. "Twenty seconds later he sent me a text saying, Â‘Meet me in the toilets in five minutes' and he left the room. I didn't go because I know what footballers are like.<br><br>"Then I got another message saying, Â‘Go to the toilets' He kept going out of the room and expected me to follow him." By 8.30pm Sophie needed the loo. When she opened the door to come out, Smith was waiting for her. "He pushed me back in the cubicle and said, Â‘I want to talk to you'. "Then he started kissing me passionately. His hands were everywhereÂ—on my thighs and on my bum. He said I had an amazing body and how much he wanted to have sex with me. The game was the last thing on his mind.<br><br>"The thing I really remember was that he was still wearing his England kit that he'd trained in a few hours earlier. "He pulled his shorts down and I gave him oral sex. He was pressed up against the wall and was obviously enjoying itÂ—but I didn't feel comfortable about it."<br><br>Former Old Trafford ace Smith also sent Sophie a string of texts AFTER she left the hotel. No early night before the big match for himÂ—he bombarded her with messages until 1am telling her to come back and begging her to have sex with him in the five-star hotel's exclusive spa and fitness suite.<br><br>Sophie said: "I didn't go back. I couldn't believe this was an England international on the eve of a big game. Thousands of people would give their right arm to be in his position." Astonishingly at 3.47pm the next dayÂ—just over four hours before the kick-offÂ—Smith sent her another explicit message, saying: "Wish I cud meet u. What wud u want me to do on that table?" And he was still trying it on weeks later.<br><br>Smith didn't earn an England cap against Croatia. He wasn't even on the subs' bench for the game. But he clearly couldn't forget his match with Sophie. She got another text on Christmas Day at 3.48pm saying: "What u doing now naughty? I'm really horny."<br><br>It is not the first time the FA has launched an investigation into sex scandals at The Grove. On the eve of England's 3-0 win over Estonia on October 12 a married star disgraced himself after being caught by an official having sex in a side room with another model.<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/2001_smith_03.jpg"><br><br>And last year we revealed how some senior players indulged in a drunken party for Chelsea star Shaun Wright-Phillips' birthday at a lapdancing club between two crucial Euro 2008 qualifiers. At the sleazy bash one senior England star had sex with a girl in full view of other partygoers in the club's basement at 4am.<br><br><strong>Begged</strong><br><br>Captain John Terry, who is paid Â£100,000 a week, was so drunk he urinated on the floor and another player begged two lapdancers for a threesome. Sophie was invited to that party at the club in Soho's Wardour Street, on October 27, and was pictured with Terry, 27, wearing a striped blue and white polo shirt. She said: "It was a horrible, drunken party.<br><br>"The players were all knocking back champagne and vodka." Sophie was at the hotel with her pal, student Katharyn Mann, to do a photo shoot for bre.ast cancer charity The Perfectly Pink Company. Also there were blondes Adele Cable and Lisa Turner who run the company and use England superstars to pose with models wearing their fashion line.<br><br>The girls were supposed to leave the team hotel after the photoshoot at 7pm. But they were sneaked into the private booths in a sectioned-off VIP area. FA bosses have now put a stop to any photoshoots with female models the night before international matches.<br><br></div>
