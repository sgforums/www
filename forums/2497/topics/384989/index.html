              <p><strong>A JOINT SingTel-Starhub bid has failed to secure them the rights to
              the 2010 Fifa World Cup, a joint press statement from them said.</strong></p>
              <p>The
              statement said that this was in spite the fact that the bid 'would
              provide Fifa with an increase in value from four years ago for the
              rights to the 2010 Fifa World Cup, while ensuring that it would remain
              affordable to the broadest number of our customers'.</p>
              <p>'In
              an attempt to reach a value that is acceptable to Fifa to bring World
              Cup to Singapore, the price offered to Fifa would sacrifice all World
              Cup margins for both SingTel and StarHub while keeping the price
              affordable for consumers,' the statement went on to say. 'However, we
              have yet to reach an agreement with Fifa.'</p>
              <p>Earlier
              this month, The Straits Times reported that at least 202 countries have
              received the green light from Fifa to beam June 2010's World Cup
              football matches in their territories, but not Singapore.</p>
              <p>It
              was thought at that time that the two parties had submitted two rival
              bids but from today's press statement it is clear that it was a joint
              bid. There is big money riding on these broadcast rights.The matches
              are expected to attract a total of 29 billion viewers worldwide.</p>
              <p>The
              only silver lining in the clouds for viewers in Singapore is Fifa's
              ruling to make four of the most important World Cup games free-to-air.
              The opening game between host South Africa and Mexico on June 11, the
              semi-finals on July 6 and 7, and the final on July 11 will be available
              for free.</p>

              <p>Base on the report, we should be ready to expect them to price it higher than the last time at $25.75 or something like that right?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>SINGAPORE: Nothing, it seems, will stop Singapore football fans from catching the South African World Cup live on television next year, with fans saying they are willing to pay more to watch the month—long tournament on television from June 11.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In a report on Tuesday, it was revealed that FIFA and joint—bidders SingTel and StarHub have yet to come to an agreement over broadcast fees, which industry sources say have tripled since the Germany World Cup in 2006.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But over 200 countries have already reached an agreement with the football’s world governing body, with Malaysia’s only pay—TV, Astro, sealing theirs more than a year ago.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It is likely fans will resort to crossing the Causeway or to other neighbouring countries come June, or even tap into Malaysian and Indonesian free—to—air television to watch all 64 matches in the World Cup, if the telcos fail to secure the rights to beam them live here.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"I really don’t mind paying more, $30 to $50 extra for the World Cup, which comes only every four years, is not a lot," said Richard Neubronner, who is backing Brazil and England.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"But I hope SingTel and StarHub will let us know early if they will show the matches live. The World Cup falls during the peak school holidays and if they are not showing the matches, I need to book my air tickets and hotel to probably Thailand before they are all fully booked. Might as well go for a holiday at the same time."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Agreeing, teacher Eugene Ng, who is backing Spain, said football—crazy fans will absorb a one—time increase in fees for the World Cup if they have to but added it must also make business sense to the two telcos.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"I think from a business point of view it is quite easy to sympathise with SingTel and StarHub," said the 29—year—old.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"I don’t think it is really their duty to bring the World Cup to us. They need to make a profit as well but I hope they will make it fair for us if they are going to charge us. I don’t mind paying up to $30 more or I will find another way through the Internet to watch the games."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Fans across the Causeway are not caught in a similar dilemma as they won’t be charged extra to watch the World Cup matches.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Astro’s head of sports C K Lee said the company paid about three times more for the broadcast rights than four years ago but besides commercial reasons, considers it a national service.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The pay—TV company have about 2.3 million subscribers and the matches will be accessible to those who have already opted for their RM$67 sports package.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"I think all broadcasters had expected to pay more for this World Cup," said Lee. "For us, to keep our subscriber base, we consider it a worthwhile cost to pay for the television rights because it is the biggest sporting event in the world."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">With six months to go before the big kick—off in South Africa, World Sports Group chief operating officer Andrew Georgiou is confident that cooler heads will prevail.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"I am 100 per cent confident that FIFA and the telcos will find a way to make it work at a price that the market will pay. In my opinion, there will be little chance for the World Cup not being broadcast in Singapore. It is not in FIFA or the television networks’ interest," said Georgiou.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Responding to further queries, both SingTel and StarHub they will pursue to secure the rights from FIFA.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"The 2010 FIFA World Cup will be aired by free—to—air broadcasters in some markets, so pay TV is not the only option. Nonetheless, we are interested to secure the telecast rights of the World Cup and will continue to negotiate with FIFA in an attempt to reach an agreement, so as to make the event available to the broadest number of our customers," they said.</p>

              <p>its not a matter of price, as I am sure consumers can afford to pay. but are they treating us as a money tree to tap on? they I mean FIFA, Singtel and Starhub.</p>
