            <div class='col-md body'>Howard could be back at Man U next season<br><br>Alex Ferguson has revealed Tim Howard could still have a future at Manchester United.<br><br>When he loaned the United States keeper out to Everton for the season, then did a deal with West Brom that will eventually lead to the permanent signing of Tomasz Kuszczak, it looked like Ferguson felt HowardÂ’s time at Old Trafford was at an end.<br><br>Although the 27-year-old was an instant hit following his arrival from Major League Soccer outfit New York Metrostars in 2003, he subsequently made a series of high-profile mistakes in big games and spent virtually all of last season on the bench as understudy to Edwin van der Sar.<br><br>However, since arriving on Merseyside, HowardÂ’s form has returned.<br><br>He will lose his ever-present record on Wednesday when Everton visit United due to the rules preventing loan signings appearing against their parent clubs.<br><br>But he has already provided Ferguson with some evidence he could have a future with the Red Devils after all.<br><br>Â“Tim has been doing really well at Everton, which is what we hoped for,Â” said Ferguson.<br><br>Â“The potential has always been there because he has great elasticity, he is brave, has a good spring and is an excellent distributor of the ball. All he needed was the experience, and now he is getting it. I have spoken to David Moyes and he is delighted at how Tim has been playing. But it is certainly a possibility he could come back to us, no question about that.Â”<br><br>With Howard consigned to the stands, Richard Wright will come into the Everton starting line-up.<br><br>Star striker Andrew Johnson is also missing with a hamstring injury but United duo Cristiano Ronaldo and Louis Saha are also facing a battle for fitness.<br><br>Both men limped off before the end of SundayÂ’s draw with Chelsea, leaving Ferguson facing a potential striking nightmare.<br><br>Even though Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Park Ji-sung are set to return to training this week, neither can be considered after long absences with hamstring and ankle injuries respectively, while Alan Smith hardly appears fit enough to start after being put on a personal fitness regime.<br><br>It could leave former Everton star Wayne Rooney as FergusonÂ’s only recognised orthodox striker, emphasising a lack of depth to the squad which has been highlighted by some as one of UnitedÂ’s major disadvantages in their title duel with Chelsea.<br><br>Ryan Giggs could be pressed into an emergency forward role in a game which tends to be hard fought and which Everton boast a decent record having drawn at Old Trafford for the past two seasons.<br><br>However, as Giggs is only too aware, having established a three-point lead at the Premiership summit the Red Devils can hardly afford to slip up now.<br><br>Â“It is a local derby and it is always a tight game,Â” the Wales skipper told MUTV.<br><br>Â“But we need to keep the consistency going because if we are going to win the league, we have to be beating teams like Everton at home. Our performances over the last few weeks have been really good and we can approach the game with confidence. If we produce our best form, hopefully it will be enough to get us the three points.Â”</div>
