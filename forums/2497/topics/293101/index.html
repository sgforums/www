IMHO, he is my pick to take over, england will turn into brazilian style, more attacking, u see portugal, more of a strong midfield team, eg ronaldo, deco, maniche, nani, so he can surely make good use of england, strong in mid.<br>hiddink. good and can take a lousy team like korea and aus. but imagine eng was russia, and they lost to isreal, when they got a chance to qualify, sure the media whack him like KNNBCCB. but have to wait for euro to end<br>capello. even more boring italian style into the lions, but sure got success lor. u can tahan the boring style then hire.<br>klinsmann. solid guy. but i think he needs an interpretator, as he cnt speak eng?<br>rijkaard. i am not sure if he is leaving barca(at least until the season ends), but he is also not that type suited for the england, where he has skillful players at his disposal.<br><br>1)luiz felipe scolari<br>2)marco van basten(young manager BUT proven, and must wait for euro to end, i include him as he is the best young manager ard)<br>3) dider deschamps( he went to CHAMPS league final with monaco leh, not uefa cup)(s'more now unemployed)<br>4) jurgen klinsmann.<br>5)martin o'neill ( best brit, if the FA is considering one)<br>IMO i dun care much about the nationality<strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LETTER OF THE WEEK<br><br>Shearer not ready yet<br><br>Shearer was undoubtedly a top marksman for both club and country. However, goals alone cannot automatically transform Shearer into a successful manager overnight. Sir Bobby Charlton, England's all-time top goalscorer, had a wretched spell with Preston North End and Wigan Athletic after he swapped his boots for the managerial tracksuit in the 1970s. The English FA should resist calling up Shearer because he has an unproven track record at club level.<br><br>Rather, the English FA would do well to employ Harry Redknapp. He has over 20 years of managerial experience during which he turned his teams' fortunes immediately. This is crucial especially for the unforgiving, fickle and impatient English supporters and media. Also, he has devised a pleasant, effective playing style with Pompey despite fielding players from diverse countries like Senegal, Croatia, Portugal and England. Thus, he make English players from various clubs play as a cohesive unit. Not only is he capable of handling temperamental players like Paolo DiCanio, he has also nurtured current England internationals like Michael Carrick, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard and Rio Ferdinand who would be delighted to play for their mentor again.<br><br>Fathie Abdat, 26, researcher-student, Manchester United fan<br><br>em Harry redknapp<br>OMG, didnt we learn enuff from McClown mistake<br><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/sports/story/0,4136,148673,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/sports/story/0,4136,148673,00.html?</a><br><br>if stupidity has a cure...</div>

It's just that the manager just cannot gel them together and get the best out of them. It is a challenging job to bond the players and play as a team, given the few international matches, resulting in much lesser time as a team. The previous managers just cannot overcome this constrain.</div>
