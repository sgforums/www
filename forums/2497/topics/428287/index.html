              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Lack of success: Fabregas says Spanish clubs would not have been as patient as Arsenal have with Wenger</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Cesc Fabregas has risked the wrath of Arsene Wenger with a damning assessment of </strong></span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>'s six-year trophy drought.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As the Gunners prepare for Wednesday's derby at Tottenham, Fabregas dared to question his manager's grand project and called on the club's new owners to choose between nurturing talent or winning silverware.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He also discussed his own future, insisting he will never leave for another English team, but left the door open for a return to his native Barcelona if Arsenal fail to  convince him they are going in the right direction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fabregas said: 'If you went to Spain and said to Pep Guardiola (the Barca manager), Jose Mourinho (Real Madrid) or Unai Emery (Valencia) they would have three years without a trophy, it would be obvious they would not continue. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'But here it is different, the  manager is intelligent and the club value different things: that the team is always in the Champions League, that we compete until the end, that we have young players, economic stability. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'But I imagine there will be a moment when you have to decide: do you win things or not?'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fabregas swapped the Nou Camp for north London in 2003 just as Wenger's 'Invincibles' were embarking on an unbeaten Barclays Premier League campaign. He won the FA Cup in 2005 and reached the Champions League final a year later but the 2-1 defeat by Barcelona in Paris proved the first of many disappointments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'From 2007 on I started to say, "We don't win but we play very well",' said Fabregas. 'After that, you realise it doesn't work. You enjoy it during a part of the season, like this year, when we were in four different competitions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'And you say, "Here, I have it all". But then you cannot make the final step and it is here where a decision has to be made: to go out to win or to develop players.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fabregas reflects on how Wenger dismantled the 2004 champions, leaving the 23-year-old and Robin van Persie to inherit the responsibilities normally shouldered by more senior players. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Without a doubt, the Invincibles team is the best I have ever played in,' said Fabregas, who is about to complete his third season as  captain. 'You felt that if you had a bad game, nothing happened because your team-mates helped you. Those players made you better. Now a lot has changed and I am the man everyone looks to.  I don't like to say it but it is true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'If I play badly, I take the responsibility and the pressure of the supporters. It is not something I am used to but I am captain, so it is reality. Only me and Van Persie remain of that generation, and we have a lot of responsibility.'</span></p>
              <p><span><br></span></p>

              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>When he arrived, Fabregas looked up to Patrick Vieira, who added his voice to those criticising Arsenal's approach last week. 'They play the best football in England yet they fail to win anything significant,' said Vieira. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Despite Manchester United's failure to beat Newcastle, Arsenal must win at White Hart Lane to revive a wilting title challenge. In recent weeks they have lost the Carling Cup final  and gone out of the FA Cup and Champions League. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fabregas feels a great personal responsibility for his side's defeat in Europe by Barcelona last month. 'I'm 70 per cent responsible for Arsenal's Champions League exit,' he said. 'I picked up a knock after 14 minutes and my world just collapsed. I should have left the pitch but I was selfish and ended up paying the price as I didn't play well and we lost.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Nonetheless, the collapse on four fronts is unlikely to persuade Fabregas to invest much more time at the Emirates. He sought to leave last summer and this interview, with Don Balon in Spain, could easily be construed as part of a wider exit strategy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'The day I leave Arsenal it will be with my head, not just because...' said Fabregas. 'You have to wait for the right moment. Who says you will play in your new team? Or that you will develop? Here I have a lot of luck on a personal level - despite not winning a lot - and I am doing very well.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I speak with (Barcelona captain) Carles Puyol, who says that he didn't win a thing until he was 26. Puyol, who has won everything there is to win! Patience and hard work are the most important things in life. <br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'If one day I leave Arsenal, it will never be to sign for another English club. That is for certain.'</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Furious Spanish football magazine <span style="font-style: italic;">Don Balon</span> have hit back at accusations by Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger that they manipulated an interview with Cesc Fabregas.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger said his midfielder’s words were ‘completely twisted’ after the Spaniard said the Gunners have to bring in experienced players if they want to win trophies.</p>
              <p>Fabregas also appeared to suggest that the Arsenal boss would have been sacked as a result of the club’s six-year trophy drought had he been in charge of a team in Spain. </p>
              <p>However, Wenger claimed the article misrepresented his player and that the author<br>reneged on an agreement to provide Arsenal with the chance to approve it.</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Don Balon</span> denied such an agreement was in place and uploaded the audio of the interview on their website.</p>
              <p>A statement from the weekly publication said: ‘We made a pact with the club that, if it<br>were necessary, we would let them see the interview and make changes if they desired. When they asked for it, it was already in print but we sent it to them regardless.</p>
              <p>‘Revised or not, <span style="font-style: italic;">Don Balon</span> would not have changed a single word of the article because it was completely faithful and respectful to the words of Cesc Fabregas.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Fabregas also suggests in the audio transcript that he feels Wenger is not playing him in his best position, a point not in the original article. </strong></p>
              <p>He said: ‘I still think my best position is slightly deeper. I’m better with the game in front of me. It’s not that I’m uncomfortable playing where I’m playing. I don’t touch the<br>ball so much, but I’ve got the chance to play the final pass more.’</p>
              <p>Fabregas praised teenager Jack Wilshere, saying: ‘I wish I had the strength he has in  his legs even now. He is going to be a great player.’ </p>
