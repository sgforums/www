              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Sepp Blatter was facing renewed calls for his resignation on Wednesday night after dismissing on-pitch racism - just as the FA charged Luis Suarez over allegations he racially abused Patrice Evra. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>In a statement the FA said Liverpool's Suarez had been charged for allegedly making 'a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra'. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>At the same time, England captain John Terry remains the subject of an FA inquiry and a formal Metropolitan Police investigation into claims that he racially abused Anton Ferdinand at Loftus Road last month. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But when FIFA president Blatter was asked for his view on the issue in a series of interviews, he gave an astonishing response. </span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Asked directly by a CNN reporter if racism exists on the pitch, Blatter denied it and said such incidents should simply be settled by a handshake at the end of the match. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I would deny it,' he said. 'There is no racism, there is maybe one of the players towards another, he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one, but also the one who is affected by that, he should say that this is a game.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'We are in a game, and at the end of the game, we shake hands, and this can happen. On the field of play sometimes you say something that is not very correct, but then at the end of the game you have the next game where you can behave better.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>To a reporter from Al-Jazeera he simply compounded the situation.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'During a match you may say something to somebody who is not exactly looking like you,' he said. 'But at the end... it's forgotten.' </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Blatter first tried to repair the  damage on his official Twitter page, without much success. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>After that FIFA released an official statement on their website. Blatter, alongside a  picture of him embracing a black man, claimed his comments had been 'misunderstood'. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>His statement said: 'The statement said: 'I would like to make it very clear, I am committed to the fight against racism and any type of discrimination in football and in society.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I have been personally leading this battle against racism in football, which FIFA has been fighting against throughout the past years through campaigns in all of our competitions such as the 'Say no to racism' campaign.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I also know that racism unfortunately continues to exist in football, and I have never denied this. I know that it is a big problem in society, and that it also affects sport.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I strongly believe that we should continue to fight all together against racism on and off the field of play, in order to eradicate this plague.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'My comments have been misunderstood. What I wanted to express is that, as football players, during a match, you have 'battles' with your opponents, and sometimes things are done which are wrong. But, normally, at the end of the match, you apologise to your opponent if you had a confrontation during the match, you shake hands, and when the game is over, it is over.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Anyone who has played a football match, or a match in any sport, knows that this is the case.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Having said that, I want to stress again that I do not want to diminish the dimension of the problem of racism in society and in sport. I am committed to fighting this plague and kicking it out of football.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Last night, the latest storm to engulf FIFA's president was being digested by Sports Minister Hugh Robertson and the FA. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But there was condemnation from Football Against Racism In Europe, who described Blatter's comments as 'insensitive and not what you want to hear from someone who should be leading the game'. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>PFA chief Gordon Taylor condemned Blatter's comments, saying: 'It's very insensitive and inappropriate at this time. As the president of FIFA he's got to be shouting from the top of the hills that it's unacceptable.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said racism does still exist in football and that they would continue to strive to eradicate it.<br><br>He told CNN: 'Racism exists in the world, racism certainly still exists in football, albeit reduced. There are still issues, of course there are and we're not complacent about that, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to say it doesn't exist because it does.'</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Asked about the two FA investigations into allegations of on-pitch racism Scudamore added: 'The English game has led and has been at the forefront of reducing incidents of racist behaviour, it's totally unacceptable.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'Everybody in the game in England understands it's totally unacceptable, we have that reputation and as far as I'm aware that reputation is still intact until proven otherwise.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'But of course the game will deal with whatever is thrown against it. There is no place for it in football let alone in England and we will continue to strive to eradicate it.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Rio Ferdinand, the former England captain and brother of Anton, was one of several footballers to express his considerable dismay on his Twitter page. </span></p>
