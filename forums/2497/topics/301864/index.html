            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/10_01/PienaarCele_468x322.jpg"><br><br>Everton have risked sparking a major row with South Africa by refusing to release Steven Pienaar for African Nations Cup duty.<br><br>It was expected the midfielder would join up with the Bafana Bafana squad for the African Cup of Nations tournament in Ghana after Saturday's FA Cup home defeat by Oldham.<br><br>But on Monday, despite claims earlier to the contrary, Pienaar was still at Everton's Finch Farm training ground and boss David Moyes intends to play him in Tuesday's Carling Cup semi-final first leg at Chelsea.<br><br>Everton are determined to maximise world governing body FIFA's 14-day ruling for the release of players for international duty.<br><br>The tournament begins on January 20 but as South Africa do not play their first game against Angola until January 23, the club believe they are entitled to extra time with the player.<br><br>Moyes said: "We have looked carefully at the rule and it's not clear whether the 14 days applies to the first match for South Africa or the opening date of the competition.<br><br>"We believe that 14 days should apply to South Africa's first match. I have spoken to the South Africa manager [Carlos Alberto Parreira] and they are clearly not pleased.<br><br>"But we have invoked the 14-day rule and intend to use Pienaar against Chelsea. That to my mind means that he can then join up with South Africa within the 14 days."<br><br>FIFA insist however that the regulations state clubs must release players 14 days before the start of the tournament.<br><br>A FIFA spokesman said: "It is very clear that the regulations refer to the opening match of the tournament.<br><br>"Clubs must release players 14 days before the opening of the competition, not the first match of the team concerned."<br><br>Everton's stance is likely to cause major conflict with South Africa, but Moyes added: "We pay the players' wages and believe we are within our rights to keep him here to play against Chelsea in the first leg."<br><br>Everton have already been given permission by Nigeria to keep Ayegbeni Yakubu and Joseph Yobo in England to play against Chelsea, but initially South Africa refused that request, hence the club's tough stance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Toffees lose out in Pienaar bid</strong><br><br>Earlier on Monday Toffees boss David Moyes had invoked the 14-day rule and insisted the South African international would not have to travel to join up with his country's African Cup of Nations squad until Wednesday.<br><br>Moyes' view was that FIFA regulations did not make it clear whether players should be released 14 days ahead of the start of the competition, or 14 days ahead of a specific country's first match.<br><br>The tournament starts in Ghana on January 20, but South Africa's first match is not until January 23 against Angola.<br><br>Pienaar was expected to fly to Pretoria on Sunday, but trained with Everton at their Finch Farm complex on Monday.<br><br>But by mid-afternoon, South Africa had formally asked FIFA to intervene, and Everton were contacted by the world's governing body and told their interpretation of the rule was wrong and that Pienaar should be released immediately.<br><br>An Everton spokesman said: "Steven will be going to London today, but not to Stamford Bridge. He will be flying out from Heathrow.<br><br>"We have been contacted by FIFA and told he has to be released by us ahead of the Chelsea match."</div>
