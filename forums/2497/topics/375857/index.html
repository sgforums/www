              <p>Adebayor sprinted the length of the field after scoring against his former club, leading to a Football Association charge over the scenes. </p>
              <p>'I've got no time for people kicking anybody or being violent on the football pitch and he was wrong to run the length of the field,' Redknapp said. 'But it's very difficult when you're getting abuse throughout the game like he was.</p>

              <p>'Adebayor went over the top but, at the same time, he was getting a lot of abuse from the fans for the whole afternoon,' he said.   </p>

              <p class="small bold"><em>HITTING BACK ... Emmanuel Adebayor explains his actions against Arsenal last week and believes he was fully justified to taunt Arsenal </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR believes he was fully justified to taunt Arsenal fans because of the abuse he received from them. The Manchester City striker angered Gunners supporters by running the length of the Eastlands pitch to celebrate his goal in a 4-2 win over his former club on Saturday.</h2>
              <p class="article">Adebayor's actions led to a booking and an improper conduct charge from the FA, despite apologising straight after the game. But he has revealed why he did it - to ram the vile chants from fans back down their throats.</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor, who left the Emirates with Kolo Toure in the summer, said: "People talk about us as being football players and the money we earn, but just because we are fortunate it does not mean we need to take abuse.</p>
              <p class="article">"If you were to abuse a man in the street for over an hour he would react and it would be a worse reaction than a goal celebration! "There is only so much abuse a man can take until he reaches breaking point. "I was being abused by people who six months ago were singing my name and the abuse was for no reason.</p>
              <p class="article">"I scored and I wanted to show people it is not a good idea to abuse me. I really didn't understand it at all. "They were clapping Kolo but they were shouting personal abuse at me before the match even kicked off."</p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal fans turned against Adebayor towards the end of his time in North London and chants aimed his way on Saturday were personal and targeted his family.</p>
              <p class="article">The £25million hitman, who claims he suffered 60 minutes of non-stop abuse, said: "I was running on pure emotion and when you take emotion out of football we are going to have a big problem.</p>
              <p class="article">"People say I had time to think because I ran the length of the pitch but that is not true. "I was abused all match and scored a goal I knew would win the game for us. Ten seconds is nothing. Your emotion is going to last a lot longer than that."</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor says the Arsenal fans were wrong to react the way they did following his celebration. There was a surge to the front of the away section and a steward needed hospital treatment after being knocked unconscious by a flying object.</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor, whose 80th-minute header put City 3-1 up at the weekend, said: "I know a steward got hurt and I really do want to say sorry for that because he didn't ask for any of this - he was just a man doing his job.</p>
              <p class="article">"Emotions were running high for me and it is obvious they were for Arsenal fans as well. "They had just seen me score the goal that meant they had lost the game and that was very hard for them to take. "The steward was just doing his job but if things hadn't been thrown and people had stayed in their seats then that wouldn't have happened.</p>
              <p class="article">"Players should feel like they can celebrate a goal without the fear of being hit by things. "I think, in terms of class on the pitch, we have overtaken Arsenal and that was a reason for some of the hostility."</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor has been banned for three games for stamping on Robin van Persie's face in the game. Fuming Van Persie released a 200-word statement blasting his former strike partner. But, while Adebayor is not contesting the violent conduct rap, he still insists it was an accidental clash.</p>
              <p class="article">The Togo international, 25, said: "I am sorry Robin got hurt but I can't regret something I did not mean to do. "Anybody who knows me knows I would not set out to hurt anybody and I would especially not mean to hurt an old team-mate.</p>
              <p class="article">"I really am glad Robin was OK because I know my stud was close to his eye but there was really nothing I could have done - there was no way I could have got out of the way in time."</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor says he was wound up ahead of the Premier League game after being snubbed by some of his old Gunners team-mates. He explained: "There were players from Arsenal who refused to shake my hand before the match. "I don't want to give you their names - that is not my style - but there's more than one of them.</p>
              <p class="article">"My friends, like Eboue, were fine with me. They are decent people. But I could not understand some of the Arsenal players being disrespectful towards me. "These are people I have spent a lot of time with and people I thought were my friends. "I can just about understand the fans' reaction because they don't know the full story.</p>
              <p class="article">"However the way some of the players behaved is just crazy. "When a man offers you his hand, you shake it. For them to act like that was a disgrace."</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor also insists he never asked boss Arsene Wenger to let him leave the Emirates last season. He said: "I'm not sure if the fans understand what happened during the end of my time at Arsenal but I have done nothing wrong.</p>
              <p class="article">"An offer came in for me and, as I understand it, Arsene and the club accepted the offer the same day. It was not my fault I left, it was Arsene who wanted to accept the offer for me. "I wasn't making any comments in the Press about wanting to leave or being unhappy, it was the club who wanted to sell me yet I am being abused by the fans who once cheered me.</p>
              <p class="article">"It makes no sense. Arsenal fans just don't have the full picture. "I have said many times I enjoyed my time at the club and I scored a lot of goals. "If they were unhappy with me leaving they need to take it up with their manager and their board because I had nothing to do with the sale.</p>
              <p class="article">"Arsene has said many things in the Press but I only take notice of those who matter to me. "I read his comments but, as the tattoo on my arm says, 'Only God can judge me' not Arsene Wenger."</p>
              <p class="article">Adebayor has to wait until the end of April for his return to the Emirates in the league. He can expect a rough reception - but the African will not duck out of it as he believes City will be in contention to win the title.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "People have asked me if they think I might be rested for the return match but I hope there is no chance. "I am not the sort of man to shy away from things, I am not scared or intimidated by such things.</p>
              <p class="article">"I hope by the time the Emirates match comes round we are still very much fighting for the title at City and we are even leading the Premier League."</p>

              <p>when it was time to get a new contract for Henry, Arsenal paid up what he was worth..</p>
              <p>same with Fabregas..</p>
              <p>and most of all, they performed..</p>
              <p>ade.. could not be stuffed..</p>
              <p>if he was treated that way, his anger is understandable..</p>
              <p>however his childish behaviour is laughable and idiotic..</p>
              <p>and his violence and vindictive behaviour, trying to hurt fellow professionals, is abhorrant and shows that he is a despicable lowlife..</p>

              <p>and arsenal fans. don't forget to blame urself, who is the one crying and booing at ade.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he did perform, and ask for a wages rise. is that so much?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its like you perform in your work, and you are not being well rewarded. how would you feel?</p>
              <p>then ur co. sold you to another co. so that the boss can cont being obsessed with the kids.</p>
              <p>then for the whole fggin match u being boo against by your former working mates..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>unconsiderate idiots.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>well obviously u r not an arsenal fans. you dont watch the arsenal game in and out. if u consider his performance last season as decent, go watch the last season EPL and champion league matches which he feature in. he perform when he feel like it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd mistake.</p>
              <p>arsenal did increase his wages last season. yet, he still show the bochap attitude and work hard when he feel like it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3rd mistake,</p>
              <p>if your kbkb about your salary, your boss up your salary. and you still perform poorly( maybe not as much as  another MNC). you started to perform poorly, finally your boss ask you to resign to allow you to join another company( higher salary). after you left, you accuse them of letting you go behind your back.** note dont forget, he wanted to join AC milan and kbkp for much of the off season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4th mistake</p>
              <p>he was not boo by former teammates or working mates, but boo by arsenal fans</p>
