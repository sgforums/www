              <p><strong>In January 2011, <span style="color: #000000;">Roy Hodgson</span> was dismissed in shame as <span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span> manager and King Kenny returned.<br></strong><br>Fast-forward 16 months and the King was dethroned after a disappointing Premier League campaign as Hodgson was announcing the England squad for Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>Dalglish's second coming was initially a success, guiding the Reds to sixth place, after they had languished in the bottom half under the current Three Lions coach, and signing Andy Carroll and Luis Suarez, at the time, two of the most hyped strikers in Europe.<br><br>Hodgson did not wait long to make his way back into management, appearing at West Brom just over a month later tasked with arresting an alarming slide down the table that had seen Roberto Di Matteo sacked at the Hawthorns.<br><br>Hodgson succeeded, lifting the Baggies to a record 11th place by the end of the season, then going on to better it this campaign, finishing 10th, a first top-half Premier League finish securing an unprecedented third-consecutive term in England's top tier for the west Midlands side.<br><br>This season has also been record-breaking at Anfield, but for all the wrong reasons.<br><br>Crippled by an appalling home return of six league wins all season and a desperate lack of luck in front of goal (no team struck the woodwork more than Liverpool during 2011-12), Dalglish saw his top-four contenders slump to eighth in the table, below Everton for the first time in seven years and with a worst points total for almost six decades.<br><br>The Reds' signings failed to inspire, Stewart Downing could not score or create, Jordan Henderson was unsure of his role and Charlie Adam could not replicate his Blackpool variety act of goals and assists.

              <br><br>Meanwhile, Carroll was not the destructive force of late 2010, becoming a one-man pantomime while an ugly storm brewed over Luis Suarez's alleged racist abuse of Patrice Evra.<br><br>Dalglish's defence of Suarez, even after he had been found guilty, bordered on worrying. The 'You'll Never Walk Along' culture of the Kop looked to be going one step too far, and the Scot seemed to be straining under the brunt of negativity with increasingly curt media appearances.<br><br>In the Midlands, however, Hodgson had completely rebuilt his reputation. Ben Foster was a solid acquisition between the sticks while Shane Long had brought his terrier-like forward play to the Baggies with goal-getting reward.<br><br>Hodgson won his first battle with his former employers, a 2-1 win at the Hawthorns in April 2011 thanks to a Chris Brunt double, but Dalglish took the second round, coming out on top 2-0 at the same venue six months later.<br><br>Then the third and final meeting. With just five games remaining in the 2011-12 season, Liverpool were eyeing an FA Cup final and, although he was not aware, the Football Association were eyeing the Baggies boss. 
              <table style="width: 300px; float: right;" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
              <tbody style="text-align: left;">

              </table>
              </p>
              <p>West Brom swept to victory in Hodgson's return to Anfield thanks to Peter Odemwingie's strike, to give him what turned out to be his last win at the club.<br><br>After that match Hodgson insisted that he took no extra pleasure from beating his former employers, but even one of the most affable of bosses might have smiled wryly as Dalglish left Melwood on Wednesday and thought how lucky he had been to get out when he did.<br><br>Thanks to his Anfield failure, the Three Lions boss has a solid reputation for success in limited surroundings, perfect then, perhaps, for the promising but often crushing environs of the England job.</p>

              <p><strong>Frank Lampard is facing Euro 2012 heartbreak - and Roy Hodgson has been plunged into a full-scale midfield injury crisis.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea veteran Lampard will undergo a scan after suffering a calf muscle injury in training on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson has been put on standby because the medical check-up is expected to rule out Lampard - and could spell the end of the 33 year-old's England career.  </p>
              <p>UEFA will send a doctor to check on Lampard, and England boss Hodgson will be able to call up Henderson because the scan is expected to show it is a new injury, which will allow the FA to change their 23-man squad at this stage.</p>
              <p>Lampard has won 90 caps for England and was pushing for a starting place in Hodgson's line-up, especially after <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry was this week ruled out</span> with a stomach injury.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Hodgson opted to replace Barry with a defender, Everton's Phil Jagielka</span>, and that now leaves England woefully short in midfield.</p>
              <p>It's a position where Scott Parker has been using injections to speed up and ease his recovery after an Achilles injury and Steven Gerrard, Hodgson's choice as captain, must be a concern having been plagued by fitness problems all season.</p>
              <p>Henderson has had a difficult first season at Liverpool, but could find himself thrust in to try to solve England's midfield issues.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester United's Michael Carrick decided to call time on his England career</span> earlier this season after becoming fed up of not getting enough chances.</p>
              <p>There is no way back for him even if he wanted to make a U-turn, as he is currently undergoing treatment on an Achilles problem.</p>

              <p><strong>The versatile Phil Jones is the other back-up, while James Milner could also play inside, but it all leaves Hodgson woefully short of options for the tournament.</strong></p>
              <p>Ironically, England's players had only a light training session on Wednesday morning before being allowed the afternoon to play golf.</p>
              <p>But it was enough to crock Lampard, who was kept out for weeks earlier in the season with a similar problem.</p>
              <p>The FA fear that Thursday will spell the end of his Euros hopes.</p>
              <p>The Chelsea midfielder may also feel, at 33, that Hodgson may look to the future in the autumn as the qualifiers for the next World Cup begin.</p>

              <p><strong>England defender Gary Cahill has been ruled out of Euro 2012 after suffering a double fracture of his jaw.</strong></p>
              <p>Cahill, 26, sustained the injury in Saturday's 1-0 win over Belgium after Dries Mertens pushed the centre-back into goalkeeper Joe Hart.</p>
              <p>England boss Roy Hodgson expressed his hope after the game that the Chelsea player would be fit for Poland and Ukraine, as he nervously waited on the results of a second scan.</p>
              <p>The Football Association has, though, confirmed on Sunday that Cahill will miss the tournament, compounding the Three Lions' recent injury woes.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has seen Gareth Barry and Frank Lampard already drop out of his England squad and is now forced to call on Liverpool's Martin Kelly as a replacement for Cahill, subject to UEFA approval.</p>
              <p>There was some positive news, however, with confirmation that defender John Terry's hamstring injury is not severe enough to keep him out of Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>An FA statement read: "Gary Cahill has been withdrawn from England's Euro 2012 squad following the injury he suffered in the match against Belgium.</p>
              <p>"The Chelsea defender has two fractures of his jaw, one either side. The England medical team have been in close contact overnight with Cahill's club doctors who will treat him moving forward.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool defender Martin Kelly will be called into the squad - subject to agreement from UEFA's medical team. Kelly trained with the England players last week and was part of the group that travelled to Norway.</p>
              <p>"John Terry has been scanned this morning and given the all clear. He will be re-assessed on Tuesday when the team regroup."</p>
