              <h1>Avram Grant named new manager of West Ham - Barclays Premier League</h1>
              <p>Avram Grant is the new manager of West Ham United - <em>subject to the formalities of a work permit</em>.</p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2010/0513/avramgrant20100510presser_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Avram Grant" width="275" height="155"></p>
              <h5>Avram Grant: Set to stay in Premier League</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>West Ham insiders have confirmed to <em>Soccernet </em>that Grant has been appointed as the successor to Gianfranco Zola, who was sacked two weeks ago.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Soccernet </em>understands that Grant held a private meeting with the Hammers' board on Thursday to cement his three year, £3 million contract. The official announcement is being delayed purely due to the wait for a new work permit to be issued for the job at Upton Park.</strong></p>
              <p>A West Ham insider confirmed to <em>Soccernet</em>:  "Avram Grant will be appointed manager subject to the club gaining his work permit, which takes time, but should be a formality."</p>
              <p>Grant was wanted by half a dozen clubs in Europe, but has chosen West Ham and an instant return to the Premier League after relegation with FA Cup finalists Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>Grant's name was first linked to the West Ham job on <em>Soccernet</em>.</p>
              <p>Grant quickly rose to take the position despite candidates such as Mark Hughes, Slaven Bilic and Steve McClaren being in the frame.</p>
              <p>McClaren opted to switch from Dutch to German football with Wolfsburg, while Hughes believed he would attract a much bigger job and priced himself out of the market. Bilic considered a return to Upton Park where he was a popular player but wanted a £40 million transfer budget - out of proportion with the Hammers' financial predicament.</p>
              <p><strong>David Sullivan and David Gold were attracted to Grant by his heroics at Fratton Park with penniless Pompey.</strong> West Ham, too, are working on a tight financial restraints, and Sullivan revealed recently that the club were days away from administration before they took over with a £50 million, 50% takeover at the turn of the year.</p>
              <p>This week Sullivan and Gold bought a further stake for £8 million, £4 million going into the club to meet pressing liabilities and for down payments on new signings. <strong>Grant's first task is to sort through a list of nearly 30 players who are available for transfer and who would welcome a move to Upton Park.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sullivan and Gold are making preliminary enquires about several on the list, and initial offers have been lodged.</strong></p>
              <p>West Ham believe that the work permit is a "formality" but cannot unveil Grant as their new manager until it arrives, and it is expected on Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>
