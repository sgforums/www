Having already recruited Craig Bellamy this summer, the Hammers are said by the Evening Chronicle to be interested in one of his best mates.</strong><br><br>A move would reunite Dyer with Lee Bowyer two years after their on-field scrap whole playing for the same Newcastle team against Aston Villa. Dyer has been at Newcastle for eight years but injury problems have restricted him to just 190 Premiership appearances.<br><br>He still has two years remaining on his contract but was said to be devastated after being booed off the pitch by Newcastle fans in his last appearance in a black-and-white shirt. Dyer is on phenomenal wages at United but West Ham would have little trouble matching those terms.<br><br></div>

Bowyer and Dyer could be reunited</span><br><br>West Ham may have lost some of their fresh fighting spirit with the loss of new signing Julien Faubert for six months, but manager Alan Curbishley is preparing to re-unite notorious scrappers Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer at Upton Park.</strong><br><br>Dyer, 28, has endured an injury troubled time at St James' Park and new boss Sam Allardyce may be ready to off-load him as he looks to re-build his squad. That would mean teaming up with controversial Bowyer who was involved in an on-pitch brawl with Dyer during a home defeat with Aston Villa two years ago which resulted in both players being sent off.<br><br>Dyer, who has also attracted interest from Tottenham, may be ready for a fresh challenge after eight years on Tyneside and a move to Upton Park would also reunite him with another former Newcastle 'bad boy', the Wales captain Craig Bellamy, who joined the Hammers for Â£7.75m. Toon's excaptain Scott Parker is already there, too, following a Â£5.5m move.<br><br>Former Ipswich midfielder Dyer is now one of the top earners at St James' Park but if any club can match his Â£100,000-a-week it is the Hammers, who have been trying to recruit big-earners throughout the close season but missed out on Mark Viduka who decided to join Newcastle on a free transfer.<br><br></div>
