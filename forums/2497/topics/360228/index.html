              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez wants a change
              to future title races, claiming teams can gain an unfair advantage at
              the business end of the season. </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/liverpool/rafa_rightherrightnow_480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>The Liverpool boss wants the final two games of the season all
              to be played at the same time, thus avoiding the scenario his team face
              this weekend. </strong></p>
              <p>Benitez prepares his side for a trip to West Brom knowing the
              title race could be ended on Saturday, with Manchester United needing
              just a point at home to Arsenal.</p>
              <p>Similarly, West Brom must watch on as Newcastle, Hull and
              Middlesbrough all play 24 hours before them, and Benitez believes these
              matches are too important to put teams at any disadvantage.</p>
              <p>“I think it’s something we can improve in the future. The last
              two weeks I think it would have been better to play at the same time,”
              Benitez suggested.</p>
              <p>“Teams are fighting to avoid relegation, and teams are fighting
              for the title, I think it would be better to play at the same time.</p>
              <p>“The last two games, I think it would be better for everyone. In Spain it is like this.</p>
              <p>“We must keep fighting, if the West Brom is to stay in the title we must fight, if not, we must fight for second.</p>
              <p>“Arsenal is a good team with quality and, after the defeat they had last week, they have something to prove.</p>
              <p>“Arsene Wenger is a winner so he will want to win, and the players will be desperate to make up for the recent result.”</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Rafael Benítez</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> has confronted the unpalatable prospect of </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> equalling </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>'s record of 18 league titles by refusing to recognise the ­champions-elect as the finest team in the country. In a begrudging assessment of his fiercest rivals, he also claimed </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> is on course for a third successive </strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Premier League</strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> crown thanks only to the financial advantage he enjoys over Liverpool.</strong></span></p>
              <p>There was an element of pragmatism in Benítez's modest appraisal of United yesterday, with Liverpool able to take the title race to the final day should Arsenal triumph at Old Trafford this afternoon and West Bromwich Albion be defeated at The Hawthorns tomorrow. His refusal to concede defeat was secondary to a refusal to offer any credit to Ferguson, however, following a campaign that has fractured the once respectful relationship between the managers at Anfield and Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Liverpool will become the first team to lose only two matches and not win the title should they remain undefeated for the rest of the season and United gain the point they require. Asked if the best team always wins the league, Benítez responded: "It just means they have more points.</p>
              <p>"If United win the league it means they will have more points, clearly, but there are some very good teams in different positions in the table. It depends on the time of the season. I don't think I ever said we were playing the best out of everyone, maybe just at certain moments. I do have a lot of respect for the other teams, but to say who is the best at one moment is not easy."</p>
              <p>The Liverpool manager added: "There are a lot of good teams in the Premier League. Without putting them in any order, I'd say Chelsea, United, Liverpool and Arsenal are the best. This year we have shown we are improving and that we are a better team than before. We can still get better but we are in this position because we are winning a lot, have played good football, scored a lot of goals and not conceded many. Eighty points is good, 86 could be much better, and we will try to get there and see what happens. If United have more points, it only means they have more points, that's all, nothing else."</p>
              <p>Benítez insisted the only difference this season between Liverpool and United, whom they have beaten home and away, lies not on the pitch but on the balance sheet, with Old Trafford's greater resources providing Ferguson with a deeper and more experienced squad.</p>
              <p>"For me, United have a bigger squad with top-class players, but always they spend more than we can spend," said the Liverpool manager. "If they make mistakes they can use different players, but the level of the two teams is more or less the same. Maybe we have to bring in some young players without the experience at this level, and that could be the difference. United are a top side that is spending big money every year on improving its squad and that is the main difference between them and the other teams."</p>
              <p>While Benítez takes pride in Liverpool's creditable pursuit of United, the club's Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso has insisted the season cannot be classed a success should it end without a trophy. "In terms of the Premier League it has been better than it has before but if you don't win anything you can't consider it to be a good season," said Alonso, who is likely to be the subject of several transfer enquiries this summer.</p>
              <p>"We have to be disappointed with ourselves, try to be critics and try to analyse the things that we haven't done properly. Of course you also have to think that we have made progress in the Premier League and we have to keep working on this basis, but you also know that success means winning trophies for Liverpool. It's very painful to look back and think of the draws that we had and the two defeats we have had also."</p>
              <p>Benítez again revisited a disallowed goal in the opening minutes of the home game against Stoke City as an example of the fine margins that have worked against Liverpool this season. "It's only natural to think where would we be if we had managed to get another good result?" admitted Alonso. "But then all the teams in the Premier League can say the same thing."</p>

              <p>It never seems to surprise me what he can come up with. So maybe if next year Man U wins the title in March,then will he come out and say "All the games from March onwards should be played at the same time.It will be more competitive for us all."</p>
              <p>And skipping Torres(it was a obvious buy la,he was already talented even b4 he came to Liverpool),hasn't he also spent a lot of money on Liverpool's 'League winning team building'? A lot of them remains relative unknown to us neutrals watching the game.</p>

              <p>not the first time he said it, and ferguson did the maths (i trust ferguson's maths) and claimed liverpool spent more in the last 5 years.</p>
              <p>benitez is just wasting his money buying all the wrong players. bellamy? sold. degen? not doing anything. etcetcetc.</p>
              <p>and a whole load of managers have agreed that man utd is the best team in england. this benitez is really just full of crap (no offence 2 liverpool fans), but he's overdone it. he's kinda becoming like mourinho. the i'm always right, the rest of u can f*** off mentality.</p>

              <p>Benitez sore loser?</p>
              <p>at least the words from mr mourinho last time do make sense at times. benitez now is all talking crap. make no sense at all.. just that he won the champions league in his first season, people think that he's a great manager.</p>

              <p>really bth benitez....so what if liverpool lose lesser games and scored more goals than united? United has WON MORE games, DRAWN LESSER games, and CONCEDE LESSER</p>
              <p>and guess what? liverpool has one of the biggest squad in europe, albeit most are thrash <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>and wasn't he whining about fergie whining about fixtures? why is he doing it now?</p>

              Fergie dont need to reply to Benitez's taunts.
              
              He just need to show him the EPL trophy with a grin.
              
              That will make Benitez shut up,albeit for a short while.

              Many Pool fans are equally evasive and deluded.
              
              They like to cower behind their 18 leagues and 4 Euros won in the days when syrup drinks were sold in school canteens for 10 cents whenever people question them about their team's CURRENT performance...
