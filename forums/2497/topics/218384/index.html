            <div class='col-md body'>Uefa is "sure" to investigate the match between Chelsea and Barcelona, says its president Lennart Johansson. Ten bookings led to players surrounding the referee, who was confronted at the end by Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard.<br><br>"I cannot deny that we have been sleeping by not taking action earlier," said Johansson after the latest stormy Champions League tie between the sides.<br><br>"I'm sure now things will happen as it was so obvious and the people we had in place who saw it will report it." Chelsea can expect a fine because any team picking up five or more bookings in a game is automatically punished.<br><br>Uefa is keen to stamp out players surrounding the referee during a match and may decide to make an example of both clubs as well as Rijkaard.<br><br>"I'm against this behaviour but I don't make the decisions, they are taken by the disciplinary bodies," said Johansson.<br><br>Uefa communications director William Gaillard said on Wednesday: "We may open an investigation if there are a large amount of cards, if other incidents are mentioned by the referee or Uefa match delegate or if either team files a complaint.<br><br>"We will examine the reports when we receive them and see if there is anything that would lead to an investigation being opened."<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42264000/jpg/_42264870_lampard_cole203x152.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Johansson criticises Mourinho and Chelsea over morals</strong><br><br>Uefa president Lennart Johansson has criticised the behaviour of Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho after the midweek Champions League draw in Barcelona. Uefa will hold an inquiry into the game - in which the Blues had six players booked - but Johansson, 76, said he was disappointed by the Chelsea boss.<br><br>"Mourinho has a duty to see he has respect for the game and not to behave like a kid," he told the Sunday Mirror. "He makes statements like someone whos been promised candy but didnt get it." Johansson, who was in London seeking support for his campaign to be re-elected as Uefa president, said fining Chelsea was unlikely to have a big impact on the London club.<br><br>"I do not believe in fines when Chelsea have the money they have to pay it. It must be judged differently," he said. "Its like any crime - when it happens the first time you are treated in a fairly decent way but, if you repeat the crime, sentencing is much tougher. Sometimes we are not severe enough."<br><br>Johansson said he was not happy with the manner in which Chelsea and owner Roman Abramovich had used their financial power to build a squad of world-class stars - but admitted Uefa were powerless to intervene. "If someone is wealthy enough to buy a club and he likes to spend his money buying players what can we do about it?" he said.<br><br>"If you talk about law, thats one thing. Here its a question of morals. Im very, very sad about this development. Im against it. I have to wait until the laws exist and try to come back to the original situation where everybody was happy when we had a balance between home-produced and imported players. And more and more clubs and coaches are doing the same. Is it morally wrong what Chelsea are doing? For me, it is. But, at the same time, I cannot blame them for doing something that in law is accepted."</div>
