The former England captain, who began a five-year contract worth an astonishing $250million (Â£123m), said: "Potentially, soccer in the States can be as big as anywhere in the world. </strong><br><br>"I want to be part of that and to help do that over the next five years and maybe more. It's great to see so many fans here and I'd like to thank them for that. "I've played for two of the top sides in the world, Manchester United and Real Madrid, and played for 11 years for my country. "The most important thing for me is my family and then my soccer. I'm looking forward to this. My wife is here and my family is here."<br><br>Beckham walked out to a tickertape parade in the searing California heat and was cheered throughout his speech. Head coach Frank Yallop said: "I can't wait to see him wearing a Galaxy shirt." Beckham will make his debut against Chelsea next Saturday and will train with his new Major League Soccer teammates for the first time on Monday.<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_01/beckhamfanAP_468x313.jpg"><br><span class="small">Beckham's fans need no converting</span><br><br>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who has also expressed a desire to join him in the U.S. at some stage, has backed Beckham to succeed. Mourinho said: "The objective is to bring soccer in the U.S. up and they couldn't choose a better player for that. "I think he's more than a player because of what he means to world football. He brings a lot of attention with him, so if the objective is to improve the Galaxy team then, for sure, he is a better player than what they have. "He's at the end of his career as a player and in 20 years, when I'm at the end of my career as a manager, I would love to come here."<br><br><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/07_01/beckhamstadAP_468x312.jpg"><br><span class="small">Home Depot Stadium: Beckham's new home</span><br><br>Galaxy general manager Alexi Lalas described it as a historic moment. "Not just for the Galaxy but for soccer and for the sport of soccer in the United States," said Lalas. MLS commissioner Don Garber echoed those thoughts. "This is truly a historic day for soccer," he said. "Here in Los Angeles we have one of the world's most recognised athletes, most recognised players coming here to our league, our city, our team.<br><br>"He's more than just a terrific player, a man with tremendous talent, tremendous integrity, someone the LA market will look to cherish and others will look to emulate. "It's also the right time because the MLS has added new teams, new stadiums, and new TV contracts to become a more popular part of the sports culture."<br><br></div>
