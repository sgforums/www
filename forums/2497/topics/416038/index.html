              <p>The champions succumbed to their third defeat in four league games at Birmingham City last Saturday and now lead the Premier League on goal difference. Wilkins's surprise departure, despite Ancelotti making it clear he was content to have his assistant remain at the club, had a further disruptive effect with suggestions that the manager was considering his future at Stamford Bridge prompting the League Managers' Association to contact him yesterday evening seeking clarification.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti was bullish in his rhetoric on Monday as he prepared for tomorrow's visit of MSK Zilina in the Champions League, claiming he hoped to remain at the club "for a long time", though there was an acceptance that his own job security would require an immediate improvement in results. "I have my contract until 2012 here, in this club, and I've said a lot of times that I'd like to stay here," said Ancelotti, who retains the full support of his squad. "I love not just this club, but these players. I have a lot of confidence in these players, in this squad. But when the team don't reach the right results, obviously the coach is under pressure.</p>
              <p>"Obviously I am under pressure because I'd like Chelsea to win every game. The coach is in trouble when the team doesn't produce results, but this is my life. I like my life. I'm not disappointed about this. I'm disappointed because Chelsea have lost three in four games, and this is not good: for me, for the players, for the club and for my job.</p>
              <p>"My aim is to stay here at this club, in this country, in this atmosphere, for a long time. It depends on me. I did a good job last year and I'd like to do the same this year. I am focused on my job and to make this team play better than we are at this moment."</p>
              <p>The events of the last few weeks have affected Ancelotti, who has 18 months to run on his £6.5m-a-year contract at the club, but today's show of commitment was designed to draw a line under the most unsettling period of his tenure. The manager was unable to discuss Wilkins's departure, with his former assistant claiming unfair dismissal and his lawyers negotiating his claim for compensation, though he insisted the promotion of Michael Emenalo would not undermine his own role as Avram Grant's arrival in 2007 appeared to do for José Mourinho.</p>
              <p>"I'm sad because the team hasn't been winning," said the Italian. "I maintain the same relationship with Ray, even if we can't work together. Nothing has changed in my personal behaviour with Ray. The club decided to change and I have to stay focused on my job with another assistant. This is not a problem for me. That's not the reason why the team are losing at this moment.</p>
              <p>"Emenalo is doing the same job that he did when I came here. He was on the training ground on the first day I was at the club, and he is on the training ground again. He's not 'involved' in the training sessions because he has no licences, but he was involved in the tactical meetings and decisions when I arrived here and still is. He did that while Ray was here, too."</p>
              <p>Asked whether he craved more control over transfer policy or the hiring and firing of his staff in his role, he added: "More power? More power, for sure, would mean more work, more jobs. I don't want this. I want to maintain my position. My experience is this. I'm not able to speak about financial things, administrative things, or contracts. I can just speak about my contract, not others. I prefer to stay in my position and control technical matters. Nothing has changed."</p>
              <p>Chelsea require only a point against Zilina, beaten 7-0 at home by Marseille in their last Champions League game, to win Group F and, with Sunday's visit to Newcastle United in mind, Ancelotti will hand a first start to Josh McEachran in midfield, with Jeffrey Bruma and Ross Turnbull also to play. Jacopo Sala, Gokhan Tore and George Saville were integrated into training today, with Alex rested with a view to playing at St James' Park given the anticipated absence of John Terry.</p>
