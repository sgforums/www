              <h1>No surrender! Wenger digs in his heels as Arsenal fans show the first signs of revolt<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/11/07/article-1084018-024ACAD3000005DC-680_306x430.jpg" alt="Wenger" width="306" height="430"></p>
              <p><em>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger insists he will not change his footballing principles despite his side's mediocre start</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has warned disillusioned </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span><strong> fans that he will never sacrifice his principles despite a barrage of criticism over his team’s alarming slump.</strong></p>
              <p>Incredibly, some supporters have called for his departure and defeat at home to <span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span><span style="color: #003580;"> </span>on Saturday would signal the likely end to Arsenal’s title challenge.</p>
              <p>Former Arsenal goalkeeper coach Bob Wilson even claimed Wenger is prepared to walk out after 12 years at the club if his lightweight team are continually criticised. But Wenger, ridiculed for branding Stoke’s players ‘cowards’ after their victory over Arsenal last weekend, insists he will not change.</p>
              <p>‘I don’t turn to anyone when things are difficult, I rely on my experience,’ he said.</p>
              <p>‘I know what is important for the team to do. 'I have a contract and usually I don’t break them. I am very proud of what my players do and I am very proud of the job I am doing as well, even if results are not as good as we want.</p>
              <p>'There are no alarming signs. I love it here. 'I don’t question my commitment at Arsenal and I always put the interests of the club first. 'I stick to what I believe is right and I am quite relaxed about that.</p>
              <p>'In any career you have moments that go well and moments that go less well. ‘I would not exchange my position with any other manager because I believe in our qualities.</p>
              <p>'You are not God when everyone says you are and you are not miserable when everyone says you are.' The truth is somewhere in between.’</p>

              <p>I believe all this comes down to Wenger himself... Cos if you want to blame it on having no money to spend cos of their stadium and a debt of $200 over million, Then what about Liverpools? They owe $300 over million, don't even have a new stadium... Their income from sponsors right up to gate collections are far lower than the gunners... Arsenal are probably one of the most profitable clubs in the world right now and with the second largest capacity stadium and the highest priced ticket in the Premier league... Who would belief that story?</p>
              <p>So I don't buy it when some of their fans claim that they don't have the money to buy players the other big three buys... Liverpool have bought Torres, Keane, Mascherano, Babel, Riera... All these weren't bought with peanuts... They are also quite big money purchases.</p>
              <p>The problem I am afraid, lies with Wenger... The guy is a proud and stubborn man... I have said it before, I personally think Wenger's transfer policies has a serious flaw...</p>
              <p>I know he gets all the credits and praises for playing nice football and admiration from some for bringing in many youngsters from time to time till a point that he may actually become so proud of his achievement that he might want to do it even better becomes more important than winning the title again...</p>
              <p>I think if the board is serious, they should put more pressure on Wenger and take away what they once said that he has a job for life at Arsenal footbll club.</p>
              <p>Or the fans turning up at the Emirates are being short-changed for the good money they pay...</p>

              <p>one must always remember who brought Arsenal to today's height. it was not George Graham, it was Arsene Wenger and by repaying him with a sack seems a little ungrateful for losses against Stoke and Hull. these 2 are new teams in the premiership with thus the complacent attitude which cost us dearly. but for the head of our professor? unjustified.</p>
              <p>so now Sir Alex Ferguson should also be sacked for a loss against blood rival Arsenal? come on!</p>

              <p>a true supporter does not look at the trophy cabinets before supporting a club. then in that case, Liverpool and Real Madrid has the most trophies all these years. support them then.</p>
              <p>just because we didn't win anything for the past 3 years means nothing to a true fan. we support them because of how they run the club... not like a business which many clubs are in serious financial debts and with the recession looming, isn't going to be optimistic. you know which teams i'm indicating.</p>
              <p>we support them for how they play their game, beautiful. you can call it porcelain football but it is still attractive. hey, we are famed for playing the best football on the planet.</p>
              <p>anyway, i've been a fan since the Tony Adams, Martin Keown, Lee Dixon, Grimandi, Ian Wright era so i know what i'm talking about.</p>
