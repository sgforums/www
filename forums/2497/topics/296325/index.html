Can he prove he is in London for more than the money, the golf and the social circuit? Freed from the intimidating presence of Didier Drogba, who is out following a knee operation and unlikely to play again for Chelsea until after the African Nations Cup in February, Shevchenko takes on the mantle of senior striker.</strong><br><br>Avram Grant is backing the Ukrainian to rise to the challenge and prove he is not past it at 31, but the situation still has the hall-marks of Sheva's last chance. Chelsea will spend in January, with Bolton's Nicolas Anelka the top target as they chase at least one striker. Everton's Yakubu is also on the radar, having played under Grant at Maccabi Haifa.<br><br>If Shevchenko does not dazzle in December, there can be no long-term future for him at Stamford Bridge. Grant said: "I think Sheva will revel in the responsibility. I hope he will. He is a great player, still. He's done a lot of things in his life as a football player and now he has a chance, although I can't say he will play every game."<br><br>Shevchenko was given the nod ahead of Claudio Pizarro against Sunderland and responded with the opener, a flying header in the 23rd-minute. Grant said: "With Sheva it is a matter of expectations. If you look at last season, he scored 14 goals and this year he's got four so far. If his name wasn't Shevchenko, you would say that was OK, but because he's called Shevchenko you expect him to play well."<br><br>Shevchenko scored 14 in 51 appearances in his first season at Chelsea, after his Â£30million move from AC Milan. This season he has four in 12.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>he need a good playmaker to assist him , not midfielders like lampard , essien or ballack , who are type of the attacking style , they are not very creative players , maybe makelele is the right person to field in. there are no midfielders that is very creative like benayoun of carrick. this is what sheva needs.</div>
