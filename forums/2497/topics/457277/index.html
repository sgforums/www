              <p><strong>Martin Jol says Clint Dempsey wants to leave Fulham and has admitted it will be "impossible" to keep him at the club</strong></p>
              <p>The wantaway forward has been left out of Fulham's squad for tomorrow's season opener against.</p>
              <p>Dempsey, who scored 23 goals last term, pulled out of Fulham's pre-season training camp in Switzerland earlier this month after Liverpool confirmed they were interested in signing him.</p>
              <p>The Anfield club have yet to make an official bid for the American, who has one year left on his contract, but Jol thinks the player is not in the right frame of mind to play against the Canaries at Craven Cottage tomorrow afternoon.</p>
              <p>The Fulham manager said: "Clint was not involved over the last four weeks so he is not going to be in the squad. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"He is not committed to the club. He wants to leave.</p>
              <p>"I would like to keep him, but I think it's impossible. It's a sad and an almost embarrassing situation."</p>
              <p>Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers told his own club's website last month that he had made an inquiry about the player.</p>
              <p>Then the website for Massachusetts-based news channel New England Sports Network (NESN), owned by Anfield proprietors Fenway Sports Group, <span style="color: #000000;">also published a story claiming Dempsey was a Liverpool player.</span></p>
              <p>Liverpool have infuriated Jol with these actions.</p>
              <p>"That was very disappointing," the Fulham boss said.</p>
              <p>"There was never an offer. Clint himself told everyone he was going to Liverpool before he came back so we really thought there was quite a firm interest in him.</p>

              <p>"If you have shown interest in a player, especially in England, you have to follow it up with an offer. They didn't."</p>
              <p>Dempsey, 29, has made it clear he wants to move to a bigger club, and has been training separately from his team-mates this summer, but Jol insists the American will not be sold cheaply.</p>
              <p>"Maybe Liverpool will come back," Jol said.</p>
              <p>"I can assure you that our chairman is strong enough. At first we didn't want to get rid of him, later on we had to change our position.</p>
              <p>"But our view is that we won't let Clint Dempsey go on the cheap, that's for sure."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;"> were thrashed 3-0 at West Bromwich Albion</span> and finished the game with 10 men after Daniel Agger was dismissed for a professional foul. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>A chaotic display from the visitors saw them fall behind to Zoltan Gera’s wonderful strike before they conceded two penalties in five minutes in the second half.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>The first, awarded after Agger had fouled Shane Long, prompting the defender’s dismissal, was saved by Pepe Reina, but the second, given for a foul on Long by Martin Skrtel, was converted by Peter Odemwingie.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Romelu Lukaku added a third to seal a first win in charge at West Brom for Steve Clarke – Kenny Dalglish’s assistant at Anfield last season – and underline the scale of the task facing Rodgers, although the man himself claimed the performance of referee Phil Dowd was the decisive factor.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>“I’m not going to go on about the referee, but I thought the two penalty decisions were very harsh,” he said. “I don’t think either was a penalty and Martin Skrtel doesn’t even connect for the second one.</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>“With the first one, Long’s pace has got him there. There is slight contact but I know Long well, how big and strong he is, and it was very harsh. With 10 men and then chasing the game, it’s difficult.”</p>
              <p>Rodgers admitted Liverpool may consider appealing Agger’s red card, saying: “It is something we will look at. It was very harsh.”</p>
              <p>Rodgers’ terrible day was compounded by Michael Laudrup, the man who succeeded him at Swansea, beginning his own tenure with a remarkable 5-0 victory at Queens Park Rangers.</p>
              <p>“That was impressive,” the Dane said. “Winning the first game in my debut – and also the team’s first in their second season in the Premier – away and 5-0. I don’t think anyone could’ve dreamed about that.”</p>

              <div class="sport item"><span>When asked if he plans to contest the red card Agger said: 'Of course. I've seen it again on television and there is no contact. Referees are only human. They make mistakes as well.</span></div>

              <p style="text-align: left; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;"><span>At Liverpool, the spotlight is always there. There is no reason to panic. Everyone is frustrated. I don't think the result was right. It doesn't really make sense. But that's football and it happens.</span></p>

              <p>Agger dun need to appeal for anything as he will be sold very soon.</p>
              <p>Did Ah Rod and me saw the same game ?</p>
              <p>WBA was more lethal and organised when they attacked.</p>
              <p>Liverpool was like headless and wingless chicken.</p>
              <p>Liverpool did not play up to BPL standard at all.</p>
              <p>WBA have more corners than Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Maybe I am expecting too much from Ah Rod and his existing team.</p>

              <p><br>You will be surprise when they beat City this weekend... City didn't look very good even at home and playing away will be more difficult. Also, Pool are always quite good at home against the big teams.</p>
              <p>Personally i wouldn't be if they do beat City at Anfield.</p>
