              <p>Wow what a performance by Gareth Bale. He totally ran Inter amok. Base on current form, he is right up there with players like C.Ronaldo and Messi. If Spurs can survive until at least the quarter finals, I think there is a real chance for Gareth Bale to be shortlisted as World Player of the Year.</p>
              <p>I think all the clubs in Europe are keen to have his service. Alex Fergie please go get him! Rooney will be very pleased.</p>
              <p>Bale on the left, Nani on the right. Nightmare for the rest of Europe. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Bale is a rising star but shouldn't get carried away with his performance against Inter. However, i disagree with you ranking him with Ronaldo and Messi. Bale is an improving individual but Ronaldo and Messi are match-winners.</p>
              <p>The first match at San Siro, probably due to complacency by the Inter Milan players, Bale stole in and scored a Hat-Trick.</p>
              <p>The return match at White Hart Lane, with Bale's Hat-Trick still fresh in mind, Inter Milan players are wary of Bale's threat and seemingly back off from challenging him. Especially Maicon, the supposed Number 1 choice Right Back of Brazil.</p>
              <p>Now you don't see Bale performing that well at EPL right?</p>
              <p>First of, you must acknowledge the fact that it's BENITEZ led Inter Milan, not Mourinho's. Given similar circumstances, a Mourinho's Inter Milan would neutralise Bale's threat.</p>
              <p>Similarly, look at sunday's EPL match between United and Tottenham. Bale hardly get pass Rafael, who is playing third fiddle behind Dani Alves and Maicon in Brazil National Team!</p>

              <p>Spurs would at least slap a 30M pound price tag on this guy man..given the inflated prices of players these days...i rather the coaching team do their best to improve guys like Obertan &amp; Bebe..Obertan scored a screamer man!</p>

              <p>Cant really blame rafa, although he is a clown in his own rights. The truth is Bale totally own Maicon. Just like the post match interview, the interviewer asked Bale about making Maicon look like a schoolboy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. We are talking about the best right back in the world but here comes a Bale that says "Maicon who?"</p>
              <p>Any team that defeat the champions must be given the benefit of the doubt!</p>

              </span></p><p>Don't overreact lah... No doubt the guy is good, last night's performance against Inter was kind of easy for him given Rafa didn't had a cover plan for him, putting a close to 30 yrs old Maicon against his speed and power play...</p>
              <p>Maicon is better known for his attacking qualities though as a defender, he is also an able one but without extra help, he was out run by Bale all on his own during counters... I kind of pity the guy cos his reputation as one of the best right-backs in the world kind of got torn to shreds last night... To counter Bale, the type of defender must be just as fast, like Rafael who I thought did a great job on him on Sat...</p>
              <p>No doubt there will be lots of big clubs line-up to sign him come end of the season but I don't think Spurs are going to sell cos they are in no need for the cash... And Bale has never gave any hint he wants to play for any other clubs as he keeps saying he is happy at Spurs. The only chance they will let him go is, Spurs don't qualify for the CL at the end of the season... That may only prompt him to reconsider but not necessary he will leave Spurs too...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think Bale's physical built is quite unusual for a good winger... Cos normally we see the good wingers as not only speedy but usually not very tall too... Giggs, Robben, Duff, Kewell just to name a few... But Bale, he is very tall, has very long legs... lol. when he run, he doesn't do much of the twist and turns to beat defenders, he just use his physical strength not to get push off by defenders and power runs with those long legs of his to beat them... That could explain why he started out as a defender first...</p>
              <p>I personally belief he is value for money even at $30m or more given his age of 21 only...</p>

              <p>The Tottenham winger's performance in last night's <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Champions League" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> win over Internazionale made headlines across Europe and he is said to be a target for leading clubs across the continent. But Bale sees no reason to leave Spurs.</p>
              <p>"I think we can achieve what we want," he said. "We've got a great squad, we've got a young squad and we've got a good manager. If we keep progressing the way the way we are then we've got a lot of bright stuff in the future to come.</p>
              <p>"I'm just enjoying playing my football at Tottenham. I'm learning every week, the manager's got confidence in me, the team's playing well, and we've got a good, young squad coming through.</p>
              <p>"I'm just happy at Tottenham now; I just want to keep playing my football there and keep progressing as a player."</p>
              <p>Asked by the BBC whether he could promise he would stay until the end of his contract in 2014, Bale said: "Yes."</p>
              <p>A more immediate focus is on continuing Tottenham's impressive debut season in the Champions League. "We're not in the competition just to make up the numbers; we want to do as well as we can," Bale said. "We're going to go into every game looking to win it; we're going to give it our all, and the most important thing is we take one game at a time and not get too carried away with everything."</p>
              <p>Bale has never experienced the kind of media scrum that greeted him at an event in central London this afternoon. But the unassuming 21-year-old from Cardiff appeared to take it all in his stride in exactly the same manner as he did in repeatedly galloping past the hapless Inter defence yesterday.</p>
              <p>"It's obviously nice to get people talking about you, saying nice things," said Bale at the launch of BT's new football fan website, www.lifesapitch.co.uk. "But I know I have to keep working hard and keep improving and that's all I want to do."</p>
              <p>Asked why he was playing so well, he replied: "I think it's a bit of everything. The team's playing well, the manager's got confidence in us, I feel as though I'm improving as a player and I think when all those things come together, you get good performances."</p>
              <p>It is unclear to whom Bale owes his unflappable demeanour but he is certainly keen to model himself on his idol Ryan Giggs. "He's shown, ever since he made his debut, what a good player and what a good person he is for football," Bale said. "He's an amazing person to follow and hopefully I can come a little bit near him."</p>
