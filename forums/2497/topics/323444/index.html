              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Gunmen have kidnapped the older brother of Everton defender Joseph Yobo as he made his way home from a nightclub.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Norum Yobo was one of three men taken from their car at gunpoint in Port Harcourt in Rivers State, Nigeria. The other two men have since been released but Yobo is still being held, it is thought because of his brother's high profile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The kidnapping took place in the B-Line area of Port Harcourt at around 4am on Saturday morning after the trio had attended the Illussion Nite Club. No group has claimed responsibility.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Details of the incident have been confirmed by Cyril Dumite, deputy chairman of the People's Democratic Party, the ruling party in Rivers State. Nigeria has seen a rise in activities - including kidnapping - by militants acting against the oil industry in the country in a bid to secure a larger share of petroleum funds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nigerian international Yobo is on holiday in Lagos and was due to return to pre-season training at the Merseyside club next week. Toffees spokesman Ian Ross said the thoughts of everyone connected with the club were with the 27-year-old and his family. "We have sent a couple of messages to Joseph offering any assistance that we can provide him," Ross revealed. "He had been given leave to return late to pre-season training next week because of his international duties for Nigeria this summer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Obviously, this family misfortune means he will stay out there for the foreseeable future. "Things like this put football and life in perspective. The thoughts of the players, management, staff, fans and everyone connected to Everton FC are with Joseph and his family at this time. "We can only hope that Joseph's brother is released without harm."</p>

              <h1>Yobo Relieved After Brother's Release</h1>
              <h2>Nigerian international defender Joseph Yobo says he is relieved
              that his elder brother Nornu was set free by his abductors on Wednesday
              night in Port Harcourt.</h2>
              <p>In an interview with kickoffnigeria.com, Yobo said he was emotionally
              unstable all through the period his brother was in captivity, but said
              he has begun recovering from the period of shock.<br><br>"This has been
              a very very difficult period for me, but I am happy now that I have
              seen my brother again," he said. "ItÊ¼s difficult to explain what I went
              through, but I was mentally and physically down."<br><br>Yobo also
              added that he was grateful for the support shown by his English
              premiership club side, Everton FC, confirming that he would be joining
              up with them on Monday.<br><br>"Right now, I just want to rest a bit,
              and then focus on getting myself mentally prepared to join my team
              mates in pre-season," he continued. "I want to say a big thank you to
              everybody at Everton Football Club for giving me immense support,
              especially the chairman who never stopped ringing.<br><br>"I will also
              like to thank Nigerians for their support at this trying time in my
              life and pray that nobody should have to experience what I have gone
              through in the past days."</p>
