              <div class="art-o art-align-left"> </div>
              <p><strong>Wigan boss Steve Bruce has been given permission to talk to Sunderland about their managerial vacancy. Meanwhile Sunderland have confirmed American businessman Ellis Short is to assume 100 per cent control of the Barclays Premier League club.</strong></p>
              <p>The former Manchester United defender has emerged as the front-runner to succeed Ricky Sbragia at the Stadium of Light after the Scot stepped aside at the weekend following his team's narrow escape from Barclays Premier League relegation.</p>
              <p>Reports this morning claimed a compensation package had already been agreed with the Latics, clearing the way for Bruce to discuss personal terms with the Wearsiders.</p>
              <p>Sunderland this morning continued to deny that this is the case, although it is understood Wigan could make an official announcement later today.</p>
              <p>Bruce was coy when asked about reports linking him with Sunderland last night.</p>
              <p>He told Sky Sports News: "There's always speculation and you cannot stop that. It is flattering. "But I'm very, very pleased with what's happened with us (Wigan) and I'm quite pleased with what's happening in the future, so we'll see what develops."</p>
              <p>Bruce, a boyhood Newcastle fan, joined Wigan in November 2007 after Latics owner Dave Whelan agreed a £3million compensation package with Birmingham.</p>
              <p>He had spent almost six years at St Andrews and had guided Blues back into the top flight just months earlier, but became unsettled when the club's board failed to offer him a new contract amid the ultimately doomed takeover bid led by Carson Yeung.</p>
              <p>Bruce arrived at the JJB Stadium with Wigan deep in relegation trouble following six straight league defeats under his predecessor Chris Hutchings. He managed to spark an impressive upturn in form which saw the Lancashire club finish 14th, and that improvement continued into the 2008-09 season when they were contenders for a place in the Europa League for much of the campaign.</p>
              <p>A late run of one win in eight matches, after safety had already been secured, meant they slipped to 11th in the final standings. That was still five places and nine points ahead of Sunderland, despite Bruce working with a fraction of the budget granted to former Black Cats boss Roy Keane. And after their flirtation with the Coca-Cola Championship, it appears to have been enough to persuade Sunderland's ambitious owners that Bruce is the man to turn them into a top-flight force.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Wigan</strong></span><strong> boss Steve Bruce is set to complete his switch to </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Sunderland</strong></span><strong> within the next 24 hours. The Latics are holding out for a huge compensation settlement - more than the £3million they paid Birmingham to land Bruce in 2007 - after resigning themselves to losing their highly-rated manager.</strong></p>
              <p>And it is understood that they have already made plans for Bruce's replacement, with Swansea boss and former Wigan star Roberto Martinez a leading contender.</p>
              <p>Bruce emerged as one of Niall Quinn and Ellis Short's leading choices for the vacancy at the Stadium of Light after Ricky Sbragia resigned on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Bruce has established himself as a top Premier League boss after transforming Wigan into a mid-table side after taking over from Chris Hutchings.</p>
              <p>After almost six years at Birmingham, he guided Wigan away from relegation trouble and they were contenders for a Europa League spot this season.</p>
              <p>If he moves to the North-East, Bruce is expected to take No 2 Eric Black, goalkeeping coach Nigel Spink and reserve boss Keith Bertschin with him.</p>
              <p>'There's always speculation and you cannot stop that. It is flattering,' Bruce told Sky Sports. 'But I'm very, very pleased with what's happened with Wigan and I'm quite pleased with what's happening in the future, so we'll see what develops.'</p>
              <p>Gordon Strachan, Jurgen Klinsmann and Frank Rijkaard are other names under consideration by the ambitious Stadium of Light board.</p>

              <p>Wigan boss Steve Bruce is reportedly close to filling the vacant position at Sunderland.</p>
              <p>Earlier reports suggested the Black Cats had gone cold on Bruce but recent events have indicated otherwise.</p>
              <p>It is believed that 48-year old Bruce is keen to work with a bigger
              financial background and could be named as the next manager at the
              Stadium of Light within a matter of days.</p>
              <p>Wigan chairman Dave Whelan is hoping to sell Bruce for more
              than the £3 million he paid for him to join from Birmingham in 2007
              whilst Sunderland have a figure of no more than £5 million in their
              minds.</p>

              <p><strong>Steve Bruce's hopes of being installed as </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Sunderland</strong></span><strong>'s new manager appeared to recede tonight when the club balked at </strong><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Wigan Athletic</strong></span><strong>'s £5m price tag.</strong></p>
              <p>Although Dave Whelan, the Wigan owner, made it clear that he would be happy for his manager to talk to Sunderland, the Wearside club declined to make a formal approach for Bruce on learning of Whelan's compensation demands.</p>
              <p>Ellis Short, Sunderland's new owner, who assumed total control of the club today, is seemingly not impressed by the idea of reimbursing Wigan for their loss. Whelan, though, was forced to pay Birmingham £3m for Bruce when he prised the boyhood Newcastle supporter from the West Midlands.</p>
              <p>Although it is possible this impasse will conclude with a compromise and Bruce's subsequent unveiling as Ricky Sbragia's successor at the Stadium of Light, Sunderland made it clear that, although the Wigan manager is near the top of their shortlist, he is not the only candidate under serious consideration.</p>
              <p>Bruce – who has become disillusioned at Wigan after being forced to sell his best players – is said to have one particularly strong unnamed, possibly continental, rival for the post.</p>
              <p>Paul Jewell, who managed Wigan from 2001-07, would be among the candidates to take over at the JJB Stadium if Bruce leaves. He turned down the chance to go back there after his successor, Chris Hutchings, was sacked but may be more receptive on this occasion. He has been out of work since December, when he left Derby County. The Swansea City manager, Roberto Martínez, a former Wigan player, is also a possible target.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile Niall Quinn, Sunderland's chairman, insists he will "take whatever time is necessary" to finalise the appointment. "It is imperative we find somebody who will raise the bar and introduce a whole new mentality to our dressing room," said Quinn.</p>
              <p>The new manager will be given a significant transfer budget by Short. Quinn hailed the Irish-American financier's buy-out of the club's former owners, Drumaville. "This is fantastic news for the club and opens the door to a new era at the Stadium of Light," he said.</p>
              <p>Short, though, had been Sunderland's majority shareholder for some months and Quinn added: "Even before today he has personally invested more in Sunderland than all previous chairmen, directors and owners combined in the club's history. Late last summer he injected tens of millions to fund new signings and the resultant increased wage bill.</p>
              <p>"As long as we invest the funds wisely, he will continue to provide what has been the missing ingredient in Sunderland's make-up, namely the financial muscle necessary to compete at the highest level. Ellis's involvement to date enabled us to turn down a bid of up to £20m from Tottenham for Kenwyne Jones in January."</p>
