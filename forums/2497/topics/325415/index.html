              <h1>Calderon Plans A Fab Move</h1>
              <h2>Real Madrid president, Ramon Calderon, is considering making a move for Arsenal’s Cesc Fabregas according to the latest reports from Spain.</h2>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The Merengues chief has being after two of the Premier League’s most wanted in Cristiano Ronaldo and the Gunners star but he has so far failed in his attempts to land them. <br></strong><br>Marca claims Calderon is planning one final raid in England before the transfer window closes on August 31. <br><br>Ronaldo seems like a distant target following Manchester United’s resistance and thus the chief is looking to sneak in for Fabregas. <br>When he was voted into power at the club, Calderon made Cesc as one of his priorities and he did promise he would sign the youngster but so far he hasn’t kept his word. <br><br>Arsene Wenger has always stated that his midfield magician is not up for sale and Fabregas himself said that he wanted to remain at the North London club for life. <br><br>However, Calderon is not afraid to reach deep down inside his pockets and break the bank in order to land his man and one final push to lure his targets to Spain seems on the horizon. <br> </p>

              <p class="by"> </p>
              <p><strong>REAL MADRID will step up their pursuit of Arsenal’s Cesc Fabregas after conceding defeat in the battle to sign Cristiano Ronaldo.</strong></p>
              <p>Manchester United’s insistence they will not sell their star winger has finally been accepted by the Spanish giants.</p>
              <p><a id="more"></a></p>
              <div class="entry-more">
              <p>Real chiefs have run out of patience with United’s stance and Ronaldo’s refusal to ask for a transfer, so have made former Barcelona trainee Fabregas their new No 1 target.</p>
              <p>Spanish sources are claiming to have made two approaches to Fabregas’ representatives and were told he wants to stay at Arsenal for at least one more year.</p>
              <p>But, as United will testify, Real do not give up easily and will try to prise him away before the August 31 transfer deadline.</p>
              <h3>Bank</h3>
              <p>The Gunners have had had to fight off repeated attempts by Barcelona to lure Fabregas back to Spain. He was one of the stars of the national team that won the Euro 2008 finals and most Spaniards want to see him back playing in his homeland.</p>
              <p>But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will not entertain any idea of selling his midfield maestro and will tell Real and Barca he is not for sale.</p>
              <p>However, the Gunners have a history of selling their best players and Real have shown with their pursuit of Ronaldo they will break the bank with offers up to £70million for men that they really want.</p>
              <p>Real are also keen on Valencia striker David Villa and have spoken to Hamburg about their midfield ace Rafael van der Vaart. A fresh enquiry has been made to AC Milan over Brazilian superstar Kaka, while Werder Bremen’s attacking midfielder Diego is another on the Real hit-list.</p>

              <p class="introcopy"><strong>CESC FABREGAS has hinted he is interested in a move to Real Madrid, but poured cold water on the idea he could move there this summer.</strong></p>
              </div>

              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Reports in Spain say Real president Ramon Calderon, resigned to missing out on Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo, has prepared a big-money offer for Fabregas.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">But while Fabregas, a product of the Barcelona youth academy, revealed he could move to Madrid in the future, he insists he wants to stay at Arsenal for the time being.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">“I did not tell Ramon Calderon no,” said Fabregas. “I told him that now wasn’t the time to go to Madrid. “That you are wanted by Madrid, one of the biggest teams in history, is important.”</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Fabregas enjoyed a great summer at Euro 2008 as he helped Spain end their 44-year wait for a trophy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">In England, however, for the third year on the trot he ended the season empty-handed.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Fabregas, who feels he would be certain to lift a trophy should he opt for Spanish champions Real, admits that another season without any silverware could see him head for the exit door. “To be four seasons without winning any titles would be too much for me,” added Fabregas.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">“Real Madrid are the favourites to win La Liga this year.” Arsenal’s trophy-less season was made even more painful as rivals Manchester United swept all before them at home and in Europe.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">Alexander Hleb, meanwhile,  has denied calling former Arsenal team-mate Fabregas selfish and says they are good friends. Hleb, who recently moved to Barcelona, set the record straight over an article which quoted him as lambasting both Fabregas and Gunners boss Arsene Wenger.</p>
              <p style="min-height: 16px; margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0px; font: 12px Geneva;">“Cesc is my best friend at Arsenal and he knows that everything I have to say I’ll say it to his face, as always. “I only said that when Cesc had the ball you didn’t know where he was going to put it because he is so good that he can pass it to the left or right – and that was changed into criticism of his way of playing.”</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>A weekend report in Spanish sports newspaper
              Marca quoted Fabregas as hinting he might consider a future move to the
              Bernabeu, particularly if Arsenal miss out on a trophy in the new
              season.</p>
              <p>Fabregas helped Spain win Euro 2008, playing an increasingly prominent role for the champions during the tournament.</p>
              <p>But the Spain international has denied discussing any long-term
              transfer plans as he prepares to bring his summer holiday to an end,
              and stressed he remains motivated with his current club.</p>
              <p>"I have not spoken to any media so it's frustrating to read

              <p>"I have spent the summer relaxing with my family, friends and girlfriend and I return to training with Arsenal on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>"I think that some people are just trying to make mischief but my intentions are very clear.</p>
              <p>"I am happy here at Arsenal, my future is with Arsenal and the priority is to achieve success and win trophies at Arsenal."</p>
