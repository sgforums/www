No. Only one team tried to win the game. "It is a surprise for a big team to come to Stamford Bridge and be very happy just to get a point.<br><br>But Wenger, who was without first-team regulars Thierry Henry, Tomas Rosicky and Kolo Toure, defended his decision to use a 4-5-1 formation, with Emmanuel Adebayor the lone striker.<br><br>The Frenchman also insisted his club are still capable of clawing back United but admitted it would be difficult. Wenger said: "What does he (Mourinho) want? Our defence was very, very young, and there was a lot of pressure on them. "It was difficult, and I felt they needed protection. We are frustrated, though, because we wanted to win the game.<br><br>"If you ask me whether I would prefer Manchester United to win the title, or Chelsea to win it, my answer is simple: I would prefer Arsenal to win it. "It looks a bit difficult, and United will need to drop points, but we have a young side and it takes time to achieve consistency."<br><br>Wenger added: "I like Drogba, but I thought he was a bit theatrical today, and tried to referee the game."<br><br></div>

Former Gunners star Cole offered to shake the SpaniardÂ’s hand after they left the pitch Â— but Fabregas refused.<br><br>Cole wanted to make peace only to end up in a heated row, with ArsenalÂ’s Robin Van Persie also becoming involved. Fabregas and ChelseaÂ’s Cole had already exchanged words towards the end of the match. But ColeÂ’s efforts to calm the situation were thrown back in his face and, as the slanging match continued, Chelsea backroom staff were forced to break up the melee.<br><br>Fabregas was targeted by Cole in his controversial autobiography My Defence. Cole, who moved to Chelsea from Arsenal in August, said: Â“I couldnÂ’t tell you a thing about Toure, Eboue, Reyes, Fabregas or Senderos. Â“I donÂ’t know whether they have girlfriends, a family, what they do or where they go.Â”<br><br>He added: Â“The impact of VieiraÂ’s loss cannot be overstated. With all due respect to Fabregas, heÂ’s no Patrick. Â“ItÂ’s like putting the gloves of a heavyweight champion on the hands of an unproven featherweight.Â”<br><br>Cole even hinted his former teammate was responsible for throwing pizza at Alex Ferguson in the Battle of the Buffet at Old Trafford in 2004. He said: Â“All IÂ’ll say is that the culprit wasnÂ’t English or French so that should narrow it down.Â”<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42336000/jpg/_42336795_ab4.jpg"><br>Cesc Fabregas went up against Ballack, Lampard<br><br></div>
