            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Adebayor is up for a war</strong></span><br><br>EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR has declared war on Chelsea ahead of ArsenalÂ’s Sunday showdown at Stamford Bridge. The powerful Gunners striker is already steeling himself for a bruising battle with Blues skipper John Terry. And he promises he will go in with all guns blazing in his bid to win the match for injured pal William Gallas.<br><br>Adebayor said: Â“Sunday will be one of the biggest games in the world and we have to be mentally ready to put up a real challenge to our opponents. Â“It will be another war and the important thing is to show no fear and enjoy the battle. Â“I have never played against Terry and Ricardo Carvalho before but I have faced many other powerful defenders and I love the physical challenge.<br><br>Adebayor, a Â£7million signing from Monaco in January, scored the winner at old Trafford in September in the absence of Thierry Henry. Gunners skipper Henry will be missing again on Sunday, while former Chelsea defender Gallas is given only a 20 per cent chance of recovering from a thigh injury in time to play at the Bridge.<br><br>Â“What the boss has said is very important for the team. It shows he has confidence in us and we have to prove he is right. We have to play for him and put all out heart into our performances.Â”<br><br>Yet the Gunners go to the Bridge at the weekend with almost half their strongest team missing. As well as Henry and Gallas, Kolo Toure is suspended and Tomas Rosicky is out with a thigh injury. Lauren is still recovering from a serious knee injury and, to make matters worse, Johan Djourou is struggling with a strained hamstring.<br><br>That could mean a return for Swiss centre-half Philippe Senderos, who has suffered in recent times against ChelseaÂ’s Didier Drogba. Yet Gunners keeper Jens Lehmann is sure his defence will be up to the job and said: Â“If theyÂ’re not conceding goals they must be doing well.<br><br></div>

The Frenchman insists it will take more than success on the pitch to make the Blues the top outfit on the planet.<br><br>According to Wenger, Chelsea do not yet possess the rich history, pedigree and fan base of clubs like Real Madrid. "At the moment they are a bit premature to say what they will do," said Wenger, whose Gunners side face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.<br><br>"Playing the best football is one of the things that makes a club bigger. You also have the natural size of the club built through history. "It will always be that Real Madrid are bigger than Alaves, even if Alaves has a better team for a few seasons.<br><br>"Also you have the accumulation of history with players who are faithful to the club. A lot of things come into making a club big. "Arsenal is a club that you could easily underestimate in terms of size because when we built the stadium we had the question, do we make 50,000, 55,000 or 60,000 seats?<br><br>"With a good team today maybe even 60,000 is too small. "Whether Chelsea can become the biggest club in the world is also down to the size of the fan base. That takes a very long time to build up." Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon made the claim that the Blues have the potential to be the world's most powerful club by 2014 when he recently laid out his vision for the future of the club.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42335000/jpg/_42335713_clichy270.jpg"><br>Gael Clichy is being tipped for a big<br>future by Arsene Wenger.<br><br>Cole is preparing to face his former club for the first time since his acrimonious transfer to Stamford Bridge on transfer deadline day. But Wenger insists Arsenal have the perfect replacement in Gael Clichy and is backing the 21-year-old French defender to match the achievements of his predecessor.<br><br>"Clichy is the answer to losing Cole - 100% the answer," said the Gunners boss, who was without the services of Clichy for the first part of the season because of a foot injury. "When we lost Ashley Cole we knew we had Clichy but he was injured. And what he is doing now after being out for so long is quite amazing.<br><br>"It's a good challenge for him because he will be compared to his model. He always said Ashley Cole was his model and tomorrow he will be compared to him. "Clichy has the potential to be as good as Cole. Ashley is playing well at the moment and I am not surprised by that. "When we lost Ashley Cole we lost a player who was 25 years old and that's the best age for a football player. We lost a big player."<br><br>One interested observer on Sunday will be Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. After his side extended their lead at the top of Premiership table to nine points, with Saturday's 3-1 victory over Manchester City, he is hoping Arsenal can do him a favour by beating second-placed Chelsea.<br><br>"I will be supporting the Gunners for a change," said the Scot.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the commentator was right. cashley cole did commit a foul which led to the equaliser.<br><br>and not forgetting the <strong>luck</strong> essien had to shoot from that distance, since he was less capable of scoring 1m from the goaline.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>seem like chelsea needs quite a lot of <strong>luck</strong> this season to catch up man utd. or shall i say they no longer have the <strong>luck</strong>? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
