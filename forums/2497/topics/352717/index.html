              <h2>Rival Premier League managers Sir Alex Ferguson and Rafa Benitez have found something else to disagree about.</h2>
              <p>Rafael Benitez might have got the better of Sir Alex Ferguson last weekend, when Liverpool went to Old Trafford and resoundingly beat Manchester United 4-1, but the Scot has taken a snipe at the Spaniard by refuting Benitez's claim that Ferguson has spent more on transfers.<br><br>Benitez
              said last week that Ferguson had spent £100million more on players than
              he had, but the United boss was far from convinced and instructed his
              staff to calculate  each manager's spending since Benitez took charge
              at Anfield five years ago.<br><br>According to United's figures,
              Benitez has spent £24 million more than Ferguson - and the Scot expects
              his Liverpool adversary to outspend him again significantly this summer.<br><br>Ferguson is quoted by<em> ITV Sport</em> as saying,  "I was amazed at that one. I got some of the people in the sports technology department to check that out.<br><br>"He's well ahead of us in spending in the last five years.<br><br>"He said our spending power is more than theirs but he has spent £24 million more than we have.<br><br>"I
              think you will see Rafa producing an absolute spending spree [this
              summer], I think that's an absolute certainty now he has signed a new
              contract.<br><br>"There's talk about a recession but I don't think there will be one at Liverpool this year."<br><em><br>ITV Sport </em>calculate that in terms of net spending - taking into account <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">income</span></span></span> from player sales - the clubs are roughly equal. Liverpool's net
              spending on players over the last five years is £82.5 million, while
              United's has been £85.5 million. Chelsea spent £154.8 million net on
              players over the same period, while Arsenal splashed just £3.4 million
              in net terms.<br><br>Ferguson also claimed that while his policy
              involved developing home-grown talent through United's youth system, as
              well as signing established stars, Benitez was more focused on bringing
              in established players.<br><br>He said: "There's a balance - we have
              signed 18 players in the last five years and eight of those have been
              young players. There's a balance, it's about doing the thing correctly."</p>

              <p>I see, and did you happen to notice the league position they were in? Did you see the form that those players were in?</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Manchester_United_F.C._(1969%E2%80%931986)</p>
              <p>Go read............</p>
              <p>But then again i suppose both managers were in more or less the same position,</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Ben%C3%ADtez</p>
              <p>Liverpool were quick to take advantage of the disharmony at Valencia and Benítez was appointed manager of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="FA Premier League" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Premier_League">English Premiership</a> club on 16 June 2004, replacing <a title="Gérard Houllier" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Houllier">Gérard Houllier</a>.
              Arriving at Liverpool, he found himself in a very similar position to
              the one he had found at Valencia. The club had a talented but
              underperforming squad that included, among others, <a title="Steven Gerrard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>, <a title="Jamie Carragher" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher">Jamie Carragher</a>, <a title="Dietmar Hamann" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietmar_Hamann">Dietmar Hamann</a>, <a title="Harry Kewell" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kewell">Harry Kewell</a>, <a title="Steve Finnan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Finnan">Steve Finnan</a> and <a title="Sami Hyypiä" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_Hyypi%C3%A4">Sami Hyypiä</a>.</p>
              <p>Difference is Ferguson became the most successful manager in English footbal history, now i don't think Benitez is going to replace him as the most successful manager in English footbal history in the near future don't you think so?</p>

Let me tell you something about drunks, even a Tony Adams battling alcoholism, maybe in his early 30s, would still be on my first team, as long as he doesnt drink at least 8 hours before a match, and most players wont do that.
