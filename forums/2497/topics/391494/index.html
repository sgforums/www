              <h1>Wolves 0 Chelsea 2: Deadly Didier Drogba at the double to fire Blues four points clear <br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Didier Drogba's double enabled Chelsea to move four points clear of
              Manchester United at the top of the Barclays Premier League as they
              overcame Wolves at Molineux.</p>
              <p>Drogba ensured the Blues took
              advantage of United's 3-1 lunchtime reversal against Everton at
              Goodison Park with a goal in each half.</p>
              <p>It took his tally for
              the campaign to 25 in all competitions and earned Carlo Ancelotti's
              side only their second away win in their last seven league games.</p>
              <p>Chelsea barely moved out of second gear for long periods ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Inter Milan.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/20/article-1252502-086314AA000005DC-35_468x307.jpg" alt="Didier Drogba of Chelsea celebrates scoring the second goal " width="468" height="307">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Double trouble: Didier Drogba fired two goals to send Chelsea four points clear</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>But the quality finishing of Drogba was the difference between the
              sides and means the Blues are now favourites to take the Premier League
              crown with only 11 games remaining.</p>
              <p>Petr Cech was the busier of the two keepers and made two crucial
              saves early in the second half when Chelsea held only a single-goal
              advantage.</p>
              <p>But Wolves' problem all season has been failure to take their
              chances, as demonstrated by their meagre goal tally of 21 - although
              Kevin Doyle again impressed as a lone striker.</p>
              <p>Chelsea were quickly in the ascendancy and the first half-chance fell to Michael Ballack.</p>
              <p>Yuri Zhirkov sent over a threatening cross from the left flank and
              Ballack got up well in the danger area but directed his header wide.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/20/article-1252502-0862F2CD000005DC-69_468x286.jpg" alt="Chelsea's Didier Drogba scores his sides first goal" width="468" height="286">

              </div>
              <p>Doyle produced the first save of the game out of Cech after 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>The Republic of Ireland international made space for himself after a
              diagonal run and Cech had to go down to his right to save his 20-yard
              drive.</p>
              <p>Doyle then flicked the ball into the path of the overlapping Kevin
              Foley but his shot from a narrow angle flew into the side netting.</p>
              <p>Doyle was causing problems for Chelsea and he was alert to a quick
              throw from Foley and forced Cech to parry his shot around the post.</p>
              <p>Ballack was only just too high with a rasping volley after a corner from Florent Malouda was only half-cleared.</p>
              <p>Jones, who had scored the winner against Tottenham ten days ago,
              curled a free-kick just wide as Wolves started to grow in confidence.</p>
              <p>But five minutes before the interval, Chelsea took the lead through Drogba.</p>
              <p>Zhirkov played a one-two with Ballack before squaring a low ball across the six-yard box and Drogba had the easiest of tap-ins.</p>
              <p>Cech produced a superb reflex save to protect Chelsea's lead after 55 minutes.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/20/article-1252502-0862E64A000005DC-458_468x286.jpg" alt="Chelsea's Ivorian striker Didier Drogba" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Net result: Drogba wheels away after the opener</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Adlene Guedioura timed his run perfectly to connect with a far-post
              cross from Jarvis but his fierce volley was somehow kept out by the
              Chelsea keeper.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti made his first change a minute later with Zhirkov replaced by Jeffrey Bruma.</p>
              <p>The home side tried to get a foothold in the game and Cech produced another splendid stop to deny Foley an equaliser.</p>
              <p>Terry miskicked when attempting to clear and Foley found himself with only Cech to beat but he managed to block his fierce shot.</p>
              <p>Ballack became the first player to be yellow-carded for dissent as the Blues looked rattled.</p>
              <p>But then Drogba doubled Chelsea's lead as Wolves were caught napping by a long clearance from Cech.</p>
              <p>Drogba was the first to react and took the ball away from Christophe Berra before clipping the ball wide of Marcus Hahnemann.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/20/article-1252502-08631B36000005DC-7_468x325.jpg" alt="Chelsea's Florent Malouda, right, competes for the ball with Wolverhampton Wanderers Adlene Guedioura " width="468" height="325">

              </div>
              <p>McCarthy made a triple substitution with Jarvis, Foley and Jones
              making way for Geoffrey Mujangi Bia, Greg Halford and Sylvan
              Ebanks-Blake.</p>
              <p>Doyle was only just off target for Wolves with a shot on the turn after some typical aggression.</p>
              <p>But it needed a good tackle from Ronald Zubar to deny Anelka a third goal as he bore down on the Wolves goal.</p>
              <p>Terry cleared the ball off the line in a late Wolves rally after Cech had failed to gather a long throw from Halford.</p>
