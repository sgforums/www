              <p>John Terry has been taken to hospital after suffering a bad blow to his foot that could rule the defender out of England's squad for the World Cup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fabio Capello already has injury doubts over a number of players, including Gareth Barry, and Terry can now add himself to the list after a possible metatarsal injury that he suffered in a Chelsea training session at Cobham.</p>
              <p>Already with problems over the fitness of Rio Ferdinand and Ledley King's chronic knee, England named five central defenders in their provisional squad, giving callups to Michael Dawson, Jamie Carragher and Matthew Upson.</p>
              <p>Terry had a scan on Wednesday and Chelsea have said that they expect to see the results on Thursday, with the defender a certainty to miss the FA Cup final with Portsmouth this weekend.</p>

              <p><strong>John Terry's World Cup dream is in serious doubt after the </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span><strong> captain was rushed to hospital having suffered a suspected broken metatarsal in training today.</strong></p>
              <p>The defender is now set to miss the FA Cup final against Portsmouth following the accidental collision this morning at the Blues' Cobham training headquarters.</p>
              <p>Terry, 29, is wearing a protective boot on his right foot and must wait until Thursday to discover his scan results which will determine his availability for South Africa.</p>
              <p>A Chelsea statement read: 'John Terry has today taken a knock in training and has gone to hospital for a precautionary scan on his right foot. He left Cobham walking freely in a protective boot, and we await the results which are expected on Thursday.'</p>
              <p>If Terry's worst fears are realised, it would compound a horrendous year for the defender.</p>
              <p>The furore over off-field revelations surrounding his private life, after his affair with former team-mate Wayne Bridge's ex-girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel, saw him stripped of his England captaincy after a 12-minute showdown with Fabio Capello in February.</p>
              <p>It is the latest metatarsal horror to hit the national side in the build-up to a major tournament.</p>
              <p>Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney was rushed into a recovery for the finals in Germany after he broke his fourth metatarsal four years ago, two years after suffering the same anguish six weeks before the European Championships in 2000.</p>
              <p>David Beckham infamously sustained the injury after Deportivo's Aldo Duscher left the midfielder sweating over his England place two months before the finals in 2002.</p>

              <p><strong>The news comes as a further blow to England manager Capello, with serious injury doubts over midfielder Gareth Barry and skipper Rio Ferdinand.</strong></p>
              <p>The Italian, who named his 30-man provisional World Cup squad on Tuesday, must now decide whether to draft in another defender.</p>
              <p>Ironically, should Terry miss out, that man could be <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span></a> full-back Wayne Bridge, who earlier this year declared he would not play for England alongside Terry.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOHN TERRY is hoping to play in Saturday's FA Cup final after giving Fabio Capello a World Cup scare. </h2>
              <p class="article">Chelsea's skipper hurt his right foot tackling Daniel Sturridge in training yesterday. It raised fears England's 'curse of the metatarsal' had struck again. </p>
              <p class="article">He went to hospital wearing a protective boot but scans re-vealed no major problem. </p>
              <p class="article">Terry said: "I took a slight knock but with such an important match on Saturday the right course of action was to put a protective boot on. </p>
              <p class="article">"The scan has shown there is no break. I'm hoping to train tomorrow if not Friday and, of course, play in the FA Cup final." </p>
              <p class="article">The knock had been a worry for both Carlo Ancelotti ahead of Blues' Wembley date with Portsmouth and Capello, who announced his initial 30-man World Cup squad on Tuesday. </p>
              <p class="article">Losing Terry would have been a major blow for both bosses. Even if he is no longer England captain, Capello still regards Terry, 29, as "a leader" and he will undoubtedly be in his side for the Group C opener against USA on June 12. </p>
              <p class="article">Gary Neville, David Beckham, Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney all suffered broken metatarsals in the build-up to previous World Cups. So it was relief all round when Terry's scan proved negative.</p>
