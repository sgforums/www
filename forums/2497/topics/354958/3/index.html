              <p><strong>Manager Guus Hiddink admitted he had been left stunned by Chelsea's shock 3-1 victory against Liverpool in the first-leg of their Champions League quarter-final at Anfield but was delighted with the way his team exploited their opponents' weaknesses.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea chief Hiddink hailed his team, saying: "I admit it was an unexpected result, but we are very happy with the win and it was well deserved. "We pinpointed areas in our opponents' side where we could hurt them. The team could smell that and they took advantage. We talked about that situation again at the break and made sure we continued in the same way."</p>
              <p>"We started very sloppily, the jobs we were doing in defence were not as good as they could have been. We let them score far too easily, but I can only compliment my team for their recovery from that set-back. Straight afterwards we could have equalised on two occasions.</p>
              <p>"But we reacted well, we scored with a very good set-piece and from then on the confidence flooded through our team. If you feel the opponent can be hurt in some part of their team, it would be stupid not to go for it."</p>
              <p>Despite Hiddink's claim that Chelsea exploited weaknesses Reds manager Rafa Benitez insisted it was individual errors and not his defensive system that was to blame for Liverpool's joint-worst defeat in European competition.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "We scored first but after that we were never in control. We conceded a bad equaliser from a set-piece. That was not because of the zonal marking but because players made mistakes to allow people space and time.</p>
              <p>"For their first goal there were three players near to the scorer and they were not able to stop him. And then something very similar happened for the second, we made bad mistakes at crucial times.</p>
              <p>"Now we know we have a difficult task in the second-leg. We have to score three times and that will be very difficult. "But we must believe we can do it. We have scored four at Manchester United so we know what we are capable of.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea did not really surprise us, and they clearly believe that this is the competition they have most chance of winning now. "They have won many away games this season, but the way we lost was hard to take."</p>

              <p>I just don't understand why pool didn't play their usual cup match style of "chase and rush tactic"... The Chelsea players seem to be given a lot of time on the ball to pass around without too much pressure from the Pool players...</p>
              <p>Are they getting tired too? Or they thought European nights they are special and the teams that come to Anfield are afraid and will only defend?</p>

              <div></div>
              <div><span><strong>Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina has defended the side's heavily-criticised zonal marking system and insisted the Reds can rescue their Champions League dream. </strong><strong>The Merseysiders' 14-month, 32-game unbeaten home record in all competitions was shattered by Chelsea's shock 3-1 quarter-final first-leg victory at Anfield on Wednesday night.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span></span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Now Liverpool must produce a recovery of Istanbul proportions on Tuesday in the second leg at Stamford Bridge to stay in the competition. But Reina maintains that zonal marking at set-pieces was not the cause of their downfall, despite the two goals conceded to Branislav Ivanovic from corners.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is always the same when we concede goals from free-kicks - people start talking about man-marking and zonal. "But we have done it for five years and, although I don't have the statistics, I know we are one of the teams that conceded fewest from set-pieces over that time."</p>
              <p>And it is very clear that manager Rafael Benitez is not about to change a system that has served him well throughout his managerial career.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: "When you see man-marking you see many goals conceded every week. "We have not conceded too many goals this season from set-pieces or over the years, the system works and has been very effective for us.</p>
              <p>"It is not the system. It is the mistakes that were made by players. If you analyse Chelsea, they have Drogba, Terry, Alex, Ballack, Essien, Ivanovic - it is very difficult to stop all of them at set-pieces.</p>
              <p>"They are all very tall, and if you make a mistake you are punished. "This system has worked very well - just look at how many goals we conceded from set plays in my time, it is as good as if not better than most teams.</p>
              <p>"But what was wrong was that players were not aware of what was going on around them. If you allow a player to run free like that, it is very hard to control all the zones, that was the big mistake."</p>
              <p>Reina maintains, however, that the position is not irretrievable. He said: "It's going to be much tougher to win the trophy now, we have to go there and win 3-1 or 3-0. But we can go to any stadium and win.</p>
              <p>"Of course the 4-1 win at Old Trafford gives us hope, it shows us what we can do at any stadium. We won like that at Old Trafford, why not at Stamford Bridge? "It has to be a perfect performance. We have to have a great day and they must have one of their worst."</p>
              <p>He added: "Maybe it is 85% in Chelsea's favour now, and just 15% to us, we know it will be hard. "We must give Chelsea credit because they played very well. But we did not play very well, we did not dominate the situation. "We had trouble in defence and they were in better shape. Some days your opponents play better than you, that is what we must address.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea did not surprise me, they are an excellent team and we let them control the game. "We started well but then did not have any control in the rest of the half."</p>
              <p>Liverpool suffered their biggest Champions League home defeat and Reina admitted they had been second best after Fernando Torres gifted them the perfect start with early goal.</p>
              <p>"We just could not control them at all. It is a bad situation now, losing 3-1 at home is always very difficult to recover from, but we know we can do it," he said. "It will not bother Chelsea that they have John Terry suspended for the next game. They have a phenomenal squad and have plenty of players who can step in for him.</p>
              <p>"We are Liverpool, whoever plays will have to be brilliant for the team. That is why we have such a good squad, we know how to recover and we know what is needed when we step into the side."</p>
              <p>Benitez still has faith in his team and insists that should they score the first goal at Stamford Bridge next week, memories of the 2005 final - when they came from 3-0 down at half-time to defeat AC Milan on penalties - will come flooding back.</p>
              <p>He said: "After the game we talked about concentrating first on the league in our next game before we think about Chelsea. "We have been playing well, we have confidence, we will get things right for the next match.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea have quality, they are physically strong with very good players. They played well and if they continue to perform at the level they showed at Anfield, the second leg will be very difficult.</p>
              <p>"We need to score the first goal in London, just like in Istanbul when we concentrated on just getting one goal back and see what happens. "Chelsea had confidence - clearly for them the Champions League is a massive competition now.</p>
              <p>"You could see they were really determined, every challenge was very strong and maybe they think it is their year for the Champions League. But we have to believe that anything can happen."</p>

              <p>Chelsea were great last night... Its just amazing how with a
              different manager but with the same set of players made... Gerrard
              was mark out by Essien for the whole match until he had to go back
              deep to lose him. But once he moved forward a bit, Essien was
              sticking on him like his new girlfriend and never got too far
              away from him... In doing so, it effectively made Pool
              ineffective...</p>
              <p>I honestly hope Chelsea win it this year if United don't... Cos
              they are a good side under Guus and deserve it... And I also don't
              think they are finish in the chase for the EPL title as well... I
              always believe they are United's main threat... Now we'll just have
              to wait and see...</p>

              <p>Rafa as a tactician was out played by Guus in the Champion League game. Yes u have pointed out correctly that Essien did a good job in shutting down StevieG. This only shutdown Liverpool but did not gurantee the win, I think Guss planned the set piece winner. Liverpool is weak in the air and getting Ivanoic to be the target man for corner is a smart move. Chelsea has so many players with great header abilities like John Terry, Drogba, Ballack and even Alex, it will be easy to miss Ivanoic and leave him unguarded.</p>
              <p>However, this is still the first game Rafa has played against Guus. While it will be a difficult task for Liverpool in the second leg, I can't wait to see what Rafa will do in the next game. After all he is a great tactician and this is his strong area.</p>

              <p>Liverpool have a false sense of security when they achieved good score for the last month.</p>
              <p>Last week was a wake-up call for them that they need to fight to win.</p>
              <p>As for next week, Bolton have shown Liverpool how to apply pressure on chelsea and break them.</p>
              <p>It is dependent on Ah Ben to spur up his squad to achieve a win at stamford bridge.</p>
              <p>It is a tall order for Liverpool to achieve and I dun really think they can do it cos chelsea defence is pretty strong.</p>
              <p>Only positive that if they lose is that they can focus on the EPL title while MU and Chelsea have to fight it out for the other two cups.</p>
