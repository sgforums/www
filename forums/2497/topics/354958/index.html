              <p><strong>Fernando Torres has told arch rivals </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> that the Champions League means more to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> than the bitter title race. The two giants are involved in a dramatic scrap as the battle at the top of the Barclays Premier League reaches boiling point.</strong><br><br>United leapfrogged Liverpool to regain pole position after Federico Macheda's sensational last-gasp goal in the 3-2 victory over Aston Villa yesterday. Torres' side are chasing their first title since 1990 but the Spanish hitman insists their main aim is to grab European glory.<br><br>'Domestic titles are very important but to win the Champions League you are saying we are the best team in Europe,' he said. 'This club has a great record in the European Cup but now I want to be a part of that history.<br><br>'Winning the European Championship was a great thing for me and I understood what it was to win a major trophy and what I had been missing. </p>
              <p>'On the way home from the European Championship I made a promise that I wanted more of this success with Liverpool and it does not come any bigger than the European Cup.'<br><br>Liverpool, who take on English rivals Chelsea in the quarter-final first leg on Wednesday, are desperate to reach their third final in five years.</p>
              <p>And Torres reckons they are capable of glory with inspirationals skipper Steven Gerrard at the helm. 'Stevie has been getting a lot of praise from some of the best players in the world,' he said. 'That is quite right because I think he is the best in the world. He is a great team player but he can also win a game on his own when maybe we are not playing so well.<br> <br>'I would love to see him have a lot more success. I cannot think of a player I would rather be playing with. 'We know it is not going to be easy against Chelsea on Wednesday but both Stevie and I are happy with our form.'<br><br>Torres has also revealed that he has no intention of quitting Liverpool. 'I have said many times the only club I would leave Atletico for was Liverpool, and nothing has changed there,' he said.<br><br>'They are the only two clubs that are in my heart. I have supported Liverpool since I was a boy and I intend on staying here a very long time.'</p>

              <p>Chelsea forward Nicolas Anelka has opined that he enjoyed his best spell of football while on <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">loan</span></span></span> at Liverpool during the latter part of the 2001-02 campaign.<br><br>Ahead of the Blues' Champions League
              quarter-final clash with the Reds, the French international feels that
              it is assumed he is an out-and-out striker, but the Merseyside outfit
              did not make that mistake and duly profited.<br><br>"I played my best football at Liverpool because I played in my best position," Anelka is quoted as saying in <em>The Sun</em>.<br><br>"There
              was Michael Owen, who’s a natural goal scorer, and Emile Heskey, who
              sets lots of things up for you. The three of us complemented each other.<br><br>"I played as a centre-forward at Arsenal and scored lots of goals so everyone thinks that’s my best position but I don’t.<br><br>"My main aim is to play well and that’s where I differ from real strikers.”<br><br>The
              30-year-old is well travelled having played for eight different
              football clubs in four countries, but he says that England is where he
              feels most at home.<br><br>"My relationship with English football is a love story,” he said. “England is a wonderful country.<br><br>"I’ve lived in France, Spain and Turkey, but England is the place where I’m happiest."<em><strong><br></strong></em></p>

              <p><strong>Didier Drogba has been labelled 'a pain in the ass' by Liverpool
              keeper Pepe Reina ahead of the two sides’ Champions League clash at
              Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>However Reina’s comment is praise rather than an insult to the
              Ivorian striker, as he named him one of the deadliest strikers he
              has faced.</p>
              <p>Chelsea travel to Anfield on Wednesday for their quarter final tie
              and Reina believes that Liverpool have a better chance of progressing
              if they keep the rejuvenated striker quiet.</p>
              <p>He said: “To be honest he’s one of my favourite players and when
              people ask me about the most dangerous striker or a real pain in the
              ass, I always say Drogba.</p>
              <p>“I think in a way he’s becoming stronger and stronger. He’s been
              having some injury problems in the last months but now he’s scoring
              goals again.</p>
              <p>“He’s scored five in the last seven games and, whoever plays up
              front, him or Nicolas Anelka, it will be difficult to stop them.”</p>

              <p><strong>Steven Gerrard IS fit for the first leg of Liverpool and Chelsea’s perennial Champions League encounter.</strong></p>
              <p>Fears were raised over whether the Liverpool skipper might struggle
              to make the quarter final, first leg at Anfield on Wednesday having
              been replaced late on in Saturday’s 1-0 over Fulham because of a twinge
              to his groin.</p>
              <p>Rafa Benitez said on Monday that he expected his talisman to shake
              off the niggle in time, a prediction that now seems to have come to
              fruition after the England midfielder trained without hindrance on
              Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Should the Champions League’s leading scorer be passed fit as
              expected he is likely to be partnered by Xabi Alonso and Lucas Leiva in
              midfield because of the suspension-enforced absence of Javier
              Mascherano.</p>
              <p>It is the fifth successive season that the two particular Premier

              <p>All along Gerrard nothing wrong lah... Just some stupid mind games that make no sense... He was playing like crazy at Fulham and only sub out in the last min to waste time after Pool had already scored...</p>
              <p>Its Drogba that is more likely not to start cos he didn't play on Sat and now that there is news like "He is fit and ready" I have even more doubts...</p>

              <p><br>Oh yeah... I almost forgot that Alonso and Lampard thing... This has added another twist to this game... Will either one try to get the other send off? Or will one try to injure the other... Interesting... For this reason, i will watch this match tomorrow...</p>

              insisted he will not alter his approach despite being one yellow card
              away from suspension in the UEFA Champions League. </strong></p>
              <p>Terry will lead his Chelsea side out at Anfield on Wednesday for the first leg of their quarter-final against Liverpool.</p>
              <p>If
              he is booked he will miss the return match at Stamford Bridge next week
              but he maintains he will stick to his usual style of play.</p>
              <p>"I
              know I am one yellow card away from a ban but I will handle that just
              the same as I did in the last game against Juventus when it was the
              same situation," he explained.</p>
              <p>"If there's a ball to be won, I'll go and win it. You can't go into the game thinking any other way.</p>
              <p>"But
              I'm hoping, obviously, not to make a bad tackle. I expect we will see
              an English-style match, with us trying our hardest hoping to score,
              while they will have their fans behind them.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully the referee (Claus Bo Larsen) is very lenient both ways and we can get on with the match."</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ashley Cole and Nicolas Anelka</span> are in the same situation as Terry and will miss the second leg if they are cautioned.</p>

              <p>Branislav Ivanovic was the unlikeliest of heroes in a 3-1 win for
              Chelsea at Anfield, as The Blues pinned Liverpool’s shoulders to the
              mat for the one-two-three that may be every bit as decisive as the
              count would suggest in a Champions League quarter final tie of familiar
              foes.</p>
