              <p> </p>
              <p>CHELSEA<br><br>Petr Cech - <strong>6</strong> - Had little to do all game. Is starting to get used to such easy
              shifts at Stamford Bridge — the Blues haven't conceded at home in the
              last nine hours.<br><br>Ashley Cole - <strong>6.5</strong> - Surprisingly subdued in such a one-sided performance. Was sometimes
              pegged back as Wolves tried to exploit wide areas, but got forward
              where possible to support his team-mates.<br><br>John Terry - <strong>6.5</strong> - Was not asked to exert himself too much. Dealt well defensively with
              Wolves' rare forays forward, and will be pleased to keep yet another
              home clean sheet. Made one good goal-line clearance.<br><br>Alex - <strong>7</strong> - A perfect return to the starting line-up in the Premier League for
              the Brazilian, who coped easily with Ebanks-Blake all game, and did
              well against the trickery of Jarvis. Encouraging for Ancelotti.<br><br>Juliano Belletti - <strong>6</strong> - Was guilty of some slack defending, but nothing the away side were
              able to take advantage of. A solid performance, but he doesn't look a
              long-term starting option at right-back.<br><br>John Obi Mikel - <strong>6.5</strong> - Didn't offer too much to convince Ancelotti he is the long-term
              solution at the base of the diamond. A solid display, but perhaps
              wasn't tested enough to really excel.<br><br>Michael Essien - <strong>9</strong> - Nodded home with a free header from a corner to secure the game for
              the Blues inside 15 minutes. In the absence of Frank Lampard and
              Michael Ballack the Ghanaian was released further forward, to great
              effect all game. Very unlucky to be denied a memorable hat-trick.<br><br>Florent Malouda - <strong>7.5</strong> - Sublime early strike quickly silenced the visitors after they had
              enjoyed a lively start. Provided corner for Essien's goal in very good
              all-round performance. If the Frenchman only contributed more
              defensively he would be very hard to ever leave out the first XI.<br><br>Joe Cole - <strong>6.5</strong> - Not a game where the Englishman's trickery was really needed, which
              was fortunate as Cole came up with few moments of individual
              brilliance. Solid, but unspectacular despite adding his side's fourth
              goal.<br><br>Nicolas Anelka - <strong>7</strong> - Led the line fantastically as always. Movement was impeccable, and
              his vision allowed those around him to prosper. Sacrificed his own
              goal-scoring threat to provide the space and time for others.<br><br>Salomon Kalou - <strong>6.5</strong> - A generally lively performance from the Ivorian, something he has not
              always given in other starting opportunities this season. Had a number
              of good chances, but still has a tendency to choose the wrong option.<br><br><strong>Substitutes<br></strong><br>Gael Kakuta - <strong>7</strong> - Replaced Nicolas Anelka to rapturous applause from the Stamford
              Bridge faithful, who quickly realised what a special talent the young
              Frenchman is. An extremely promising 30-minute cameo, in which he
              showed class in all areas of the game.<br><br>Nemanja Matic - <strong>6</strong> - Given first-team chance in place of Malouda. Took time to find feet
              but looked very comfortable in possession and certainly was not out of
              his depth.<br><br>Fabio Borini - <strong>6</strong> - Ancelotti has great faith in his young compatriot, and while his
              strength is understandably questionable, his intelligent runs set him
              apart as a potential star.<br><br><br>WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS<br><br>Wayne Hennessey - <strong>5</strong> - Will be disappointed with the way both Joe Cole's goal and Essien's
              second strike slipped under his body, but was let down badly by his
              defence for Chelsea's other two goals. Made many solid saves.<br><br>Greg Halford  - <strong>5.5</strong> - Questionable at times defensively, but that was almost inevitable
              considering the constant demands put on him by the Chelsea onslaught.
              Will not be too disheartened with his individual efforts.<br><br>Jody Craddock - <strong>5.5</strong> - Gave ball away for Chelsea's opener, and magnified initial error as
              he failed to close Malouda down. After that it was always a
              damage-limitation exercise.<br><br>Christophe Berra - <strong>5.5</strong> - Powerful defender struggled valiantly throughout the game, but his
              lack of real top quality was exposed time and again by the Blues. Will
              be happy to forget this afternoon.<br><br>Richard Stearman - <strong>6.5</strong> - Wolves' early collapse forced Mick McCarthy to change things
              tactically, giving the former Leicester City man license to roam
              forward. This he did admirably, causing some consternation among the
              home side. Still, was poor in his main duty as a defender.<br><br>Andrew Surman - <strong>6</strong> - Given a difficult task as a wing-back by his manager, the former
              Southampton star had his moments in the game but often his lack of
              familiarity at this level was exposed. Will emerge stronger for this
              experience.<br><br>Dave Edwards - <strong>7</strong> - In a rich vein of form, Edwards looks a quality presence in the heart
              of Wolves' midfield. Broke up Chelsea attacks and drove his side
              forward whenever possible. Impressive all-action display deserved
              better, although he did fade as game wore on.<br><br>Matt Jarvis - <strong>7</strong> - Near-perfect cross almost gave his side an early advantage, which
              could have changed the whole course of the match. Nevertheless, was the
              away side's one bright attacking influence with his consistently
              testing delivery.<br><br>Segundo Castillo - <strong>4.5</strong> - Shown up as the distinctly average defensive midfielder he is in the
              presence of Essien and Mikel. Couldn't stem the tide for his side, and
              was unsurprisingly withdrawn early into the second half as Mick
              McCarthy shuffled his pack.<br><br>Karl Henry - <strong>5.5</strong> - Torrid afternoon for the midfielder, as he saw his side completely overrun and found himself unable to do anything about it.<br><br>Sylvain Ebanks-Blake - <strong>5</strong> - Ploughed a lone furrow up front for his side, and any threat he
              carried was thoroughly nullified by the attentions of Terry and Alex.
              Hard to tell whether that is a credit to the defenders, or a criticism
              of the attacker.<br><br><strong>Substitutes</strong><br><br>Michael Kightly - <strong>6 </strong>- Offered another option to Jarvis after an early second-half introduction.<br><br>Andrew Keogh - <strong>5</strong> - Replaced the hapless Ebanks-Blake, but found it equally difficult to get involved in the game.</p>
