              <p><strong>I'm already more than happy to finish 2nd.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez has said
              that this season’s form in the Premier League has been an improvement
              on last season’s despite having key players out with injury.</p>
              <p>The Reds have almost surrendered the title to Manchester United
              but Benitez has put a positive spin on things and believes there is
              still a successful future to look forward to.</p>
              <p>“We must not forget that our league performance is better than last season,” he said.</p>
              <p>"Still, we have to improve. Yes, we have had key players injured and maybe that could have cost us four or five points.</p>
              <p>"In this title race, that would be a massive difference. We are in a good position but we could be in a much better position.</p>
              <p>"We are now rated in the Uefa rankings as the best team in
              Europe over the last five years – that underlines how we have done in
              those seasons – but we must go forward for the rest of the season, and
              in the future.</p>
              <p>"We had confidence and we were in a very good position for a long time.</p>
              <p>“It has been our best performance for several seasons but, when
              we need fresh legs when senior players are injured, things are not
              easy.”</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0px;">Benitez to ask ''everybody'' over loss of form</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.skysports.com/07/09/218x298/RafaBenitez_574338.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rafael Benitez will mount his own inquest into Liverpool's faltering title challenge, claiming that he will ask ''everybody'' to get to the root of the problem.</strong></p>
              <p>The Reds face a home Premier League game against Sunderland on Tuesday, knowing they are seven points behind leaders Manchester United, who have a game in hand after Liverpool's disastrous defeat at Middlesbrough on Saturday.</p>
              <p>The title race is all but over, with Liverpool having won only one of their last seven league games and now the recriminations will start, while boss Benitez has made it plain his own inquest will be far-reaching.</p>
              <p>When asked at a gloomy media conference if he will look at individual players, the tactics and himself, the answer was clear: ''At everybody.''</p>
              <p>Benitez accepts that confidence must be raised this week, beginning with a good performance against Sunderland to send the side into next Tuesday's Champions League last-16 second-leg clash at home to Real Madrid in the right frame of mind.</p>
              <p>If Liverpool go out of Europe - they hold a 1-0 lead from last week's first-leg victory at the Bernabeu - their season will be effectively over.</p>
              <p>They face a battle to finish in the top two of the league and automatically qualify for the Champions League, with Chelsea in second on goal difference and Aston Villa breathing down their necks.</p>
              <p>''We have talked about the mistakes we made (at Middlesbrough) and the future,'' said Benitez. ''And the immediate future is playing Sunderland, trying to get three points and then waiting to see what happens with Manchester United.</p>
              <p>''The title was difficult before; it is more difficult now. What we have to do is take our chances, and that is something that has been the same problem the whole season.''</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=24257"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fernando Torres</span></span></a> will again be missing with an ankle injury while full-back Alvaro Arbeloa is out with a hamstring problem.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: ''We have to keep going. We are disappointed so we will try to win the next game and then have a week to plan for Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>''We can still progress in the Champions League and it still gives us the chance of a trophy. We must keep going in the title race, to try to win each game as it comes along.</p>
              <p>''Now we have the opportunity against Sunderland to do things right, to be able to approach the Real Madrid second leg with confidence. We have to remain positive.</p>
              <p>''We have learned we must be more clinical, to finish games when you have chances.''</p>
              <p>He added: ''But we must not forget that our league performance is better than last season. But still we have to improve. Yes, we have had key players injured and maybe that could have cost us four or five points.</p>
              <p>''In this title race that would be a massive difference. We are in a good position but we could be in a much better position.''</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Liverpool back to winning ways at Anfield.</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Liverpool reduced the arrears on Manchester United to four points with a 2-0 home win over Sunderland.</p>
              <p>Two second half goals proved decisive as the Reds are now third in the Premiership behind Chelsea on goal difference.</p>
              <p>However the outcome could have been so different had Sunderland striker
              Kenwyne Jones taken his early chance when one-on-one with Reds keeper
              Jose Reina.</p>
              <p>David Ngog side footed home early in the first half giving the home side a timely boost.</p>
              <p>The game was made safe when Martin Fulop failed to hold Ngog's
              cross and Yossi Benayoun was on hand to apply the finishing touch.</p>
              <p>"I’m happy with the goal, but the most important thing is the points," Benayoun told <em>Sky Sports 1</em>.</p>
              <p>"After we lost against Middlesbrough, it was important to come
              back to winning ways. Now we have time to think about Real Madrid (in
              the Champions League next week).</p>
              <p>"We were very disappointed. We expected to beat Middlesbrough — but we did a job tonight.</p>
              <p>"It is important for everyone to show the supporters — even if
              it is not to win the league but to finish second and do our best."<br> Reds boss Rafa Benitez was pleased for the French teenager Ngog, who
              scored the first and created the second for Benayoun on his full home
              debut.</p>
              <p>But Benitez said: "Ngog did a very good job; he scored an excellent goal, and that gave him confidence.</p>
              <p>"Benayoun too was excellent, while we needed Jose Reina to make a very good save before we had scored.</p>
              <p>"If they had scored early on when (Kenwyne) Jones got through, it could have been a lot more difficult.</p>
              <p>"Generally we needed to keep calm, to find space and to be patient.</p>
              <p>"Now it will be important to win our next league game at
              Manchester United; if we can do that things may well be a lot different
              at the top of the table."</p>
              <p>Sunderland boss Ricky Sbragia also rued the early miss of Jones.</p>
              <p>"Jones should have scored - and on any other day, he probably would have done so," he said.</p>
              <p>"If we had scored then the game would have been very different.
              Liverpool would have become anxious and we would have given ourselves
              something to hang on to.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool would have been under pressure. We did okay in the
              first half - but once they went ahead, it was always going to be
              difficult.</p>
              <p>"We tried to change the system at that point by sending on
              Djibril Cisse, but the second goal soon after that really made it hard.</p>
              <p>"Two down away to a team of Liverpool's quality is always going to be tough.</p>
              <p>"We were also surprised by the way Liverpool played. We were expecting more long balls, but that is not what happened.</p>
              <p>"We had to gamble by bringing on more strikers. But that gave
              them space - and once they scored the second, the game was going away
              from us."</p>
