              <p>That's the problem with the english game.....above average players and they are worth a bomb. Not even world cup stars like forlan, ozil, muller, sneijder are worth that much. Maybe players like iniesta, xavi, torres etc are worthy contenders.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>City
               saw a £20 million bid for Milner, 24, rejected earlier this summer, and
               boss Mancini has now indicated he will return with a renewed offer for a
               player who Villa are thought to value at £30 million.</p>
              <p>"Milner is a good player, but today he is an Aston Villa player," Mancini told <em>Sky Sports News</em>. "If we have this chance [to sign Milner] I think we can take him, but we must wait now."</p>
              <p>City goalkeeper Shay Given, a former team-mate of Milner's at Newcastle, believes the midfielder is a quality player.</p>
              <p>"I worked with James at Newcastle and he is a very, very good player, but we have got some great players already," said Given.</p>
              <p>Patrick
               Vieira has also welcomed City's pursuit of Milner: "He [Milner] is a 
              terrific player. Of course it is not my place to say if he has to come 
              or not but when you look at players we have around it will be good. The 
              attraction of City is that the future is fantastic. We have a really 
              competitive team and I think every single player will want to play for 
              City because the future is bright for City."</p>
              <p>Earlier on Thursday, 
              O'Neill had explained: "I had a conversation with James before the World
               Cup and he intimated that he would like to go at that time.</p>
              <p>"I 
              haven't spoken to him since. I know there have been conversations with 
              his agent and our chief executive. Manchester City have made an offer 
              for the player but certainly there is a difference in valuation, but I'm
               sure things will get resolved.</p>
              <p>"James is due back next week after
               an extended stay after the World Cup - the same as the rest of the 
              World Cup players like Emile Heskey, Stephen Warnock and Brad Guzan. 
              They are all due back next week and I imagine things will get resolved 
              one way or the other in the very foreseeable future."</p>
              <p>Milner has two years remaining on his contract but is reported to have refused to discuss an extension.</p>

              <p>To be fair, I think Milner is worth the risk... Cos the guy is still very young and the potential in him being the next good English midfielder once Lampard and Gerrard goes is very likely... And that isn't too long from now... One or two yrs tops. Of course $30m is very high but I am reading it's more like $24m max from City. Anyway, the thing about Milner is, he is afterall an English player. Therefore, English clubs have to pay a premium for him...</p>
              <p>The situation in England and Spain is quite different... In England, there are a few clubs able to pay and also there are a few top sides so players are spoilt for choice. In Spain, there are only 2 clubs players aspire to play for... Either from senior level or right down to the youth level... So it's either Real or Barcelona. So things are not so complicated. Most of the best young players are filter to their youth or C or B squads early and eventually promote to the main squad should they do well... So in a way they saved a lot from buying Spanish players... But that doesn't mean they don't need to pay a premium on them as well... Look at Ramos, Real also had to pay $27m a record fee for a teenager... Then there is Alonso, Pool knew they could get more just like Arsenal now also know they can get more from Barce cos they also have to pay a premium for Spanish players...</p>
              <p>Actually it's very much the same if they want to get a citizen player... Only difference is they get them much earlier like in the case of Puyol but if they don't make it, we probably never hear of them again as they are thrown to lesser sides... And also there are lesser sides to compete for these young potentials signatures... So it's very much easier...</p>
              <p>As for City, everyone now knows you can get a premium when City comes calling just like in the case with Chelsea a few yrs ago... But on Milner, the guy is only 24... The new rule will not come into play until 2 yrs from now... So given his age, he will be just the right age when it takes effect... Unlike those 28 and above ones now... </p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> will make a £24m second and final offer for James Milner within the next 48 hours as they seek to push through a deal for the England international.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The proposed deal is being conducted amid considerable acrimony with the winger's relationship with the <span style="color: #000000;">Aston Villa</span><span style="color: #000000;"> manager, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Martin O'Neill</span><span style="color: #000000;">, threatening to unravel.</span></p>
              <p>Milner is angry and upset with O'Neill for suggesting that he had expressed a desire to leave during a meeting about his future before the World Cup finals. He also strongly rejected the manager's claim that he was offered a new contract with the club. Villa, however, have stood by O'Neill's interpretation of events and his comments, made during a pre-season trip to Dublin, prompted Milner to try to telephone the manager last night to seek an explanation.</p>
              <p>There was no indication Milner had managed to get in touch with O'Neill as the situation became increasingly fraught. Milner is due to report back to Villa for pre-season training on Monday after being given an extended break following the World Cup, although the events of the past 24 hours mean that it is almost inconceivable he will join up with his team-mates at the club's Bodymoor Heath training ground.</p>
              <p>Instead it now appears a matter of when and not if he becomes a Manchester City player. Although all the indications are that City's £24m bid will not be accepted – Villa's asking price is closer to £30m – negotiations are expected to continue with a view to a swift conclusion now it has been established Milner has no future in the Midlands. Villa are set to push for Stephen Ireland, the City midfielder who has been told he can leave the club this summer, as a makeweight in a deal.</p>
              <p>In many ways O'Neill's remarks are likely to accelerate the process. Having previously suggested the club would do all they could to keep Milner, who was outstanding last season and won the PFA Young Player of the Year award, O'Neill has publicly conceded defeat, claiming the 24-year-old had made it clear in a meeting at the end of May that he was not interested in discussing a new deal on improved terms and that he wished to leave. Milner and his representative strongly dispute this was the case and believe O'Neill has portrayed him an unfair light.</p>
              <p>"The state of affairs is really straightforward," O'Neill said. "James and his agent came to see us before the World Cup and intimated they would like to go. If that is the case then Manchester City made the offer, which we told them about. There is a difference of valuation at this moment between the buying club and the selling club. That may well be resolved and if that is the case then absolutely fine."</p>
              <p>"I think James's agent has told our chief executive he wouldn't be signing a new contract," O'Neill continued. "Obviously that puts a different slant on things, like everything else. Although I haven't spoken to James since that day, he has played in the World Cup and the rest really is pretty well straightforward. If a fee is agreed, at the end of the day, the player can leave. Manchester City have put a valuation on the player. It doesn't match our valuation but we will see. I am probably sure if that is the state of affairs, particularly if the player is keen to go, I am sure it will get resolved."</p>
              <p>How things pan out between Milner and O'Neill between now and then will be of just as much interest. The Villa manager has spent much of the previous 12 months waxing lyrical about the development of the player he signed for £12m from Newcastle United in 2008, and Milner was just as effusive in his praise of O'Neill for the part he played in his promotion to the senior England team. Yet O'Neill's latest comments have left Milner so disappointed that their previously close relationship could now be fractured beyond repair.<strong> </strong></p>

              <p>only barry and milner are overvalued and that's only because we wanted to keep our best players. at least we're not like other clubs where fringe english players and players not proven at epl are overvalued, ie. carson when he was at pool, swp at chelsea, smalling and curtis davies for 10mil...</p>

              <p>we paid 12 mil for milner and you expect villa to make a loss?</p>
              <p>the prob with the english game i think is that english players are just not good enough compared to foreign players. So when a english player comes along that's on par and almost there with the foreign players, you've gotta be prepared to pay over the odds for them cos clubs are not gonna let them go cheap.</p>
              <p>It does not help the english game even if the top clubs get to hoarde all the best young english players cos they're just gonna sit on the bench kept out by better foreign players...</p>
