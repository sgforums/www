              <h1>Drogba Was Ready To Leave Chelsea For Manchester City - Agent</h1>
              <h2>The Ivorian was all set to depart Stamford Bridge in January, according to his agent, who would also like the player to turn into an 'African Platini' when he retires...</h2>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/44103_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="222"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/people/c%C3%B4te-divoire/497/didier-drogba"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Didier Drogba</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> was on the verge of leaving </span></strong><a href="http://www.goal.com/en/teams/england/96/chelsea-news"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> in January, his agent has intimated, and only didn't do so, supposedly, because the Stamford Bridge directors made a choice between the Ivorian and coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, with the Brazilian losing out because of Drogba bringing 'history' to the club in recent seasons.</span></strong></p>
              <p>"Since last year, there have been two firm offers: Inter and Manchester City, who offered me a golden deal," the player's agent, Senegalese Thierno Seydi, is reported by <em>Setanta Sports</em> as telling <em>L’Observateur</em>.</p>
              <p>"I was okay, so was Didier, but Chelsea’s directors did say 'no'. They refused a €20 million transfer (£18 million) plus a 30-year-old player. It proves how much they trust Didier. And the president [Abramovich] was right to keep Didier because the team are winning again since he’s back in.</p>
              <p>"That’s simple, the four biggest clubs in the world are interested in him (laughs) but I won’t say more. That’s for sure.</p>
              <p>"Didier is one of the 10 best-paid players in the world, but humility is part of his personality. I want him to become an African Michel Platini when his career is over, a decision taker."</p>
              <p>Seydi also hinted that the problems between Scolari and Drogba, seemingly a running sore that helped poison Chelsea's season, was purely personal and had little to do with tactics.</p>
              <p>"The fact that he was told to sit on the bench had nothing to do with sport, it was just a problem between two men that couldn’t work together," he explained.</p>
              <p>"One had to go and Chelsea decided to part ways with Scolari. They literally said that Didier made history at the club, that he could still bring a lot to the team, so they decided to let the coach go and to keep Didier."</p>
