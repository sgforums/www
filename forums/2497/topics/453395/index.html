              TOTTENHAM chairman Daniel Levy is stalling over giving boss Harry Redknapp a new deal.
               
              Redknapp, 65, wants to tear up the remaining 12 months of his current Â£3million-a-year contract and replace it with a new three-year one which will include a significant pay increase.
               
              But Levy is not keen to offer anything longer than a one-year extension so it looks like the two men will spend the summer in a prolonged tug-of-war.
               
              Levy feels Redknapp was responsible for failing to secure a top-three finish and a guarantee of Champions League football because he was distracted by talk of becoming the next England manager.
               
              But the Redknapp camp insist the target issued by the chairman was a top-four finish and that it was hardly his fault Chelsea became kings of Europe to pip Spurs to the fourth Champions League spot.
               
              That meant the manager and players all lost out on bonus payments directly related to qualifying for Europeâ€™s premier competition.
               
              In spite of heart surgery and a gruelling court case earlier this year, Redknapp remains committed to transforming Tottenham into regular Champions League contenders.
               
              And, deep down, Levy knows he will have to tread carefully because Redknapp remains very popular with the White Hart Lane faithful.

              <p>No, he was overlooked as he was crazy for the England job. He said the FA didn't even contracted him at all. He was the Press choice but the FA had other ideas from past experienced. Just like Keegan was the Press and Fans choice as well and it didn't work out.</p>
              <p>The FA in appointing Roy said his international experienced and his past record was the main reason for their selection. I read someone mentioned Harry, in his 20 to 30 over years in mangement, only won an FA cup and have zero experienced on the international stage. All the while he has been managing small clubs with Spurs being the biggest. Roy had Inter Milan (twice) and <span style="color: #000000;">Switzerland</span> on his CV.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, the fans choice may not be the best option as fans normally base their decisions from emotions rather than practicality like we have seen at Liverpool. This time the owners went with their own choice rather than the fans choice (Rafa) after their experienced with Kenny.</p>

              Redknapp issues contract warning
                  By ESPN staff
                  
                  Harry Redknapp has told Tottenham that they would not allow any of their best players to enter into the final year of their contract, so he expects to be treated the same at White Hart Lane.
                  
                  â€¢ Redknapp plays down UCL woes
                  â€¢ Spurs cool over Harry contract Redknapp has little more than a year to run on his current deal, leading to speculation that chairman Daniel Levy is looking to the future. Everton boss David Moyes and Wigan manager Roberto Martinez have both been linked with the Tottenham post.
                  
                  "I don't think things could have gone better since I've been here," Redknapp told Sky Sports News. "We've finished fourth twice, fifth once, we've had a quarter-final of the Champions League. We've played fantastic football and I enjoy being at Tottenham.
                  
                  "It's not a case of me looking for security. What it's about is players knowing you've only got a year left on your contract. It doesn't work.
                  
                "You don't let players get down to the final year if they're any good and you don't let managers get to their final year if they're any good.
                  
                  "If Daniel doesn't think I'm worth it, that's up to him."
                  
                  Reports in some of the national newspapers claim Spurs are currently a troubled ship, something with which Redknapp strongly disagrees. Clearly he still has a strong relationship with Levy, but stories will continue to be written while his position is left precarious.
                  
                  "I've never had a problem with Daniel Levy, I've never had a minute's problem," Redknapp said. "The situation is I have a year on my contract and Tottenham have to decide if they want to extend that contract. If they don't, I go into my last year, which isn't an easy one when it comes to getting players in [while only having a year left].
                  
                  "If Daniel thinks I'm the man to take the club forward, he'll extend the contract. If he doesn't, he won't. It's up to Tottenham."
                  
                  Another report has linked Redknapp with a lucrative move to Qatar, something he strongly denied. "I don't speak to anybody else. I remember somebody saying something about Qatar - I've never been to Qatar in my life! I love it at Tottenham, but it's up to the chairman."
              
                  ==============
                  spurs can try david moyes.  redknapp is to be blamed for spurs failure last season.  he was obviously distracted by the england manager job.

              <p><span><strong>Harry Redknapp is close  to parting company with Tottenham and could leave before the end of the month.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The position of the manager, who again guided Spurs to fourth place in the Premier League, is becoming increasingly uncertain as problems relating to a new contract come to a head.</span></p>
              <p><span>Redknapp has only a year left on his current deal and wants a longer-term commitment, but he has been left uneasy by the club’s reluctance to offer it.</span></p>
              <p><span>Instead of preparing to lead his country out against France tomorrow, as most expected Redknapp would two months ago, he will watch from the sidelines and is thought to be open to the idea of a pay-off from Tottenham.</span></p>
              <p><span>Redknapp, despite public denials, has an uneasy relationship with his club chairman Daniel Levy. That has come about partly as a result of the manager being heavily linked with the England job.</span></p>
              <p><span>Redknapp said: ‘I have a year left on my contract. I’ll sit down with Daniel when the time is right.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Redknapp was unhappy that the club appeared to put an unrealistic £10million compensation price on his head in case the FA made an approach.</span></p>
              <p><span>Spurs’ failure to renew Redknapp’s contract after the appointment of Roy Hodgson as England boss then led him  to fear his position was not as secure as he had thought. That brought an escalation in the tension between him and the club and the situation will have to be resolved before the start of next season at the latest.</span></p>
              <p><span>With regard to the England job Redknapp added: ‘I was never approached. I would have taken it, though.’</span></p>

              <p>The 65-year-old will leave the club officially today.</p>
              <p>He was dumped yesterday in a showdown with Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
              <p>Redknapp wanted a new long-term deal but was stunned when Levy informed him owner Joe Lewis was after a younger boss — with Wigan’s Roberto Martinez rated the No1 target by White Hart Lane insiders.</p>
              <p>The club axed ’Arry for failing to finish higher than fourth in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>SunSport can reveal Levy told Redknapp it was the wish of billionaire Lewis that he departed.</p>
              <p>Hot tip Martinez, 38, has sprung to prominence after he inspired a brilliant last third of the season for Wigan.</p>
              <p>They escaped relegation with a scintillating brand of attacking football, beating Arsenal, Manchester United, Newcastle and Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Redknapp, who took charge in October 2008 after the disastrous reign of Juande Ramos, has paid the price for league position — despite three top-five finishes — and failing to lift silverware.</p>
              <p>Overall, Spurs felt that with the money given to Redknapp, he should have been pushing for the top slot.</p>
              <p>A severance package is currently being negotiated as the Londoners look for a new direction.</p>
              <p>One insider said: “Harry could get Spurs within touching distance but not all the way. So it has been decided it’s time for a change.”</p>
              <p>Redknapp being linked to the England job also proved a major distraction, as did his January court case.</p>
              <p>His TV appearance last week, talking about his contract situation, was poorly received too at a time when Levy was in mourning after the death of his mother.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Andre Villas-Boas and Ralf Rangnick are two of the names on the shortlist to replace Harry Redknapp. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The sacked Chelsea boss and former Schalke chief are among those under consideration as the north London club begins the search for a successor to the sacked 65-year-old. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Chairman Daniel Levy will discuss his options at a hastily-convened meeting with Spurs' top brass with several current Premier League managers also under consideration.</span></p>
              <p><span>As revealed by <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span>, David Moyes and Roberto Martinez are both strong candidates to replace Redknapp. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>However, there is a reluctance to pay out a hefty compensation figure to any club on top of that which Spurs will have to shell out to their former boss in lieu of his £3m annual salary.</span></p>
              <p><span>That has led to unemployed bosses Villas- Boas and Rangnick entering the frame. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>While Villas-Boas's credentials will be known to Spurs' fans, those of career-coach Rangnick will be more of a mystery. <br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The German was in line for the post at West Bromwich Albion earlier this month before the Black Country club decided to give Steve Clarke his chance in front-line management. </span></p>

              <p><span>Marseille manager Didier Deschamps and Ajax coach Frank de Boer will be on the radar if the club decides to approach a foreign coach in employment, while erstwhile Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez is certain to be interested in the post. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Meanwhile, England manager Roy Hodgson expressed his surprise at Redknapp's departure. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Redknapp was the favourite with bookmakers to replace Fabio Capello before Hodgson was appointed. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Hodgson said: 'I was very sad to hear the news. It came as a major surprise to me and I'm disappointed for him. <br></span></p>

              if spurs is serious about doing better than challenging for 4th they should go for someone with pedigree.

              <strong><span style="font-size: medium;">
              <p>TOTTENHAM face a player revolt if they push ahead with plans to appoint ex-Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas.</p>
              </span></strong>
              <p>AVB, 34, is earmarked to replace Harry Redknapp and has already held productive talks with the North London club.</p>
              <p>But some senior Spurs stars have spoken to Chelsea players who claimed Villas-Boas was a nightmare to work with and told them to steer well clear of the Portuguese coach.</p>
              <p>Many Tottenham players are already unhappy at Redknapp’s shock sacking last Wednesday.</p>
              <p>And chairman Daniel Levy now faces the prospect of making an appointment that might tear the dressing room apart at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>Ruthless Levy, who showed no mercy in sacking Redknapp despite leading Spurs to a fourth-place finish last term, could refuse to be dictated to by militant players and push ahead with his move for AVB.</p>
              <p>Or he may have to turn his attention towards France boss Laurent Blanc or Wigan’s Roberto Martinez.</p>
              <p>Blanc, 46, has transformed the French national team since taking over following their 2010 World Cup debacle.</p>
              <p>They have gone 23 games unbeaten including last week’s 1-1 draw with England and a 2-0 win over co-hosts Ukraine at Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>Blanc also spent three years as manager of Bordeaux, wining the French Double in 2009.</p>
              <p>Spurs have yet to officially approach Wigan owner Dave Whelan for permission to speak to Martinez.</p>
              <p>And one stumbling block to a move for the Spaniard could be the imminent appointment of Tim Sherwood as director of football at Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Martinez, 38, was opposed to working with Louis van Gaal in a similar capacity at Liverpool.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Tottenham Hotspur</span><span style="color: #000000;"> have held direct negotiations with </span><span style="color: #000000;">André Villas-Boas</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and they are poised to offer him the manager's job. Tottenham officials met Villasâ€‘Boas's agent in London last Friday and Saturday to explain what they were looking for in the successor to Harry Redknapp, who they sacked last Wednesday. But they have since accelerated the process by speaking directly to Villas-Boas.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The 34-year-old Portuguese, who was dismissed by </span><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span> in March, was initially unsure whether he was the Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy's first choice for the vacancy. He felt that Levy had other candidates in mind, which was true, with Everton's David Moyes numbering among them. But it has become clear that Villasâ€‘Boas is the man that Levy wants to lead Tottenham into a new era.</p>
              <p>The sacking of Redknapp represented a gamble, as he had led the club to fourth-, fifth- and fourth-placed finishes in the Premier League in the past three seasons, only missing out on Champions League qualification last month when Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in the final of the competition.</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas knows that Levy's minimum requirement is to qualify for Europe's elite tournament. The chairman also wants to be challenging for the league title in the near future. Redknapp often said he thought "there was a championship in this club". It is a demanding brief and the jury remains out in some quarters over Villasâ€‘Boas. He has plenty to prove after his ill-fated Chelsea tenure, when he failed to impose his will on the squad's strong personalities. It hurt his reputation that, after his dismissal, the team recovered to win the Champions League and FA Cup under Roberto Di Matteo. But Levy has come to view Villas-Boas as the dynamic young coach to drive the club forward.</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas and his representative have sought assurances about the future of Tottenham's best players, chief among them the midfielder Luka Modric, who has exited Euro 2012 with Croatia and is determined to be granted a big transfer this summer. Villasâ€‘Boas tried to sign Modric when he was at Chelsea last summer, only for Levy to block the £40m proposal.</p>
              <p>It is unclear whether Levy will be able to hold on to Modric for another season, although he is empowered to hold the player to his contract, which has four years to run. He is adamant he would not sell Modric to Chelsea or Manchester United but he may be more receptive to a bid from Real Madrid, particularly if the sum on offer was upwards of £40m.</p>
              <p>Tottenham's new manager, though, will be granted a large transfer kitty to reshape the squad in his image, and it stands to be even larger if Modric were to leave. The priority area is centre-forward. The club are struggling to satisfy Emmanuel Adebayor's wage demands to make his loan move from Manchester City permanent; they have not taken up the option on Louis Saha. Jermain Defoe is the only established striker.</p>
              <p>Levy is keen to find a more senior role within the set-up for Tim Sherwood, the youth development squad coach. Sherwood survived the cull of Redknapp's backroom staff, which accounted for Kevin Bond, Joe Jordan and Clive Allen, because Levy considers him to be an asset to the club.</p>
