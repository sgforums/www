              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;"> have added Jordan Henderson to their list of midfield targets for the summer as Kenny Dalglish prepares to test </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Sunderland</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #000000;">'s resolve to keep the England international at the Stadium of Light.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Henderson had been linked with a move to Manchester United earlier in the season as his impressive form earned a full England debut against France in November and prompted the Sunderland manager, Steve Bruce, to value the 20-year-old at £20m. Now Liverpool are keen on the Sunderland-born talent and with their owner, Fenway Sports Group, allocating a substantial transfer budget to Dalglish, they have the means to prise Henderson away from his boyhood club.</p>
              <p>Sunderland have dismissed claims that they had received and rejected a £13m offer from Liverpool for the midfielder, and the Anfield club refused to make any comment on the potential transfer. However Henderson's club are aware of Liverpool's interest and expect that to develop into a firm bid during the close season. The midfielder is in Stuart Pearce's squad for the European Under-21 Championship in Denmark this month, and his future is unlikely to be resolved before that competition is over.</p>
              <p>Bruce would be opposed to losing a player he has championed since Henderson established himself in the Sunderland first team two seasons ago and who signed a five-year contract with the club in April 2010. The Sunderland manager is determined to rebuild with "eight or nine" new players this summer and has £18m to spend from the sale of Darren Bent to Aston Villa in January. But a major offer for Henderson would assist his attempted revamp, particularly if the player were receptive to an Anfield move.</p>
              <p>Dalglish is keen to add more quality to the Liverpool midfield next season. Though Henderson impressed in central midfield in his first full campaign for Sunderland, he is also comfortable on the right of midfield and his crossing ability would appeal to a manager seeking to improve the supply to Andy Carroll. The Aston Villa pair of Stewart Downing and Ashley Young are also on Dalglish's wanted list, as is Blackpool's Charlie Adam, although he faces competition from Manchester United for Young and a difficult task to prise Downing from Villa Park. Villa are resigned to losing Young this summer but are reluctant to let Downing go too, even though the England international is refusing to extend a contract that has two years remaining and has begun publicly agitating for an exit from the Midlands.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Liverpool are closing in on a £30million swoop for two of England’s hottest prospects — Blackburn defender Phil Jones and Sunderland midfielder Jordan Henderson.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Anfield giants increased their initial offer of £13m for Henderson, 20, to £15m yesterday and are hopeful Sunderland will compromise on their asking price of £18m.<br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"></div>
              <div class="artSplitter"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Liverpool are also ready to make a formal offer to Blackburn for £15m-rated Jones, though they face a battle for him with Arsenal and Tottenham.<br></span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The moves are part of Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish’s strategy of buying top English talent, having signed striker Andy Carroll in January for £35m from Newcastle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The club have also asked about the availability of midfielder Lee Cattermole at the Stadium of Light.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Henderson and Jones are in Spain with the England Under 21 party preparing for this month’s European Championship in Denmark. Stuart Pearce’s squad fly home tonight before travelling to Southampton for Sunday’s friendly against Norway, but Henderson is on stand-by to travel to Merseyside and complete the deal as soon as the two clubs agree a fee.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Liverpool’s move for Jones will alert Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who has made it known he wants to build his back four around the 19-year-old. Wenger was prepared to wait a year while signing Jones’s Blackburn team-mate Chris Samba now.<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>That deal is advanced but Liverpool’s move may force Wenger to rethink his plans for Jones, who has impressed in the centre of defence and midfield since making his Premier League debut against Chelsea in March last year. He signed a five-year deal that May and extended it by 12 months in February.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Blackburn would prefer to keep their prize asset and sell Samba but accept that they will not be able to stand in Jones’s way if the right offer comes in. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dalglish has already signalled a change of direction at Anfield since succeeding Roy Hodgson by handing first-team opportunities to 17-year-old Jack Robinson, 18-year-old John Flanagan and 21-year-old Martin Kelly, and giving a new deal to Jay Spearing, 22.</span></p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">LIVERPOOL are ready to launch a £15million raid for Charles N'Zogbia after moving a step closer to finalising a deal for Jordan Henderson.</h2>
              <p>Wigan winger N'Zogbia, 25, will be top of Kop boss Kenny Dalglish's wanted list once they complete the signing of Sunderland midfielder Henderson, which could happen this weekend.</p>
              <p>The Reds have increased their original £12m offer to £15m, which is a lot closer to Sunderland's £18m valuation.</p>
              <p>Henderson, 20, is currently on duty with the England Under-21s and is keen for a deal to be sewn up before they head out to Denmark for the European Championships next week.</p>
              <p>There is a convenient window for business to be done with Stuart Pearce's side playing a friendly against Norway in Southampton on Sunday before they fly out three days later.</p>
              <p>N'Zogbia caught Dalglish's eye with his brilliant form as Wigan took eight points from their last four games to avoid relegation.</p>
              <p>He scored four times, including the all-important stoppage-time winner against West Ham.</p>
              <p>Wigan turned down a £12m bid from Birmingham in January. But the French international only has a year left on his contract and the Latics would find it difficult to resist an improved bid from Liverpool.</p>
              <p>That would free up funds for Wigan boss Roberto Martinez, who is to be offered a new three-year contract to head off possible interest from Fulham and Aston Villa.</p>

              <p>I think Henderson will be playing regularly if he signs for Liverpool. He can play on the wings too, maybe a signal that Joe Cole's and Jovanovic's days are over.</p>

              <p>It's definitely over for those two. I will be surprise if any of them is still around when the new season starts as Jovanovic has already said he wants to leave. Joe could go to Spurs to revive his career again...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JORDAN HENDERSON will quadruple his wages with a £20million Liverpool move.</h2>
              <p>The Sunderland midfielder will now be on £60,000 a week as part of a four-year contract.</p>
              <p>Henderson, 20, spent yesterday having a medical in a private hospital on Merseyside.</p>
              <p>Kop striker David Ngog will become David Ngone, moving the opposite way as part of the deal.</p>
              <p>Henderson can now focus on England's European Under-21 Championship bid after linking up with Stuart Pearce's squad 24 hours late in Denmark.</p>
              <p>The signing softens the blow for Kop boss Kenny Dalglish after he missed out on Blackburn's Phil Jones.</p>
              <p>Dalglish now has Birmingham's £10m-rated Scott Dann as his major defensive target, with Paris St Germain stopper Mamadou Sakho as the alternative.</p>
              <p>Dann, 24, was a crucial loss in the season's run-in for Birmingham and his absence was a key factor in their relegation.</p>
              <p>The centre-back was in excellent form until a hamstring injury kept him out for the last four months.</p>
              <p>Villa winger Stewart Downing, Blackpool skipper Charlie Adam and Ipswich rookie Connor Wickham are others on Dalglish's hit-list.</p>
              <p>French international Sylvain Marveaux is also set to arrive on a free from Rennes next month, with Newcastle left-back Jose Enrique another likely new face.</p>
              <p>Barcelona rookie Jeffren Suarez is also available for a token fee after being told by the Champions League winners that he is surplus to requirements.</p>
