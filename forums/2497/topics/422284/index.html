              <p><em>Bendtner: "I didn't know I could become rich from football."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">NICKLAS BENDTNER is set to infuriate hard-up football fans by claiming he EARNS his massive £52,000-a-week pay packet.</h2>
              <p>The Arsenal striker even wears the No 52 shirt to match his mind-blowing Emirates wedge.</p>
              <p>Yet Bendtner, 23, says it is only fair he picks up an incredible salary because he misses out on other pleasures in life - such as skiing.</p>
              <p>The Denmark star, poised to face England tomorrow, said: "I would lie if I said I didn't enjoy the money I earn in football.</p>
              <p>"We spend an incredible amount of time, energy and focus on our career because when we are not training or playing we still have to live for football.</p>
              <p>"It is always fair to ask whether players are worth the incredible amounts of money. "We must be worth our salaries because that is how the mechanisms of society works, isn't it?</p>
              <p>"As long as I work as hard as I can then I believe I'm worth what is coming my way. I pay a big price with my body, my time and with never being able to have privacy when I am out.</p>
              <p>"I don't complain about that. It's a part of being a professional footballer but it's definitely a price to pay.</p>
              <p>"Again, I am not complaining but I love to go on a skiing holiday but as long as I have my career I can't do that because of the risk of injury.</p>
              <p>"When I was a boy in Copenhagen I only played for the sake of the game and never thought about money or being famous.</p>
              <p>"I didn't know I could become rich from football."</p>
              <p>In fairness to Bendtner, he is an ambassador of a children's cancer charity in Denmark and often makes hospital visits.</p>
              <p>He said: "It is private, what sort of money I spend on charity. I don't do it to get publicity but because it is so good to be able to help."</p>
              <p>As for tomorrow's game, he added: "England are a fantastic side but for some reason never win anything. They have a squad capable of winning the World Cup but always disappoint."</p>
