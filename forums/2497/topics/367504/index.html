              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Inter Milan boss Jose Mourinho has reignited his feud with Carlo Ancelotti, saying he is 'no friend' of the Chelsea boss.</p>
              <p>Mourinho had a difficult relationship with a number of
              his fellow coaches in Serie A last season, and he exchanged words with
              former Milan boss Ancelotti on several occasions.</p>
              <p>At his first
              press conference as Chelsea boss, Ancelotti said he did not want to be
              compared to Mourinho and added: "I don't know any 'Special One'."</p>
              <p>And,
              when a British journalist asked Mourinho about 'his friend' Ancelotti
              at the Inter press conference on Friday, the Portuguese replied: "He is
              not my friend.</p>
              <p>"He is a good coach with plenty of experience and could do well.</p>
              <p>"Ancelotti
              says he doesn't know any 'Special One'? I don't either, but I do know a
              coach who won two consecutive titles with Chelsea after 50 years
              without winning it."</p>
              <p>He added: "In England, they now say that he is Prince Charles, but I only know one Prince Charles - the Prince of Wales."</p>
              <h4>Impact</h4>
              <p>Ancelotti,
              though, has said that there is no 'war' with Mourinho and reiterated
              that he would like to put his own stamp on Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"I think Mourinho is a great coach because he won a lot of trophies but it's not a war between Mourinho and me," he said.</p>
              <p>"It's
              normal that he is popular in Chelsea because he won the Premier League
              but I also want to win it. I also want to be popular with the fans.</p>
              <p>"I'm not sure if the period of time here will be long or short but I want the people to remember me."</p>
              <h5>Blues duo</h5>
              <p>Mourinho,
              meanwhile, refused to be drawn on whether Inter could make a fresh
              attempt to sign Blues duo Ricardo Carvalho and Deco.</p>
              <p>"I don't want to talk about that," he said.</p>
              <p>"I only speak about the players we have at the club.</p>
              <p>"However, the transfer market will be open for a long time."</p>

              <p class="article">Last season Inter Milan boss Mourinho clashed with the Italian, who used to 
              manage AC, when they shared the San Siro.</p>
              <p class="article">Now new Chelsea chief Ancelotti will wake up today facing a new broadside from 
              the Portugeezer.</p>
              <p class="article">Mourinho said: "They say of Ancelotti in England that he is Prince Charles.</p>
              <p class="article">"But I only know one Prince Charles - and that is the Prince of Wales. 
              Ancelotti is no friend of mine."</p>
              <p class="article">Mourinho was hitting out in response to a dig from Ancelotti earlier this week 
              in which he refused to acknowledge his predecessor's self-appointed status 
              as The Special One.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea, meanwhile, are attempting to sort the John Terry saga within the next 
              five days.</p>
              <p class="article">Ancelotti takes his squad on a summer tour of the USA on Thursday.</p>
              <p class="article">But there are now genuine fears that the Blues skipper's 'head could go' in 
              his standoff with the club over interest from Manchester City and that he 
              may end up leaving Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p class="article">Blues insiders believe Terry is upset that Ancelotti spoke out on Monday <strong>BEFORE</strong> talking to him about City's ongoing interest - and that this is at the heart 
              of the problem.</p>
              <p class="article">Talks between miffed Terry and the Blues top brass are planned for the next 
              few days, even though Chelsea still insist there is no issue to be resolved.</p>
              <p class="article">Ancelotti publicly declared England centre-half Terry is not for sale at any 
              price and that the case is closed.</p>
              <p class="article">But behind the scenes there are moves to try to nip a growing rift in the bud 
              between the club and their iconic captain before matters get out of hand.</p>

              <p class="article">Cole is set to be left behind by Ancelotti as he continues rehab work 
              following knee surgery.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea medics believe the long flights - and four matches crammed into 10 
              days - would not suit the England star's recovery.</p>
              <p class="article">He is back in pre-season training and a firm decision will be made in the next 
              few days.</p>
              <p class="article">Cole has also had preliminary contract talks with Chelsea as he enters the 
              last year of his current deal.</p>
              <p class="article">But both parties agree there is no rush.</p>

              <p class="article">Italian Ancelotti is the fourth manager at Stamford Bridge since Mourinho left 
              in September 2007 after winning every domestic competition.</p>
              <p class="article">Only the Champions League crown eluded the 'Special One' during his spell at 
              Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">Since then Avram Grant, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Ray Wilkins and Guus Hiddink have 
              all taken turns in charge.</p>
              <p class="article">Now Ancelotti is determined to become as popular and as successful as 
              Mourinho.</p>
              <p class="article">Ancelotti said: "Mourinho is a great coach because he won a lot of 
              trophies but it's not a war between us.</p>
              <p class="article">"It's natural that he is popular in Chelsea because he won the Premier League 
              but I also want to win it. I also want to be popular with the fans.</p>
              <p class="article">"I'm not sure if the period of time here will be long or short but I want the 
              people to remember me."</p>
              <p class="article">Ancelotti's most immediate chance of winning over the fans is to end the 
              uncertainty over the future of his captain John Terry.</p>
              <p class="article">The defender is still being courted by Manchester City although Chelsea insist 
              that he is not for sale at any price.</p>
              <p class="article">City have already had a £30million bid rejected by the Blues but are expected 
              to return with an even higher offer if they feel relations between Terry and 
              Chelsea become strained.</p>
              <p class="article">Terry held talks with Ancelotti at the club's Cobham training ground after 
              returning from his summer break.</p>
              <p class="article">He is also believed to have spoken with club director Eugene Tenenbaum, 
              although chief executive Peter Kenyon and owner Roman Abramovich were not 
              there.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea have already scoffed at suggestions that they failed to keep Terry in 
              the loop over City's interest and insist there has been no major change to 
              the player's stance since City first declared their interest last January.</p>
              <p class="article">Terry is more likely to stay for another tilt at the Champions League and is 
              expected to press Chelsea for a new, more lucrative contract, with wages 
              closer to Manchester City's reported offer of £200,000 a week.</p>
              <p class="article">The club are almost certain to improve the defender's contract before City's 
              billionaire owners return with another bid.</p>
              <p class="article">After the FA Cup final victory over Everton last May, Terry said he hoped the 
              club would bring in players of the quality and class of David Villa and 
              Franck Ribery.</p>
              <p class="article">But so far, goalkeeper Ross Turnbull, teenage striker Daniel Sturridge and 
              Russia left-back Yuri Zhirkov have been the only additions to a squad that 
              reached the semi-finals of the Champions League last season.</p>
