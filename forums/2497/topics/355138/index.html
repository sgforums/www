              <p>Arsenal scored a vital away goal in their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Villarreal.</p>
              <p>The Gunners conceded an early goal when Villarreal captain Marcos Senna smashed a 25-yard strike past goalkeeper Manuel Almunia.</p>
              <p>The home fans were whipped into a frenzy after just 10 minutes as they gained the ascendency.</p>
              <p>Arsenal had their share of problems with first half injuries forcing
              defender William Gallas and Alumina off the pitch causing manager
              Arsene Wenger to ring the changes.</p>
              <p>The visitors were yearning for an equaliser to get something
              out of the trip and it took the brilliant Emmanuel Adebayor to produce
              that goal in the 66th minute.</p>
              <p>The Togo striker received the ball on his chest whilst
              surrounded by three defenders but managed to conjure a stunning scissor
              kick to send the ball into the back of the net.</p>
              <p>Villarreal pressed forward after Adebayor’s piece of magic but
              could not force a winner and now Arsenal have everything going their
              way for the return leg at Emirates Stadium.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>VILLARREAL - Emmanuel Adebayor's
              superb overhead strike secured Arsenal a 1-1 draw away to Villarreal in
              their Champions League quarter-final, first leg on Tuesday. </strong><br> <br> The game was only 10 minutes old when Villarreal midfielder Marcos
              Senna received the ball outside the area and scored with a fierce drive
              that flew into the top corner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Arsenal were hindered by
              first-half injuries to goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and defender William
              Gallas who both had to be substituted, as Villarreal dominated.</p>
              <p>But the Londoners responded in
              the second half and Adebayor's acrobatic effort from Cesc Fabregas's
              pass in the 66th minute left the visitors with an away-goal advantage
              for the return leg in London on April 15. <br> <br> "I don't even know how I scored that, but the most important thing was
              that the ball went into the back of the net," Adebayor told ITV.</p>
              <p>"It was quite difficult for us
              because they played some very good football. The second leg is going to
              be tough, but we will do everything to get through. We got a good
              result to take home and we are very happy."</p>
              <p>A match which started at a
              hectic pace, full of slick passing from both sides, was blown open when
              Senna's thunderbolt left Almunia with no chance.</p>
              <p>Visiting defender Gael Clichy
              had already blocked an attempt from a corner on the line by then, but
              Arsenal responded with Samir Nasri testing keeper Diego Lopez at his
              near post in the 18th minute.</p>
              <p><strong>DOUBLE BLOW</strong></p>
              <p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger
              was forced into making a change in the 27th when Almunia had to be
              substituted for Lukasz Fabianski, after he failed to recover from an
              earlier knock to his right ankle.</p>
              <p>Fabianski had barely got his bearings when he had to make a a double save from Senna and then Joan Capdevila.</p>
              <p>Three minutes before the break,
              it was Gallas, struggling with an injury to his right leg, who had to
              be replaced by Johan Djourou as Villarreal comfortably held the
              visitors at bay.</p>
              <p>Arsenal playmaker Fabregas and
              winger Theo Walcott started to find some space after the break, though
              it was not until midway through the second half that Adebayor
              threatened the home goal with a header.</p>
              <p>Soon after, Fabregas's long
              pass found Adebayor with his back to goal in the area, and the Togo
              striker controlled on his chest and twisted in the air to volley over
              his shoulder, and wide of Lopez into the far corner.</p>
              <p>Villarreal, who are unbeaten at
              home in this competition, pressed hard towards the end with Senna and
              Diego Godin going close, but Arsenal held firm and carried plenty of
              threat themselves on the break.</p>
              <p>Senna told Antena 3 television:
              "We started at a good pace but eased off a little in the second half.
              That's the way quarter-finals go sometimes.</p>
              <p>"The tie remains open. Although they have home advantage now and an away goal we won't be throwing in the towel."</p>
