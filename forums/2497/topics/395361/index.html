              (fractured fibula), William Gallas (calf strain)
               and Andrey 
              Arshavin (torn calf) have joined long-term injury victims Robin van Persie
               (whose lengthy recovery from serious ankle ligament damage continues, 
              though he could return in a few weeks), Aaron Ramsey (double leg 
              fracture), Kieran Gibbs (broken metatarsal) and Johan Djourou (knee 
              surgery) on the sidelines.<br><br>But Gael Clichy (back) and midfielder 
              Denilson (groin), also injured in midweek, have passed late fitness 
              tests.<br><br>Sol Campbell could replace Gallas in central defence 
              alongside Thomas
               Vermaelen, who is available again after serving a one-match
               ban last week. <br><br>Further forward, Samir Nasri and Abou Diaby 
              will shoulder the creative burden in the absence of Fabregas, while Theo
               Walcott will hope to return to the starting line-up in place of 
              Arshavin after impressing when he came off the bench against Barcelona.<br><em><br>Last
               starting XI (v Barcelona):
               Almunia, Sagna (Walcott 66), Vermaelen, Gallas (Denilson 44), Clichy, 
              Diaby, Fabregas, Nasri, Song, Arshavin (Eboue 27), Bendtner. Subs not 
              used: Fabianski, Campbell, Rosicky, Eduardo.</em><br><br><strong>Wolves</strong><br><br>Mick
               McCarthy is without striker Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, who has a virus, so 
              Sam Vokes is expected to take his place on the substitutes' bench.<br><br>Michael
               Kightly is still sidelined with ankle and knee problems. Otherwise, 
              McCarthy has no new injury problems to deal with, and is therefore 
              likely to name the side that drew with Everton last week.<br><br><em>Last
               starting XI (v Everton):
               Hahnemann, Zubar, Craddock, Berra, Elokobi, Foley, Mancienne (Guedioura
               70), Henry, David Jones, Jarvis (Ward 90), Doyle (Iwelumo 90). Subs not
               used: Hennessey, Ebanks-Blake, Keogh, Milijas.</em><br><br><strong>PLAYERS
               TO WATCH<br><br>Arsenal<br><br>Theo
               Walcott</strong> has had a frustrating, stop-start season because of a 
              succession of injuries, but has recently appeared to be getting back to 
              his best, albeit mostly deployed as an impact substitute when his pace 
              can terrorise tiring defenders. <br><br>That was demonstrated again 
              against Barcelona,
               when his introduction proved to be a turning point. He may get to start
               against Wolves, and another goal like the one that beat Victor Valdes would 
              be a welcome boost for the hosts.<br><br><strong>Wolves<br></strong><br>Irish
               striker <strong>Kevin Doyle</strong> has been in impressive form, 
              leading the line for McCarthy's side with intelligence, strength and 
              commendable perseverance. <br><br>He has not been a prolific scorer 
              (seven goals this season, all of them in the league), but he set the 
              team on their way with an excellent opener against West Ham recently, 
              and his current form should give him all the confidence he needs to 
              stretch a less than watertight Arsenal defence.<br><br><strong>PREDICTION</strong><br><br>A
               game that a few weeks ago looked like a safe bet for a home win has 
              suddenly become a much sterner test because of Arsenal's injury pile-up 
              and Wolves' fine run of form. Wolves can enter the arena as relaxed but 
              buoyant underdogs, while Arsenal know they cannot afford the slightest 
              slip after dropping two points last week.<br><br>The Midlands side will 
              not be able to emulate Barcelona's mesmeric 
              passing, but they may well attempt to match the Catalans' impressive 
              closing down of their opponents in the first half last Wednesday. <br><br>All
               in all, it is building up to be another potentially jittery afternoon 
              for Arsenal. An early goal or two would settle home nerves nicely; 
              scoring them is the challenge facing Wenger's men.<br><em><br></em><strong><em>Arsenal

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Nicklas Bendtner came off the bench to head a dramatic 
              stoppage-time winner and keep Arsenal's Barclays Premier League title 
              dreams alive with a narrow win over 10-man Wolves at the Emirates 
              Stadium.</p>
              <p>The Gunners - outplayed by Barcelona for large spells at home on 
              Tuesday night - made seven changes to their starting XI as manager 
              Arsene Wenger clearly had one eye on next week's Champions League 
              quarter-final second leg at the Nou Camp.</p>
              <p>However, despite dominating the home side could not find a 
              breakthrough until deep into five minutes of stoppage time.</p>
              <p>Wolves defended bravely and overcame the sending off of captain 
              Karl Henry for a late challenge on Tomas Rosicky only to be denied when 
              Bendtner headed in what could prove to be the young Dane's most vital 
              strike yet.</p>
              <p>Bendtner also netted a last-gasp strike as the Gunners defeated 
              Hull last month.</p>
              <p>The victory keeps Arsenal on the coat tails of Chelsea and 
              Manchester United with five games remaining.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Just four days after their artful struggle against Barcelona and Arsenal were 
                  accused of spoiling their beautiful football with play-acting, moaning and 
                  intimidation.</strong></p>
              <p>The case was made by Wolves captain Karl Henry, harshly sent off at the 
                  Emirates and who fingered Tomas Rosicky and Thomas Vermaelen for conning referee 
                  Andre<br>Marriner into the red card.</p>
              <p>Even Arsene Wenger admitted his players over-reacted to the challenge which 
                  sent<br>Rosicky into an exaggerated roll, and the FA will await Marriner’s 
                  report before deciding whether to charge the Gunners with intimidation.</p>
              <p>‘It’s a disgrace, an absolute disgrace,’ said an angry Henry. ‘I’ve nicked 
                  the ball and Vermaelen has come flying in and whoever else trying to get me sent 
                  off. It’s not nice to see.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">‘They play good football here and they’re a great side. We love Arsenal’s 
                  great football but when they’re rolling around, getting people sent off, it 
                  makes you not want to see them do so well. Two minutes later, he’s up, running 
                  around and absolutely fine.</div>
              <p>‘That’s what they do here. I don’t think it’s pretty and it’s not good. Their 
                  players moan when they get tackled, when they get hit hard, and so does Arsene 
                  Wenger. It’s part of the game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/04/article-1263558-08FD9D29000005DC-432_233x306.jpg" alt="Wolverhampton Wanderers' manager Mick McCarthy (R) talks to Karl Henry" width="233" height="306">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Show of support: Mick McCarthy (right) had sympathy for 
                  his player</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>‘Here in particular, Arsenal moan a lot. Their players go down like a sack of 
                  spuds. They get hit hard like other clubs do and we’re hearing about it for 
                  weeks and weeks. To get sent off is a disgrace.’</strong></p>
              <p>Henry plans to appeal against the dismissal, which carries a three-match ban 
                  but could be extended if his appeal is considered frivolous.</p>
              <p>‘It’s sad to see you can’t tackle any more,’ said the 27-year-old. ‘I grew up 
                  watching some of the older games and I’ve seen tackles flying in. Today it seems 
                  you can’t make contact with anybody.</p>
              <p>‘I can understand how he gives a foul. But I’ve seen it again and I nick the 
                  ball. It was never a red card.’</p>
              <p>Wenger did not condone the reaction of his players but offered the horrific 
                  injuries suffered by Eduardo and Aaron Ramsey in explanation.</p>
              <p>‘There is still a trauma in the team,’ said the Arsenal manager. ‘But we have

              <p><strong>Wenger’s crusade against what he considers a specific tactic to kick his 
                  players has generated a mob mentality at the Emirates, where the home crowd bay 
                  for red cards whenever their heroes are tackled aggressively.</strong></p>
              <p>The fury was turned on Wolves boss Mick McCarthy as he applauded Henry off 
                  and put an arm around his captain. </p>
              <p>‘I felt bad for Karl,’ said McCarthy. ‘I ushered him off and congratulated 
                  him on his performance. The fans may have thought I was congratulating him on 
                  kicking one of their players but I don’t advocate that. I don’t ask anyone to 
                  kick anyone.</p>
              <p>‘I became the pantomime villain. They’ve come here, they’ve won and they boo 
                  me off. Am I bothered? I’m bothered we lost. They booed me off because my team 
                  actually gave them a fright.’</p>

              <p><strong>Wolves went within seconds of killing Arsenal’s title hopes. The visitors could have been four down inside 20 minutes, but rode their 
                  luck, grafted and grew in confidence before substitute Nicklas Bendtner headed 
                  another added-time winner — the Gunners’ third in their last six league games — 
                  from Bacary Sagna’s cross.</strong></p>
              <p>‘We kept composed and didn’t hoof the ball,’ said Bendtner. ‘Wolves like to take three minutes every time they have a throw-in or a 
                  goal-kick and it’s frustrating.</p>
              <p>‘They wasted a lot of time and there was a lot added on. We got what we 
                  deserved in the end, which was a victory.’</p>

              <p>i think it is a red card. no doubt about that.</p>
              <p>this tacle is challenge from behind and at high speed. if you had no attempt totake someone out why make the challenge if rosicky is just pass the ball way outside the penalty box.</p>
