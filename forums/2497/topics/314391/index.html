              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Liverpool's two estranged American owners?       </span><span style="color: #000000;">Gillett &amp; Hicks...</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez was considering his Liverpool future on Sunday night after claiming that he had been undermined by chief executive Rick Parry. In an astonishing twist to the bickering that is ripping Liverpool apart, furious manager Benitez demanded answers over Parry's alleged role in the recent approach for Jurgen Klinsmann and appeared to side with co-owner Tom Hicks in questioning the Anfield administrator's conduct.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez has so far detached himself from Anfield's boardroom feud, but is now privately airing misgivings over whether he can continue working alongside Parry. He could not contain his anger after learning that Parry not only attended last November's meeting at Klinsmann's California home but helped set it up. Benitez knew joint-owners Hicks and George Gillett were there, and Klinsmann was effectively offered his job, but was unaware of Parry's input.</p>
              <p>Benitez said: 'I was surprised to read about some meeting with another manager. More to the point, I was surprised by who was apparently at that meeting. 'I want answers. I feel my situation is being undermined by it, and that is why I want some clarification. I need to speak to members of the board. All of them. I don't know when. Could it be a matter of days? It could be hours.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="thumbed_image" rel="lightbox" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/04/10/ixliverpool110.jpg"><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/graphics/2008/04/10/ixliverpool110.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="192"></a></p>
              <p>Hicks put Parry in the frame after being riled by the Anfield chief's claim that the ongoing row was 'offensive' towards Benitez, the players and supporters. Hicks said: 'I did not hear him say it was offensive when George Gillett gave his radio interview telling the world our relationship had become unbearable. I did not hear Gillett or Parry say they were the ones who set up the Klinsmann meeting, yet both were there, along with Foster Gillett, myself and my son. Rick allowed all the controversy to build up without taking any responsibility.'</p>
              <p>The fear for Liverpool is that Benitez could be ripe for an approach from Real Madrid or Barcelona at the end of the season. Hicks said: 'I will formally request George's approval to terminate Rick's contract. If he chooses not to, the record will be clear. 'Rick Parry has been Liverpool's CEO for 10 years and we haven't won a league championship under his leadership. Our commercial revenues have not kept up with other top clubs during that time, which has made it very difficult to compete for the Premier League.</p>
              <p>'After watching him operate, I came to the conclusion it was time to ask him to resign, due to his inability to manage an organisation, his seemingly arrogant attitude to our supporters and his lack of communication with Rafa. 'I reached my decision a few weeks ago but waited until after the games against Everton and Arsenal. It is important to try to have a new CEO by May so we can begin working with Rafa on player transfers.'</p>
