              </div>
              <p>The agent of Guus Hiddink has hinted at talks with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Cees van Nieuwenhuizen confirmed that Turkey were interested in appointing former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> manager, but said they were just one of nine suitors for his client.</p>
              <p>"I have spoken with representatives of four clubs and five national federations," Van Nieuwenhuizen told <em>Sovetskiy Sport</em>. "Almost all of the options have previously been mentioned in the press - <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Juventus</span></abbr>, etc.</p>
              <p>"However, as I have repeatedly said, we have not held talks with anyone.</p>
              <p>"To all we have said that there must first be talks with the new
              president of Russian FA and to know his position on the future."</p>
              <p>Van Nieuwenhuizen was keen to stress that no option was being
              discounted and he rejected any suggestion that Hiddink is too old to
              return to club management.</p>
              <p>"It all depends on how a club is organised," said the agent. "For example, if the model is like <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> and Alex Ferguson, then Guus would be interested.</p>
              <p>"After all, Sir Alex is not so much a coach at his club than a
              manager or technical director, identifying the club's transfer policy
              and organising the entire workforce.</p>
              <p>"Ferguson does not even attend first-team training every day. This is a well-known fact!</p>
              <p>"But Sir Alex is older than Guus. So I can easily imagine Hiddink leading a serious European club under such a model.</p>
              <p>"But for now I see no point in speculating about it, because
              Guus's contract with the Russian FA is until the summer and perhaps it
              will be extended."</p>

              <p>his track record speaks for itself. he will succeed anywhere he goes. if liverpool got him, he should be the man to guide liverpool to its first title since 1990. I am sure he can do it within 3-4 seasons time.</p>

              <p>I am not too sure if he can be a success at Pool cos, the premiership is changing... Pool and United are no longer the clubs who can afford the best or pay the best. City will emerge as the strongest club where players would go once they get the CL spot. Chelsea will continue to remain strong alongside them for the time being. Pool and United will have to feed off those players they don't want and Arsenal if they cannot product anymore Fabregas, will have to be contented with more Nasri type of players more often than not...</p>
              <p>So Hiddink going to Pool may not necessary be a success story either.</p>

              <h2>HIDDINK AGENT DENIES REDS RUMOURS</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/01/240/Guus-Hiddink-Russia_2407034.jpg" border="0" alt="Hiddink - no Anfield talks."></div>
              <p><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Guus Hiddink's agent has denied an approach for his client from Liverpool - but believes Hiddink could be interested in taking over at Anfield in the summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Reports have suggested Cees van Nieuwenhuizen had held talks with the Anfield club, something the agent strongly denies.</p>
              <p>"That's absolutely not right," he told BBC Radio Five Live. "Each day I'm surprised when I read comments in the newspapers in Russia, or in Italy with Juventus, or in England with Manchester City before and now Liverpool."</p>
              <p>The former Chelsea boss is under contract with Russia until this summer, but Van Nieuwenhuizen admitted a move to Liverpool could interest his client when that deal is through.</p>
              <p>"It would be fair to say because it's one of the big names in global football," he said. "But if Liverpool have a problem today or tomorrow then Guus is not available.</p>
              <p>"Guus is not available for any club until August 1." Hiddink, who took over temporarily at Stamford Bridge last season following the departure of Luiz Felipe Scolari, remains close friends with Blues owner Roman Abramovich, a factor which could complicate a move to a rival club.</p>
              <p>Van Nieuwenhuizen said: "As Guus said after he left Chelsea, he enjoyed every second of being in the Premier League with Chelsea. "He still has a very strong relationship with Mr Abramovich from Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"If he would consider a return to the Premier League I think one of the first things he would do is give a call to his friend Abramovich and say, 'I hope you don't mind if I join club A, B, C or whatever'.</p>
              <p>"In a way it's a funny situation but on the other hand Guus is also very close with some of the people on the technical staff at Chelsea like Ancelotti, who he knows very, very well, and also Frank Arnesen, with whom he worked for a couple of years at PSV Eindhoven.</p>
              <p>"So Guus doesn't want to interfere with the current success story that Chelsea has picked up again under Ancelotti."</p>
