              <h1>Everton 0-2 Liverpool: Blues mugged after Yobo nightmare</h1>
              <h2>Two goals from mistakes gift Reds derby win...</h2>
              </div>
              <div id="article_detail_block"></div>
              <div id="small_article_image_container"><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/62196_news.jpg" alt="EPL: Javier Mascherano, Everton - Liverpool (Getty Images)"></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>Two Joseph Yobo mistakes gave Liverpool the bragging rights from a Merseyside derby they barely deserved to win.</p>
              <p>A first half deflected goal, followed by a late second,
              both due to Yobo's luckless defending, meant Everton remain near the
              bottom of the table despite dominating the Goodison Park showdown.</p>
              <p>The Blues also had the ball in the net twice, only to
              be ruled offside both times, and Rafael Benitez's side breathed a huge
              sigh of relief on a day when they struggled to find any rhythm, and
              were pressed back for long periods of the game.</p>
              <p>A wonder save from Pepe Reina when the score still at 1-0 was also to prove a pivotal moment.</p>
              <p>Liverpool lined up without Fernando Torres, while
              Alberto Aquilani, Albert Riera and Yossi Benayoun were all kept on the
              bench. Everton, meanwhile, began in a  4-2-3-1 with Marouane Fellanini,
              Diniyar Bilyaletidinov and Tim Cahill supporting Jo.</p>
              <p>A typically brash start to the derby almost saw Cahill
              booked within the opening minutes after stamping on Javier Macherano's
              left foot, but referee Alan Wiley resisted the chance to show an early
              card.</p>
              <p>The start continued to be scrappy but Everton looked to be edging it, until out of nowhere Liverpool nicked the lead.</p>
              <p>Mascherano took aim from 30 yards, but his shot looked
              to be flying a good yard wide until Yobo stuck out a boot and deflected
              the ball past his own goalkeeper.</p>
              <p>Everton briefly were reeling, with Steven Gerrard testing Tim Howard in the 16th minute, but they then took control of the half.</p>
              <p>Bilyaletinidov should have made it 1-1 in the 18th
              minute. Both teams appeared to unite in juggling the ball in the air,
              with Felliani and then Jo flicking it on before Mascherano got in on
              the act. It finally fell eight yards from goal but was somehow screwed
              wide.</p>
              <p>Everton continued to take the game to the visitors, and
              from a throw-in Pepe Reina was fumbling and struggling to get control
              of the ball before Glen Johnson thumped the ball clear.</p>
              <p>In the 24th minute Steven Pienaar put a poor effort
              wide, before Fellanini caused problems minutes later by heading into
              the danger area as Liverpool continued to be forced back, but Reina was
              yet to be seriously tested.</p>
              <p>Jo then had the ball in the net on 34 minutes but was
              ruled offside, which proceeded a Dirk Kuyt 30 yard effort which failed
              to replicate Mascherano's earlier attempt and flew over the bar.</p>
              <p>Liverpool had contributed little to the half, save for
              the goal, but three minutes from half-time and only a wonderful save
              from Tim Howard denied them a second.</p>
              <p>Johnson sent the ball in from the right and found
              Emiliano Insua at the back post, but Howard superbly denied him,
              fisting it away.</p>
              <p>Everton again had the ball in the net but once more Jo
              was the victim of the linesman's wrath. The half-time whistle brought a
              standing ovation and defiant singing from a home support buoyed by the
              first 45 minutes.</p>
              <p>Benitez seemed content to sit on the 1-0 lead as
              Everton again were the aggressor. Ten minutes in and referee Wiley may
              well have pointed to the spot when Fellani was held by Jamie Carragher.</p>
              <p>Pienaar fired a stinging effort straight at Reina in
              the 59th minute, and the Liverpool keeper fumbled it, the second time
              in the game he had looked surprisingly uneasy, however he then pulled
              off an incredible double save in the 72nd minute to keep Liverpool's
              advantage.</p>
              <p>First he blocked Cahill's header, but the ball fell
              into the path of Fellaini who looked certain to score, until Reina
              unbelievably managed to get up again to deny David Moyes' side.</p>
              <p>It appeared to suck the life out of Everton, who were
              failing to trouble the visitors less and less, and when Kuyt, who had
              done little for 80 minutes, made it 2-0 the game was all but over.</p>
              <p>Yobo swung at fresh air, missing the ball, which fell
              to Riera who had been on for just two minutes. His shot was saved, but
              Kuyt was there to fire in the rebound.</p>
              <p>It was harsh luck on the home side, and as Reina
              flapped at another long ball, fans must have been scratching their head
              at how they had failed to put a telling ball past him.</p>
              <p>Yobo's agony was ended when he was taken off with three
              minutes to go, before the two Liverpool substitutes Benayoun and Riera
              combined to almost grab a third, with Howard forced to block with his
              legs.</p>
              <p>The away support chanted “going down, going down” at the end as Everton were left to lick their wounds.</p>

              <p>Benitez was stunned by an "amazing" double-save from Reina 20 minutes
              from time when, with his side under pressure, the Spain international
              dived low to his left to keep out Tim Cahill's header and then stood up
              to block Marouane Fellaini's rebound.</p>
              <p>"It was a great save from Pepe Reina, which was crucial also. He showed he is a top-class keeper," said Benitez.</p>
              <p>"To defend a lot of throw-ins, corners and free-kicks during 90 minutes against a team which is good in the air as <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Everton</span></abbr> is not easy but he helped the team and in this situation he was amazing."</p>

              <p>everton lucky got bad strikers. liverpool is going down. This manager too kia si. two holding midfielders is not top club standard, even if we dont have torres. Anyway, everton is not that good so to play defensive is short term mentality.</p>
              <p>Sack rafa before its too late. or isit?</p>
