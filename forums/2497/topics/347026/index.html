              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea team news<br></strong>Chelsea are without goalkeeper Petr Cech for tomorrow's Barclays Premier League clash with Hull.</p>
              <p>He sustained a back injury during last weekend's 2-0 defeat by Liverpool and will be replaced by Hilario. Defender Ricardo Carvalho is, meanwhile, doubtful with a hamstring strain and unlikely to play.</p>
              <p>Michael Essien and Joe Cole (both knee) are still sidelined for the Blues, but new loan signing from Inter Milan Ricardo Quaresma is in line for his Chelsea debut.</p>
              <p><strong>Squad</strong>: Hilario, Taylor, Ferreira, Bosingwa, A Cole, Terry, Alex, Ivanovic, Mancienne, Lampard, Ballack, Obi, Deco, Kalou, Drogba, Anelka, Stoch, Quaresma, Belletti, Malouda.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Hull team news</strong><br>Hull are without striker Daniel Cousin for tomorrow's Barclays Premier League trip to Chelsea and record signing Jimmy Bullard is doubtful.</p>
              <p>Cousin will be out for at least 10 days following minor knee surgery while midfielder Bullard is awaiting the verdict on scan results after jarring his knee on debut at West Ham last month.</p>

              <p>Scolari really make Chelsea CMI. Worst coach in recent times. The entire Chelsea right flank always make mistakes - Bosingwa and Alex and Mikel. All lousy. Hull always break through and almost score because these players all sleeping.</p>
              <p>Anyway Chelsea players also in decadence. No Chelsea player is a convincing striker. Anelka is score all the jiao goals - it shows now when he cant score a decent goal. Lampard and Deco is too inconsistent. Terry and Alex the header specialists all become weak. Drogba dont need to say. Ballack is really useless can never shoot on target nowadays. Ashley Cole like to shoot but never on target also.</p>
              <p>Frankly Chelsea all the players are playing worse than previous seasons except Kalou. Hahaha</p>

              <p>Yeah I was also wondering why take him out so early? Yeah I know he is new but he seems to be doing rather well and he looks fit too... The commentary said he looked the most dangerous of the 3 (Anelka &amp; Kalou)... and yet he got taken out... Another strange call by Big Phil...</p>

              <p>I think Zola is doing a great job at West Ham, Chelsea should seriously look at what he is doing over there... Little fund to work with, had to sell Bell, and yet he is able to motivate and keep the sprite of his players up and fighting...</p>
              <p>Chelsea should consider a younger manager... Scolari is too old for the premiership liao... He like to relax too much already... Maybe something he pick up as a national coach/manager...</p>

              <h2>WILKINS HITS OUT AT CHELSEA BOO-BOYS</h2>

              <div><em>Scolari, left Wilkins to handle the interview with Sky's reporter</em></div>
              <div>

              </div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Assistant coach Ray Wilkins has labelled a minority of Chelsea fans "out of order" after they hurled abuse at boss Luiz Felipe Scolari. Chelsea have now dropped 16 points at home this season and they slipped to fourth place in the Premier League after their goalless draw against hard-working Hull.</strong></p>
              <p>But Scolari was the target for the Chelsea boo-boys when he replaced on-loan Ricardo Quaresma with Didier Drogba in the second half. A section of the home support chanted 'You don't know what you're doing' at the Brazilian coach and then booed the team off at the final whistle.</p>
              <p>But Wilkins declared: "I think it is a minority that would be chanting it. That would kick it off and then people would get on the back of that. "That is their prerogative because they pay their money. People do pay a lot of money to watch football and if they want to boo then by all means come and boo. "But to say someone does not know what he is doing when he has achieved what he has in the game, is a tad out of order.</p>
              <p>"It is never very pleasant whatever ground you are at. He clearly does know what he is doing. He has been in the game a hell of a long time and won a lot of trophies as well. So, from that aspect it is quite disappointing.</p>
              <p>"The substitutions are always to try and improve things on the pitch, so that is why we did it." The only saving grace for Scolari, according to Wilkins, is that he probably would not have understood what the Chelsea fans were chanting.</p>
              <p>And the former England midfielder insists he has no plans to inform the Brazilian. "When crowds are chanting I don't think managers from foreign countries understand what is being said," added Wilkins. "He would not have understood that. I certainly won't tell him because it is unnecessary. I don't think it should be heard around our stadium."</p>
              <p>Chelsea's poor home form is almost certain to cost them the title this season but Wilkins is adamant they will not give up the fight until it is mathematically beyond them. "Every game is vitally important for us now," admitted Wilkins. "Hopefully we will turn the corner. You cannot give up on the title when you see the talent that we've got within the club.</p>
              <p>"We will keep plugging away until it is mathematically impossible to catch anybody. "It is going to be difficult to catch Manchester United but we will try. They have a game in hand on us and are still a good few points in front, so it is going to be tough for everybody to catch them. But we are going to give it a damn good go.</p>
              <p>"Second at any time is not good enough for Chelsea. We strive to be number one but second is never good enough for a club as big as ours. "There seems to be a little bit of anxiety among the lads when the goal doesn't come early on. We had a chance early on with John Terry but unfortunately he didn't put it in.</p>
              <p>"Had that gone in, I'm sure it would have settled the boys down and we may have gone on and won quite comfortably. "There is no real emergency. We are naturally disappointed we have not picked up three points. We've huffed and puffed and created a lot of chances but not been able to put the ball into the back of the net."</p>
              <p>Hull are without a win in nine league games but boss <strong>Phil Brown</strong> was proud of his team's work ethic and insisted they might even have won the game with better finishing. "We could have nicked it," said Brown. "It was a game plan designed on hard work and riding our luck in front of both goals. "We did that in the first minute when John Terry put one over the bar from a yard. Slowly but surely in the second-half the tide turned.</p>
              <p>"We played decent counter-attacking football and the best chances fell to us. "But I am delighted with the clean sheet and the work ethic was astounding and phenomenal. I am proud as a manager to say we've come here and tried to take them on. "Every individual deserves credit. We could have gone on and won it but I am pleased with the point."</p>
