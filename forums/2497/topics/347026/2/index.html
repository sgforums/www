              <p><br>Steve Clark left to join Zola cos Scolari doesn't trust his judgement... Scolari have his own Brazilian assistant... And although Ray Wilkins was brought in to give the impression he is No.2, he is clearly not involve much in the football and tactical side of things... If we watch where they sit on the bench, there is another fat Brazilian guy sitting next to Scolari and they discuss what to do during a game... Wilkins is just there so show that there is an English presence in the management team after Clark left... And give Scolari a chance to avoid the Press and Media...</p>

              <p>Cudicini could probably be he wanted to leave and play whatever last few yrs he have in the top level... He has given a lot of his time to Chelsea and wasn't getting any match either... Spurs are a big London club too and he won't have to move everything he has now, his family, his home, his children schools... Everything. Just go to a different stadium for work only. Very convenient deal for him... Anyway he is doing well at Spurs now... And I think if Cech is there he won't get to play much.</p>
              <p>Wayne Bridge also could be he wanted to go himself having been offered better salary at City and a first team place... After spending so many season's playing second fiddle to A Cole, I think he had enough... And I think he could now be the highest or one of the highest paid left-back in the world also... Perviously he was reported to be on $70k per week... That is already a lot for a sub left back... Even Evra don't make that much... He is reported to be on $35 to $40 only and looking for an improve contract at $50-$60 per week. Chelsea couldn't offer him either one so...</p>
              <p>Kenyon is only doing what Roman ask him to... And that could be balancing the books from now on as he don't want to waste too much now... He wants Chelsea to be self-reliance...</p>

              <p>Kenyon is only doing what Roman ask him to... And that could be
              balancing the books from now on as he don't want to waste too much
              now... He wants Chelsea to be self-reliance...</p>

              <p><br>Cudicini at his age, 35, has signed a 1 year rolling contract with Chelsea.. His current one will not end until Jun 2009 so I guess out of goodwill for his long service, they let him go since Spurs were offering him the security of a contract of at least 18 months an attractive deal to a 35 yrs old... They also probably had no used for him anymore... Maybe they don't even plan to re-new his deal come Jun 2009.</p>
              <p>The second one was really up to Scolari lah... He could have maybe done better than Malouda but while he was there, he was always given the miss... but at least now they have Quaresma lor...</p>

              <p>Now Chelsea attack and defence are like the weakest in years.</p>
              <p>Also Chelsea midfield never could play a defensive role properly, like Ballack, Lampard, Deco and forgot who else</p>
              <p>Malouda is also inconsistent. Sometimes can be doing well then make one mistake and his mark will score goal</p>
