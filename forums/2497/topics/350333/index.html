              <p><strong>Inter president reflects on the key incident of the match at Meazza. "It was a penalty on Balotelli and it's unbelievable how certain Roma are that it wasn't.

              <p><strong>The penalty called in favour of Balotelli has been a controversial topic. Sunday evening, at the end of the Inter-Roma match </strong><a class="a" href="http://sgforums.com/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Inter/Primo_Piano/2009/03/01/Inter_Roma0103.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>that ended 3-3</strong></span></span></a><strong>, </strong><a class="a" href="http://sgforums.com/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Inter/Primo_Piano/2009/03/01/spogliainterroma.shtml"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Luciano Spalletti and José Mourinho</strong></span></span></a><strong> already argued at a distance. Today, Inter president Massimo Moratti expressed his opinion on the matter, which doesn't help to bring both sides together: "For us, it was a penalty, a fair penalty because Balotelli was fouled," said Moratti. Then he added: "I find it truly unvelievable how confident they were when stating the opposite. There is no point in arguing about it; that's how it ends, each side with a different opinion."</strong></p>

              <div class="p"><span style="font-weight: bold;">TOO MUCH RESENTMENT</span>- "There always has to be controversy; that's also part of football but perhaps I don't approach it with as much resentment as the other side does. I believed in the possibility of drawing," added Moratti. "We had a poor start but we had a great second half where we really showed what we are made of. It's important to pay more attention and to be more focused so that we are not so controlled by the opponents."</div>
              <div class="p">

              <div class="p"><span style="font-weight: bold;">THAT'S MARIO</span> - Moratti also commented on Balotelli's gesture, who turned around towards Roma fans shortly after scoring from the spot. "About Mario's gesture... That's how he is," said the Nerazzurro president who chose not to reproach Mario for his behaviour: "He's already been scolded by quite a few television stations, Roma and Sky, so I think that may be enough."</div>

              <p><strong>"This has been the result of a large manipulative work, a strong push to manipulate the public opinion; a brilliant job of a world that is not mine.

We have only won a match by a refereeing mistake in Siena," recalls the Portuguese. Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri, has said to be on the side of Roma manager Luciano Spalletti.

"I have gone in front of the camera to tell everyone that my team did win in Siena because of a refereeing mistake. The next day, the manager of a black and white jersey's team, who follows Inter matches, has gone in front of the camera admitting to have scored an offside goal....how nice...." "The day of the scandal is approaching." "91 more days and then I am going on vacation" he adds. For 91 days I am capable of conducting a medieval press conference. I speak with the press because I have to. Spalletti speaks before the match, during half-time and after the match. He is a 'primetime' kind of man, everyone's friend, But I am not like that."</div>

I am not one to manipulate the public opinion and I am definitely not a primetime champion," he told the journalists. "If I were in Torino's and Udinese's shoes, I would let the junior lads play. If I think of next weekend, it is better not to play...," he repeats. Then the mystery of Ranieri's phone call: "He has tried to call me this morning. You have my permission to ask him what he wanted to tell me" he told the journalists. And after seven minutes of bold comments he left the press conference reminding everyone that tomorrow evening there will be an Italian Cup's semifinal match "against a difficult team that wants to reach the semi-finals just as much as we do."</div>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Jose Mourinho's ability to raise a press conference from the banal to the incendiary won him as many friends and admirers as it did enemies and critics during his time in England.</strong></p>
              <p>And barely six months in to his career in Italy, the Portuguese's outspoken commentary on the state of the local game has raised the shackles of peers, media and officials alike. Though the forces stood in opposition to him currently outnumber his supporters by some distance.</p>
              <p>A running feud with Juventus and fellow former Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri and an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF7bTccabtQ&amp;eurl=http://www.101greatgoals.com/videodisplay/1749693/"><span style="color: #1342a0;">on screen argument with respected Sky Italia presenter Mario Sconcerti</span></a> (above), following criticism for his finger to the lips celebration after Inter ground out a win over Udinese, announced his arrival in Serie A.</p>
              <p>But the frosty relations with both the fourth estate and his immediate rivals plumed to new depths in the wake of Inter Milan's controversial 3-3 draw with Roma at the weekend.</p>
              <p>Mourinho will face disciplinary action after he railed against criticism of his young striker Mario Balotelli, who went to ground under a weak challenge from Marco Motta to earn Inter a penalty - that Balottelli converted himself - when the scores were 3-1 to Roma and Inter's procession to a fourth straight Scudetto starting to look less comfortable that it had for some time.</p>
              <p>In the wake of a fractious and ill-tempered game, Roma coach Luciano Spaletti has already been banned for one match for addressing the fourth official in a "provocative and insulting manner", while Roma were fined 8,000 euros after their fans racially abused Balotelli, who is of Ghanaian origin.</p>
              <p>And Roma Midfielder Daniele De Rossi, too, is to be investigated after he said "if referees are allowed to make mistakes, I don't understand why they should always be made in the same direction".</p>
              <p>The media, too, we quick to point to Inter's good fortune and in a league still reeling from the damaging calciopoli match-fixing scandal of 2006 the inference was that Mourinho's side were perhaps benefiting from an uneven playing field.</p>
              <p>Mourinho, as you might expect, was not willing to let this slight pass, and reacted angrily with a remarkable tirade in which his scattergun approach saw verbal bullets firing in the direction of all his major rivals for the title.</p>
              <p>"I don't like intellectual prostitution, I like intellectual honesty," Mourinho said. "I think that in the last days there has been a great intellectual manipulation, a great work to change and manipulate public opinion.</p>
              <p>"No one talked about Juve, who won many points through referee mistakes."</p>
              <p>After attacking Roma and Juventus Mourinho also had a dig at Milan and his rant has been the hot topic of Italian football ever since. Juventus, particularly sensitive to accusations of favouritism these days, went as far as to post a message of displeasure on their website.</p>
              <p>"Juventus express their astonishment and disgust, asking Inter to publicly denounce these comments," it read. "With his statements, the Inter coach has not only shown a lack of respect for Juventus and their 14 million fans but to all of Italian football."</p>
              <p>Mourinho, unsurprisingly, has so far remained unrepentant.</p>
              <p>The former Chelsea manager has not enjoyed the same relationship with the Italian media as he did with their English counterparts. In England the young, dynamic coach was viewed as a breath of fresh air, a man unafraid to speak his mind and to hell with the consequences - in Italy he is simply viewed as arrogant.</p>
              <p>But love him or loath him, there is never a dull moment with Mourinho, as the Italians are quickly learning.</p>
              <p>Fabrizio Bocca, writing on daily la Repubblica, was not a lone voice in calling for calm. "Someone must end this bullfight," he wrote, "or for the next meeting of Juventus and Inter we may just as well start slapping each other, having run out of words."</p>
              <p>A laudable sentiment, but the chances of Mourinho running out of words any time soon remain as distant as they ever have.</p>

              <p><strong>AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini has responded angrily to Inter Milan boss Jose Mourinho's claims that the Rossoneri win will nothing this season.</strong></p>
              <p>The veteran defender is eager to remind the Inter coach that he is yet to win a single Scudetto, when Maldini already has five.</p>
              <p>The comment came as a response to a swipe from the Portuguese, who has made enemies of many Serie A managers including Luciano Spalletti of Roma, Claudio Ranieri of Juventus and Milan's Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't matter that Milan have so many players with a winning mentality, this season they will finish with no trophies," Mourinho said after the Coppa Italia clash with Sampdoria.</p>
              <p>"And Juventus only find themselves in such a good position due to refereeing errors."</p>
              <p>Maldini rarely shies away from the media spotlight and replied: "I don't want to trade insults with Mourinho, but he really can't make these claims until he wins something for Inter himself.</p>
              <p>"As far as I know, he is discussing something which he has a chance of winning, but which I have already won five times."</p>
              <p>Yet Maldini's final season for the Rossoneri before retiring does look set to end without any silverware.</p>
              <p>The 40-year-old defender's team were eliminated from the UEFA Cup by Werder Bremen and the club are 12 points behind Mourinho's men in the Serie A table.</p>
