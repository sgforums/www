              <p>this is only the end of april. </p>
              <p>Players to deserve the award?</p>
              <p>We have at least the defensive trio of van der sar, vidic and
                  rio in manchester united.</p>
              <p>reason for winning? </p>
              <p>the crazy amount of clean sheets they kept.</p>
              <p>this is only for manchester united. i have not even started on
                  other teams yet.</p>
              <p>what has giggs done this season to win?</p>
              <p>he didn't even play much for goodness sake. he won it due to
                  past glories, not present form. </p>

              <p>I hope that by trying to prove our point that other players are more worthy, we do not belittle Giggs contribution to the United cause just this season alone... Some may fail to realised Giggs's contribution but here is a 35 yrs old guy playing his heart out in every match... Some others might have already retired by this age but he is still doing the business at the highest level... This alone I guess could get him the respect from fellow professional...</p>
              <p>But i don't believed its just because of this, fellow professionals have their own eyes to see how he has contributed to United's season this year. Giggs has many a time this season deliver the pass or the final pass for the match winner. Just like the all important goal Macheda scored against Villa...</p>
              <p>Starting 27 times for United this season and another 16 as a sub is a lot to ask from a 35 yrs old... Thats 40 over matches for United this season alone and its still not over... We have to remember he is playing in the premiership and not Serie A. He may have started 12 in the Premiership, but he also got the highest sub appearance too in 12 (Even more than Tevez)... Thats shows the importance of the man to the squad. Here is a model player I guess, despite playing so many matches, he have not got booked for a yellow let alone a red card in 40 over matches this season...</p>
              <p>On the voting system, i personally don't find anything wrong with it... Of course some will find it to be flaw but do we want a Player of the Year when the season is over and disinterested by then? The voting i guess was conducted in Feb, Mar... Votes has to be counted and arrangements have to be made for the event and organizers to be inform... But by Feb/Mar, the season is already into its 6 or 7th months out of 9 already... Will another 2 months make a big difference? I guess I can accept it cos I prefer to see a Player of the year announced before the season is over rather than when people are no longer interested on it anymore... It would be very disappointing for something so significant to be an anticlimax to a season don't you think so...</p>

              <p>Is Giggs given all the votings slips so he post himself as the

              <p>but end of season hard to get everyone and given it is 34 games, it is pretty much end of season unless, someone can hamdam in 100 goals in last 4 games and then I have nothing to say lor.</p>

              <p>Speaking exclusively in an interview for BBC Choice's 45 Minutes
