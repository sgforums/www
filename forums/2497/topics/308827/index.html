              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Former Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier says English footballers are pushed into top management jobs too quickly.</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He believes Bryan Robson, Stuart Pearce and Gareth Southgate all took on senior positions far too quickly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"In France, you cannot become a manager when you step out of your career as a player," Houllier told Inside Sport. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"Would a manager of a big company put somebody without
              experience into a key position in his company? No, he would not, but
              they do in football."
               </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The 60-year-old Frenchman said being a player and being a manager were two very different roles. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"As a player, you think of yourself and your career," he
              said. "The manager has the vision of the club (to deal with) and has
              got to think of a strategy." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Houllier said any prospective managers of a big club should gain the necessary skills before assuming such a responsibility. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"You need to develop them and prepare them," he said. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"I have never felt that England had this culture of developing coaches, but it is such a big country of football. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">"Whether it is Bryan, Stuart or Gareth, I'm sure that
              they would have liked to go up the different steps and to have two or
              three years as an assistant manager." </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Houllier began his managerial career in his mid-20s as player-boss of French side Le Touquet. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He later moved to Arras as youth coach and then became
              head coach at Noeux-les-Mines before accepting his first major
              managerial position with Lens, guiding them to promotion and a place in
              the Uefa Cup. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He went on to enjoy success at Paris St-Germain and was
              in charge of the French national team when it failed to qualify for the
              1994 World Cup finals in the United States. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He bounced back by steering Liverpool to six trophies -
              League Cup (2), FA Cup, Uefa Cup, Uefa Super Cup and Charity Shield -
              during his five-year reign at Anfield. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He left the Reds in 2004, winning two league
              championships with Lyon before becoming technical director at the
              French football federation's prized academy at Clairefontaine. </span></p>
