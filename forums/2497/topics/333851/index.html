              <h1>Hughes Not Chasing Fantasy Targets</h1>
              <h2>Despite the billions of pounds likely to be lavished on his club, Manchester City manager Mark Hughes insists that he will sign only experienced personnel in the January transfer window, and not multi-million fantasy targets...</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/34384_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="254"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Since Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG) took control at Eastlands on September 1, City have been linked with the great and good of global football. Robinho was snared for a British record fee, while Mario Gomez, David Villa, Gianluigi Buffon, Kaka, Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres have all been linked with a move to the newly-monied outfit.</strong> <br><br>However, the club's manager is eager to rein-in expectations for the January sales by insisting that City will sign those targets that were already in place before the takeover, and not superstars like the ones to which they have been linked. <br><br>He argued that the club should have a purpose that stretches further than signing the best players in the world as he made the point that more experience is needed in his side. <br><br>He told the Manchester Evening News: "All the stories linking us with spending vast fortunes on the world's best players are predictable and we try to nip them in the bud. But they keep on persisting and it is something we have to deal with.<br><br>"We accept them because there is a lot of interest in the club and people want to know and see who we will pursue and get through the door.<br><br>"I keep telling everyone that we are trying to be realistic in the targets we think we can get. There is no point chasing players we have no chance of getting. Our acquisitions will be players we have looked at and that we have researched and focused our attentions on.<br><br>"We will not be flying off left, right and centre trying to sign people. It will be done with thought and with purpose.<br><br>"Every football manager is in the market for good players should they become available and should that be the case then City will be in the forefront, but the trick is knowing when those players become available and being able to clinch the deal."<br><br>He went on: "An older element would certainly help the team and its development. We are good to watch, but we frustrate the fans sometimes because we still do have frailties and I understand that.<br><br>"Come January we will try to address those frailties, but along the way we will still produce good football."</p>
