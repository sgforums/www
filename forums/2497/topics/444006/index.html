              <p><span><strong>Chelsea's super-sensitive manager Andre Villas-Boas has had lead pundit Tommy Langley removed from his own club’s TV channel for criticising the Portuguese’s hardline treatment of disenchanted players. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Former club favourite Langley was told he was no longer required at Chelsea TV after he described AVB as ‘vindictive’ for allegedly not allowing Nicolas Anelka and Alex to park their vehicles in the first-team car park after they had been banished from the squad for handing in transfer requests.</span></p>
              <p><span>Langley, who was the club’s player of the year in 1979, has been an admired analyst on Chelsea TV for a decade and does co-commentary as well as co-hosting discussions before and after matches. Friends of Langley say he is extremely upset but does not want to say anything that would jeopardise a return to his TV role if AVB has a change of mind.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Chelsea boss has proved to be remarkably thin-skinned when it comes to negative media comment, and notably labelled Gary Neville’s  description of David Luiz playing like he was controlled by a 10-year-old on PlayStation as ‘ridiculous’.</span></p>
              <p><span>Villas-Boas believes Neville and other pundits such as Alan Hansen have a ‘likely biased position in their opinion-making because of a direct past related to a single club, which is their favourite’. <br></span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen2465" class="moduleHalf">   </div>
              <p><span>Yet his dumping of committed Chelsea supporter Langley points to him not accepting strong adverse comments on the home front, either.</span></p>
              <p><span>A Chelsea spokesman said: ‘For a number of reasons we are reviewing the structure and output of Chelsea TV. </span></p>
              <p><span>'We are waiting for these reviews to be completed before we make a final decision regarding staffing and content.’</span></p>
