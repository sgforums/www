              <p>Man U's title chance hinges on chelsea's adaptability when their african players leave for the ACN in january... Arsenal, as usual, leaky at the back... but has the potential to outscore their opponents and there still untapped talents, be it in the form of players returning from injuries (rosicky, nasri) or fringe players...</p>

              <p>hi, I disagrees with TS.  If U compare the stats with last season, MU did better this season.</p>
              <p>Yes, MU may have lost to Pool and Chelsea. But in the last game, I felt MU played well.  Since when did U see Frank Lampard or Deco so silent? Even Chelsea's top two strikers did not do much against MU's central pairing of Brown/Evans, who did not really have much gameplay under their belt this season. I give them credit.  MU just lacked the luck, but not quality or fire. Importantly, swinging against them is SAF's comment on Wiley. It seems, MU just not having any luck with MIB. Not sure about the impact but against Pool/Chelsea, if the luck was blowing their sail, things <strong>may</strong> have been different.  (kudos to Pool/Chelsea for winning, btw).</p>
              <p>MU lost two top players, and surely, they will have to adapt and adjust. and I felt they are coping considerably. Injuries to Rio/EDS/Vidic/Park/Heagraves robs the team of some stability, but once they recovered, I believe MU will be more compact and generally, they do perform better in latter stages of the season.</p>
              <p>Just my two cents.</p>

              <p>Before the match, I had Chelsea winning this easily... the match as well as the title. But after the match, I am more reluctant to belief Chelsea will have it easy to the title...</p>
              <p>Reason is Chelsea may have won this match... But they didn't do it convincingly to me... What I felt instead was, United actually came out better, had the better chances and controlled lots part of the match and the important moments... Terry brought down Valencia was a penalty but not given... Rooney was not offside when replay clearly showed A Cole played him on and he was in on a one on one with Cech but the assistant ref made a wrong call... The goal itself was a foul that shouldn't have been... Their goal also had a foul element to it... First Brown was pull down and out of the way, and Drogba was in an offside position...</p>
              <p>All said, United may have lost this match but there are certain things that gave out lots of positive for them... And another thing is, I felt Lampard, Ballack, Deco as well as Drogba are on the wane... They are no longer the powers they were 2, 3 yrs ago and I feel as the season gets longer, it will tell on them. Already Lampard and Ballack is so obvious and unlike Scholes and Giggs, these 2 are main players in the starting 11.</p>
              <p>Another area we may also take into account is... Carlo Ancelotti manage Milan for 8 yrs and only won 1 Serie A title... And that title was won quite easily without the pressure of a title fight as the second highest team was like more than 10 points behind... And when he concentrate on the Champions League, he always have to rest his first team squad... He have never won the League title and the CL together in the same season... And I am still not sure if he can handle the pressure of both together in a real title fight come March, April &amp; May...</p>
              <p>Therefore, I don't think its that bad still for the others to catch up with the Blues... Sometimes, leading the table early isn't a good thing as more pressure builds up by the weeks. I belief Chelsea despite now leading by 5 points, won't lead the table all the way till May... Arsenal, United, and even City and Spurs are still in with a good chance... And who knows, perhaps even Pool.</p>

              <p>All said, United may have lost this match but there are certain things that gave out lots of positive for them... And another thing is, I felt Lampard, Ballack, Deco as well as Drogba are on the wane... They are no longer the powers they were 2, 3 yrs ago and I feel as the season gets longer, it will tell on them. Already Lampard and Ballack is so obvious and unlike Scholes and Giggs, these 2 are main players in the starting 11.</p>
              <p>Another area we may also take into account is... Carlo Ancelotti manage Milan for 8 yrs and only won 1 Serie A title... And that title was won quite easily without the pressure of a title fight as the second highest team was like more than 10 points behind... And when he concentrate on the Champions League, he always have to rest his first team squad... He have never won the League title and the CL together in the same season... And I am still not sure if he can handle the pressure of both together in a real title fight come March, April &amp; May...</p>
              <p>Therefore, I don't think its that bad still for the others to catch up with the Blues... Sometimes, leading the table early isn't a good thing as more pressure builds up by the weeks. I belief Chelsea despite now leading by 5 points, won't lead the table all the way till May... Arsenal, United, and even City and Spurs are still in with a good chance... And who knows, perhaps even Pool.</p>
