              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PETER KENYON will leave his role as Chelsea chief executive next month.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Blues supremo arrived at Stamford Bridge from rivals Manchester United in 2004. He will end his reign on October 31 but will stay on as a non-executive director.</p>
              <p class="article">Kenyon said: "I am extremely proud of my time at Chelsea and of the friendships I have forged with everyone here. "I have been in football for 15 years and I can say with great certainty and pleasure the experience at Chelsea is one of the best I have had.</p>
              <p class="article">"When I joined Chelsea it was an incredible challenge and together with all the staff, the players, the board and Roman, I think we have really built a club, in a relatively short space of time, that can be in the forefront of European football for many years to come. That is a major achievement.</p>
              <p class="article">"I am also delighted that our relationship is not ending and I can continue to make a contribution to keeping Chelsea in that position and to go back to visit friends.</p>
              <p class="article">"I intend to take a little time off before considering what I do next but I am certain I have at least one major challenge left in me.</p>
              <p class="article">"I would like to wish Chelsea the best of luck for the rest of the season. I am sure Carlo can lead the team to more great things."</p>

              </p><p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/09/16/article-1213896-000008FB00000CB2-521_468x350.jpg" alt="helsea's owner Roman Abramovich (L) of Russia looks worried as he talks with Chelsea Chief Executive Peter Kenyon " width="468" height="350"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>All change: Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich (left) will have to find a chief executive to replace Peter Kenyon</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>have announced that chief executive Peter Kenyon is to leave his full-time role at the club.</strong></p>
              <p>The former <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a> head honcho will depart at the end of October after becoming an increasingly peripheral figure at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>He will continue as a non-executive director, representing Chelsea in various minor capacities, including committee roles with UEFA.</p>
              <p>But the end of his day-to-day duties comes after an erosion of his duties dating back to the sacking of Luiz Felipe Scolari in February.</p>
              <p>Kenyon played the key role in bringing the Brazilian to the Barclays Premier League on a huge contract prior to the start of last season.</p>
              <p>But when it was time to bring Scolari's disastrous reign to an end, owner Roman Abramovich flew into London to personally sack the former Portugal boss while Kenyon was on holiday in Barbados.</p>
              <p>Abramovich subsequently instigated the appointment of Guus Hiddink as Scolari's successor and Kenyon's part in luring Carlo Ancelotti this summer is also said to have been minor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/09/16/article-1213896-06473DC6000005DC-423_233x282.jpg" alt="Frank Arnesen" width="233" height="282"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>More power: Frank Arnesen</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Sports Agenda revealed in April that Kenyon was becoming disillusioned and his responsibilities were reduced further this summer when Frank Arnesen was promoted from his role as director of youth development and put in charge of player recruitment as the new sporting director.</strong></p>
              <p>Kenyon had to go on 'gardening leave' between leaving United and officially taking up his Chelsea role in early 2004.</p>
              <p>Under Abramovich, Kenyon took charge of the business side of the club, with Chelsea having a long-term project of becoming one of the world's most successful and best supported clubs, as well as being profitable.</p>
              <p>Chelsea have been Premier League champions twice since Kenyon's arrival, with Jose Mourinho behind both title triumphs, and they also reached the 2008 Champions League final.</p>
              <p>Reports that he would leave Stamford Bridge began earlier this summer, and he was linked with a role at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span></a> following the Abu Dhabi takeover at Eastlands last autumn.</p>
              <p>With Arnesen having taken up many of Kenyon's sporting roles, chairman Bruce Buck and director Eugene Tenenbaum may now take up the rest of his responsibilities on the short term.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PETER KENYON left Chelsea yesterday with a £2million kiss-off - and plans to return to football.</h2>
              <p class="article">The departure of the chief executive was announced in a club statement after months of negotiations over compensation. Chelsea are determined Kenyon will not return to haunt them working for another club and have even retained him as a non-executive director. But that agreement has a get-out clause and it is understood that Kenyon is keen to take up another job as soon as he can.</p>
              <p class="article">A close friend of Kenyon told SunSport that the ex-Manchester United chief has no plans to stay out of the game. The source said: "Peter has been in football for more than 20 years and has no plans to work outside the game.</p>
              <p class="article">"He knows he has a lot to offer, that has been backed up by the level of interest there has been in his services already. Make no mistake, he will be back."</p>
              <p class="article">A possible destination could be Manchester City, who may decide they could use Kenyon's expertise in the transfer market and his contacts at UEFA.</p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea are looking to appoint a successor with a business background - on a salary of £400,000. Kenyon earned £1.6m a year but the replacement will not be expected to get involved in football matters.</p>
              <p class="article">Academy chief Frank Arnesen has taken responsibility for player recruitment over the past eight months. In that time, Kenyon was being pushed aside and given less glamorous duties such as sponsorship deals. That convinced Kenyon, who has been at Chelsea for six years, his time was up.</p>

              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div><span><span><strong></strong></span></span></div>
              <div><span><strong>Chelsea have named Ron Gourlay as their new chief executive. The 46-year-old replaces Peter Kenyon, who announced on Wednesday he would be stepping down from the position at the end of next month.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Gourlay, who was previously the chief operating officer at the London club, told Chelsea's official website: "It is a huge honour to be offered the chance to lead Chelsea." </p>
              <p>Gourlay continued: "We have a fantastic team both on and off the field and those teams can move us on to even greater success in the future.</p>
              <p>"To be responsible for that is a fantastic challenge and I will be giving it my total commitment, drive and energy.</p>
              <p>"All successful clubs strike the balance between the footballing and commercial sides and my role is to ensure this happens as it is a critical part of our strategy moving forward."</p>
              <p>Gourlay has been at Chelsea for five years in a variety of roles. He has more than 25 years of experience in football and past senior jobs include working at Manchester United and Umbro.</p>
              <p>Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck said: "Ron was the outstanding candidate for the job. It was not necessary to look outside as we had someone with all the necessary attributes inside which was important as it ensures continuity and a smooth transition."</p>
              <p>Buck said Gourlay had the full support of the board and the club's owner, Roman Abramovich.</p>
              <p>He added: "We are absolutely confident that he can now take us forward into the next stage of our development as a club and business."</p>
              <p>Kenyon, who insists he has "at least one major challenge left", will continue at the club on UEFA and the European Clubs' Association committees and will be one of the representatives in the Gael Kakuta case, regardless of whether it is heard after his October 31 departure date.</p>
