The Anfield boss has warned his stars not to be distracted by the impending takeover of the club by the oil rich Dubai International Capital group.<br><br>Benitez is expected to get a transfer kitty of around Â£80 million but hopes that will inspire his current squad to show they are irreplaceable.<br><br>The Spaniard said: "Because the future looks positive, I'm sure all the players will be thinking about this in a good way and, if Liverpool is moving forward, they'll want to be part of that. I have spoken to Rick Parry and the chairman and they are very positive.<br><br>"But it is important we now all keep our focus.<br><br>Ruthless Rafa has already shown he is prepared to make big changes. He dismantled the side that won the Champions League 18 months ago and will not be afraid to wield the axe again if they do not meet the new challenges.<br><br>But Benitez insisted he won't compromise Anfield traditions by introducing the kind of celebrity culture that has engulfed Chelsea since Roman Abramovich ploughed his fortune into the club. The Liverpool boss said: "My staff and I are doing exactly the same things now as we've always done Â— and always will do.<br><br>"At Liverpool, there will always be a balance between making the right changes but also thinking about the heritage. Benitez has already met top officials from DIC who attended yesterday's game against Fulham after spending the week examining the club's finances.<br><br>The Â£450million takeover is expected to be concluded in the New Year with chief executive Rick Parry being tipped to take over as club chairman<br><br>The Dutchman said: "Rafa is a very clever manager He is good at building up a team and he should be able to handle that pressure of having more money to spend. "Our squad already has a lot of quality and if there is more money coming into the club it will get better and better.<br><br>"I don't know much about the takeover Â– only bits that I have read about. But it seems good for the club and that means it is good for the players. We don't have to be afraid of it."<br><br></div>

Believe me, I prefer this situation than the one we have.<br><br>"We are working with the same list of names that we looked at before, but we have some other names just in case we get more money to spend."<br></div>
