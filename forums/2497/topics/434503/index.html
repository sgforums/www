              </div>
              <p><strong>ARSENAL</strong><br><strong>Ryo Miyachi:</strong> The Japanese youngster joined Arsenal coming straight from high school. A tall winger with incredible speed (he matched Theo Walcott in a sprint test), Miyachi spent the end of last season on loan at Feyenoord where he made 12 appearances, scored three goals, became a firm fans' favourite and was given the nickname 'Ryodinho'. <br><strong>Plays like: Thierry Henry</strong> before he became a striker.<br><br><br><strong>ASTON VILLA<br>Gary Gardner: </strong>Widely tipped to join the first-team squad under Alex McLeish this season, the midfielder has had a bit of trouble with injuries already in his short career. However, the Villa fan (mind you, that's what his brother said) is an extremely talented ball player who was linked with Real Madrid in the tabloids.<br><strong>Plays like: Paul Scholes</strong> - good long and short-range passing with an eye for goal.<br><br><br><strong>BLACKBURN ROVERS<br>Grant Hanley: </strong>A graduate of the Rovers academy, Hanley will find himself getting a lot more game time following the departure of fellow centre-half Phil Jones. The strong Scot has also impressed national boss Craig Levein enough to see him hand the 18-year-old two full international caps.<br><strong>Plays like: Ryan Nelsen</strong> - a no-nonsense defender who relishes aerial tussles more than surging runs.<br><br><br><strong>BOLTON WANDERERS<br>Tom Eaves: </strong>The gangly striker was signed by Owen Coyle after scoring a hat-trick against Bolton in a pre-season friendly last summer. The former Oldham youngster reached double figures for the reserves last season despite only playing 15 games. Eaves seems to have all the components to make it: Height, speed and finishing ability. It's lucky that Coyle's the Bolton boss and not Allardyce or he'd be groomed into another Kevin Davies.<br><strong>Plays like: Zlatan Ibrahimovic</strong>, a big man that is very comfortable with a ball at his feet and can score from range.<br><br><br><strong>CHELSEA<br>Josh McEachran:</strong> There's been a lot of hype around the 18-year-old, most of it deserved. With the impending financial restrictions set in place by UEFA the Academy graduate will become a key player for The Blues in the next five years. His career has tended to mirror that of Jack Wilshere - another young left-footed midfielder - and I expect him to do play in a deep position just like the Arsenal man did last season.<br><strong>Plays like: Liam Brady</strong>, according to Ray Wilkins. And who am I to disagree with 'Butch'?<br><br><br><strong>EVERTON<br>Jose Baxter: </strong>Baxter has been the 'New Rooney' ever since he made his debut aged 16 in 2008. This is definitely a make-or-break season for the Bootle boy - either he establishes himself in David Moyes' first-team plans or he's out on loan. Will be looking to build on his few substitute appearances and his Reserve Team Player of The Year Award.<br><strong>Plays like:</strong> He reminds me of <strong>Jose Antonio Reyes</strong> - he's quick, a good dribbler and a good finisher. Let's just hope he doesn't also suffer from homesickness.<br><br><br><strong>FULHAM<br>Lauri Dalla Valle: </strong>The young Finn was part of the deal that took Paul Konchesky to Liverpool. God knows why Liverpool allowed him to go in exchange for Mr Average. A natural goalscorer, Dalla Valle was Liverpool's best player in the FA Youth Cup final defeat to Arsenal two years ago. He did well in a short loan spell at Bournemouth for the final months of last season.<br><strong>Plays like: </strong>A predator in the box, he can finish from any angle much like <strong>Ruud Van Nistelrooy</strong>.<br><br><br><strong>LIVERPOOL<br>Jonjo Shelvey: </strong>Completely bald already, the Attilo Lombardo lookalike has a big future ahead of him. Going from orchestrating Charlton's midfield while going through puberty, to playing in 15 games in his debut season for 'The Reds', he has the potential to be an England player before the 2014 World Cup. However, standing in his way is Kenny Dalglish's sordid fantasy with central midfielders following the signing of Messrs Henderson and Adam.<br><strong>Plays like: </strong>A fellow baldy, <strong>Zinedine Zidane.</strong> Both players share a presence on the ball that oozes confidence. This doesn't mean I think he'll be as good as Zizou, but their characteristics are strikingly similar.<br><br><br><strong>MANCHESTER CITY<br>Vladimir Weiss: </strong>The Slovak had an excellent loan spell at Rangers last season, making 35 appearances and scoring five goals. Also a regular for his country, Weiss will have a nation's hope on his shoulders for a good ten years to come. His club game, however, may not be as pressured. Undoubtedly a fringe player at City, he will be lucky to make five starts in the Premier League this season. A move away seems the only viable option if the 21-year-old wants to taste first-team action this season.<br><strong>Plays like: Ryan Giggs</strong> - a winger that likes to do everything at 100 miles per hour.<br><br><br><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED<br>Tom Cleverley: </strong>Spent last season on loan at Wigan - which has given him vital Premier League experience - the midfielder has seen what this league's all about and was a big factor in The Latics staying up. Cleverly is an immensely talented midfielder and he will be around for a long time. If given a chance he could fill United's central midfield berth.<br><strong>Plays like: Juan Carlos Valeron</strong> - a typical No.10 working just behind the striker.<br><br><br><strong>NEWCASTLE UNITED<br>Kazenga LuaLua:</strong> Brother of former Toon Army favourite Lomana, Kazenga performed excellently whilst on loan at Brighton, scoring goals and creating a fair few for his team-mates. His progress may have been hampered by a broken ankle he picked up in November, but he is still an incredibly exciting talent whose name Newcastle fans will be singing for some time to come (unless he joins Brighton permanently).<br><strong>Plays like: Ashley Young</strong> as he's got a lot of tools in his locker; good pace, eye for goal, free-kick specialist and two good feet. <br><br><br><strong>NORWICH CITY<br>Tom Adeyemi: </strong>An incredibly intelligent youngster who turned down a chance to study at Cambridge University to pursue a career in football. Adeyemi spent last season on loan at Bradford where he played 35 times, scoring five goals. A very athletic player who stands at 6"1, he is very highly rated by the staff at Norwich and could surprise a few people with Premier League newcomers Norwich.<br><strong>Plays like: Patrick Vieira</strong> - very well built but has good technique to match his stocky frame.<br><br><br><strong>QPR<br>Troy Hewitt: </strong>Signing a player from non-league is always a risk, and Rangers have taken that risk in signing the 20-year-old from Harrow Borough, where Hewitt scored 20 goals in 30 matches for the Ryman League outfit. The move has come about due to the two clubs' close links and a good word from QPR scouts means Hewitt's gone straight to the Big League.<br><strong>Plays like: DJ Campbell</strong>, both have dropped down and come back from non-league football and both have similar pace, movement and vision.<br><br><br><strong>STOKE CITY<br>Ben Marshall: </strong>A former youth player at Manchester United and Crewe Alexandra, Marshall arrived at Stoke in a double deal with Matt Lund. The tall winger/striker won praise from Greg Abbott after a successful loan spell with Carlisle. If he can recover adequately from a very bad injury sustained in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy, I reckon he could fit well in to Tony Pulis' style of hoof-ball.<br><strong>Plays like: Connor Wickham</strong> - a tall striker that can also play out on the wing.<br><br><br><strong>SUNDERLAND<br>David Meyler:</strong> If it wasn't for injuries ,Meyler's season would surely have mirrored that of former team-mate Jordan Henderson (some fans rate Meyler more). Instead the Irishman's gone to America for a month of rehabilitation following a second knee ligament injury. However, there is no doubting his talent or his incredible commitment.<br><strong>Plays like:</strong> A big, physical player with a touch of class. A bit like <strong>Dietmar Hamman</strong>.<br><br><br><strong>SWANSEA CITY<br>Jazz Richards: </strong>A midfielder who has represented Wales at U-17, 19 and 21s. Jazz - real name Ashley - played a few games at right-back during a Swans injury crisis, impressed and looks set to challenge for that spot permanently. Made eight appearances last season for the play-off winners.<br><strong>Plays like: </strong>A pacy and energetic midfielder that can also play in defence - the only real comparison is <strong>Emmanuel Eboue.</strong> Obviously.<br><br><br><strong>TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR<br>Jake Livermore</strong>: Now considered a part of 'Arry's first-team squad plans after loan spells at Ipswich and Leeds last season, interspersed by his league and cup debuts for Spurs against Stoke and Arsenal respectively. A loan to another Premier League club would do wonders for his confidence and experience.<br><strong>Plays like: </strong>A strong combative midfielder in the style of current Spurs teammate <strong>Wilson Palacios</strong>.<br><br><br><strong>WEST BROM<br>Luke Daniels: </strong>With Scott Carson leaving Albion for Bursaspor, and the inconsistent Boaz Myhill being the only other recognised first-team goalkeeper at the club, Daniels has a good chance of making his Baggies debut this season. After loan spells at Shrewsbury, Tranmere, Bristol Rovers and Rochdale the 22-year-old has experience of lower league football and of being a club's No.1.<br><strong>Plays like:</strong> An immense presence between the sticks, Daniels has an air of <strong>Petr Cech</strong> with a confidence that belies his age.<br><br><br><strong>WIGAN ATHLETIC<br>Daniel Redmond: </strong>The technically gifted midfielder made his first-team debut earlier this season when Latics defeated Hull City in the FA Cup as a reward for his superb performances at reserve team level. A real playmaker on the ball, Redmond's strength and resilience has seen him fill in comfortably at full-back in the past and he is currently reserve team captain.<br><strong>Plays like: Stewart Downing </strong>- not the quickest winger but has very good technique and crossing ability. Could be Charles Insomnia's replacement.<br><br><br><strong>WOLVES<br>Danny Batth: </strong>With elder statesman Jody Craddock hobbling toward retirement and the general awfulness of the Wolves defence, Mick McCarthy may be looking for a new CB for the start of the season. He won't have to look far. Batth has enjoyed fruitful loan spells at Sheffield Wednesday and Colchester United over the past two seasons and will certainly be knocking at Mick's door.<br><strong>Plays like: </strong>His gaffer <strong>McCarthy</strong> - a big presence on and off the pitch who doesn't stand for any nonsense.</p>
