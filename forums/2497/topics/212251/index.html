            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal's resurgence continued as they dispatched Porto 2-0 at the Emirates Stadium to take a significant step towards reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League.<br><br>Arsene Wenger celebrates 10 seasons at the north London club on Thursday - and the Gunners boss firmly believes he has never had more potential within his squad, despite what had been a sluggish start to the new campaign.<br><br><strong>First goal 37min</strong><br>Emmanuel Eboue made ground down the right, and whipped in a teasing centre. The ball flew just over Pepe towards the far post - where the Arsenal captain was waiting to expertly head back across the keeper and into the far corner.<br><br><strong>Second goal 48min</strong><br>William Gallas charged forwards and fed over possession to Henry at the edge of the Porto area. The Gunners skipper moved the ball across before slipping in Hleb on the overlap down the right. The Belarus midfielder needed no second invitation and dispatched a low, angled drive into the far corner.<br><br><strong>Arsenal were now in cruise control.</strong><br>Henry made plenty more of his trademark runs to the by-line, with Fabregas' snap-shot from one such cutback across goal forcing a good reaction save by Porto keeper Helton.<br><br>Lehmann needed two attempts to gather a low, angled drive from Ricardo Quaresma at his right-hand post with 10 minutes to go before Arsenal closed out a comfortable victory.</div>

You only feel at home once you know where everything is.Â”<br><br>Well, they have certainly discovered where the goalposts are now.<br><br>One man who had been enjoying the new surroundings, until he was injured at the end last night, was defender William Gallas.<br><br>Gunners keeper Jens Lehmann was rarely troubled Â— although he did survive an early scare when AndersonÂ’s corner was turned towards goal by Bruno Alves and the big German saved with his foot.</div>
