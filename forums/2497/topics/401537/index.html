              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;"><strong>Liverpool fan Eriksson wants 'dream' Anfield job</strong></h1>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2009/1019/svengoraneriksson20091019_275x155.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="155"></p>
              <p>The race for the newly vacant Liverpool manager's job is hotting up as 
              Sven-Goran Eriksson threw his hat into the ring and former winger John 
              Barnes gave his backing to Kenny Dalglish - if the Anfield legend wants 
              to reprise his old role.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Eriksson told the <em>Sun</em>: "I<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> have been a Liverpool fan all of my 
              life. I never mentioned it when I was in charge of England because I 
              didn't think it was fair.</strong></span> I was shocked when I discovered Rafa Benitez 
              had left. Would I want to be the manager of Liverpool? It is every 
              manager's dream to manage Liverpool.''</p>
              <p>Eriksson told how he used 
              to watch Liverpool games on TV at home in Sweden and how he also visited
               Anfield when he was learning his way as a coach.</p>
              <p>"My father was 
              also a Liverpool supporter and every Saturday we would watch an English 
              match on television. It was the highlight of the week. Liverpool matches
               were televised quite regularly and we would cheer them on. They have 
              always been my team and nothing has changed.</p>
              <p>"When I was starting 
              out in coaching I was invited to Liverpool to see how they did things. 
              Joe Fagan was the manager at the time. I remember him showing me around 
              Anfield and taking me into their legendary boot room. It was such a 
              privilege and an honour for me to be invited in there. I will never 
              forget that moment. Liverpool will always hold a special place in my 
              heart."</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Hiddink and Rijkaard cool on links with Liverpool
               vacancy</h1>
              <div class="story-image"></div>
              <p>The agents of both Guus Hiddink and Frank Rijkaard have 
              distanced their clients from the vacant manager’s post at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr> left the Reds post on Thursday by 
              mutual consent after six years at Anfield.</p>
              <p>But, Cees van Nieuwenhuizen, agent of Turkey coach Guus Hiddink told <em>BBC
               Sport</em> that the former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> boss would not be turning his back on Turkey
               having only recently taken up the post.</p>
              <p>"Guus has shown over the years that he is loyal to agreements that he 
              signed," Van Nieuwenhuizen said. "There is no reason why he would change
               such behaviour.</p>
              <p>"Guus just started two weeks ago in Turkey and as much as he likes the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> and as much as he respects <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> as a legendary club with a great future 
              ahead, a switch would be hardly doable.</p>
              <p>"I know, never say never and especially in football this is true, but 
              for me this is an impossible thought."</p>
              <p>BBC Sport also spoke to representatives of both Croatia manager Slaven 
              Bilic and former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Barcelona</span></abbr> boss Frank Rijkaard.</p>
              <p>Bilic's agent and brother Domagoj admitted the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> job was appealing, saying: "An offer has 
              not come - not yet anyway - so we will not discuss it. But if any offer 
              does come we will of course discuss it."</p>
              <p>Rijkaard's agent Perry Overmeers was less enthusiastic, however, saying 
              that his client would honour his current deal with Turkish side 
              Galatasaray.</p>
              <p>"Rumours linking Frank to <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> are just that, rumours," Overmeers said.</p>
              <p>"Frank is the type of person who likes to fulfil his obligations and he 
              has one year left on his contract with Galatasaray."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> are ready to move for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Harry Redknapp</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p><em>Sky Sports</em> says sources suggest <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> are planning a shock move for Redknapp 
              following the departure of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Rafa Benitez</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Reds chief Kenny Dalglish knows Redknapp well having brought his son 
              Jamie to Anfield in January 1991 when he was at the helm of the 
              five-time European champions and the two families have been close ever 
              since.</p>
              <p>The former Bournemouth, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West Ham</span></abbr>, Southampton and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr> manager has transformed the fortunes of 
              the White Hart Lane club since replacing Juande Ramos in October 2008.</p>
              <p>Redknapp has only one year remaining on his current contract at White 
              Hart Lane and talks over a new deal are yet to take place.</p>

              <p>It would be silly for Harry to leave Spurs right now cos Spurs are on the up while Pool, don't really know which way they are heading...</p>
              <p>Harry has got Spurs into the CL and the one big difference this time is, They have manage to keep their star players at the club unlike previous seasons... Bale, Modric all commit themselves to the club now and Spurs are looking to build on that with interest on better players arriving...</p>
              <p>Spurs also have a new and bigger stadium on the way so there is a lot to look forward to... On the Pool side, they probably haven't even started work on their own new stadium despite talking about it for like donkey years now. So if a new owner isn't found soon, they will continue to slide or be the new Villa... An almost there every season club but never at the top...</p>
              <p>So my take is Harry would be wise to stay at Spurs... As for O'Neill and Hodgson, Pool would be a move up from their present club...</p>
