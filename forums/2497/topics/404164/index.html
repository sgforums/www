              <p><br>I doubt so.   If it is as you said, why he allows so many threads on England?   Think he is trying to be funny.   Very rude of him!  Even if he wants to keep all related news in one thread, there is no need to change the title of the thread.    </p>

              <p><br>We try to be polite with you hoping you would understand but unfortunately you choose to be boorish towards the people here... Therefore, all I can say is... You have a choice. If you can't accept your thread title being changed for good reasons, then you should refrain from starting threads here in future... This way, you can be very sure your thread title won't be changed.</p>
              <p>And I also find it rather interesting that for someone who is less than 2 months old in this forum can say you have read complaints in here before... Cos personally, I have not heard any complains for sometime already, so are you someone's clone account who was previously here but decided to start a new account cos your other account is already stain?</p>
              <p>Anyway, for someone to kick up such a fuss over such a minor thing, i actually find it quite hilarious... So if you are here looking for trouble under a new account... I hope you would just grow up and stay away... Leave us in peace.</p>
