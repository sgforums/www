            <div class='col-md body'>England head coach Steve McClaren insists that until David Beckham retires from international football he will always have a chance of making his squad.<br><br>The former England captain was unceremoniously dropped by the ex-Middlesbrough man after he replaced Sven Goran Eriksson last summer.<br><br>McClaren has resisted the chance to recall the Real Madrid ace on numerous occasions, including last week's 1-0 home defeat to Spain.<br><br>He now insists that the likes of Beckham, David James and Sol Campbell, all have a chance of a recall as long as they are available for selection.<br><br>Asked whether people have misread McClaren shutting the door on Beckham, he told Sky Sports News: "Yes, of course they have.<br><br>"It's the same with David James and Sol Campbell.<br><br>"I reiterated a few weeks ago after watching Portsmouth and Manchester United, they gave excellent performances there.<br><br>"Unless they retire in international football everyone is under consideration. I don't retire them, they retire themselves and they haven't, none of them have, David Beckham included."<br><br>Meanwhile, McClaren have moved quickly to quash talk he held a crisis meeting with senior players following last week's defeat at Old Trafford to Spain.<br><br>"No, there are meetings with players, but crisis? Never in crisis. Just opportunities to learn and do things better," he continued.<br><br>"The big frustration of being an international manager after a game is de-briefing the players and closing a game. So getting the messages to the players after a game can be difficult.<br><br>"In the coming weeks, although I haven't decided how, we'll get that message across. We'll close that Spain game down and quickly move onto Israel."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Highly-regarded England boss Steve McClown has let the press know that he intends to play Steven Gerrard on the right of midfield in a 4-4-1-1 formation against Israel next month. Owen Hargreaves will anchor the midfield with Frank Lampard ahead of him and Aaron Lennon on the left. Anything to avoid choosing between Lampard and Gerrard, eh?...</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/98322.jpg"><br><br><strong>McCLAREN WANTS GERRARD ON THE RIGHT IN ISRAEL</strong><br><br>Steve McClaren has no intention of leaving out either Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard from the England team to tackle Israel next month despite revealing that Owen Hargreaves is central to his plans.<br><br>Rather than face up to a choice between the Liverpool and Chelski midfielders as partner for the deep-lying Hargreaves, McClaren's fudge will see Gerrard moved to the right of midfield. Barring a miraculous recovery by Joe Cole, Aaron Lennon will then be required to play out of position on the left.<br><br>McClaren's blueprint seeped out during his press briefing on Wednesday in which it was also confirmed that every England player would receive a DVD of their contribution in the defeat to Spain in order to, in the words of The Daily Telegraph, 'underline their "accountability'' for performances.'<br><br>Hargreaves' reputation was further enhanced by his absence from the debacle at Old Trafford and, fitness permitting, the Bayern Munich midfielder will be one of the first names on the England team-sheet in Tel Aviv.<br><br>"We need him," McClaren told The Times. "I always remember the first time he played in a World Cup warm-up match [in 2002] and Owen wanted me after the game to get the video out and go through it with him. That was very unusual. Most players you have to drag in. I thought, 'This is a different breed, a different type of player here, a different mentality.'<br><br>"He had that great determination and mental strength to say, 'I want to improve.' I've seen him grow and grow. I think he struggled early on [with England] because he wasn't a regular at Bayern. But now you see him, he's a regular and the confidence he brings into the squad he has transferred into his performances. He makes a thousand tackles and interceptions, the unseen things that are very important to make it a better team."<br><br>While McClaren has flirted with a 4-3-3 formation, he will revert to a 4-4-1-1 in Israel in order to provide Wayne Rooney his preferred position as a second striker.<br></div>
