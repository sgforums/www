              <p><strong>£40m deal for Ronaldo</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/04_02/120ronaldo_186x250.jpg" alt=""></p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>CRISTIANO RONALDO is set to sign a new £40million deal with Manchester United. He will become the highest-paid player in England on a massive £150,000 a week. The Portuguese winger, 23, will put pen to paper on the five-year deal before Euro 2008.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo’s current contract had four years to run but United want to stave off Real Madrid. A United source said: “This will be the biggest contract in the club’s history. Given Ronaldo’s achievements over the past two years, it’s easy to understand why. “There is no doubt he is the best player in the world and we want to make sure he is happy at United. There is only one place for him and that is Old Trafford.”</p>
              <h4>Boost for Alex Ferguson</h4>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo, currently on £100,000 a week, is enjoying a sensational season. He has scored 37 goals for United in all competitions and is the hottest property in world football. The news is a big boost for boss Alex Ferguson, whose troops face Arsenal in tomorrow’s title clash.</p>
              <p class="article">Real were plotting a massive bid for Ronaldo in the summer, while Barcelona and Inter Milan were also planning swoops. Real technical director Pedja Mijatovic held a meeting with Ronaldo’s agent Jorge Mendes to reiterate the club’s desire to capture the superstar. But Mendes made it clear to Madrid that Ronaldo is set to stay at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo’s new deal will dwarf that of team-mate Wayne Rooney on £112,000 a week. He leapfrogs the Chelsea quartet of Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko — both on £130,000 a week — and Frank Lampard £120,000 a week and John Terry, who is on £135,000 a week.</p>
              <p class="article">But he has some way to go to match the biggest earners in world sport. Tiger Woods pulls in £50m a year, boxer Oscar de la Hoya earned £22m in 2007 and golfer Phil Mickelson was just behind on £21m.</p>
              <p class="article">David Beckham’s pay at LA Galaxy is about £16m a year — but he earns millions more in sponsorship deals.</p>

              <p>Where got much... If that Shevchenko can get $130,000 a week for doing nothing and Terry $135,000 a week... What is $150,000 for a player of his skill level... Moreover Shevchenko 31 liao and Terry 27... This fellow only just turn 23... Easily he can play top level until he is 30...</p>
              <p>I am sure Real Madrid will still try again but at least when they think must offer him more than the 150k a week to better his weekly salary plus the transfer fee... will be alot liao... But I belief they will still try however their offer won't be too attractive compare to whats he will be getting very soon.</p>
              <p>Barcelona and Inter should also forget it lah...</p>

              <p><br>No, nobody is so sure but no reason why he cannot right? If Figo can play well into his 30s and Zizu also, why can't he? Anyway, even if its for the next 2, 3 years its still worth it cos he will still have sale value at 25 or 26... Even a 28 yrs old ronaldino will still command a transfer fee of about $12 to $20m or maybe even more so whats the problem? Anyway, they bought him for 12m only... so nothing to lose.</p>

              <p><br>Precisely... they didn't but that doesn't mean players starting younger their careers will end earlier too...</p>
              <p>There is no given rule that players who started playing top level football at an early age careers can't last more than a few years... Its only a matter of how they take care of themselves over the years and the people managing them as well... Modern players gets better medical attention and treatment even compare to a decade ago...</p>
              <p>Zizu and Figo big money moved only took place after they pass 26, 27 yrs old... So I don't see why present younger players can't peak at that age... At 25 to 27 is probably the best age where skills are combined with experienced to make a player not only skilful but intelligent too.</p>

              <p>history proves time and again that no one can be on top for a long time. the recent dampeners surrounding ronaldinho is proof to that. who would have thought 2 years ago ronaldinho is fallible?</p>
