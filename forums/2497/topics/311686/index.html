              <p><span id="intelliTXT"><span style="color: #888888;">Â Ronaldo was hailed "the best player in the world".</span> </span></p>
              <h2>BOSSES UNITE TO HAIL RONALDO</h2>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo was hailed as "a genius" after another stupendous free-kick saw Manchester United take the advantage in the title race. United saw off Bolton 2-0 at Old Trafford thanks to two early goals from Ronaldo, captaining <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson's </strong>side for the first time. Ferguson believes the title race will go to the wire and heaped more praise on his skipper for the night, while opposite number Gary Megson called the winger "the best player in the world".</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "The important thing was that we had the opportunity and the incentive to go three points clear of Arsenal, our nearest pursuers. "It's nip and tuck now. I think it's going to go to the wire. Chelsea will be key because they have got us and Arsenal at home. "It's a lead, it's not a significant lead but it's a lead nonetheless. "With eight games to go the team who plays with the most consistency now will win it."</p>
              <p>Ferguson made seven changes from the side who beat Derby and claimed he needed to test out various options ahead of Sunday's meeting with Liverpool. Gerard Pique came in for the injured Rio Ferdinand while Wayne Rooney, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs were all rested. "It was not a great performance but it was necessary to make those changes as Rio Ferdinand is doubtful for Sunday with a back problem," added Ferguson.</p>
              <p>"I had to find out about Gerard Pique. We've got great confidence in the lad and he's come through very well. "They are all top players so you have to put your faith and trust in them. "At times we were a bit relaxed in the second half but when we speeded up the game and played with great penetration at times we could have scored a few more goals.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldo's free-kick was marvellous. He does put in the practice and he has this technique." Ronaldo now has 33 goals this season - overtaking George Best's 32 in 1968, the most a United winger had scored in one campaign until now - and 24 in the league. Ferguson added: "It's fantastic and speaks volumes about the player, it's amazing that he can do that playing in the position he does."</p>
