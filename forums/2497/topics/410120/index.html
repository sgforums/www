              <p><strong>Nigel de Jong believes his Manchester City team-mates have shown him more respect since his controversial World Cup Final appearance. The tough midfielder was one of Holland’s stars as they reached the summit showdown with Spain in South Africa. But De Jong’s kung-fu kick on Xabi Alonso was a key moment in a brutal match.</strong></p>
              <p>But De Jong revealed: “I don’t regret anything. I never intended to hurt him. And after such a great World Cup I came back in the dressing room of Manchester City as a different player. Well, that’s how it felt.</p>
              <p>“I had just played in the final of the World Cup. It gives you a different status. The lads at City said they were impressed with the Dutch team’s performances out there in South Africa. That was really nice.’’</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p>De Jong says he has quickly switched his focus on to Manchester City anyway. And he admits the Abu Dhabi-backed sky blue revolution must target the Premier League title THIS season.</p>
              <p>De Jong explained: “What makes it really hard for us, is that every team we play, sees us as the big favourite for the title. We are now a hot item in England only because our club have spent such a lot of money on new players. I am not saying they hate us in every stadium, but I do feel there is a tremendous amount of jealousy.</p>
              <p>“I really think we must compete with Chelsea and Manchester United this season. Two years ago a new owner arrived here. Last year we laid the foundation, this year we have to fire from all cilinders. We must go and win trophies.</p>
              <p>“We can’t expect it to be a smooth ride. United and Chelsea are established teams. Their players know exactly what it takes to win the league.’’</p>
              <p>City bought six new players in the summer including the towering midfield presence of Yaya Toure. Some pundits thought the Ivorian’s arrival would cloud De Jong’s chances.</p>
              <p>But the duo are operating in the same midfield and the Dutchman believes their partnership will flourish.</p>
              <p>He said: “I see Yaya more as a central midfield player than a defensive midfield player. He has an attacking mind. I think together we can form a great partnership in midfield. It will be like a strong block.</p>
              <p>“Besides, I have always been a regular player in the first team and I expect that will stay like that.”</p>
              <p>De Jong feels he can be a stabilising factor for the team this year as so many new faces attempt to settle in at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>“Vincent Kompany and I are the only two players who have been with this club before the sheik arrived,” he said. “So I think I am a player with a lot of experience at the club.’’</p>
              <p>Sheik Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan has spent millions on City but the 39 year old billionaire had never attended a match until a fortnight ago. When he did turn up, he didn’t meet the players. So De Jong is still to meet the owner.</p>
              <p>He ended: “I don’t think that is abnormal. The sheik has installed people at the club who take care of everything on his behalf. That is the way he works. I do know what he looks like, as I have seen pictures of him before. When he was shown on the large screen in the stadium, he was not a complete stranger to all the players.’’</p>
