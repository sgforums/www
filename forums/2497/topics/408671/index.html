              <p>Injuries helped prevent the midfielder from living up to his hefty price tag last season after joining from Roma a year ago and although he didn't say Aquilani's Liverpool career was over, Hodgson admitted the club was looking to farm out the 26-year-old Italian.</p>
              <p>Benitez was criticised for his work in the transfer market during his Liverpool reign and the signing of Aquilani, who was injured long-term when he arrived at Anfield, as the expensive replacement for <span style="color: #000000;">Xabi Alonso</span>, was widely considered to be a bad piece of business. Aquilani showed some promise when he did take the field but those occasions were too few and far between for a key summer purchase.</p>
              <p>Aquilani was not included in Liverpool's squad for Thursday night's Europa League play-off against Trabzonspor and discussions are underway over a possible move.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: "At the moment we are considering possibly loaning him to an Italian club, but nothing is sure about that yet so I don't have anything definite to report. I didn't want to use him (against Trabzonspor) just in case the loan goes through.</p>
              <p>Aquilani had a history of injury problems when he joined Liverpool and it was more than two months into last season before he made his debut for the club. Hodgson has given no indication as to which Italian club he could join but he was linked with Juventus - from whom Liverpool have just signed midfielder <span style="color: #000000;">Christian Poulsen</span> - earlier in the year.</p>

              <h1>Juventus join chase for Liverpool loaner Alberto Aquilani but Italian giants line up swap deal with Felipe Melo<br></h1>

              </div>
              <p>Juventus are keen to sign Alberto Aquilani after Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson cleared the £20million flop to leave Anfield on a loan deal.</p>
              <p>However,
               the Serie A giants could try to tempt the Reds with a permanent 
              transfer, offering Brazil midfielder Felipe Melo in exchange.</p>
              <p>Hodgson
               signed Denmark international Christian Poulsen from Juve as a 
              ready-made replacement for wantaway Argentina captain Javier Mascherano.</p>

              </div>
              <p>But the Italians believe there is still interest from Anfield in 
              one-time Arsenal target Melo, according to Italian newspaper Corriere 
              dello Sport.</p>
              <p>Hodgson left Aquilani out of Liverpool's 1-0 
              Europa League win against Trabzonspor on Wednesday night to stop him 
              being cup-tied and admitted a return to Italy was on the cards.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Who wants me? Roy Hodgson has sanctioned a loan move away from Anfield for midfielder Aquilani</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'We are considering possibly loaning him to an Italian club, but
              nothing is sure about that yet so I don't have anything definite to
              report,' said the boss after the play-off round first leg.</p>
              <p>'I 
              didn't want to use him (against Trabzonspor) just in case the loan goes 
              through, because for Aquilani this year it's very important that he 
              plays regular football, every week, as the No 1 man on the teamsheet.</p>
              <p>'I can't promise him that here so if a loan move to Italy could help him in that respect it might be good for all parties.</p>
              <p>'It would certainly be what he needs, it would certainly protect the 
              value of the player and when he does return to Liverpool no doubt we 
              will see the Aquilani that we signed before he came here injured last 
              year.'</p>
              <p>Aquilani was signed from Roma last summer as the 
              replacement for Xabi Alonso, who left for Real Madrid, but the Italy 
              midfielder never managed a regular run in the team because of injuries.</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani has agreed to join Juventus on loan, according to reports in Italy.</strong></p>
              <p>Reds manager Roy Hodgson revealed last night that the Italian – a £17million signing from Roma last summer – would be allowed to return to his homeland on a temporary basis this season in a bid to gain first-team football, and it now appears as though Aquilani has agreed to link up with the Old Lady of Italian football, according to Italian newspaper Il Corriere dello Sport.</p>
              <p>Aquilani joined Liverpool still recovering from ankle surgery, and was restricted to just 26 appearances for the Reds last season, as injury and illness scuppered his chances of making an impact at Anfield.</p>
              <p>He scored two goals for the Reds in 2009/10, one in the Premier League against Portsmouth and another in the Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid.</p>
              <p>Il Corriere dello Sport also claim that an option to buy Aquilani permanently has been inserted into the loan deal.</p>

              <div class="KonaBody"><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><strong>Saturday's confirmation of Alberto Aquilani's return to Serie A on loan for a season was no great surprise; that his destination would be a giant (albeit a convalescing one) like Juventus was a little more so.</strong><br><br>What's clear is that the Italian's Liverpool career seemed doomed from the off, even if a few optimists - including new Anfield coach Roy Hodgson - have expressed their hope that a stronger Aquilani will return to the Premier League in good form this time next year.<br><br>So why hasn't it worked out for the second most expensive signing of the Rafael Benitez era? <strong>Goal.com UK </strong>looks at the five main reasons why Aquilani has failed to justify his hefty £18 million price-tag so far...</span></div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><span><br><br></span></div>
              <div class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">1. His injury record</span></strong></span></div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br>It is mystifying to many that erstwhile Reds coach Benitez got Aquilani's signing sanctioned in the first place in view of the midfielder's suspect fitness record. Only once in nine seasons as a professional has Aquilani taken part in 30 league games or more in a season, back in 2003-04 when he made 41 appearances on loan to Triestina in Serie B.  <br><br>More startlingly, he played less than 15 Serie A matches in two of his last three campaigns at Roma. So it should not be a great shock that one affected so frequently by niggling injuries (and who was purchased while carrying one) managed just 813 Premier League minutes for the Reds, starting nine times. <br><br>This has also been a major factor in stalling the player's international career. Since making his Italy debut against Turkey nearly four years ago, Aquilani has only appeared a further 15 times for the Azzurri.</div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br></div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><img style="margin: 5px; border: black 1px solid;" src="http://u.goal.com/64400/64467hp2.jpg" alt="" width="100%"><br>
              <div class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bleak forecast</strong> | Adapting to British weather was the least of Aquilani's problems</div>
              <div class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"><br></div>
              </div>
              <div class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>2. The pace of the Premier League</strong><br></span></span></div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br>Following on from general fitness worries, there was always a sizeable question mark over whether even a fully-fit Aquilani would ever be a player suited to the rigours of the Premier League. <br><br>Even if his nickname from the Roma faithful, <em>Il Principe</em> ('The Prince') suggests a certain elegance, it's not just about physique. Indeed, according to the official records from last season Aquilani weighs only 4kg less than the Reds' midfield battering ram, Steven Gerrard.<br><br>It's more about the use of the body, managing to cope with closer attention from the opposition and the general zip of the game in England. This is something Aquilani never genuinely mastered, making promising yet sporadic contributions and arguably having his best games for the club in a European context during the two Europa League quarter-final legs against Atletico Madrid.</div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><br></strong></span>
              <div class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>3. His miscasting as a Xabi Alonso replacement</strong></span> <br><br></span></div>
              <div class="KonaBody">Aquilani's signing was knee-jerk, a panicked response to the long-mooted loss of Xabi Alonso after Benitez had bafflingly tried to dump the Basque midfielder in the summer of 2008. Alonso's departure for Real Madrid netted Liverpool an estimated £30m, which their coach immediately felt burning a hole in his pocket.<br><br>That the Reds needed to replace Alonso was in little doubt - his smooth and versatile passing was the base from which Liverpool built. That Aquilani, a more stylish and attack-minded midfielder, was not the man to do it seemed equally clear. <br><br>As Liverpool laboured without Alonso (and the distribution of Jamie Carragher, for example, was cruelly exposed), Aquilani was expected to step into the breach. Even if he had the potential to be gradually trained in the 'quarterback' role, he was by no means a ready-made substitute.  </div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br><br></div>
              <div class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>4. Rafael Benitez's swift loss of faith in him</strong><br></span></span></div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br>Having arrived for the second highest fee of the Benitez years (Fernando Torres having been the most expensive purchase), the eagerness to see Aquilani make his first steps in red were understandable, even though he required a spell of rehabilitation first. <br><br>That he had to wait until the League Cup defeat at Arsenal on October 26 to make his debut was no surprise. That he would not make his full Premier League debut until exactly two months later, at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, was.</div>

              <div class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"><strong>All smiles</strong> | But Benitez was reluctant to risk his big-money buy</div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br>It is completely normal that a player being nursed back to fitness, as well as one finding his way in a foreign football culture, should be introduced gradually. Yet there was a growing sense of bewilderment that having got his star signing fit, Benitez seemed increasingly reluctant to use him. <br><br>In fact, Aquilani only tended to start relatively low-risk games throughout the remainder of the season (Portsmouth, Burnley etc), starting the penultimate match with Chelsea only due to injuries limiting Benitez's options. The Spaniard seemed to be regretting his purchase.</div>

              <div class="KonaBody" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">5. The fact Steven Gerrard still rules the roost at Anfield</span></strong></span></div>
              <div class="KonaBody"><br>We have already mentioned Aquilani's need to pull the strings from an advanced midfield position. There's just one problem; a certain No.8 already does just that for the Reds.<br><br>Steven Gerrard didn't have his finest season for Liverpool in 2009-10, but he is still the team talisman and driving force. Everything Liverpool do centrally between midfield and attack goes through him, leaving little room for Aquilani. The arrival of Joe Cole arguably complicated the situation yet further.<br><br>Lucas has already been through the same difficulty, criticised for his patchy form until a just revision in recent months. The truth is that the Brazilian was used to play going through him at Gremio and in Brazil's representative teams, something which was never going to happen at Anfield. <br><br>He has had to learn a new role, to play effectively with Gerrard; something which Aquilani has, thus far, had little opportunity to do.<br></div>

              <p>Ah Roy may be tied by the new rule of 25 and the need for english players that he have to offload aquaman.</p>
              <p>I dun qualified aquaman as a flop as he was not given a chance by ah ben to perform.</p>
              <p>This season should be a good time for him to shine if stevie need a break.</p>
              <p>Unless Ah Roy have other plans in mind, then it is better to sell him instead.</p>
