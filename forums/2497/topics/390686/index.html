              <h2>Keith Hackett's verdict</h2>
              <p><strong>1)</strong> Other than making sure people don't go over the top and lose their
                  tempers, you should let play continue. This is a problem for the
                  manager to resolve. He can remove the player and continue with ten men
                  if he likes – but all you can do is offer some operational advice to
                  both of them to avoid any escalation. <em></em><br><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>2)</strong> Allow the goalkeeper to be replaced by a named substitute. It is only
                  the goalkeeper, if injured, who can be replaced in the penalty
                  shoot-out. <em></em><br><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>3)</strong> Play on. You need to think quickly, and your judgment here should be
                  that the defender did not deliberately kick the ball to his goalkeeper.
                  Yes, he may have intended to, but you cannot read the defender's mind
                  and guess whether he intended a back-pass or a corner-kick when under
                  pressure: you must base your decision on the facts in front of you.<em></em></p>

              <p><strong>1) </strong>This
              is one incident, not two, so you would not show two yellow cards
              followed by a red. Show him one yellow for unsporting behaviour – in
              this case simulation, attempting to deceive. Restart play with an
              indirect free-kick to the defence. <em></em></p>
              <p><em></em><br><strong>2) </strong>Show
              him a red card for violent conduct and restart play with an indirect
              free-kick to the opposition. You should also take a moment to call over
              the stadium manager, and request that the number of stewards near the
              incident is increased. After the game, report the incident to the
              authorities.</p>
              <p><em></em><br><strong>3) </strong>You
              can deal with both offences here: the first offence, offside, is
              punished by restarting with an indirect free-kick to the defending
              side. The second offence, violent conduct, is punished by showing the
              goalkeeper a red card. The fact that you were stopping play for an
              offside doesn't mean you can't also punish a separate violent incident.
              Wait for another player to replace the keeper in goal before restarting
              play.</p>

              <h2>Keith Hackett's answers</h2>
              <p><strong>1)</strong> You must be efficient when it comes to a shoot-out: you and your
              assistants are there to prevent messes like this. One of your
              assistants should be standing in the centre circle with the two teams,
              recording who is taking each kick. But clearly in this situation the
              system has gone wrong, so use common sense: having disallowed the goal,
              allow one of the player's team-mates to retake it. After all, you were
              at fault for allowing the kick to go ahead.<em></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>2)</strong> Think it through in stages. The striker's half-hearted dive did not
              deceive you, so you played on. With play then live, the striker
              intended to foul the keeper, but didn't go through with it. But the
              keeper has deliberately attempted to deceive you and get his opponent
              sent off by ostentatiously diving. So caution (yellow card) the keeper
              for unsporting behaviour, and restart with an indirect free-kick to the
              attacking team. <em></em><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>3) </strong>Yes.
              Back-pass is one of those often misunderstood terms – it doesn't have
              to be a deliberate passing gesture, nor does it have to go back. You
              need to consider: was the ball last played by a defender? Yes. Did the
              defender want the keeper to pick up the ball? Yes. So it counts as a
              back-pass: the defender has played the ball and has deliberately sought
              help from his keeper. Stop play as soon as the keeper picks it up and
              restart with an indirect free-kick.<em></em></p>

                      official answers appear in Sunday's Observer and here from Monday.</p>
              <h2>Keith Hackett's answers</h2>
              <p><strong>1)</strong> The law on encroachment is clear: once you have signalled for a penalty
                      to be taken, if a member of the attacking team other than the kicker
                      enters the penalty area, or goes within 9.15m of the penalty mark, or
                      in front of the ball, you must let the kick go ahead, but award a
                      retake if the ball enters the goal. The encroaching players are taking
                      advantage of that just to make a point, so you must start to caution
                      (yellow card) them. You must also extend time to allow for the retakes.
                      If any of the kicks are missed and sufficient time is available,
                      restart with an indirect free-kick to the defending team from where the
                      encroachment occurred. </p>
              <p><em> </em><br><strong>2)</strong> It's a goal. It's unfortunate, but you should base your decision on
                      whether or not the striker deliberately hurled mud into the keeper's
                      eyes. Clearly he didn't, so play on. <em></em></p>
              <p><br><strong>3) </strong>Stop
                      play and restart with an indirect free-kick to the away team at the
                      point where the home attacker was offside. You could have awarded a
                      direct free-kick against the keeper for handball – he should play to
                      the whistle, not the flag – but use common sense: the advantage you
                      played has not ensued, so take play back to the offside offence.<em></em></p>

              <p><strong>1) </strong>A
              nightmare. Ask the player to leave the field of play, restart
              accordingly and report the matter to the authorities afterwards.
              There's no other action you can take regarding the goal. After the game
              action would be taken against the player, the club and against you and
              the fourth official. It's awful officiating: before the start of the
              game you must obtain the names of the substitutes, and during it you
              and the fourth official must keep track of who has been substituted and
              who has been cautioned or sent off.<em></em></p>
              <p><strong>2)</strong> Stop play and issue a yellow card for the first offence, then a second
              yellow followed by a red for the second offence. It's a tough
              situation: you should be careful using advantage in circumstances like
              these – only play on if the advantage is clear. If it is, try to let
              the player know he has committed a cautionable offence in the first
              incident by shouting: "That was a yellow card. Advantage!".
              Preventative refereeing is always the best policy.</p>
              <p><br><strong>3)</strong> "Studs up" doesn't automatically mean dangerous play. Award the goal if you're happy there was no danger to an opponent. <br><em></em></p>

              <p><strong>1)</strong> You cannot abandon the game in these circumstances: it is up to the
              authorities to decide what to do after the game has reached its
              conclusion. So you should bring both captains together, explain to them
              that the situation will be reviewed after the match, and tell them to
              complete the game. It's a real mess though, and shows the danger of
              allowing these manufactured restarts. Frankly I would have tried to
              stop play before the ball had entered the goal.</p>
              <p><em></em><br><strong>2)</strong> Award a penalty and show the goalkeeper a yellow card for unsporting
              behaviour. It is clear from the path of the ball that an obvious
              goalscoring opportunity has not been denied, so it's not a red.</p>
              <p><em></em><br><strong>3) </strong>An
              abandonment is entirely your decision. You should base your decision on
              whether the game has become a farce or dangerous to the safety of the
              players. In a league or cup game at the top level, the procedure for
              calling a game off is to approach the ground commander, tell him that
              you are going to abandon, and then play on for a few minutes in order
              to allow the police and stewards to prepare the safe exit of
              spectators.<em></em></p>

              <p><em>Keith Hackett's official answers:</em><br><strong>1) </strong>Don't
                  join in the dancing - you must end this idiocy quickly. I would walk
                  towards the two players, then stop halfway and request that they join
                  me, which would put an immediate stop to the dancing. When I had their
                  attention, I'd warn them in no uncertain manner that they were a
                  disgrace and damaging the image of the game - and that if they did it
                  again, they'd been booked for unsporting behaviour.</p>
              <p><br><strong>2)</strong> Book him for unsporting behaviour. Goalkeepers attempting to extend
                  their vision of their goal in this way is a problem. Many years ago I
                  was at one of my local grounds Stockbridge Works whose groundsman Big
                  Jack took great pride in the state of the field of play. The first
                  thing he'd do on a match day was go to the dressing rooms and make it
                  very clear that any goalkeeper marking his pitch in this way would do
                  so at his peril. At one particular game, he was so annoyed to see a
                  goalkeeper ignoring his rule, taking huge divots out of the pitch, that
                  Big Jack intervened in the half-time team talk to give the keeper a
                  firm final warning. When the keeper then did it again in the second
                  half, Big Jack strode onto the pitch and, with a straight right-hand
                  punch, knocked the keeper spark out. He always regretted getting into
                  trouble - but he'd always remind me of the story whenever I visited
                  Stockbridge.</p>
              <p><br><strong>3)</strong> Yes, give the goal. You would already have inspected the <br>headgear at half time and approved it as safe and legal.</p>

              <p><em>Keith Hackett's official answers:</em><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>1)</strong> No. Only the referee can officiate and apply the laws of the game. The
              captain does not decide how you referee the game and therefore his
              request would be denied. <strong>Keith Hackett:</strong> I would also suggest that he gets on with playing the game and leaves the business of officiating to you. <em></em></p>
              <p><br><strong>2)</strong> Dismiss the goalkeeper. He has clearly committed a serious offence from
              which his team have benefited and, given the circumstances, his actions
              have denied an obvious goal scoring opportunity, so he must be shown
              the red card. Have the defending team choose someone to take over in
              goal and re-start play with an indirect free kick at the point inside
              the penalty area where he dropped his shorts.<em></em></p>
              <p><br><strong>3)</strong> Again you must dismiss the goalkeeper. However, as with the previous
              circumstances a team must have a goalkeeper and so, before restarting
              play, another player needs to go in goal and put on a distinguishing
              coloured jersey. Otherwise the game would have to be abandoned. Having
              blown for the initial offence on the goalkeeper you would restart play
              with a direct free kick to the defending team. <em></em></p>

              <p><em>Keith Hackett's official answers:</em><br><strong>1) </strong>As
              everyone spotted - trick question: there's no limit to the amount of
              time you can add on. I'd pull the captain over and make him and
              everyone else aware that I would be staying until midnight to make sure
              the right amount of added time was played. If players continued to
              waste time, I would continue showing yellow cards and dismissing any
              repeat offenders. I'd also make it very clear to the captain that if
              this behaviour continued and his team went down to seven men as a
              result of my red cards, the game would be abandoned and he and his team
              would be reported to the authorities.</p>
              <p><br><strong>2)</strong> Allow
              play to continue - do not award an offside. Wait until the ball
              eventually goes out of play - for a goal, a throw, a corner, etc - and
              then book the goalkeeper for leaving the field of play without
              permission.</p>
              <p><br><strong>3)</strong> Because the sub hasn't entered the
              field of play before taking the kick. A substitution isn't complete
              unless the player has entered the field at the halfway line. The fourth
              official manages this process to ensure the law has been complied with.
              An alert referee would have intervened sooner in this situation to stop
              the player taking the corner.</p>

              <p><strong>1)</strong> Award a penalty and caution (yellow card) the defender for the reckless
              challenge. It's not a red card for denying an obvious goalscoring
              opportunity because the tackle came after the shot, which was not on
              target. And while the ball may be dead now, it's not too late to
              penalise the offence, which happened while play was live. <br><em></em><br><strong>2) </strong>Although
              the player is temporarily off the field he is considered to be on the
              goalline for the purpose of this law. He's in an offside position and
              has become active, so your assistant's offside flag is correct. <br><em></em><br><strong>3)</strong> Although the player has been off the field for 15 minutes, there's
              nothing in the laws to prevent him coming back on. It's a similar
              situation to a player who is off the field receiving lengthy treatment
              for an injury. So, however unusual the situation may seem, allow him
              back on. <em></em></p>

              <p><strong>1)</strong> It may be obvious to everyone that it's a clean goal, but in law, you
              cannot give it: the moment the lights fail the ball is dead and play is
              considered to have stopped. Restart the game with a dropped ball. You
              should later report the incident to the authorities. At Uefa level all
              clubs must have an alternative electricity supply in place, which is
              confirmed before matches by the Uefa delegate. <br><em></em><br><strong>2)</strong> The law states that the throw must be taken "from the point where it
              left the field of play" – and as the ball did not leave play on the top
              of a nearby hill, you should intervene before the player starts his
              run, and ask him to take it from the correct position. If he did take
              it before you intervened, you should award a foul throw, giving the
              throw to the opposition. <br><em></em><br><strong>3)</strong> Send him to the stands. When a player is sent off he is not allowed to
              take part in the game again, even as a manager. He should not be
              allowed to stand either at the side of the pitch or in the technical
              area. <br><em></em></p>

              <p><strong>1) </strong>Order
              the kick to be re-taken. As soon as the goalkeeper moves off his line
              you must be ready to act. Base your decision on the outcome of the
              kick. If the kick is scored, award the goal. If it is missed, as in
              this scenario, award a re-take.</p>
              <p><em></em><br><strong>2)</strong> His team now has only two substitutions remaining. They could have
              replaced the striker immediately, before you signalled for kick-off, in
              which case they would have been allowed to nominate another substitute.
              But they left it too late.</p>
              <p><em></em><br><strong>3)</strong> Award the goal, and tell the home manager to cool down. Explain clearly
              that the law has not been broken. The assistant is allowed to run
              inside the touchline. However, they are advised not to, because it
              looks untidy and can interfere with play – it's not good practice, so
              you should also have a word with your assistant and agree on where he
              should run. <br><em></em></p>
