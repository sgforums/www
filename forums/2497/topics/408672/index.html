            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually I feel this Kuyt has been a good player for Pool over the last few seasons... He may not be the most skilful player there but at least he is good enough. And to me, he is the most hardworking one in their squad. Not Gerrard, not Torres and not even Carragher... His never give up attitude during matches, running, chasing for everything has been a plus point for them... I am not suprise Rafa has come back for him given his work rate. I guess Pool will only miss his type of play after he leave...</p></div>

              <p><br>He may not be the best finisher but he hardly plays as a striker that's one of the reason... He is always used as a right-winger who helps out in defense a lot more than most other right-wingers do... His chasing and running at the front and back throughout the match is admirable...</p>
              <p>Later if we get to see Joe takes over the right wing position, My goodness, we will see the difference... The dream partnership for defensive disaster... Glen Johnson and Joe Cole... lol.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROY HODGSON last night insisted Inter Milan had pulled out of their bid to sign Javier Mascherano.</h2>
              <p>And that has left the Argentine hardman facing at least another six months at Anfield - despite slapping in a transfer request.</p>
              <p>Mascherano wants out of Liverpool as his wife has failed to settle in England, and former Kop boss Rafa Benitez was keen to take him to Serie A.</p>
              <p>Inter Milan chief Benitez also wanted to raid his old club for Dirk Kuyt - yet now Hodgson has revealed the Italian giants' president Massimo Moratti has told him they will not be trying to sign any Anfield stars.</p>
              <p>The Reds chief claimed: "I spoke to Moratti on Wednesday about the fact they are not going to buy Liverpool players, and Dirk comes into that category doesn't he?"</p>
              <p>Kuyt's agent Rob Jansen is still claiming Inter want the Dutch striker, although Hodgson shot that down by insisting: "It is just not true."</p>
              <p>But one man who is leaving is £20million crock Alberto Aquilani, who is being lined up for a season-long loan to either Juventus or Napoli in Serie A.</p>
              <p>Hodgson admitted: "Last year he hardly played. If he has another like that, his value will be vastly diminished, but most importantly he'll be unhappy.</p>
              <p>"If he gets regular games it gives him the football he needs and protects the value of the player - but we're doing it with a view to bringing him back."</p>
              <p><strong>FK RABOTNICKI</strong> have been fined £8,000 following the racist abuse Liverpool's players faced during the Reds' 2-0 Europa League win in Skopje last month.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIRK KUYT has stunned Liverpool by admitting: I want out.</h2>
              <p>The Dutch star is desperate to join his old Kop boss Rafa Benitez at Inter Milan in a £13million move.</p>
              <p>But new Anfield manager Roy Hodgson rapped Benitez for reneging on an agreement not to poach his old favourites.</p>
              <p>Kuyt's agent Rob Jansen said: "The clubs continue to talk but Dirk has told Liverpool he no longer wants to be involved as this is something that regards his career and life.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't mean he wants to leave at all costs but when a club like Inter comes along it's normal to look into it further."</p>
              <p>Hodgson is already facing a losing battle to hang on to Javier Mascherano, with Inter faxing a £20million offer yesterday and Barcelona also in the hunt.</p>
              <p>And the new Anfield boss blasted: "When Benitez left the club he signed an agreement that he would not poach players from Liverpool and I think that still applies.</p>
              <p>"As far as I'm concerned, the agreement with Inter president Massimo Moratti still stands.</p>
              <p>"We have not received an offer from any club for Dirk Kuyt, this is obviously something going on behind the scenes with the agent talking to possibly the manager of Inter.</p>
              <p>"Two things. One, we don't welcome an offer and two, we haven't received an offer.</p>
              <p>"At this late stage in the transfer window it would be remarkably unusual for us to accept an offer for a player we don't want to leave for money we don't need.</p>
              <p>"I need the player, not the money. We have not received an offer and Dirk hasn't told me he'd want to leave if one came in."</p>
              <p>Hodgson left Mascherano out of the defeat at Manchester City and he is not involved against Trabzonspor tonight.</p>
              <p>Hodgson conceded Barcelona are favourites to land the Argentine. He added: "I don't want to force him on to the field that might make his transfer difficult. On Sunday I'll know one way or another if he's going to be here or at Barcelona."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIRK KUYT pledged his future to Liverpool - and celebrated with the goal which clinched their Europa League survival.</h2>
              <p>The Dutch winger has been chased by Inter Milan and even his own agent insisted he was tempted to cut and run.</p>
              <p>But after scoring against Turkish side Trabzonspor, he revealed: "I like it here and want to stay and win things.</p>
              <p>"A lot of people have said a lot of things about my future but, for me, it is at Liverpool."</p>
              <p>Kuyt's pledge capped a tricky night for Kop boss Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>The Anfield side were lucky to be only 1-0 down at the break after Kuyt lost possession.</p>
              <p>Hodgson admitted: "There has been no offer for Dirk. Dirk is not for sale and I never doubted he would be staying.</p>
              <p>"If we'd have lost the game 1-0 you'd probably have said he was playing for a move because he cost us the first goal.</p>
              <p>"But he recovered well from his early mistake. And as far as I'm concerned he is someone I believe in and count on.</p>
              <p>"We were looking down the barrel here but this result will stand us in good stead for the coming season."</p>
