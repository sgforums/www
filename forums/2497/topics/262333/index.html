            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has hit back at 'history' taunts from Liverpool's fans by pointing out that they have not scooped the title in 17 years.</strong><br><br>The Reds have an impressive record in the league throughout their history - winning the title no less than 18 times - although their last came back in the 1989-90 season.<br><br>While Chelsea's quest to land the UEFA Champions League has eluded them of late, Mourinho has stated at least they have won two of the last three Premiership titles whereas Liverpool have emerged empty handed.<br><br>Mourinho is undeterred in his resolve to make Chelsea champions of Europe and the successful Portuguese tactician is pleased his troops are heading in the right direction.<br><br>"Liverpool fans can continue to chant 'no history' at us but we continue to make it," Mourinho told the club's official magazine. "They have their history, we have our history.<br><br>"They are a club with a history in Europe that Chelsea doesn't have, and their history is magnificent, but I think for 17 years they don't win one championship and we won two in the last three years.<br><br>"Of the 12 pieces of silverware in English football in the last three years, Chelsea won six, Liverpool two, Manchester United two and Arsenal two, so we won the same number of pieces of silverware that the other three clubs won all together. So I think we are going in the right direction.<br><br>"The FA Cup final was a special final, an historic one, more than a normal FA Cup final. It was also the end of a period when in three years, we won every competition in English football, so it was special.<br><br>"In the future a lot of people will do it but I was the first manager to lift the FA Cup at the new Wembley; John Terry was the first captain to lift it and so on.<br><br>"At that moment we made history and the way people celebrated was magnificent. A few days later I was in London and I could feel also for the fans the feeling was special. After two Premierships and two Carling Cups before, I think at the moment we won't change this FA Cup for anything."</div>
