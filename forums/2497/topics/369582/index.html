              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> is ready to hand Yuri Zhirkov a debut tonight against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">AC Milan</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The game in Baltimore, a 72,000 sell-out, will prove an emotional
              occasion for Ancelotti as he confronts the club whom he managed for
              eight years and steered to two European Cups.</p>
              <p>"Zhirkov is working very well now," said the Italian. "He can play against Milan for the first time for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.
              I will give him this opportunity to play with us. For me, he's a new
              player and a very good player. We can use his quality for our team. He
              will play.</p>
              <p>"I knew this game was coming and I'm excited by it. For sure,
              it's not a normal game for me. Playing against Milan, where I was
              coaching for eight years, is a different thing for me. But I want to
              stay with my mind on my team because it's an important moment now. We
              have to improve and I want to know how this team can play."</p>

              <h1>Zhirkov's Debut Goal Sees Chelsea Past Milan</h1>
              <h2>Yuri Zhirkov had a dream Chelsea debut, scoring the winner as Chelsea beat Milan 2-1 in Baltimore...</h2>
              <div><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chelsea 2-1 AC Milan</strong></span><br></div>
              <p><br>Yuri Zhirkov scored the winner on his debut, as Chelsea ran out 2-1 winners over Milan.<br><br>The
              last time these two sides met was in a friendly last summer, when a
              horror show from Zeljko Kalac contributed to a 5-0 romp from Chelsea.
              The Australian keeper was back between the sticks this time, and he was
              in action soon, saving a pile-driver from range from Frank Lampard.<br><br>It
              was all Chelsea in the early stages, and it was no surprise when the
              goal came after just six minutes, and it was worth the price of entry.
              Picking the ball up more than 30 yards out, Didier Drogba unleashed an
              unstoppable shot that went flying into the top right hand corner,
              leaving Kalac with no chance. <br><br>Milan began to earn a bit more
              possession after conceding, but they were struggling to create any
              genuine chances. They did come close on 18 minutes, when Andrea Pirlo's
              shot from range was well saved by Petr Cech's outstretched left foot,
              while Ronaldinho's overhead kick from the rebound bounced out off Marco
              Borriello. <br><br>Chelsea were content to sit back and counter, and
              they were getting plenty of encouragement from Kalac's antics in goal.
              Having nearly made a complete mess of an attempt to tackle Nicolas
              Anelka, once in the box and once way outside of it, he then managed to
              fumble a seemingly routine cross, but luckily escaped unpunished on all
              three occasions. <br><br>Just before the half-hour, Milan had their
              best chance of the match, when a 1-2 between Clarence Seedorf and
              Alexandre Pato resulted in a sublime chip from the Dutchman, which was
              cleared off the line by John Terry. <br><br>After a frantic start, the
              game had slowed down somewhat, but on 35 minutes, a scything challenge
              from Mathieu Flamini on Jon Obi Mikel earned him a yellow card, a rare
              occurrence for a friendly. <br><br>On 37 minutes, just when the match
              was looking for some inspiration after a brief lull, it was provided by
              Seedorf. Ronaldinho laid the ball up for him just outside the box, and
              he unleashed an strike to match Drogba's earlier effort, as Cech
              helplessly watched the ball sail into the top-right hand corner. <br><br>Chelsea
              almost fought back instantly, when Drogba's ball across the six-yard
              box found Yuri Zhirkov, who was denied by Kalac's trailing leg. <br><br>That
              was the last chance of an exciting first half in which Milan dominated
              possession, while Chelsea created the best chances, and both sides
              deserved to be level thanks to two spectacular strikes. <br><br>Unusually
              for a friendly, neither team made a change at half-time. Chelsea were
              inches away from reclaiming the lead almost immediately, when Anelka
              slid his shot just past the far post after being put through by Drogba.
              <br><br>Seconds later, Seedorf nearly produced an early contender for
              goal of the season. Playing the ball into Ronaldinho, the Brazilian
              produced a phenomenal first time back-heel back into Seedorf's path.
              but the Dutchman's lob flew just wide.<br><br>It was certainly an
              intense start to the second period, and Kalac was being kept busy again
              as Lampard tested him out with another long range effort. Branislav
              Ivanovic then got booked for a challenge that might have seen him off
              in a competitive encounter, and Ronaldinho's free-kick flew wide. <br><br>On
              the hour mark, Carlo Ancelotti made his first substitution, replacing
              Anelka with AndriyShevchenko. Meanwhile, Seedorf, who had just picked
              up a knock to the knee, was replaced by Ignazio Abate. The changes were
              now starting to increase, with Oguchi Onyewu and Gianmarco Zigoni
              replacing Nesta and Borrielo respectively. <br><br>With twenty minutes
              remaining, Chelsea took the lead once more. Shevchenko cut in from the
              left and saw his shot saved, while Lampard's rebound was also blocked. 
              However, the ball came out to Zhirkov, who fired a low strike in at the
              near post. <br><br>The Rossoneri continued to make their changes, with
              Gennaro Gattuso now replacing Pirlo. Marek Jankulovski then took
              Zambrotta's place, while Drogba was withdrawn for Claudio Pizarro. <br><br>Milan
              now almost had a new XI by this stage, with Davide Di Gennaro replacing
              Ronaldinho, and Filippo Inzaghi taking Pato's place. <br><br>With ten
              minutes remaining, Milan did not look likely to equalize, as the new
              introductions tried to settle into the game. Inzaghi did attempt an
              ambitious bicycle kick, but he failed to connect properly and the ball
              simply floated out of play. <br><br>On 85 minutes, Zhirkov's succesful
              debut came to an end, as he was replaced by Michael Mancienne. Just
              before full time, Jose Bosingwa was withdrawn for Sam Hutchinson.<br><br>Just
              when it seemed as though the game was petering out to its inevitable
              conclusion, Inzaghi got a trademark header in from the six yard box,
              which was spectacularly tipped over by Cech. Onyewu then headed wide
              from a late cross, as Chelsea hung on to claim the victory.</p>
