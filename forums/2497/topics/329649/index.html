              <p><em>Robinho will not be the last player to snub Chelsea</em></p>
              <p> </p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">IAN WRIGHT believes Robinho will not be the last player to snub Chelsea for Manchester City. Robinho turned his back on the Blues to make a shock £32.5million move to Eastlands after the Abu Dhabi United Group took control at City. And Wright reckons Roman Abramovich should get used to seeing his top targets opt for Manchester over London.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Arsenal legend said: "Abramovich could get whoever he wanted but now City can just come in and say, 'Excuse me, we want him'. "They can put the same money on the table and it's a wake-up call to Chelsea because someone else has joined the party who can flex their muscles. "It does show that for a lot of players it is all about the money but if they come with the same quality and potential as Robinho, I can't see the problem.</p>
              <p class="article">"A lot of players have joined Chelsea for precisely that reason and the fact they're in the Champions League. "I'm sure once City get to the point where they can offer that too, they're going to attract even more star players. "I think we're seeing the beginnings of another Chelsea."</p>
              <p class="article">Wright also believes Robinho, 24, will make an immediate impact at City after fighting his way out of Real Madrid. He added: "Robinho knows what he wants and in no uncertain terms told Madrid that he wanted to leave. "That takes balls and self-belief so I think that alone shows he will make an impact.</p>
              <p class="article">"I think at the end of the day Madrid were relieved that it was anybody but Chelsea. "He's a very, very good player and is headstrong. That might cause a problem for Mark Hughes somewhere along the line but I think the world's his oyster.</p>
              <p class="article">"You don't know who City are going to attract next off the back of Robinho. "But now they can match Chelsea pound for pound, I think a lot of players are going to want to go there."</p>

              <p>Roman used to have the power that he can just buy anyone he wants but now with this sheikh, he is being outmuscled. What do you think will be Roman's reaction to this? I have this feeling he is gonna pull out of Chelsea soon.. Bcos if he fights on, its a losing battle for him.. He will just have to fork out more money which is no point because the sheikh easily owns him..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let's say if Roman pulls out, is Chelsea a self-sustainable club? Can they afford their mega stars wages by themselves? Can they afford to give pay rises in order to keep their stars? Players like Drogba staying?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Views? This is so gonna be interesting.. A possible Leeds could be on the way..</p>

              <p>Players go to Chelsea for the money and a quick shot at glory. Big players also go to Man U, Liverpool and Arsenal for those reasons and also, (the difference here) the clubs' pedigree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think along the likes of Real Madrid, AC Milan and Bayern Munich etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
