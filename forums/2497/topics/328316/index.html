              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Chelsea have confirmed Andriy Shevchenko will
              rejoin AC Milan subject to passing a medical on Monday - but the terms
              of the deal are "private".</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>A return to Milan has been speculated upon
              during much of Shevchenko's two years at Stamford Bridge and the Blues
              confirmed on Saturday night he will make the move back to the San Siro.</p>
              <p>However, Chelsea and Milan have not yet disclosed details of
              the transfer or confirmed whether the switch is a permanent move or
              loan switch.</p>
              <p>The Blues signed the Ukraine international in the summer of
              2006 but he failed to live up to his reputation as the world's finest
              striker.</p>
              <p>The 31-year-old scored just four league goals in the 2006-07
              campaign and five last season as injuries and form undermined his
              impact in west London.</p>
              <p>Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani told his club's television channel Shevchenko will undergo a medical on Monday.</p>
              <p>"After a series of frantic phone calls during the day today, we have reached an agreement with Chelsea," he told Milan Channel.</p>
              <p>"Andriy returns to the Rossoneri, tomorrow he will be in Milan,
              Monday he will undergo a medical, then he will sign a contract and from
              Tuesday he will be available to Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>"We succeeded in bringing home the player who in the last 50 years has scored the most goals in our shirt.</p>
              <p>"President (Silvio) Berlusconi and I am happy, as is our coach and I believe also our players.</p>
              <p>"I believe that Milan are the only club in the world to have three European players of the year in our squad."</p>
              <p>Galliani added: "Andriy has returned home and I am happy about it. I am a Milan fan and I am very happy.</p>
              <p>"I've spoken to Andriy 48 times in the past three hours...the terms of the agreement are very private.</p>
              <p>"Between today and tomorrow Andriy will be at Milan and he will start again his life as a Milan player.</p>
              <p>"Andriy made a mistake in leaving and I believe that in the past two years he has realised that this is his home.</p>
              <p>"Now he has made his financial sacrifices but at this point the only thing that matters is that he returns to us."</p>

              <p><br>Err... like you said "usually"... But this is not your usual situation... These are players on super high scale salaries and not your average joe earning 20 to 30k a week... Chelsea accepted the same conditions with Veron and Crespo too, paying part of their weekly salary while they were official still under contract to them and playing for the 2 Milan clubs...</p>

              <h1>Andrei Shevchenko will return to his best at AC Milan says Clarence Seedorf</h1>
              <h2>AC Milan midfielder Clarence Seedorf believes Andrei Shevchenko will be able to put his Chelsea nightmare behind him and get back to his world-beating as he returns to the San Siro.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/00795/shevchenko_795661c.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Shevchenko, 30, had two disappointing years at Stamford Bridge after a £30million move from Milan but sealed a return to Serie A when the clubs agreed a season-long loan deal on Saturday – though it is still subject to a medical.</strong></p>
              <p>Seedorf played with the Ukraine striker for four seasons at Milan and believes he will prove his doubters wrong as he returns to the scene of his greatest triumphs.</p>
              <p>"Andrei will certainly be very motivated and he will have the desire to demonstrate that he is not that which we have seen in London and that he is a true footballer," Seedorf said.</p>
              <p>After losing out on Shevchenko, Roma have been linked with Chelsea winger Florent Malouda.<em>Gazzetta dello Sport</em> report that the <em>Giallorossi</em> are hopeful of signing the France international before transfer deadline day.</p>
