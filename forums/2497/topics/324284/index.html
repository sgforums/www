              <p class="articleHeading"><em>Bentley a £17m deal from Blackburn</em></p>
              <p class="articleHeading"> </p>
              <div style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">
              <p class="introcopy"><strong>TOTTENHAM have begun a £50million-plus spending spree with the money they expect to recoup from selling strikers Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="font-size: 12px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <div>With Berbatov set to join Manchester United in a deal that could be worth up to £30m, and Keane desperate to make a £20m switch to Liverpool, Spurs are already assigning which players the cash will be spent on. They have agreed a £17m deal for Blackburn and England midfielder David Bentley that will see the Ewood Park club receive around £12m plus goalkeeper Paul Robinson.</div>
              <div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div>
              <div>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is understood to have had talks with Blackburn supremo John Williams yesterday to finalise the transfer. And Tottenham have registered an interest in Blackburn’s £12m-rated striker Roque Santa Cruz, who has also been identified as a potential target by rivals Arsenal if they lose Emmanuel Adebayor.</div>
              <div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div>
              <div>Santa Cruz, who scored 19 Premier League goals in his debut season with Blackburn, is well aware he is being looked at by Spurs and Arsenal, and has not ruled out the possibility of a move. “Of course I am motivated by the interest of other clubs, but I am used to this now,” he said. “I am happy for the great season I had and the important goals I scored for a small club, but if I do not leave, the plan is to have a better season with Blackburn.”</div>
              <div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div>
              <div>Should Tottenham miss out on Santa Cruz, they could turn to Spartak Moscow’s Roman Pavlyuchenko as a direct replacement for Berbatov. Sporting director Damien Comolli was in Moscow over the weekend to watch Pavlyuchenko in action. He failed to get on the scoresheet and was substituted in Spartak’s 5-1 defeat to CSKA.</div>
              <div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div>
              <div>Having already lined up a £9.5m move for Espanyol forward Luis Garcia, Comolli also made an enquiry about Pavlyuchenko’s Russia international team-mate Andrei Arshavin. Arshavin’s agent, Dennis Lachter, is planning to fly to England this week and is prepared to meet Spurs officials. But Arshavin is desperate to join Tottenham’s rivals Arsenal and has set his heart on playing in the Champions League next season. Zenit St Petersburg have put a £24m price tag on Arshavin and have rejected a £19m bid from an unnamed Premier League club. </div>
              <div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div>
              <div>Lachter is confident his client will eventually be allowed to move on for around £20m, but Spurs would have to smash their wage structure to meet his £4m-a-year demands. Tottenham have already splashed out around £30m on Luka Modric, Giovani dos Santos and goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes this summer.</div>
              <div><br class="webkit-block-placeholder"></div>
              <div>With Manchester United due to fly out for their tour of Africa this week, manager Sir Alex Ferguson spent much of yesterday in a meeting with chief executive David Gill, with Berbatov top of the agenda. If Keane also leaves, that gives Spurs a dilemma over what to do with third-choice striker Darren Bent, who is a target of both Sunderland and Everton. They had been expected to accept bids around £12m, but may now be wary of letting all three strikers leave.</div>
