              <p>England's dressing room invader branded the players a 
              "disgrace" after their 0-0 draw with Algeria.</p>
              <p>Pavlos Joseph’s shock appearance in the dressing room led news 
              bulletins in the hours after the desperate 0-0 draw with Algeria, widely
               condemned as England’s most shameful performance in years.</p>
              <p>“The crazy thing is I only went looking for the toilet,” <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> fan Pavlos, 32, from South-East 
              London, told the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>.</p>
              <p>“I walked round the outside of the stadium to meet my two cousins and 
              their dad who were at the opposite end of the ground. We’d arranged to 
              meet at a certain lamp-post on the stadium concourse. When they still 
              hadn’t arrived after half an hour, I started needing the toilet.</p>
              <p>“I found a security guard, who sent me off back along a walkway 
              underneath the stand out onto the pitch in the direction of the tunnel 
              and explained that there were toilets near there.</p>
              <p>“This was 45 minutes after the game had finished. There were a few 
              photographers packing up their stuff, there were six or so groundsmen 
              working on the grass and a dozen police doing a practice march, but 
              no-one else around.</p>
              <p>“I walked across the grass and up the players’ tunnel. Eventually, I 
              took a right, down a corridor and before I knew it I found myself in the
               dressing room. There was no door.</p>
              <p>“The next thing I knew, there was <abbr><span class="glossary-term">David Beckham</span></abbr> standing in front of me. He was stood
               up wearing his grey England three-piece suit, wandering around with his
               hands in his pockets and looking at the floor. I froze and looked round
               the room. I couldn’t believe where I was.</p>
              <p>“I saw <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Joe Cole</span></abbr> walk naked out of the shower a few feet 
              away from me. He glanced at me and then did a massive double-take. Then 
              David looked at me. His face seemed to drop. Everything seemed to happen
               in slow motion.</p>
              <p>"The room was dead silent. The players were sitting on benches with 
              towels round their waists just looking at me. They looked like they were
               in shock. No-one was moving. It was surreal. Suddenly David spoke. He 
              took a step towards me and said, ‘Whoa, who are you?’</p>
              <p>“At first I didn’t know what to say. I glanced around at everyone again 
              and then looked back at him. I said, ‘I’m Pavlos and I actually need the
               toilet.’</p>
              <p>“For a moment, no-one said a word. Then I thought, ‘What the heck. I’m 
              in the England dressing room. Why not say something?’. I looked David 
              straight in the eye. I said, ‘David, we’ve spent a lot of money getting 
              here. This is a disgrace. What are you going to do about it?’”</p>
              <p>He was met with stunned silence.</p>
              <p>Then Pavlos, whose Greek Cypriot mother and father Leo and run a fish 
              and chip shop in Crystal Palace where he was born, fixed the other 
              players in his gaze and said: "That was woeful and not good enough."</p>
              <p>“The room was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop. David’s face changed 
              as if he was going to say something back to me.</p>
              <p>“Then, just as quickly, the look turned to confusion and his mouth 
              closed. Straight away, a FIFA official in a suit was alongside me.</p>
              <p>“He told me I had to leave and led me out the way I’d come in. I didn’t 
              say another word to the players and I didn’t get an answer from Becks.”</p>

              charged with trespass</h1>
              <p>The fan who entered the England dressing room after Friday 
              night's <abbr><span class="glossary-term">World
               Cup</span></abbr> match has reportedly been arrested and charged with 
              trespassing, reports <em>The Guardian</em>.</p>
              <p>Media in South Africa said Pavlos Joseph will appear in court on 
              Sunday afternoon, but a spokesman for the South African Police Service 
              was unable to confirm the arrest and charge.</p>
              <p>Rich Mkhondo, spokesman for the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">World
               Cup</span></abbr> organising committee, said today: "I spoke to the police
               just before I came in here and they have interviewed the English fan 
              and they will be releasing a statement soon. We are addressing the issue
               and the police are working hard to investigate what happened.</p>
              <p>"They have studied the CCTV and they interviewed the English fan 
              yesterday and will issue a statement soon to clarify the next steps to 
              be taken."</p>
