              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Bentley driver: The Spurs winger scores against Arsenal... then does nothing</em></p>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"></h1>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">10 David Bentley</span></h1>
              <h2>Blackburn Rovers to Tottenham, July 2008, £15m</h2>
              <p>Bentley has scored just one goal since joining Spurs. It was a bit special and did come in a 4-4 draw with Arsenal, but other than that Bentley has contributed very little to Spurs’ campaign this season.  Certainly hasn’t justified his massive fee. </p>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"></h1>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">9 Alberto Luque</span></h1>
              <h2>Deportivo La Coruna to Newcastle, August 2005, £9.5m</h2>
              <p>After falling behind Michael Owen, Mark Viduka, Obafemi Martins and Alan Smith in the striking  pecking order at St James' Park he joined  Ajax after just  two years at the club.  Scored just once in 21 appearances at Newcastle.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/14/article-1181632-04EFF838000005DC-511_233x408.jpg" alt="Steve Marlet" width="233" height="408">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Cottage industry: But Steve Marlet didn't cut it at Fulham</em></p>
              </div>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"></h1>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">8 Steve Marlet</span></h1>
              <h2>Lyon to Fulham, August 2001, £11.5m</h2>
              <p>Fulham paid a club record fee for Marlet. But he struggled after fellow Frenchman Jean Tigana Craven Cottage as manager and ended up on an 18-month loan to Marseille.   </p>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"></h1>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">7 Jean-Alain Boumsong</span></h1>
              <h2>Rangers to Newcastle United, January 2005, £8m</h2>
              <p>Played just 18 times for Rangers before moving to Newcastle United. Having joined Rangers on a free transfer in July 2004, former Rangers manager Graeme Souness returned  to his old club to pay £8m for Boumsong. After a good start, Boumsong struggled and people quickly questioned the price Newcastle had paid Rangers for his services.  He joined Juventus 18 months later for less than half the fee paid to Rangers. Now at Lyon. </p>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"></h1>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">6 Massimo Taibi</span></h1>
              <h2>Venezia to Manchester United, August 1999, £4.5m</h2>
              <p>Often remembered for the horror goal he conceded to Matt Le Tissier. He played just four matches for Man Utd including a 5-0 defeat to Chelsea. United’s fans were delighted when he moved to Reggina after just one season.</p>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"></h1>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">5 Robbie Keane </span></h1>
              <h2>Tottenham Hotspur to Liverpool, July 2008, £20.3m</h2>
              <p>One of the biggest transfer flops in Liverpool’s history (and there have been a few over the years).  Keane signed a four-year contract with Liverpool in July but struggled to score goals. In fact it was November before he scored his first league goals for the club. After 19 matches and five goals for the club he supported as a child, he returned to Spurs.</p>

              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">4 Sergei Rebrov</span></h1>
              <h2>Dynamo Kiev to Tottenham Hotspur, June 2000, £11m</h2>
              <p>His time at White Hart Lane was regarded as a failure. He scored 10 in 60 appearances. Ended up signing for Fenerbahce on loan  before joining West Ham United on a free in July 2004.</p>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"></h1>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">3 Chris Sutton</span></h1>
              <h2>Blackburn Rovers to Chelsea, July 1999, £10m</h2>
              <p>After being relegated with Blackburn in 1998-99, Sutton joined Chelsea for £10m. He struggled at Chelsea, scoring one league goal in 28 matches.  After one season he was transferred to Celtic for £6m. </p>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"></h1>
              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">2 Francis Jeffers</span></h1>
              <h2>Everton to Arsenal, June 2001, £8m</h2>
              <p>Showed great potential at Everton.  Arsene Wenger paid £8m for Jeffers in 2001, but he ended up back on loan to Everton after a few seasons. Career has spiralled downhill since then and he’s now wearing No 9 shirt for Sheffield Wednesday.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/05/13/article-0-042E0172000005DC-386_468x309.jpg" alt="Chelsea's Andriy Shevchenko" width="468" height="309">

              <h1 style="color: #0cac0c;"><span style="font-size: large;">1 Andriy Shevchenko</span></h1>
              <h2>AC Milan to Chelsea, May 2006, £30m</h2>
              <p>After joining from AC Milan for a club record, Shevchenko scored Chelsea's goal in a 2–1 loss to Liverpool in Community Shield 2005. But he went on to score just nine in 47 matches for Chelsea.  Currently on loan back at AC Milan where he is yet to score in his second spell. Career has plummeted since he joined Chelsea. </p>

              <p><br><br><span style="color: #333332;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">10) David N'Gog (Paris Saint-Germain to Liverpool - £1.5m)</span></strong><br><br></span>When most people hear the name David N'Gog, they laugh. Try it now. Why is it so funny? It might be that some of a less cultured tongue pronounce it 'Enn-Gogg' - which admittedly has an amusing sort of sound to it - but the average football fan is far more likely to be baffled by just how the young striker ended up playing for Liverpool despite not being very good at playing football.<br><br>He is a young, tall and fast striker and didn't cost a lot. It was 'touch N'Gog' (<em><span style="color: #333332;">that's</span></em> how you say his name) over whether to even include him on the list - we could all yet be proven wrong - but thus far, the Frenchman has only succeeded at looking woefully out of his depth. And it's not as if he had even proven anything at the point Rafa Benitez snapped him up from PSG.<br><br>He has essentially become Fernando Torres' deputy at Anfield for several stretches this season, and upon failing to impress, is likely to be shunted down the pecking order this summer.</p>

He flopped at Tottenham last season and now at Portsmouth, a club so short of cash, he has failed to live up to his £6m billing (though the official fee remains undisclosed).<br><br>It seems, though, he may have at least found a home at Fratton Park. Maybe. Pompey don't quite have the money to throw away that Spurs do and thus they will want to get as much value out of their man as is possible.<br><br>He can hit a mean shot, and has grabbed a couple of headlines off the back of his big goals, but lest we forget he is a defender. He hasn't quite worked out that part of his game yet.</p>

              <p><br><br><span style="color: #333332;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">8) Dave Kitson (Reading to Stoke City - £5.5m)</span></strong><br><br></span>Dave Kitson was signed by Stoke for a club record transfer fee. He would be the bright spark of Premier League experience in front of goal to keep the Potters in the top flight.<br><br>Well, he's here, so suffice to say it didn't work out. The only thing bright about Kitson at Stoke was his hair, and he can't take credit for his genetics.<br><br>It's safe enough to say he's just not in the Stoke mould. He's something of a late bloomer, a classy striker and without doubt a good player, but Stoke are another type of team altogether. He didn't blend into his surroundings, to say the least.<br><br>He played 18 games and didn't score a single goal - and so he went back on loan to Reading. Even Steve Coppell managed to crack a smile and squeal out a laugh at this sorry state of affairs. Win-win.</p>

              <p><br><br><span style="color: #333332;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">7) Andrew Johnson (Everton to Fulham - £10.5m)</span></strong><br><br></span>Another striker, another club record signing and another one who has some kind of aversion to scoring goals. It goes without saying that if Fulham as a team hadn't been doing so well, then AJ would have found himself much, much higher up the list. Luckily for him, the Cottagers haven't had to score a lot to win.<br><br>He has worked hard and never looked completely out of his depth, but he may as well have been Steve Marlet. Bobby Zamora may not have scored a lot either, but he was half the price and has been considerably more valuable an outlet for the team all season. Make no bones about it: Johnson is a flop. He doesn't even have the time-honoured excuse of being a youngster and being able to grow into his talents.<br><br>The fact there was such a debacle over completing his signing after the medical scare should have been the sign that the usually shrewd Roy Hodgson needed to call off the deal, but he didn't. It will be interesting to see whether the Hodge is willing to swallow his pride and replace his big-money man this summer. After all, one transfer window of tremendous work from the experienced coach turned Fulham into a decent team - imagine what another could do?</p>

              <p><br><span style="color: #333332;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">6) Xisco (Deportivo La Coruna to Newcastle United - £5.7m)</span></strong><br><br></span>It's been quite a season on Tyneside. A power struggle of some description between former recruitment man Tony Jimenez, director of football Dennis Wise and part-time coach, part-time Messiah Kevin Keegan culminated in a comical beginning to this season (and it has since, like any good comedy, only gotten funnier).<br><br>Xisco was one of Jimenez's men, brought in for a fairly substantial amount of money and not given much of a fair shake. He's never been the best prospect in the world, or even close for that matter, but to end up fifth choice at the club, even behind Shola Ameobi, means you're doing something, somewhere, incredibly wrong.</p>

              <p><br><br><span style="color: #333332;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">5) Jo (CSKA Moscow to Manchester City - £19m)</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333332;"><strong></strong><br><br></span>Something about this move seemed wrong from the beginning. Right player, wrong club. He was never worth the reported £19m anyway, and following his bumpy start that found him in and out of the side, he was loaned out to Everton.<br><br>There, he is finding his feet, but David Moyes has already suggested he cannot afford to sign him, which suggests City will either be stuck with a player they don't want or taking a significant loss on him this summer when they sell him on. Big money, bad business<a id="KonaLink2" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2009/04/20/1218702/goalcom-special-10-worst-premier-league-transfers-2008-09"></a><span style="color: #1a2732;">- the two go hand-in-hand.<br><br>He's still young, but he will never be Drogba. Admittedly, his touch of Brazilian flair means that magic can be produced at any given moment, but for the most part he really is just your average Jo.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>4) Deco (Barcelona to Chelsea - £8m)</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong></strong><br></span><br><span style="color: #1a2732;">Many fancied themselves as real experts when Chelsea snapped up Deco from Barcelona. A real bargain. A top-quality flair player. Just what they need. The 'missing piece'.<br><br>They must have felt so proud of themselves two or three games into the season, while the Portuguese international was still fresh, fit and enjoying the sunshine. Consistency is another matter altogether.<br><br>The days are long gone that Deco can battle from one end of the season to another, and thus he was never, ever going to go the distance in the Premier League. He is what many in England would consider a luxury player. Quite why he snubbed Inter, a team he would have slotted into with far more ease, to join up with 'Big Phlop' Scolari is beyond pretty much everybody.<br><br>The funniest thing of all about the signing was Chelsea buying a third egotistical attacking midfielder for one position. Admittedly, Guus Hiddink has found a good place for Ballack alongside Lampard within his current setup, but there was never going to be a place for Deco. Not now, not ever - he should, if he has any sense, get out at the first available opportunity.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #339966;">3) Marlon: A King-Size Flop</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: #1a2732;">Roy Hodgson is still breathing a never-ending sigh of relief. Not only has he transformed Fulham from relegation battlers to Europa League contenders, but we can't forget that he was moments away from signing Marlon King, only for the big man to fail Fulham's notoriously stringent medical.<br><br>He is a powerful striker with one hell of a shot on him, but if you believe what you read, he'd much rather spend his time hitting women and only using his head to butt Dean Windass in a Scarborough </span><a id="KonaLink3" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2009/04/20/1218702/goalcom-special-10-worst-premier-league-transfers-2008-09"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; color: #0464d1! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; position: relative;">casino</span></span></a><span style="color: #1a2732;">. Football is an afterthought.<br><br>Wigan picked him up from Watford, Hull then loaned him from the Latics and after his disastrous spell there, he went down another rung to a hopeless Middlesbrough side.<br><br>Think of him as Stan Collymore without quite so much talent. Who knows where he'll end up next season, that is if he manages to stay out of jail.</span></p>

He has indisputable ability, but lacks the world class quality of his predecessor and doesn't seem to be progressing as many expected he would, either.<br><br>He signed for his supposed 'dream club', Tottenham, for a substantial initial fee of £15m and unless his goal of the season contender against Arsenal - the club that snubbed him as a youth and of course Spurs' greatest rivals - is worth all that, then he's still an unbridled flop. He has a lot more work to do.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #1a2732;"><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/09/240/Robbie-Keane_1210765.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #339966;">1) Robbie Keane (Tottenham Hotspur to Liverpool - £19m)</span><br></strong><br><span style="color: #1a2732;">Was Robbie Keane really Rick Parry's signing, or was that Rafa Benitez's last-ditch attempt at saving face once he realised his monumental error? When you think bad transfers, you generally tend to think Spurs. They're usually involved. But Liverpool fans will be cursing their luck for being on the wrong end of this one.<br><br>This was Rafa's fourth or fifth 'last piece of the puzzle' signing, the dream partner for Fernando Torres, a player of proven Premier League quality joining his dream club ... what went wrong?<br><br>Two words: Steven Gerrard. Benitez has finally found a system that puts Gerrard where he belongs - in attacking midfield - which is a system that only accommodates one striker, and that of course is Fernando Torres. It's true, Keane would be a dream partner for 'El Nino', but he can't compete with the club captain. It was never going to work. Stevie was never going to settle for right wing again (and why should he?) while Rafa wouldn't be quite so courageous as to put him in central midfield and risk over-exposing his side.<br><br>The only way Keane and Gerrard could have ever co-existed is if the Reds adopted a similar system to England, with the only problem there being that Keane, while good, isn't exactly Wayne Rooney when it comes to an all-round range of abilities, not to mention telepathic understanding with Stevie G.<br><br>It just wasn't meant to be, and humiliatingly, the Reds sold Keane back to Spurs in January, making a loss of anywhere between £6-8m. Oh well, there's always next year.</span></p>
