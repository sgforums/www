              <div>WITH cutbacks under way at Carrington, suddenly there is the threat of more 
              sweeping changes at Manchester United.</div>
              </div>
              <p class="byline"> </p>
              <div>
              <p>Not only are senior players under scrutiny, but other staff at Old Trafford 
              are operating under a cloud of suspicion.</p>
              <p>Key players - including Nemanja Vidic, Michael Carrick, Ben Foster and Nani - 
              are all playing for their futures.</p>
              <p>Off the field, chief operating officer Michael Bolingbroke has been 
              side-tracked, interviewing employees about events following a staff party at 
              the club's Red Café last month.</p>
              <p>Feelings are running high among the 700 people employed at the club, but that 
              won't get in Sir Alex Ferguson's way as he plans for the future of his 
              squad.</p>
              <p>The United manager is laying the groundwork for Serbian defender Vidic to 
              leave next summer by routinely monitoring the form of Palermo defender Simon 
              Kjaer.</p>
              <p>The Danish centre-half has a release clause in his contract with the Italians 
              worth £10million and is being primed for a move to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ferguson is also convinced Northern Ireland international Jonny Evans, despite 
              acknowledging his lack of pace, will emerge as a top-class central defender 
              alongside Rio Ferdinand.</p>
              <p>The United boss is concerned because the volatile Vidic is becoming 
              increasingly irritable, taking out his frustrations in training-ground 
              tackles on junior players.</p>
              <p>Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck have been on the end of some crude 
              challenges recently, part of an ongoing problem with Vidic identified in 
              training.</p>
              <p>Vidic's form has also dipped. He was sent off against Liverpool for the third 
              successive game last month and returned to the team yesterday only because 
              of injuries.</p>
              <h4><strong>Hairdryer</strong></h4>
              <p>Other players are also in the firing line, with Ferguson contemplating the 
              futures of Carrick, Foster and motormouth Nani.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-280"><img title="FOSTER: Spoke out of turn" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00067/foz_280x420_67354a.jpg" alt="FOSTER: Spoke out of turn">
              <div class="caption">FOSTER: Spoke out of turn</div>
              <div class="caption"><br></div>
              </div>
              <p>Goalkeeper Foster's relationship with Ferguson reached breaking point 
              following the 2-2 draw with Sunderland on October 3.</p>
              <p>The United chief launched into his full hairdryer treatment in the dressing 
              room after Foster's weak jump and mistake led to Kenwyne Jones' second-half 
              strike.</p>
              <p>Foster was immediately axed from the first team, replaced in goal by Edwin van 
              der Sar against Bolton and losing his status as No 2 to Tomas Kuszczak.</p>
              <p>It prompted a Foster outburst against Ferguson in the media, following his 
              appearance for England in the 1-0 loss to Brazil, and although he has 
              apologised for the controversial comments, Fergie is still furious with the 
              keeper.</p>
              <p>In his interview, Foster begged to be allowed to go out on loan to play 
              first-team football and preserve his World Cup dream, but Ferguson slammed 
              that door shut during talks last week.</p>
              <p>The United manager has made it clear that he will not tolerate any more 
              indiscreet comments from the keeper.</p>
              <p>He has been told he is staying at Old Trafford, and ordered to battle it out 
              with Kuszczak for the right to be van der Sar's understudy.</p>
              <h4><strong>Incendiary</strong></h4>
              <p>Under-performing midfielder Nani, who was expected to emerge from the shadow 
              of departing Cristiano Ronaldo this season, but has been a huge 
              disappointment, is another player in the firing line.</p>
              <p>While away on World Cup qualifying duty last week, the Portugal international 
              winger accused Ferguson of shattering his confidence.</p>
              <p>Like Foster, Nani apologised for his incendiary comments during a meeting with 
              the manager, but despite Ferguson's public backing, the tricky winger is 
              clearly in the danger-zone.</p>
              <p>Former West Ham and Tottenham midfielder Carrick is also uncertain of his 
              position, with old club Spurs retaining an interest in a deal involving 
              Croatia star Luka Modric heading for Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ferguson believes England international Carrick, who has scored just once for 
              United this season, should have more say in the centre of midfield.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-right-280"><img title="CARRICK: Needs to prove himself" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00067/carrick_shush_280x42_67352a.jpg" alt="CARRICK: Needs to prove himself">
              <div class="caption">CARRICK: Needs to prove himself</div>
              <div class="caption"><br></div>
              </div>
              <p>Carrick's role is just one of several vulnerable positions Ferguson has 
              pinpointed in the team, instructing his brother Martin to find replacements.</p>
              <p>Despite long-standing interest in Valencia playmaker David Silva, there is a 
              belief that he does not have the speed for the Premier League.</p>
              <p>Other positions being considered are at left back, where Ferguson wants an 
              understudy to the excellent Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>Despite showing promise after their move from Brazil, twins Rafael and Fabio 
              da Silva have failed to make the grade.</p>
              <p>Ferguson also wants another central midfielder next summer and a striker to 
              support Wayne Rooney.</p>
              <p>The United chief insists he will not spend big in the January transfer window, 
              claiming his targets are all being quoted "around the £50million mark".</p>
              <p>Ferguson said: "I am in the same position as I was in the summer. I don't see 
              any value in the market.</p>
              <p>"We get a million names thrown at us, all valued at £50million."</p>
              <p>Instead, he will wait until the end of the season before he twists the 
              Glazers' arms and demands sufficient spending power.</p>
              <p>That will be tough, with post-World Cup transfer fees notoriously high, but 
              Ferguson has promised his coaching staff he intends to rebuild the team 
              again.</p>
              <h4><strong>Redundancies</strong></h4>
              <p>There is also considerable uncertainty off the field, with redundancies and 
              cutbacks at United's Carrington training complex upsetting some staff.</p>
              <p>In addition, the club's chief operating officer turned his attention to more 
              pressing matters this week.</p>
              <p>Bolingbroke and the club's human resources department have been in overdrive, 
              interviewing staff about the events of Friday, October 23.</p>
              <p>The club is awash with rumours after a staff party at the Red Café ended when 
              some of them moved on to the Fantasy Bar in Manchester.</p>
              <p>Staff earning between £18,000-£20,000 are living in fear of the investigation 
              which centres on one high-ranking member of staff at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Officially the club insist that "what staff did after the party at Red Café is 
              of no concern to the club".</p>
