              <p>so what if owen is not willing to go back to liverpool and join man utd instead. he has the right do do so to turn his back. to each his own. He is being sore lar, like seeing an ex going out with a new guy, who happened to be someone he disliked.</p>
              <p>all he know is to whine and then comment that owen is a judas, like his like minded cronies and lackeys.</p>

              <h1>Liverpool's Glen Johnson Blasts Mourinho's Ethics At Chelsea</h1>
              <h2>Liverpool's shiniest left-back has a thing or two to say about his old boss...</h2>
              <p><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/51655_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="158"></p>
              <p><em>Johnson says he harbours no ill feelings towards his old boss and wonder what Mourinho thinks about what’s happened to him since he left Chelsea.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool's most expensive signing of the summer so far, Glen Johnson, has said that, during his time with Chelsea, then manager Jose Mourinho was less than honourable with the sought-after left-back.</strong><br><br>Asserting that the Portuguese gaffer told him 'a lot of things that weren’t true', Johnson cited one particular incident that happened during the games prior to the Blues facing Barcelona in the Champions League.<br><br>“We had a couple of games to play before the Barcelona match. Mourinho picked me for a game and told me in front of five witnesses that if I played well, I would keep the shirt,” <em><span style="color: #333332;">The</span></em> <em><span style="color: #333332;">Times </span></em>quote Johnson as saying.<br><br>“I immediately told my agent that it didn’t matter how well I played, I would be dropped because Mourinho wouldn’t want me anywhere near the team for the Barcelona game. Sure enough I was voted man of the match — and I was dropped from the squad. <br><br>"You would have to ask Mourinho what his reasons were but I know it was because he didn’t want to see me play well and be forced to pick me for Barcelona. That was the day I knew I had to leave Chelsea. Managers have to stick to their word. You have to be able to trust them.”<br><br>Johnson went on to say that he harbours no ill feelings towards his old boss and claims that his performances now speak for themselves.<br><br>“It gives me a lift when I wonder what Mourinho thinks about what’s happened to me since I left Chelsea. He never spoke to me about why I wasn’t playing. He probably thought I would go to Portsmouth, fade away, disappear and not do anything in the game — and probably 70% of football fans thought the same," he went on.<br><br>"I think I’ve proved my point as far as Mourinho is concerned. People, even Jose Mourinho, make mistakes.”</p>
