              <p>Whenever footballers, managers or supporters suggest their club needs
               new players, it is tempting to point out that recruitment can make 
              things worse, not better. As <em>ESPNsoccernet</em>'s worst 10 signings of the season show...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="mod-inline image image-right">
              <div style="margin-left: 10px; width: 275px;"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/2011/0427/talben-haimvnufc_275x155.jpg" border="0" alt="Tal Ben-Haim" width="275" height="155">
              <div style="width: 275px;"><cite></cite>Tal Ben-Haim joined his ex-Portsmouth manager Avram Grant at West Ham in July</div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong>10. Tal Ben-Haim</strong><br> Since excelling at Bolton, Tal Ben-Haim has managed the sort of sequence
               of underachievement that might be some kind of record. He has passed 
              through five Premier League clubs without impressing at any. West Ham 
              clearly ignored his immediate past when they borrowed the defender from 
              Portsmouth in August. What they got was a plummet to the foot of the 
              Premier League, not helped by Ben-Haim's form: his first five league 
              games produced just two points, while his last was a 5-0 hammering at 
              Newcastle.</p>
              <p><strong>9. Sebastien Squillaci</strong><br> When Arsene Wenger discarded his usual strategy by paying a sizeable sum
               (around £6 million) for a 30-year-old, the question was if the Arsenal 
              manager had ignored his youth policy for a good reason. Eight months 
              later, the answer appears not: Squillaci, unlike most Arsenal recruits, 
              has a lower resale value. But, more pertinently, he has not performed on
               the pitch. The centre-back appears especially incompatible with his 
              fellow Frenchman Laurent Koscielny - the Gunners' first five Premier 
              League defeats occurred when they were paired - and when Thomas 
              Vermaelen is eventually fit, will probably rank as the fourth-choice 
              central defender.</p>
              <p><strong>8. Alexander Hleb</strong><br> "Here you just need to fight, run, not too much passing," Alexander Hleb
               said. "This, for me, is something new." As Birmingham have rarely been 
              confused with Barcelona, what did he expect? And as Hleb appears the 
              antithesis of no-frills workaholics like Craig Gardner and Lee Bowyer, 
              what did the club imagine he would do? From the start, Birmingham and 
              Hleb were a marriage of convenience that was doomed to end in divorce: 
              he needed a club, they a flair player after Charles N'Zogbia's wage 
              demands ended a bid to bring him south from Wigan. It is unsurprising 
              that he rarely starts for Alex McLeish's side and, in its own way, just 
              as predictable that Birmingham's battling qualities, rather than Hleb's 
              skill, will keep them up.</p>
              <p><strong>7. James Milner</strong><br> A staple diet of unofficial awards is the choice of the most improved 
              player. Last year, it may well have been James Milner. This season, 
              however, Milner appears the prime contender for whatever the opposite 
              is: the player who has regressed most, perhaps. Factor in a £26 million 
              fee in an almost uniquely unsuccessful swap (Stephen Ireland, who went 
              to Aston Villa in the same deal, was another contender for this list) 
              and a player who was supposed to have cemented his arrival at the 
              division's top table instead seems to have made one of the misguided 
              moves of the year. No longer in the Manchester City team, he has only 
              played well on a handful of occasions, and one of those was his 
              valedictory appearance for Villa.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Roque Santa Cruz</strong><br> Blackburn's January quest for a galactico earned ridicule aplenty, and 
              rightly so. When David Beckham, Ronaldinho and Juan Roman Riquelme took 
              the utterly unexpected decisions that an offer from Ewood Park was one 
              they definitely could refuse, the returning Roque Santa Cruz became the 
              biggest name to arrive in East Lancashire. But fame isn't everything and
               Rovers' bizarre attempts at recruitment are backfiring. Santa Cruz is 
              yet to score since returning to the club who somehow pocketed £18 
              million when selling him to Manchester City; apart from one header that 
              hit the bar, he has rarely looked like finding the net. Predictably, he 
              has seldom appeared fit and his struggles are one cause of Blackburn's 
              descent down the table.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Mauro Boselli</strong><br> Wigan's low profile can be a benefit. At most of their rivals, rather 
              more questions would be asked about the failure of the club record 
              signing to muster a solitary league goal. Instead, Mauro Boselli 
              disappeared on loan to Genoa without too many noticing. Yet should 
              Wigan's six-year spell in the Premier League come to an end, the £6 
              million man's drought - incorporating a crucial missed penalty in a 
              potentially decisive defeat at West Ham - will be the major cause, 
              especially in a squad that lacks scoring strikers.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Christian Poulsen</strong><br> In a department of the Liverpool team where the recent alumni include 
              Xabi Alonso, Javier Mascherano and Dietmar Hamann while Steven Gerrard 
              and Raul Meireles are among the current competition, the standards are 
              high. To say Christian Poulsen fell short is an understatement. Anfield 
              has seen few less positive passers than the Dane and, while his long 
              association with Roy Hodgson was one explanation of his unpopularity, 
              Poulsen's performances were another. His first season on Merseyside 
              seems certain to end with youngster Jay Spearing ahead of him in the 
              queue for the central midfield places.</p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>3. Paul Konchesky</strong><br> Liverpool's summer business was so poor that they could fill much of 
              this list. In the end, unimpressive as they have been, there was no room
               for Joe Cole or Milan Jovanovic. So there was stiff competition for the
               title of the worst signing at Anfield, but Paul Konchesky is a 
              deserving winner. Quite how, having worked with Konchesky for 
              two-and-a-half seasons at Fulham, Roy Hodgson deemed him a Liverpool 
              player is a mystery, but the left-back's mistakes were a constant: 
              defeats at Stoke and Tottenham can be attributed to his errors. 
              Tellingly, Liverpool have looked far more secure with anyone else on the
               left of the defence.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Bebe</strong><br> The strangest signing of the season, Bebe continues to astonish. Not in 
              the right ways, however: utterly dismal displays in the Carling Cup 
              defeat at West Ham and the FA Cup win over Crawley provoke a sense of 
              surprise that anyone could deem him a Manchester United player. Sir Alex
               Ferguson, famously, had not seen the Portuguese winger before buying 
              him but he paid more for Bebe than he did for Javier Hernandez. Barring a
               remarkable improvement in the remainder of his United career, the 
              callow forward may go down as one of Ferguson's worst signings.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Fernando Torres</strong><br> The long wait was ended 14 games and 732 minutes into his Chelsea career
               when the most expensive player in the history of English football 
              finally scored. Yet the verdict on the £50 million man this season may 
              be that his signing cost Chelsea their chance of winning the Premier 
              League and the Champions League; it might inadvertently result in Carlo 
              Ancelotti's departure. Because, while Chelsea have generally fared 
              better with Torres on the bench, his move appears to have revitalised 
              Liverpool and caused his new club no end of problems.</p>

              <p>I agree with Joe Cole but not Carroll. He was injured when he joined Liverpool and the last injury, he was out for a game only! He has scored 2 goals so far...I know most strikers are just on their goals but Carroll has help to link up play upfront with his height..and create a fear factor when Liverpool having a corner.</p>
              <p>The owner has instructed to pay 15m lesser on what Liverpool can get for Torres. So if Torres fee was 60m, Carroll will be bought for 45m...simple as that. Also, those who write Torres off is just simply naive...am sure he will banging on lots of goals for Chelsea next season.</p>
