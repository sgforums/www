              <p><strong>God moves in mysterious ways. Theatrically, dramatically. Beautifully, brutally. Head held high, neck extended, shoulders back, spine straight, lips pursed. Chest heaving. Up, pause for effect, down again, air escaping His lungs, blowing sailboats to shore. A prelude, a performance, pulling the world towards Him before striking with great vengeance and furious anger. The hush became awe. Wonder. Let there be light, preferably a spotlight – and, lo, there was light! A flash and a thunderbolt scorched across the sky, ripping past Diego López. If Guti boasted the </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2010/feb/01/real-madrid-guti-heel-of-god"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>"heel of God"</strong></span></a><strong> as </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Real Madrid" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/realmadrid"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Real Madrid</strong></span></a><strong> finally won at Riazor three weeks ago, </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Cristiano Ronaldo" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/ronaldo"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong></span></a><strong> boasted His destructive power as they defeated Villarreal last night.</strong></p>
              <p>The Word of God is <em>the</em> word down Madrid's way. Iker Casillas has long been Saint Iker, "a fallen angel" with the hands of God. As one column-writing loon put it: <span style="color: #000000;">"</span><span style="color: #000000;">the day he came to earth, light shone upon his house like at the gate of Bethlehem when Christ was born</span><span style="color: #000000;">."</span> When David Beckham joined Madrid a particularly sycophantic suitor described him as "arriving barefoot, like Christ". And from the day Ronaldo took the same path, these most devout zealots have had him down as a candidate for beatification, his qualities exalted, his failings excused. Meanwhile, across the Spanish divide, Sport declared that Christ's address at the Sea of Galilee was, in fact, "a prophecy of Leo Messi". But this was something else. Something bigger. This was deification.</p>
              <p>Last night God Himself appeared before the Santiago Bernabéu. Shiny faced, oily-haired, pouting and dressed in a Madrid shirt but God nonetheless. "Yesterday," opens AS's match report, "Cristiano was not just Cristiano but the whole of Christianity." Marca's cover, meanwhile, declared: "God came dressed as CR9". </p>
              <p>The heel of God? Bah! The hands of God? So what?! Ronaldo has His creation, His omnipotence, His omnipresence. The whole package. Perfect teeth. Nice smell. A class act all the way. Today, Ronaldo <em>is</em> God. Not because, as in Richard Dawkins's famous description, he's the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it, petty, unjust, unforgiving, a malevolent bully, capricious and megalomaniacal. But because last night Ronaldo was omnipresent and all-powerful, the creator supreme, an irresistible force as Madrid hammered Villarreal 6-2 to go back within two points of Barcelona, climb above them in terms of goals scored and rack up a 12th win out of 12 at home. </p>
              <p>He was God because he "made" and scored the first, tumbling over and then belting in a free-kick so good, so quick, so vicious in its sudden dip, that one radio station began a search to find it a name to go with Cruyff Turns and Panenka Penalties. Because He created the third for Gonzalo Higuaín, racing down the right wing to slide a perfect first-time ball across. Because He laid the fifth on a plate for Kaká, wriggling through the challenges to leave the Brazilian one-on-one with López. And because He made the sixth for Xabi Alonso, cutting inside from the right and getting brought down for the penalty that He – very, very reluctantly and not without storming off the pitch in a strop at the end – let the former Liverpool midfielder take to score his first goal for the club.</p>
              <p>As one editorial inevitably put it, Madrid won and convinced – they managed to <span style="color: #000000;">"vencer" and "convencer"</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> which is still the task before them. Alonso played superbly, Marcelo terrified Villarreal every time he advanced and Higuaín got two more goals to give him 14, twice as many as Karim Benzema. But few noticed because last night was all about Cristiano Ronaldo; last night, he was everywhere and everything, dashing down the line, crashing to the turf, lashing at the ball, sprinting after lost causes, resuscitating moves, utterly engrossing, utterly all-encompassing. If Kaká belongs to Jesus, you could be forgiven for believing that the rest of the team belongs to Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was absolutely unbelievable; a whirlwind awarded four marks by AS. Out of three. Just before midnight in the cold concrete corridor of the stadium, a Villarreal player shook his head sadly and blew out his cheeks. "When he's playing like this," he said. "Ronaldo is completely unstoppable. Truly incredible." </p>
              <p>"His performance can be summed up in just one word," insisted one Tomás Guasch: "¡olé!" Raising his eyebrows, the Villarreal goalkeeper López used as many to describe the free-kick that set Madrid on their way: "whoosh!" El País's headline simply called Him a "colossus." Most, though, were using rather more words. "One day, he'll win the ball, cross it in and head it home himself," claimed El Mundo. "Apart from the absurd paraphernalia that accompanies his free-kicks, he was impeccable. As well as shooting, taking the free-kicks, building the plays and giving passes, Cristiano Ronaldo is also the one that folds up the shirts, cleans the boots and cuts the grass. The only thing left for him to do is man the ticket office," wrote Roberto Palomar in Marca, "Ronaldo did everything. His activity was such that his team-mates just get in the way."</p>
