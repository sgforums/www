Liverpool want to end the midfielder's West Ham nightmare by taking him on loan, even though he has already played for two clubs in the last 12 months. </strong><br><br>FIFA's rules forbid a player having three clubs in that time, but Liverpool launched an appeal to be allowed to sign Mascherano, who has played only five games for the Hammers - and none since November - since his controversial signing last summer, along with countryman Carlos Tevez.<br><br>Benitez, who takes his side to face West Ham at Upton Park tomorrow for a game crucial to both ends of the Barclays Premiership table, believes he will get his man in the end. Benitez said: "We are waiting for FIFA to make a decision, but even if that does not come before the deadline, I believe he will still be able to join us." It appears the only way that could happen then is if West Ham tear up his contract and make Mascherano a free agent. Benitez admitted: "That is an option."<br><br>The Liverpool boss added: "I hope he will join us, he has great experience. "We know the rule says he cannot play for three clubs, but he is unable to play at West Ham and we must take into consideration the law, and the law is more important than the rules. "He is unable to work at the moment, nobody can say you cannot work."<br><br>Benitez has trailed the midfielder since before last summer's World Cup, and said: "We were aware of the player when he was at River Plate, he was in the national team at 18. There is no doubt about the quality of the player. "He played well in the World Cup and he is a great professional with talent and quality.<br><br>"We have good midfielders in Alonso, Gerrard, Sissoko and Zenden, but the only holding midfielder is Alonso and the idea is to bring Mascherano here to put pressure on in that role. "If we sign him it will be on loan for one and a half years, at least. He is a good option and has the character and ability to do well in the Premiership. "We have an agreement, but we must wait for the FIFA decision. We hope that will come in the next two days, but if it does not we still believe we will be able to sign him."<br><br>He continued: "We are doing our best as a club to sort this out. FIFA need to do something before January 31. But if they do not, I still feel we can achieve what we want. "We talked to West Ham and had permission to talk to Mascherano, that says that he is not likely to play for them again.<br></div>

Mascherano, who was deemed not good enough for West Ham's relegation battle by Alan Curbishley, will be thrust into Liverpool's Champions League campaign instead.</strong><br><br>The signing is reward for Liverpool's patience. They hoped to sign the Argentine midfield powerhouse, 22, at the start of the transfer window, but have had to wait while lawyers have thrashed out a deal with UEFA and FIFA, because players aren't supposed to move clubs twice in a season. Mascherano has already played for Corinthians, as well as West Ham. The authorities finally agreed to cave in on the transfer and it will be announced tomorrow, on the final day of the transfer window.<br><br>Rafa Benitez last night saluted the signing. "We have an agreement to take him on loan for 18 months then we have an option to sign him permanently. "He is a top class player and played at the top level at the World Cup. We were monitoring him when he was with River Plate. The only question is whether he can play to his level in England, but I know he can play a lot better than he did at West Ham.<br><br>"We don't have another holding midfielder and this is a crucial time for us. We will play against West Ham, Everton, Newcastle, Sheffield United and Barcelona twice."<br><br>Mascherano made only three Premiership starts with West Ham, and seven appearances altogether. Benitez added: "Maybe Liverpool can be a better option for him because we can speak in Spanish to him and we play a different style of football that suits him better. Corinthians and River Plate are top sides in their countries and he is used to winning trophies. I think he will have more possibilities with us."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>New twist in Mascherano transfer</strong></span><br><br><strong>The Premier League is considering whether to allow West Ham's Javier Mascherano to join Liverpool. Mascherano's registration documents were sent to the Premier League before the transfer window closed. But a Premier League statement said it wants to "take time to satisfy itself with the proposed arrangements". </strong><br><br>"The Premier League can confirm that, in accordance with its rules, Javier Mascherano's registration documents were received from Liverpool FC prior to the transfer window closing," said the Premier League statement. "The board will consider the terms of the registration as quickly as possible and notify the parties involved of its decision accordingly."<br><br>Under Fifa's rules, a footballer cannot play competitively for more than two different clubs between 1 July and 30 June the following year. Mascherano, 22, has already represented Corinthians and West Ham in that time.<br><br>But Fifa said: "The Fifa single judge ruled that Javier Mascherano is eligible to play in official matches with Liverpool with immediate effect." In the statement Fifa explained its ruling was determined partly because the South American and European seasons overlap.<br><br>Mascherano has played only six minutes for West Ham since the defeat at Tottenham on 22 October and had been desperate to leave the club.<br></div>
