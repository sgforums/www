              <h1>Terry: Totally committed to Chelsea</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Terry18.jpg" alt="Terry18" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>LONDON
              - England captain John Terry said on Sunday he was fully committed to
              Chelsea and that leaving the London club was "never a possibility".</strong></p>
              <p>Terry had been a target for
              Manchester City, with local media speculating that they had offered him
              a salary of 200,000 pounds per week after making a bid of around 30
              million pounds.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old centre back and
              club captain remained silent on the issue despite City manager Mark
              Hughes regularly confirming his interest and British newspapers ramping
              up the speculation.</p>
              <p>He finally made a statement on
              the club's website on Sunday saying: "There has been a lot of
              speculation recently about my future and I want to clear this up once
              and for all.</p>
              <p>"I am totally committed to Chelsea and always have been.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea have also made it clear to me consistently that there was never any intention to accept any kind of offer.</p>
              <p>"When you are linked with any
              club, or with a manager who I have huge respect for, it will always
              make headlines but me leaving Chelsea was never a possibility.</p>
              <p>"I know there has been comment
              that I should have made a statement earlier. However, throughout this
              period there have been numerous discussions between myself, the owner
              and the Chelsea Board and we all agreed that the timing of any
              statement would suit everyone involved in those talks, not any outside
              influences or agendas.</p>
              <p>"What is clear to me following
              those discussions is that Chelsea's ambition remains as high as ever.
              This has been further proved by the appointment of (manager) Carlo
              Ancelotti. I am certain that he will take this club on to the next
              level.</p>
              <p>Terry joined Chelsea as a trainee in 1997 and is hugely popular with the west London club's fans.</p>
              <p>He had the chance to secure the
              Champions League title in 2008 but slipped and missed what would have
              been the decider in a penalty shoot-out against Manchester United, who
              went on to win it.</p>
              <p>Despite winning domestic
              honours galore, the Champions League is, probably because of his Moscow
              failure, desperately close to Terry's heart.</p>
              <p>"Another important factor was
              knowing that Chelsea would be securing key current players for the long
              term. The strengthening of the squad around this core is crucial to
              pushing us onto greater success," he said.</p>
              <p>"I am as committed as ever to helping drive Chelsea forward and I will be proud to lead the team for as long as I can."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said earlier this
              month that he considered the centre back to be a "symbol of the club"
              and that no price would be enough to take him from Stamford Bridge.</p>
