            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/images/PH2/sheva412.jpg"><br><br><span class="large"><strong>I've been made a scapegoat, insists Shevchenko</strong></span><br><br>Andriy Shevchenko says he has been made a scapegoat for Chelsea's current problems and is furious with reports suggesting he has become an unsettling influence at the club. The Â£30million Ukrainian striker has been disappointing in his first season at Stamford Bridge and after missing the last two matches with a muscle strain, is vying for a recall against Liverpool at the weekend.<br><br>But Shevchenko, 30, told the Times: 'I am being made a scapegoat for things that have nothing to do with me. 'I have been attacked from all sides but I intend to carry on. I will grit my teeth. I am not a quitter I just want to be kept out of the politics.'<br><br>Shevchenko also rejected reports that he is a dressing-room 'spy' of owner and friend Roman Abramovich. He told ESPNsoccernet: 'This is not true. I'm just one player, I'm part of the team like all the others and I don't think this is true at all.'<br><br>'I've got the same relationship [with Abramovich] as other Chelsea players, I'm just one player in the team, and I've got the same relationship as all the other players have.'<br><br>The former AC Milan player has shrugged off suggestions that there is tension between him and boss Joe Mourinho and insists he would accept any decision the Portuguese manager made.<br><br>He added: 'I highly respect him as a manager. 'Mourinho is a great manager. He has showed how much he's worth by winning so many titles,' he adds. 'He has won many titles, but I cannot judge him either as a coach or as a person because I haven't known him for long enough.<br><br><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/images/JonMC/October%202006/shev-woe-275.jpg"><br><br>Shevchenko feels he has acclimatized to London, but his on-pitch performances have not been up to scratch and he has come under intense pressure to find the net.<br><br>'It's hard to judge my performance,' he says. 'The year is not over yet. So far I have not been at my optimum level, I need time but I'm working as hard as I can. 'I need more time, I need time to fit in, I played for another team, for a long time and now I've come to a new team. I need time and luck as well.'<br><br>Shevchenko however has now decided to stop talking to the English media - unless asked to do so by the club. He declared: 'There have been a lot of quotes coming out from me that I don't even know where they've come from.<br><br>'They have caused a lot of hurt to me and my family. From now on other than sanctioned club press conferences all my comments will appear here on my official website.'</div>
