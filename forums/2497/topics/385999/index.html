              <p>As for the fad of not celebrating against former teams and those
              players supported as boys, Birmingham fans should relax. It sounds like
              Johnson could be in the stand celebrating alongside them.</p>
              <p>"I’m desperate for my first goal," he told the <em>Daily Mail</em>. "My older brothers, Stuart and Richard, will be in the away end. I’ve already warned them that it could happen.</p>

              <div>Birmingham City played out a goalless draw against Chelsea at St Andrews Stadium in a highly entertaining game that would've left the crowd wondering how neither side scored.<br><br>The
              hosts came into this game boasting a superb run of form that had seen
              them go nine games unbeaten, with five consecutive victories prior to
              their previous match - a draw against Everton.<br><br>In
              contrast, the top dogs of the top-flight arrived at St Andrews Stadium
              following a dreary run only of one win from their last six games in all
              competitions.<br><br>Carlo Ancelotti handed Daniel Sturridge his first Premier League start, due to the absence of Nicolas Anelka through injury, while Brazilian defender Alex replaced Ricardo Carvalho.<br><br>Meanwhile, Brum boss Alex McLeish
              chose to field an unchanged side for the seventh successive game, as
              Liam Ridgewell and Roger Johnson - who both sustained minor injuries at
              Goodison Park - recovered in time to make a start.<br><br>McLeish's men
              signaled an early intent to take the game to their opponents, when
              Cameron Jerome chased a ball and beat Alex with his pace, but was
              unable to score from a narrow angle.<br><br>Following an early scare,
              the travelers soon settled into a rhythm that saw the home side under a
              fair amount of pressure, during which goalkeeper Joe Hart made some
              excellent saves to deny Sturridge and Frank Lampard, keeping his side
              in the game.<br><br>But Birmingham created chances of their own to
              trouble the visitors' defense, and on one such occasion, Ridgewell
              found some space in the box and sent in a ball that Christian Benitez
              easily tapped into the open net. But the goal was disallowed as the
              linesman deemed that the player was offside when the ball was played
              his way, despite a floored Didier Drogba appearing to have played his counterpart onside.<br><br>Five
              minutes before the break, play was stopped when the Londoners were
              handed a for a foul on Florent Malouda. Alex took the free-kick and let
              loose a thunderbolt from 35-yards that rattled the crossbar.<br><br>Following
              the break, Birmingham tightened their defensive line to avoid a hiccup
              early on in the second period. As both sides slowly regained their
              rhythm, Brum committed more bodies to the attacking third of the pitch.
              as Ancelotti's charges continued to enjoy a fair share of possession.<br><br><span class="main-content">At the hour mark, Sebastian Larsson</span> looked set to give his side the lead through a free-kick that beat the wall, but Petr Cech
              produced a sensational save to put the ball away for a corner. However,
              the Czech Republic international had smacked his head against the post
              in the process, and there were a few tense moments as the 'keeper (who
              still wears protective head gear following an injury a few seasons
              back) lay on the ground. Fortunately for the shot-stopper, he was able
              to continue following some treatment.<br><br>Meanwhile, at the other end, <span class="main-content">Salomon Kalou
              - who had just come on in place of young Sturridge, who never really
              made the impact he would've liked - looked to make an immediate mark on
              the game when he went one-on-one with Hart, who was forced into making
              yet another brilliant save to keep the game on level terms.<br><br>With
              less than ten minutes to go, an error in judgment by Stephen Carr saw
              Drogba almost get to the ball, but Hart got to the ball first. The
              Ivorian was unable control his pace, and the 'keeper was subject to an
              accidental boot in the head. The fans breathed a sigh of relief, as the
              battle-hardy stopper was able to continue after being bandaged.<br><br>Any flicker of hope that Chelsea had of a late winner was extinguished when Malouda was sent off for a second bookable offense.<br><br>As
              the ref brought an end-to-end game to a halt, Birmingham managed to
              snatch a point from the table-toppers to go 10 games unbeaten, which is
              their best run in the top-flight in over a 100 years.</span></div>

A solid afternoon's work.<br><br>Stephen Carr - <strong>6.5</strong> - Was exposed only once by Ashley Cole,
              not a bad return after 90 minutes' pressure. No frills at the back —
              apart from one slack header back to his keeper — the captain led by
              example as he repelled any threat that came his way.<br><br>Roger Johnson - <strong>8.5</strong> - Most defenders fear facing Drogba, Johnson seemed to relish the
              occasion. Gave the big Ivorian as good as he got, never showing
              weakness and hardly giving him a sniff. Very impressive performance.<br><br>Scott Dann - <strong>7</strong> - Alongside Johnson was a resilient presence, holding off the
              opposition with remarkable composure. You wouldn't think this is his
              first season in the Premiership.<br><br>Liam Ridgewell - <strong>7</strong> - Rounded out the defense with another strong performance, the former Aston Villa man was not happy with the defending from set-pieces but never refused to put his body in where it hurts for the team.<br><br>Barry Ferguson - <strong>7</strong> - Made life harder for the Chelsea attackers as he sat in front of his
              determined central defenders. The Scot won the ball well and
              distributed it precisely, springing a number of counter-attacks for his
              side.<br><br>Sebastian Larsson - <strong>7.5</strong> - Diligent worker down the right, frustrating Ashley Cole on numerous
              occasions and shielding his defenders from pressure. Set-piece delivery
              also posed many problems for the away side.<br><br>James McFadden - <strong>6</strong> - Decent shift from the Scotland international, who posed a few threats
              with his delivery and trickery. Lack of a right foot was exposed,
              however, and subsequently he was substituted late on.<br><br>Lee Bowyer - <strong>6.5</strong> - His runs in behind the defense can make the difference against lesser
              teams, but against Chelsea the former Leeds United midfielder struggled
              to make much of an attacking impact.<br><br>Cameron Jerome - <strong>6.5</strong> - Physical presence up front didn't help much against Alex and Terry,
              and defensively fingers were pointed at him as his side lost many
              headers. But other than that the former Cardiff striker put in a good
              shift for the team.<br><br>Christian Benitez - <strong>6.5</strong> - Incorrectly flagged for offside after tapping home what looked like
              an early opener for his side. Was lively and dangerous throughout, but
              sometimes lacked a bit of awareness and intelligence.<br><br><strong>Substitutes</strong><br><br>Keith Fahey - <strong>6</strong> - Replaced McFadden, but didn't really get into the game.<br><br>Damien Johnson - <strong>6.5</strong> - Replaced Larsson late on, his fresh legs helped preserve his side's clean sheet.<br><br><br>CHELSEA<br><br>Petr Cech - <strong>7</strong> - Made one fantastic save from Larsson's free kick, picking up a knock
              in the process. A solid afternoon for the Czech, in an open game.<br><br>Ashley Cole - <strong>6.5</strong> - Got forward on a number of occasions, but seems to be lacking the
              cutting edge he had earlier in the season. Generally solid at the back,
              Ancelotti will want to try and coax more out of him in coming weeks.<br><br>John Terry - <strong>7</strong> - Showed his quality in a solid performance. Plugged any leaks in what
              was at times a very open defensive line, winning the ball in the air
              and recycling it on the deck. <br><br>Alex - <strong>7.5</strong> - Arguably Chelsea's most threatening player all game, the Brazilian
              seemed to win every header from corners. Rattled the bar with a
              thumping free kick in an all-action performance. <br><br>Branislav Ivanovic - <strong>6.5</strong> - Less threatening going forward than in recent weeks, the Serbian had
              a relatively quiet afternoon dealing with the few counter attacks that
              came his way.<br><br>John Obi Mikel - <strong>6.5</strong> - He still gives away far too many fouls, but the Nigerian covered his
              defense well and generally kept his side's structure and defensive
              discipline. Substituted late on for Ballack. <br><br>Juliano Belletti - <strong>6.5</strong> - Brazilian was unspectacular on only his third start of the season,
              showing his worth in defense and attack — but making enough poor
              challenges and misplaced passes to undermine the fact he is not best
              suited to the midfield diamond.<br><br>Florent Malouda - <strong>6.5</strong> - Sending off was innocuous — two relatively harmless challenges — but
              suspension will not be welcomed by his manager. While on the pitch he
              was solid, providing some width going forward and supporting his
              defense when required.<br><br>Frank Lampard - <strong>6</strong> - The tip of the diamond is still not a position where the midfielder
              can sparkle, as he struggled to really get into the game and cause
              problems for the opposition. Replaced by Joe Cole late on as Ancelotti looked for more creativity.<br><br>Daniel Sturridge - <strong>6.5</strong> - Looked lively and full of confidence on his first league start for
              the club. Had a couple of chances to open the scoring, but failed to
              take advantage. Encouraging signs for his manager, but was still
              withdrawn with 20 minutes left for Kalou.<br><br>Didier Drogba - <strong>6</strong> - Quiet afternoon for Drogba, for once the defense got the better of
              him. Nothing he tried really seemed to come off, as he barely got a
              sniff at goal.<br><br><strong>Substitutes</strong><br><br>Salomon Kalou - <strong>6.5</strong> - Had one decent chance to grab his side a win, but Hart denied him.<br><br>Joe Cole - <strong>6.5</strong> - Had little chance to really make a difference.<br><br>Michael Ballack - <strong>n/a</strong> - Late change for Mikel, saw little of the ball.</span></p>
