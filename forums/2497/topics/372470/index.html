              <h2>WENGER PAINTS A EUROPEAN PICTURE</h2>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Arsene Wenger believes the unquenchable thirst for money among top
              clubs will lead to a European League being formed in 10 years time.</p>
              <p>The Arsenal boss flew in to Glasgow on Monday for the first leg
              of the Champions League play against Celtic on Tuesday night and
              claimed that there was no financial pressure on him to get to the group
              stages of the competition.</p>
              <p>However, in the context of discussing whether Celtic or Rangers
              would be a welcome addition to the Barclays Premier League, Wenger
              expanded his views on the future of the game.</p>
              <p>And in doing so, the Frenchman claimed greed could eventually put an end to the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"I believe you have two parts of Scottish club football; you have Rangers and Celtic and then the rest," the Frenchman said.</p>
              <p>"I would say that Celtic and Rangers could compete, certainly,
              in the Premier League in the top eight. "The other teams at the moment
              are not equipped for that.</p>
              <p>"But I see more of a European League developing in time anyway.
              "The national leagues will survive, but maybe in 10 years you will have
              a European League.</p>
              <p>"The way we are going now financially, even the money coming in
              from the Champions League for some clubs who spend so much money will
              not be enough anymore because the income is basically owned by UEFA and
              they distribute the money to the clubs.</p>
              <p>"I'm not sure 100 per cent that I am right, but I feel that
              there are some voices behind the scenes in our game aiming to do
              something about a European league, especially if the rules become too
              restrictive for the big clubs as things currently stand."</p>

              <p>agree with AW. fans from all over the world except for european countries will benefit from the exciting football. all the money will be pour into the elite league to lure more fans and viewers from all over the world.</p>
              <p>currently an elite league will sure consist of at least 4 from eng, spain, italy. 3 from germ, france. 2 from scot, port, netherlands, tur etc. this will end up be not feasible again as there will end up be around 15-20 clubs or more. i cant imagine players need to fly from countries to countries for 20-30 times in a season for LEAGUE matches.</p>

              <p>Arsene Wenger is not saying it's a good idea, he's just saying there's a real possibility of it happening. For him to say it, there really must be a reason and that something behind it all is going on.</p>
