              <p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson blamed the incident on Gomes by saying:</p>
              <blockquote>“You can look at the referee and look at the linesmen and blame them, but the goalkeeper should know better. He’s an experienced goalkeeper. I thought he made a mess of it. The referee played on because the goalkeeper took possession of the ball. He then went to take a free-kick thinking it was a foul. He made an error.”</blockquote>
              <p></p>
              <p>And, not surprisingly, Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp saw it the other way around:</p>
              <blockquote>““It was handball. He put his hand on the ball and dragged it down. He should have been booked. The referee didn’t see him handball it, that’s why he’s allowed play to go on. The assistant referee has seen it, that’s why he’s flagged. He’s handled the ball. If he’s handled the ball he should be booked and it’s a free-kick. Gomes puts the ball down to take a free-kick. It’s obvious. Why would he stand there and leave the ball there after he saw him handball it?””</blockquote>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Harry Redknapp is in line for an FA charge after the aggrieved Tottenham boss appeared to question referee Mark Clattenburg's integrity over Manchester United's farcical second goal at Old Trafford.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The FA will today investigate Redknapp's comments, with the threat of punishment adding insult to injury. Redknapp was incensed when Nani scored as Spurs goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes lined up what he believed to be a free-kick. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Redknapp said: 'The officials will come up with a story that will make it look right. That's the way it happens. He made a cock-up, but he'll come up with some excuse.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The FA will be concerned by the allegation that Clattenburg and his assistants would try to cover up any mistake.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">United boss Sir Alex Ferguson had little doubt that Gomes was at fault, and Redknapp conceded the Brazilian should have played to the whistle after Nani fell and clearly handled the ball. Clattenburg waved play on but Gomes put down the ball and the United winger scored one of the strangest goals of the season.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Redknapp said: 'We all say from when you're kids that you should play to the whistle, but he just thought it was a blatant handball.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'Mark Clattenburg is a top referee but he's had a nightmare with that. It was a scandalous decision.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">United defender Rio Ferdinand used Twitter yesterday to answer criticism from Spurs fans, reminding them of their side's controversial goal at Fulham last month. He wrote: 'U weren't piping up when u were at fulham and Tom huddlestone got into the lino n ref about his goal when it coulda been offside?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">'By the way I went over to the referee just 2 clarify that he never blew his whistle, I never swore so what's all the fuss about?'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tottenham's misery grew yesterday with news that Rafael van der Vaart is expected to miss tomorrow's Champions League home match against Inter Milan.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Holland</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> star, a revelation since arriving from Real Madrid in August, limped out of the 2-0 defeat at United with a hamstring injury. </span></p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">Like everyone else I couldn't believe my eyes as events unfolded at Old Trafford. It was one of the most bizarre and divisive goals in Premier League history.</p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">My analysis is that Mark Clattenburg was right by the letter of the law, but his decision lacked credibility - and left a scar on this match.</p>
              <div class="pageBreak"> </div>
              <div class="pageBreak"> </div>
              <h2>1. The penalty appeal <br></h2>
              <p>Due to the bizarre run of events that followed, Nani's legitimate penalty claim was overlooked by many, including Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp.</p>
              <p>Nani appeared to be pushed from behind as he raced past Younes Kaboul. He went to ground very easily as most players do, but if an attacker does not go down then he will never get the decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/31/article-0-0BD79D10000005DC-56_468x447.jpg" alt="Going down: Nani is challenged in the box by Tottenham defender Kaboul " width="468" height="447">
              <p class="imageCaption">Going down: Nani is challenged in the box by Tottenham defender Kaboul</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p>Clattenburg saw this incident clearly and instantly gave a 'negative' signal, placing his arms behind his back - he saw it but didn't think it was an offence.</p>
              <p>His decision was a good one as there was so little contact. It would have been a soft penalty but technically it wouldn't have been wrong.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <h2>2. The handball <br></h2>
              <p>Next came the moment that Spurs claim should have resulted in a free-kick.</p>
              <p>Players who feel they have been fouled often grab the ball to force the referee to make a decision.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/31/article-0-0BD729BC000005DC-975_468x286.jpg" alt="Rough justice: Nani handles the ball, but Clattenburg calls for play to go on" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption">Rough justice: Nani handles the ball, but Clattenburg calls for play to go on</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p>Clattenburg could not see Nani deliberately handle the ball from his position. Anyway, it became irrelevant when Heurelho Gomes picked up the ball.</p>
              <p>The referee would want the game to flow and playing on was the best decision having not given the penalty. For the record, handball is not a mandatory caution, whatever Alan Hansen says.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <h2>3. The 'free-kick' <br></h2>
              <p>If Gomes felt he had a free-kick why walk 10 yards up the pitch to take it? Why not play to the whistle? His actions were bizarre and caused all of the problems.</p>
              <p>At no point did Clattenburg blow the whistle or make any move to do so, nor did he signal 'advantage'. He shouted 'Play on', but you do that when there is no offence.</p>
              <p>If Gomes had put the ball down at the point where Nani had handled it and Nani had kicked it in from there then I am sure that Clattenburg would not have allowed the goal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/31/article-1325377-0BDB2EC5000005DC-648_468x253.jpg" alt="Mark Clattenburg" width="468" height="253"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"> </div>
              <div class="thinCenter"> </div>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>4. The confusion <br></h2>
              <p>Even if Clattenburg was playing advantage, it would have been over as soon as Gomes had the ball in his hands.</p>
              <p>Advantage is accrued once the player has control of the ball and can play on unaffected.</p>
              <p>Despite Nani's handball, a free-kick could not have been awarded once Gomes picked up the ball.</p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <h2>5. Naughty Nani <br></h2>
              <p>As a top-flight referee, you have to contend with the 'win at all costs' mentality which over-rides all else.</p>
              <p>With players prepared to dive and feign injury, it is perhaps too much to ask for sportsmanlike conduct. Nani knew that Gomes had put the ball down for a free-kick which is why he hesitated. He did nothing wrong in law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>6. The consultation <br></h2>
              <p>This is the point at which the whole incident could have been cleared up.</p>
              <p>Assistant referee Simon Beck knew there was an unsatisfactory and unnatural feel to the goal. He had seen the handball and so gave Clattenburg an opportunity by calling him over.</p>

              <p>Clattenburg did well to keep the Tottenham players away but mysteriously allowed Rio Ferdinand to approach. He might be England captain but he is not the United captain and had no right to approach - let alone stay at - the consultation.</p>
              <p>The law allows a referee to change a decision providing he has not restarted play. Clattenburg decided not to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>7. The protests <br></h2>
              <p>I fully understood the Spurs protests. Clattenburg did nothing wrong in law but there was a lack of credibility in his decision. I always tried to ensure that things felt right while trying to apply the law correctly.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Unusually this situation had two alternative endings, both right in law - let the goal stand or give a free-kick for the missed handball after consultation with Beck. Personally I would have done the latter. Of course that would have saved Gomes the embarrassment that his stupidity perhaps deserved.</p>

              <p>Nani's controversial goal in the 2-0 win over <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham </span></a>at the weekend was the pacy winger's fifth of the season for his club and his form has been noted in north London.</p>
              <p>'I'm very impressed by Nani,' said Wenger. 'I like what he is doing. He has individual quality in one-on-ones, but he has improved a lot in his team play and in front of goal.</p>
              <p>'He has started scoring goals with both feet, and is a great crosser of the ball.</p>
              <p>'Personally I think he has developed his game in an extraordinary way.'</p>
              <p>Nani was asked to fill the void left by Cristiano Ronaldo's departure to Real Madrid in 2009 and Wenger believes the Portuguese is following in the footsteps of his more famous countryman.</p>
              <p>The Frenchman added on Eurosport: 'He has something like that about him. He is a little bit less direct in his way of playing than Ronaldo is. However, he is technically a virtuoso and has remarkable speed.'</p>
              <p>The Gunners are above United on goal difference after 10 games of the season - five points behind leaders Chelsea.</p>
