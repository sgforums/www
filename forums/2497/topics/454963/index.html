              SO England going out in the quarter-finals was no curse at all was it? It was a blessing in disguise.
              
              Just think what might have happened if the Ashleys had not missed their spot-kicks and we had somehow gone on to the final instead of Italy.
              
              Imagine our brave boys trying to cope with these Spanish matadors in this flamboyant form.
              
              For when a team as talented, tactical and technical as Italy are blown away you know you are witnessing something extra special.
              
              Make no mistake Cesare Prandelliâ€™s side were the second best team in the tournament and deserving finalists.
              
              But they found being second best to Spain means you are a long, long way behind.
              
              So England are even further away in the distance.
              
              And not even parking a double decker bus would have saved us from an utter humiliation.
              
              Certainly Roy Hodgson will have watched this and realised the scale of his task ahead.
              
              He might have enjoyed the spectacle but will he really relish trying to topple the finest international side of a generation, possibly of all time?
              
              Yes he can continue to spin the positives that England did not lose a match during Euro 2012 â€” only a penalty shootout.
              
              That we will improve the more he works with the players and the more he evolves the team into a younger, more technical, flexible outfit.
              
              All of it true. But the bigger truth is that, right now, Spain are unassailable.
              
              And the depressing thing for England, and every other nation, is that there is no sign of that changing any time soon.
              
              They have been on top for more than four years and are as hungry and eager as ever.
              
              Last nightâ€™s win over Italy sealed a record third successive major international trophy following their 2008 European crown and 2010 World Cup.
              
              And they became the first nation to successfully defend the trophy in the competitionâ€™s 52-year history.
              
              Best in the world? You better believe it!
              
              Now you would not bet against them going on to Brazil in two years and defending their world crown No team outside South America has ever won the gameâ€™s greatest prize in that part of the world.
              
              But this Spain team, and more importantly this system, is not just setting new records, it is setting new standards.
              
              This is a way of playing the game that has taken years to perfect but which could dominate for years.
              
              Players may change but the style will not and the conveyor belt of talent looks as rich as ever.
              
              Left-back Jordi Alba is only 23 and has just scored his first goal in international football looking like a striker.
              
              He has also just joined Barca ahead of Manchester United â€” do you blame him?
              
              We claim the Premier League is the best in the world. It may be in terms of excitement, drama, spectacle, passion, atmosphere and strength in depth.
              
              We might even try and garner some extra glory by saying Premier stars David Silva, Fernando Torres and Juan Mata all scored and ex-Arsenal skipper Cesc Fabregas got an assist in this 4-0 rout of a fine Italy side.
              
              And do not forget Mario Balotelli finished joint top scorer.
              
              But none of that helps Hodgson create a best in the world England team.
              
              Look at the Spanish side. One Premier League player in the starting line-up â€” Manchester Cityâ€™s Silva.
              
              Look at the Italian team. One Premier League player in the starting line-up â€” Manchester Cityâ€™s Balotelli.
              
              Look at the Spanish squad. Where do the vast bulk of them play their football? Spain.
              
              Look at the Italian squad. Where do the vast bulk of them play their football? Italy.
              
              Both leagues that are not dominated by top foreign talent like ours. And both nations benefit enormously from that â€” their best players playing together for their best clubs.
              
              Remember how Spanish heroes Gerard Pique, Xabi Alonso, Alvaro Arbeloa and Fabregas, all played in the â€˜greatestâ€™ league in the world and then turned their backs on it.
              
              To go home to play for the two best teams in the world â€” Barcelona and Real Madrid.
              
              Most of them did well in the Premier League, all of them have excelled away from it.
              
              For in Spain, club and country are as one. Thereâ€™s a common belief the beautiful game should be played beautifully.
              
              But it took immense bravery, unswerving faith and dogged perseverance to create a classic new style. If we want to compete, we must do the same. St Georgeâ€™s Park is a start, but only a start.
              
              One day it might be the answer, but watching this I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to be any time soon.

              <p>Agree with every word of the article. It will probably take decades to reach the level Spain is currently at. Germany i think is probably the team that can really go up against Spain i feel, unfortunately bested by Italy in this tournament. They have experienced players that still have many years ahead ( scwhenstieger, lahm, pudolski,etc ) and up coming stars ( ozil, kroos, muller, etc ). </p>
              <p>Italy I feel have lost their best generation of defenders ( cannavaro, nesta, maldini ) are no longer that solid unit last seen in 2006. England i feel have not improved much at all, be it under Capello and Hodgson both of whom favour solid defending ( italy style ). A look at their next generation also nothing much honestly.</p>

              italy's future also look gloomy.
              
              i dont see outstanding player in the current italian squad.  and pirlo will probably retire soon.

              <p>Maybe Brazil in a few years time, but by then the best of spain might have already retire from international already.</p>
              <p>Italy had proberly thrown away their best hope to win anything, pirlo is getting too old and he is not to be replacable anytime soon...</p>
              <p>England needs a Drogba to stand a chance to ride their luck. I still thinks that their defence is petty soild.</p>

              <p>Italy played the last half hour with 10 men because all their men old and injured easily.</p>
              <p>That's how Spain can run riot at the end of the match. Plus Spain have alot of depth in their squad. (Except Strikers)</p>
              <p>Spain is nowhere invincible, it's just that Italy defence had alot of holes during last night's match. A defensive game with rapid counter-attacks against Spain is most effective. </p>
