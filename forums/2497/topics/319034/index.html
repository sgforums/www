              <p><strong>The
                  prospect of a ground-share between Liverpool and Everton has been
                  raised once again as both clubs run into problems over their respective
                  new stadiums.</strong></p>
              <p>Plans have been in place for some time for Liverpool to build a
                  new ground on Stanley Park, but the club's American owners have been
                  forced to downsize then put on hold the development, as Tom Hicks
                  struggles to raise the necessary funds.</p>
              <p>The 60,000-seater stadium will cost around £300million, but
                  Hicks has been thus far unable to borrow the money he needs to complete
                  the project, given the current worldwide financial problems.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Everton's proposal to move to a new 55,000-capacity
                  ground in Kirby, a scheme that has proved extremely unpopular with the
                  club's fans, has hit problems.</p>
              <p>The planned stadium was to be a joint venture with Tesco, who
                  would build a retail development alongside the stadium. However,
                  Liverpool City Council have raised serious objections to such a
                  proposal, as have local residents.</p>
              <p>All of which raises the possibility of a shared ground, which had previously been rejected by all and sundry.</p>
              <p>Warren Bradley, leader of the Liberal Democrat majority on the city council, told The Guardian:</p>
              <p>"I'd back the redevelopment of Goodison but you can't unless
                  Everton make a commitment. If they want to come to the table, we're
                  always ready and willing.</p>
              <p>"I've also been working behind the scenes on a joint Liverpool
                  and Everton stadium. I've talked to the sports minister and to the NWDA
                  [Northwest Regional Development Agency] and I've spoken to [Everton's
                  chairman] Bill Kenwright."</p>
              <p>It will be interesting to see how fans of both clubs react should these plans go any further.</p>

              <p><strong>Merseyside neighbours Everton and Liverpool have both moved to
              scotch reports that a stadium share between the two clubs could be on
              the cards.</strong></p>
              <p>Everton this week received a fresh setback in their attempts to
              relocate to Kirkby after Liverpool City Council voted unanimously
              against the project.</p>
              <p>While The Reds’ hopes of a new 60,000-seater stadium continue to
              stall, reports have started to gather pace that the two clubs could be
              tempted to reposition together.</p>
              <p>However, Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks has been quick to reject any such suggestions.</p>
              <p>“There is no interest in a shared stadium and no planned meeting to discuss this,” said a spokesman for the American.</p>
              <p>Toffees chief executive Keith Wyness echoed the thoughts emerging from Anfield.</p>
              <p>"Having discussed the matter with my Liverpool counterpart Rick
              Parry, I can categorically state that a shared stadium is not on the
              agenda of either club,” he told the club’s official website.</p>
              <p>"We have a series of criteria which any prospective stadium must meet, and a shared stadium does not meet that criteria.</p>
              <p>"When Mr Hicks and Mr [George] Gillett took over Liverpool FC, they made it perfectly clear they were not interested."</p>
