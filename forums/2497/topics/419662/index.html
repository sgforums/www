              <p>The new year has not brought much cheer for four Premier League 
              managers after Wednesday's results put them under severe pressure to 
              keep their jobs.</p>

              <p>Chelsea's sensational form slump continued as they <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=292961&amp;league=ENG.1&amp;cc=4716">lost 1-0</a> away to Wolves, leaving <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=96">Carlo Ancelotti</a> searching for answers, while Liverpool boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=54">Roy Hodgson</a> - already believed to be on the brink of being replaced - saw his side fall to a heavy<a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=293134&amp;league=ENG.1&amp;cc=4716"> 3-1 defeat</a> at Blackburn.</p>
              <p>At the bottom of the table, Avram Grant's lowly West Ham were <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=293023&amp;league=ENG.1&amp;cc=4716">thrashed 5-0</a> at Newcastle and Aston Villa fell into the relegation zone by virtue of Wolves' win and their <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=293032&amp;league=ENG.1&amp;cc=4716">1-0 loss</a> at home to Sunderland, prompting fans to call for <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=12">Gerard Houllier's</a> head.</p>
              <p>All
               four clubs are performing well below their respective expectations this
               season and while Hodgson, Houllier and Grant are all new to their clubs
               this season, the decline of Ancelotti's Chelsea has in some ways been 
              the most surprising. From winning the domestic double last season, 
              Chelsea find themselves all but out of the title race just over halfway 
              through the season and currently sit outside the Champions League places
               in fifth having won just one of their past nine league matches.</p>
              <p>Asked
               after the Wolves result if he was confident he was the right man for 
              the job, Ancelotti said: "Yes, I know this team very well and I'm sure 
              that this moment will change and we will be able to fight for everything
               this season. I would be surprised if I am sacked. I don't fear (for my 
              job). I'm worried because the team doesn't reach the result. I think 
              it's obvious we are not good enough in this moment.</p>
              <p>"It's not my 
              decision. I hope I can continue this job, because I would like to stay 
              here and I have a good relationship with the players and with the club."</p>
              <p>Hodgson
               is the bookmakers' favourite to be axed next and after Liverpool's 
              latest defeat, which left them in 12th just five points better off than 
              rock bottom West Ham; he gave a two-minute interview in which he 
              answered just three questions after the defeat at Blackburn. Liverpool 
              legend and current club advisor Kenny Dalglish is heavily rumoured to 
              take over from Hodgson on a temporary basis.</p>
              <p>Hodgson said: "I am 
              not prepared to talk about [my future] because obviously I am depressed 
              enough with the performance and the result. I have no comments to make 
              and I have no intention to answer any questions on the subject. [I feel]
               dejection, bitter disappointment, frustration. I am very disappointed 
              for the fans who gave us good support and saw the team concede the goals
               we did."</p>
              <p>Houllier was more upbeat despite being the manager to 
              lose in front of his home supporters as Phil Bardsley's goal inflicted 
              Villa's 10th loss of the season, already two more defeats than they had 
              across what became Martin O'Neill's farewell season last term.</p>
              <p>Villa
               fans chanted "you're getting sacked in the morning" but Houllier tried 
              to brush off the jeers, saying: "I heard it and it hurts. But I when I 
              hear the chants it strengthens my resolve to put things right. I spoke 
              to (chief executive) Paul Faulkner and he was very supportive. I don't 
              doubt (chairman) Randy Lerner's firm support and determination. We are 
              in this together for better or worse."</p>
              <p>Wolves' victory also left 
              West Ham on the bottom again as the Hammers' mini-revival ended with a 
              bang thanks to a hat-trick by Newcastle striker <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/32242/Leon-Best">Leon Best</a> and goals from <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7902/Kevin-Nolan">Kevin Nolan</a> and Peter Lovenkrands at St James' Park.</p>
              <p>Grant
               said: "I feel confident I'm the man to lead us out of trouble. Look 
              what we've done before this game. We were on the bottom but playecd good
               football to take points and climb up the table. That result is 
              difficult to explain. It was a bad day at the office."</p>

              <p>Imo, houllier shd be sacked outright. He came and riled a lot of the senior players.</p>
              <p>Hodgson shd resign to save himself from further reputation damage,. I think he deserves a better squad than the current one at liverpool. But then again, a sack means more money right lol. Ancelotti shd be given more time.</p>
              <p>Wolves has 6 wins so far, they definitely deserve to stay up.</p>
              <p>Very reluctant actually for any of the current bottom three to go down.</p>

              <p>On account of below, this fella also deserves sacking.</p>
              <p>"I don't like the game," Grant said. "I don't like the performance, I 
              don't like how we played, but in football, that happens. Sunderland lost
               here 5-1 and afterwards, they have won many games, so it
              happens."</p>

              <p>well, maybe it's easy for me to say but he couldn't bring the best out of his key players. And it's not just a simple performance of the players issue. He came in and implemented a lot of his own methods too fast too quickly. Villa players were after all used to an irishman, now the gaffer's a frenchman.</p>
              <p>As for grant, I think he should cut all that crap and say, we are genuinely in a crisis and let's step up a gear. Most times, he says they wil turn the corner. Yes as the gaffer he has to manage his PR well so as not to affect the confidence of players. But then now he compares west ham with sunderland.....that's bloody unrealistic man. West ham is not sunderland at all as the latter is much more solid under steve bruce.</p>
