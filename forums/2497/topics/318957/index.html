              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>AVRAM GRANT insists Chelsea would have won the title if he had taken over sooner from Jose Mourinho. The Israeli replaced the Special One as boss six weeks into the season with Blues struggling in fifth place.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">But Grant said: “I tell you this: If Chelsea had played at the beginning of the season like they did at the end then they would definitely have been champions of England ahead of Man United.”</p>
              <p class="article">Grant, axed by Roman Abramovich on Saturday, took the title race to the final day before United retained their crown. He added: “Over the last three months of the season with me working as manager, we were never called boring Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">“No one expected Chelsea to win things because when I took over, the team were fifth and had just been held to a Champions League draw by Rosenborg. “No one believed we would have finished second and reached the Champions League final in Moscow.”</p>
              <p>"I was told by the club that I had come in as part of building the future and my position was not dependent on achievements. Nobody expected we would win anything, because I was given the club when we were fifth in the league and had drawn at home to Rosenborg in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"Nobody believed that we could even finish second or reach the Champions League Final in Moscow. "But the target I set myself was to at least reach the Champions League Final because a team that invests so much money should at least reach the final."</p>
              <p class="article">Grant will be handed a £4m pay-off. He said: “I’m not suing anybody. Roman is a very good friend.”</p>
