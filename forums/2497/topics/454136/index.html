              <p><span><strong>Luka Modric is close to moving to Spain, with Real Madrid desperate to sign the Tottenham midfielder.<br></strong></span></p>
              <p><span>That is the view of Modric’s friend and former Croatia team-mate Mate Bilic, who has claimed Manchester United and Chelsea have competition for the 26-year-old.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘I’m very good friends with Modric,’ said the Sporting Gijon striker. ‘He wants to play in the Spanish league. He loves the Premier League but he wants to play in Spain. He’s very close to agreeing a move.’</span></p>
              <p><span>That revelation comes with Real Madrid preparing a bid for Modric and former Croatia and Real star Davor Suker claiming the Tottenham man is good enough to be a galactico and also claims Manchester City are interested in him.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>United and Chelsea are also keen to sign Modric, who wants to leave White Hart Lane for Champions League football. Managerless Spurs don’t want to lose the linchpin of the midfield but might not be able to resist a second summer of bids, even if clubs might not want to meet Daniel Levy’s £35million valuation. </span></p>

              all the players you mentioned are neither from spain nor italy which i feel produces the best midfielders.
              
              england obviously lack midfielders of the highest calibre.  hence they think modric is very good.

              <p>You sure he played badly at the Euro? He was the main player Spain was worried about and his Croatia team was unlucky not to get to the 2nd stage. Spain had their keeper to thank for a string of good saved against them or the team that went home would be them instead of Croatia...</p>
              <p>Also, Real's interest in him came about during his performance at the Euro... if he played that badly, I don't think they would be interested with him at all.</p>

              he had only one shot against italy and did nothing throughout the match.
              
              i watched many spurs game. i feel he is not one that can turn games.  at least not often enough.

              did you watch any of italy's game?  or any of the many matches pirlo ever played?  he is one of the most creative passers of the ball whereas modric regularly pass the ball square.
              
              a good midfielder is one that can create chances out of nowhere - those that can split defenses. 
              
              anyway i am not saying modric has no talent.  but exaggerated.  or maybe english football doesnt suit him.  time will tell.

              <p><strong>Tottenham are reportedly being tempted to get the deal done on wantaway Luka Modric, with Real Madrid now thought to  offering midfielder Nuri Sahin plus something like £30million cash.</strong></p>
              <p>Real remain the frontrunners to land the Croatian midfielder despite renewed interest from Manchester United and Chelsea.</p>
              <p>Tottenham value Modric at £40million, but the inclusion of Turkey midfielder Sahin, 23, in a £30m package might tempt them.</p>

              <p>Modric is on holiday after Croatia’s exit from the Euro 2012 group stages but will soon tell Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy that he wants to leave.</p>
              <p>Sahin, born in Germany, has 31 caps for Turkey and only arrived from Borussia Dortmund last year. His chances of nailing down a first-team spot under Mourinho are slim.</p>
              <p>Spurs could also be offered former Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho as part of any deal but his age - 34 - is against him.</p>
