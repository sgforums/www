              <p><strong>Paris Saint-Germain and <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span> are also attempting to sign the 26-year-old Croatia international but it is understood that a deal could be struck with Real in the next few days. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>Real had cooled their interest, after an inquiry earlier this summer, in which they had offered cash plus Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin but talks are understood to have resumed over a straight cash offer.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Spurs</span> chairman Daniel Levy has been quoting an asking price of £50 million for Modric but the Real offer is expected to be the best one he will receive with the player preferring to move to Spain rather than join PSG.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Levy is adamant that if Modric quits Spurs then he will also leave the Premier League and the chairman will not even countenance an offer from Chelsea whose interest may, indeed, wane now that they have agreed a deal to sign the exciting young Brazil playmaker Oscar for around £22 million.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>That move came about after Chelsea hijacked Spurs’ bid to sign the 20 year-old from Internacional and should Modric go it is likely that Spurs will make a move for Joao Moutinho although they will not meet Porto’s asking price of more than £30 million for the Portuguese midfielder. A deal, however, does seem likely for Moutinho to eventually move to White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday Spurs’ new head coach, Andre Villas-Boas, confirmed that the club would listen to offers for Modric after he once again informed them he would like to leave. “The interest Luka is getting from a number of different clubs is the same as he got last year,” Villas-Boas said.</p>
              <p>“Luka is a player of major importance for the football club and that is why he attracts so many clubs. At the moment, it’s in the hands of the chairman to accept the right proposition.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea was involved last year so there is nothing new in the situation. If the player’s ambition is to move to another club, we can respect that decision, but there are club interests that the chairman will defend and I think only when the right offer is met, there will be more news.”</p>

              <p>And Villas-Boas let slip last night that two other clubs — thought to be Manchester United and Paris St Germain — are also keen on signing the 26-year-old.</p>
              <p>But the former Chelsea boss is adamant Spurs will not lower their asking price and says Modric understands the club’s position.</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas said: “There has been continuous interest from three different clubs in Luka. But it is important for Tottenham to hold on to their rights.</p>
              <p>“His situation will continue as it is until the price is right.</p>
              <p>“It’s important to understand his feelings. We have been speaking and I understand his point and he understands the club’s point.</p>
              <p>“Luka is an intelligent person and understands the club has to defend his value their values, rights and interests. It’s a difficult situation for the club but we have been co-operative by openly saying we are willing to listen to offers.</p>
              <p>“But the offer has not been met to what the chairman wants. If that is met, there won’t be any problems.”</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas also denied he is interested in Porto ace Hulk having been photographed with the striker in a London hotel on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>He added: “Hulk is a very special player for me as we achieved a very good year at Porto — but we were just talking.”</p>
              <p>The man who is likely to be Modric’s long-term replacement, Gylfi Sigurdsson, impressed as he scored within 10 minutes of coming on against Stevenage, Yago Falque grabbed a late second.</p>
