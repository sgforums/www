            <div class='col-md body'>Tyson's Forest knock out Addicks<br>Posted 06/01/07 17:05<br><br>Nathan Tyson delivered a knockout blow to Charlton's FA Cup hopes as Nottingham Forest sailed into the FA Cup fourth round with a 2-0 win. New Charlton boss Alan Pardew had hoped a good run in the competition might help lift his struggling side out of the Premiership relegation zone.<br><br>Instead he must now haul his players off the canvas, after Tyson-inspired Forest ran riot and all but sealed their passage before half-time with two well taken goals.<br><br>Junior Agogo and Grant Holt both hit the net in a thrilling four-minute spell, with Tyson's surging performance down the left flank causing chaos among the visitors' back line.<br><br>Forest's thumping 5-0 defeat at Oldham one week ago showed just how hard are the times they have fallen upon since their last appearance in an FA Cup final in 1991.<br><br>But Colin Calderwood's men still looked good value for an upset against a Charlton side, whose mini-resurgence under new boss Pardew came to an abrupt end at Arsenal last week.<br><br>While the Addicks' patched-up line-up struggled to settle, Forest made light of Kris Commons' injury to give Tyson a shot in the wide left berth for the first time this season.<br><br>Calderwood's gamble would prove good enough to book Forest a place in round four, via what some supporters of the former European Cup-winners may baulk at being described as a traditional giant-killing.<br><br>Tyson proved far too much of a handful for temporary defender Radostin Kishishev, and his influence helped Agogo and Holt launch early runs towards the Charlton box.<br><br>Tyson burst into the left side of the box and delivered a powerful low cross which was hacked away by Jonathan Fortune; then he almost got on the end of a through-ball from Holt.<br><br>Charlton's crisp passing moves were having little impact, and Dennis Rommedahl tried his luck, cutting in from the left flank and firing high over the bar.<br><br>Tyson showed his threat again in the 17th minute by running half the length of the field and steam-rollering Kishishev along the way before finally being stopped in the box by Tahar El Karkouri.<br><br>Forest spurned the best chance of the game so far in the 21st minute when Tyson crossed from the left, and James Perch connected to flash a header across the face of goal from point-blank range.<br><br>Marcus Bent almost made Forest pay at the other end with a 20-yard snap-shot which Smith had to parry up over his bar for the first corner of the game.<br><br>Pardew made what appeared to be a tactical change in a bid to cope with Tyson's significant threat as he withdrew Amady Faye and slotted Souleyman Diawara in at centre-back.<br><br>But moments later, Forest kicked off that dramatic four-minute spell which left the home side on course for the fourth round and Charlton facing another humiliation.<br><br>The excellent Perch crossed from deep on the right, and Agogo got in behind Diawara to sweep the ball under Thomas Myhre and into the net to give Forest a 28th minute lead.<br><br>Two minutes later the magnificent Tyson fired in a cross from the opposite flank which clattered defender Fortune and screwed up to hit his own bar before squirting to safety.<br><br>But rampant Forest extended their lead in the 32nd minute when Nicky Southall whipped in a curling free-kick from the right, and Holt rose above Diawara to head home Forest's second.<br><br>The shell-shocked visitors were suddenly embroiled in a damage-limitation exercise - but despite a period of possession, they mustered no new chances to get back into the match.<br><br>Charlton needed a good start to the second half and they almost got it when Bent connected with Rommedahl's left-wing cross but saw his powerful drive blocked by Ian Breckin.<br><br>But their comeback bid quickly petered out, and their best chance came in the 78th minute when Gary Holt almost deflected the ball past his own goalkeeper.<br><br>Long before the final whistle, the visitors' body language proved they were resigned to their fate as Forest eased to a thoroughly deserved victory.<br></div>
