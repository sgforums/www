              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>The Liverpool star striker, who scored the 2 goals against Chelsea.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fernando Torres hit two late goals in Liverpool's 2-0 win over Chelsea at Anfield.</p>
              <p>With the Blues down to ten men following the second half sending off of
              Frank Lampard for a lunge on Xabi Alonso, the game seemed to be heading
              for a stalemate.</p>
              <p>Liverpool looked to be unable to capitalize on their
              territorial possession until Torres scored a minute from the end then
              deep into injury time.</p>
              <p>The Reds now trail leaders Manchester United by two points.</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari admitted to <em>sky sports</em> that Liverpool deserved their win.</p>
              <p>"I think the result it’s after what’s happened with Lampard.
              It’s normal because they have more possession, they have more quality,
              they arrive more in front of our goal, but until then no,” he said.</p>
              <p>The Blues’ boss added: "If it’s possible I want the referee to
              look at this situation on the television and maybe he will change the
              red card for Lampard because as I look on television it’s a foul for
              the other player (Alonso) not for Lampard."</p>
              <p>"After this they are the owner of the pitch and they scored two
              goals,” he said before adding, “I think Liverpool are better than us,
              all of the game."</p>
              <p>Scolari insisted his players would not give up on the title yet
              yet. "We need to look again, we need to try again, because we have many
              games. But we are behind now, two clubs Manchester and Liverpool, and
              it’s more difficult than before but we need to fight until the last
              game."</p>
              <p>Goalscorer Torres said, "We knew before the game we had to win and we have more confidence now.</p>
              <p>"They are my first two goals after the injury; to score at home this season for the first time and against Chelsea is fantastic.</p>
              <p>"With one player less Chelsea had to defend. A draw was good for
              them but we had to win. We worked very hard and with determination, but
              we know we have to improve."</p>
              <p>Torres added: "We know that Manchester United is favourite at top of the table, and we will fight until the end."</p>

              <p>Bosingwa's should be sent off and charged for putting a leg onto Yossi Benyoun's back at the corner flag in front of the assistant referee.</p>

              <p>Just like what Fergie said at the start of the season lor...

His Chelsea looked more resilient than what they are now... Only thing was he wasn't a big name manager...</p>
              <p>This just show us that a "big name" manager may not give you what you want... Look at Barcelona, an unknown manager and they are still doing very well...</p>

              <p><br>When we talk about old, we are not talking about a single player but as a unit... Sure United have older players like Giggs, Scholes &amp; Neville... but they also have enough younger ones to replace them and choose to play them selectively rather than week in, week out... If you look at Chelsea's 3 attacking midfielders, Deco, Lampard &amp; Ballack, all of them are above 30 already... They play in almost every match... Scolari even play them in the FA and Carling cup matches... This type of thing can build up in the players resulting in them losing their form like Deco... When he first started, he look quite impressive but now like an average player... Ballack also seem to have lost that extra spring to his movement lately... Lampard isn't surprising cos he is used to the Premiership all his career and also more importantly, of the 3, he is the most committed to Chelsea and also the youngest although also coming to 31... His time will tell in a yr or two you just see... No more up and down the field and power shots by then...</p>
              <p>And another thing, if base on just last night's match... I thought Chelsea best player was Alex...  </p>
