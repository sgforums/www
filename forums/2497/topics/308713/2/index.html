              <span>He was furious that a penalty was awarded for handball against Wayne Bridge on a linesman's advice after appeals by Spurs.</span></p>

              <p><span>Even though Spurs were already celebrating and
              Kalou's shot hit a post, Grant moaned: "We're all upset because he
              stopped the match when Kalou was right in front of goal. How can he
              decide whether it's one or two seconds more?"</span></p>

              <p><span>"The penalty was a rash decision and it wasn't
              even the referee's. When the ball hits a hand it doesn't mean a penalty

              <p><br> Just watched some replays, about the bridge issue, honestly, very little in either contact to say it was deliberate or not. Bridge's arms were up more because he was trying to maintain body balance. Can say Chelsea were a bit unfortunate but it was a very close call.</p>
              <p>As for the match overall based on the highlights I watched, I think both sides had enough chances to put the game away in normal time. In fact, I think there was enough in the match to be settled without a free kick, penalty and a slightly lucky header. But that's football sometimes.</p>
              <p>Tottenham seemed to be make more attempts, but during their attacks Chelsea had more people at the back as well. In terms of slightly more quality chances, my guess is that it was about even.</p>
              <p>For the freekick leading to Drogba's goal, I only saw the foul from one camera angle and it did seem Zokora's studs did come into contact with Drogba's ankle (not shin). But I honestly don't think it was enough to cause that much pain. Also hard to say whether the contact was enough to put Drogba off but it might still have been a foul non-the-less. Drogba's reaction was just kinda exagerrated I guess. The freekick itself wasn't badly taken, they made use of the fact that keeper's view was obstructed.</p>
              <p>Already commented on the penalty decision. Otherwise, penalty was well taken and Berbatov managed to get Cech to move in the wrong direction.</p>
              <p>Woodgate got his goal in extra time after Cech knocked the ball back onto him for the goal. There was lots of chance the ball could have gone anywhere, but it fell nicely enough for Spurs, a valid goal and credit to Spurs for creating the chance.</p>
