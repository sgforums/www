              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> striker Michael Owen is ready to prove his doubters wrong this season.</p>
              <p>He was publicly shunned by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Wigan</span></abbr> chairman Dave Whelan and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Blackburn Rovers</span></abbr> boss Sam Allardyce, and seemingly deciding between Hull and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Stoke City</span></abbr> until a slightly better offer came along.</p>
              <p>"If that was how they were perceiving me, fine, because the greatest accolade I could have is that <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> did not think that," the former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> striker told <em>FourFourTwo magazine</em>.</p>
              <p>"I can quietly sit here and look around at where I am now, and if
              anyone else wants to look at what they've say, they might feel
              embarrassed."</p>
              <p>Owen is quick to defend his record and is determined to prove
              United were right to gamble on him. And he says the mission from
              Ferguson is clear: "To score goals."</p>
              <p>He said: "The team has lost two players: (Carlos) Tevez, who scored a few, and (Cristiano) <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Ronaldo</span></abbr>, who got lots over the last two seasons.</p>
              <p>"There's a big hole to fill, and hopefully I can help plug it in terms of goals. I can't do it on my own, but I will help out."</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester United striker Michael Owen insists he has nothing to prove - but believes recent critics Sam Allardyce and Dave Whelan may end up "embarrassed" about snubbing him publicly.</strong></p>
              <p>The former Liverpool forward was left kicking his heels for a while this summer after leaving Newcastle and appeared likely to end up at Hull or Stoke until Sir Alex Ferguson took him to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Blackburn boss Allardyce and Wigan owner Whelan distanced themselves from a move for the England striker - and Owen, 29, believes they will realise they were wrong.</p>
              <p>"If that was how they were perceiving me, fine, because the greatest accolade I could have is that Sir Alex Ferguson didn't think about that," Owen told FourFourTwo magazine.</p>
              <p>"I can quietly sit here and and look around where I am now - and if anyone else wants to look at what they've said, then they might feel embarrassed. I don't feel I have to impress these people.</p>
              <p>"I only need to prove things to people who believe in me. I want to show Sir Alex was right to believe in me."</p>
              <p>Owen is unfazed about the challenge of filling the gap left by the departures of Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo. "The team has lost two players - Tevez, who scored a few, and Ronaldo who got lots over the last two seasons," he said.</p>
              <p>"There's a big hole to fill, and I hope I can help plug it in terms of goals. I can't do it on my own - but I will help out.</p>
              <p>"When you sign for United you get excited about a lot of things. One of them, I hope, is scoring a lot of goals - because I am going to get a lot more chances here than at other teams."</p>
              <p>Owen insists his international ambitions remain stronger than ever as he contemplates next summer's World Cup.</p>
              <p>"My mind's been thinking about that since I was three years old in the back garden, and nothing has changed," he said. "Winning the World Cup is the ultimate - it's still my dream."</p>
