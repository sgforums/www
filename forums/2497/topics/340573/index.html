              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger insists his side will return to the Emirates Stadium to face Premier League pace-setters Liverpool next week with a strong chance of forcing their way back into the title race.</strong></p>
              <p>On a day when both Rafael Benitez's men and Manchester United both dropped points, Wenger said his side's hard-earned 1-1 draw against Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium was ''not disastrous''.</p>
              <p>And despite fluctuating recent form, Wenger believes his side have shown signs they have got their season back on track after a poor start which threatened to effectively end their campaign before Christmas.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: ''We will keep our focus and try to win the next game and try not to think about it. We must just believe that the next game is one to reduce the distance between us and Liverpool.</p>
              <p>''The league is wide open but we are in a position that every point we drop we are asked about it. I understand that, but champions are people who never stop and we can show that belief to keep going.''</p>
              <p>But Boro's gutsy performance exposed familiar frailties in a Gunners line-up in which striker Emmanuel Adebayor was a class apart from his young and occasionally lightweight-looking team-mates.</p>
              <p>''There was room for us to take the three points but they fought very hard. In the end we were 1-0 and unlucky on the goal we conceded and after that we had two or three more chances to score and we didn't do it,'' Wenger added.</p>
              <p>The result proved much more pleasing for Boro boss Gareth Southgate who was forced to rush Chris Riggott and Robert Huth back from injury due to the suspension of the talismanic David Wheater.</p>
              <p>His side bustled with energy and intent from the kick-off and their urgency was encapsulated by a fine performance from youngster Tony McMahon in his first Boro game for two years after suffering two broken legs.</p>
              <p>Southgate said: ''Tony was fantastic. It's been a real long haul for him and we've sent him out on loan to get him matches. He needed those games under his belt and he's given an outstanding display.''</p>
              <p>''We're relatively pleased with the account we've given of ourselves. We needed to pick up some points. It's been a tough run for us but we've given a very good display and that's the most pleasing thing.''</p>

              <h1>Cesc Fabregas not worried about Rio Ferdinand's opinion</h1>
              <h2>Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas has knocked back suggestions by Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand that the London club are all-but-out of the Premier League title race.</h2>
              <p><img src="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/telegraph/multimedia/archive/01207/cesc-fabregas_1207369c.jpg" alt="Cesc Fabregas not worried about Rio Ferdinand's predictions" width="460" height="287"></p>
              <p><span class="caption"><em>Not giving up yet: Cesc Fabregas thinks Arsenal can still win the Premier League title as a week is a long time in football.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Speaking to <em>Sky Sports</em> Fabregas said: "With all the experience they [Manchester United] have, they should know more than anyone that football can change in one week, two weeks.</strong></p>
              <p>"It is a massive game against Liverpool, it is vital. It can be a massive change in the table. "If we win we know that we can come back to five points which is not a lot. We know five points is nothing."</p>
              <p>Although Ferdinand, who is Japan with Manchester United for the Fifa World Club Cup, admitted there was still a possibility that Arsene Wenger's side could land the title, the England defender feels it is very unlikely given their current position eight points behind Liverpool at the top of the table.</p>
              <p>Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor backed up his captain, saying: "It is better if Rio say 'we will try to do everything to win it'. "We know we are eight points behind and we have a chance to play them and close the gap. "We have to keep focused. It is going to be an important game and I don't have to say too much about it.</p>
              <p>"The motivation will come from within ourselves. We need to show good character and a good personality to win the game."</p>

              <p>I think losing Flamini and Hleb were the biggest setback for them in recent years... After years there growing up and finally getting it right in the premiership, they were sold.</p>
              <p>Flamini last season was my player of the season for them... He was doing all the running from Aug all the way till the end... Such players are important as when the team is not doing well, his energetic runs could still inspire the team. Fabregas in my opinion is a little over rated. Last season he disappear from Feb to Apr, his performance wasn't just average, it was very poor. And this season so far, he has not done that much either...</p>
              <p>Losing Hleb also is rather disappointing... Last season you could expect them attacking from the wing more often but this season, not much especially when Walcott is out now.</p>
              <p>Biggest disappointment must be Robin Van Persie, 3 to 5 yrs ago he shown that he has the potential to be one of the top players in the world... He was even better than Ronaldo then. Many non-Arsenal fans actually liked him, like myself... I thought he scores great goals. But so much time spent in the treatment room seems to have taken all that away. Now at 25, he can no longer be consider a young potential player anymore, if anything, his football career is halfway over... That's why i feel he is Wenger's biggest disappointment considering the talent and skilled he have or had... </p>

              <p><br>Well, for one if Arsenal do beat Pool... I guess Chelsea and United fans would be happy... Chelsea will go back to the top while United would be 6 points behind but with 2 games in hand. Is that good enough? lol</p>
              <p>Who cares if Arsenal cannot beat another lowly club... I bet the Blues and the Devils fans will lose any sleep should if happens... lol</p>

The Reds have yet to win in their three visits to Arsenal's new stadium. But Reina is confident the Premier League leaders will come away with three points against their title rivals.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Spanish keeper said: "We don't have that many great memories from our other visits to the Emirates. "They played very well and we weren't in our best moment. "This time I think it is different because we are top of the table and I think it is easier to play when you are up there.</p>
              <p class="article">"We've never won there before, so maybe it's the right time to do it. "It is possible for us to win on any ground. But we have to respect them a lot and play to win, like we always do.</p>
              <p class="article">"We have already won at Stamford Bridge, so we're confident we can now go to the Emirates and win there too."</p>
              <p class="article">The Gunners are well off the pace in the title race after a sloppy start to the season. But Reina has warned his team-mates not to underestimate Arsene Wenger's side. He added: "Arsenal have great players and a good squad. "They are able to do great things. They beat Manchester United at home and also won at Stamford Bridge, so we know it will be a really tough game.</p>
              <p class="article">"They probably do save their best for the big teams. The way they play their football probably makes it easier for them to take on the top sides, because they allow them to play their brand of football. "Against more physical teams they have struggled a little bit because of that."</p>

              <h1>Rafa in, Torres out of Emirates Epic</h1>
              <p><strong>Liverpool will definitely be
              without Fernando Torres for Sunday’s trip to Arsenal, but they will
              have their leader Rafa Benitez on the touchline. </strong></p>
              <p>Benitez has been in hospital this week due to kidney stones, and
              there had been fears that he would not be well enough to travel to
              North London this weekend.</p>
              <p>Last season the Spaniard masterminded two 1-1 draws at Emirates
              Stadium, one of which was crucial to their Champions League
              progression, and assistant Sammy Lee revealed Benitez will be healthy
              enough to bark out the orders on Sunday.</p>
              <p>"He's a lot better. He wasn't very good at the start of the week but
              slowly but surely he's got better and he'll be okay for the game,” Lee
              told the club’s official website.</p>
              <p>The news is less positive for Torres though, who is still suffering from hamstring problems.</p>
              <p>Torres is back in training but, after several recent breakdowns, the club are being extra careful with him.</p>
              <p>"He won't be fit for the weekend, no," said Lee. "He's back in
              training and running. We are trying to make sure he's right and 100 per
              cent for when he does come back."</p>
