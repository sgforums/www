              <p>That's the problem with club that are manage by rich owners... They don't last very long... Look at Blackburn, When Jack Walker took over, they started spending millions... They were like the Chelsea of old and now the City of present day. He got them promoted to the Premier League, breaking the transfer record twice, they even manage to win the title... But when he left, see what happen to the club...</p>
              <p>Then there was Leeds United too... We all know what happened there... And even longer back, Sunderland were spending so much in the past that they became known as 'the bank of England' club... but got relegeted in the end...</p>
              <p>So history shows such spendings could hurt the club in the long term... Cos if anything happens to the owner or he loses interest in it after a few years... Where does the club go from there?</p>
              <p>In Chelsea's case, It has been around 5 or 6 yrs since Roman took over and every year they are still in the reds financially to the tune of between $70m to $140m yearly... They have not had a profitable year for such a long time already... And the chances of them being profitable is far away cos even breaking even could be a problem... Where is the money going to come from should Roman pulls out or suddenly pass away? How about the $500 to $600 million that is still owe to him? Chelsea is going to have to work their socks off to pay back this amount to him or someone who inherit his estate should anything happens to him...</p>
              <p>The Arabs will be the same as well... In time, maybe in 5 to 10 yrs down the road, they could lose interest as well...  </p>

              <p><br>Err... I think you are seriously mistaken... Roman Abramovich didn't just 'donate' the sum free... He convert them into equities... All £370m of their $700m debt...</p>
              <p>Technically, it's like a financial massage only... Cos they didn't need to pay any interest on their loan from him either... It's only to make the figures appear better for the club record books... And should he suddenly pass-away, whoever inherit his estate or himself one day in the future, would still expect to get paid should they cash in on these equities...</p>
              <p>And I am guessing the loan amount should still be in the region of $300 plus million rather than the $200m you mentioned...</p>
