The 31-year-old will leave Real Madrid at the end of the season after signing a deal worth $55m a year to play in Major League Soccer. "Of course it's a huge amount of money... an amazing amount," Beckham told ABC News' Good Morning America. "I'm going for the life, for my kids and my wife to enjoy it, but the main thing for me is to improve the soccer and to be part of history."<br><br>The former England captain reiterated that his move was not financially driven, although he admitted some people were amused by his new salary. "I said yesterday and some people laughed at me, but this move for me is not about the money," he continued. "I think soccer can be a lot bigger in the US. From a young age kids are brought up with soccer, then they seem to go into other areas. "Hopefully that's what I'll be there for, to pass my experience on to them."<br><br>Beckham is reported to have turned down offers in England in order to play in the US, a decision which did not surprise his former manager <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson. </strong>"I anticipated that. It was to be expected he would go to America," said the United boss. "Having played for us and deep down being a United fan he would not have come back to another English club. "We wish him well. He was a terrific player for United. It is a big career change, playing for Real Madrid and going to America.<br><br>"His position at Madrid has probably accelerated the move. He has only played a few games this season and he cannot be happy with that. Every top player wants to play."<br><br>Real president Ramon Calderon described Beckham as a "gentleman" and said he understood the midfielder's decison not to sign a new contract after falling out of favour with manager Fabio Capello. "We have to thank Beckham for being a gentleman in the four years he has been at Real Madrid," Calderon told the Real Madrid website.<br><br>"Beckham's agent told us that they had a very interesting offer and in the end, it has been the best situation for both parties and we must celebrate it.<br>Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas described his team-mate as a "magnificent person". "It's a pity," said Casillas. "Those of us who have known him believe him to be a great player and a great professional. He has given everything to Real Madrid.<br><br>"I feel fortunate to have known him because he is a magnificent person. We are happy for him but equally sad because he is an example for everyone of us."<br><br></div>
