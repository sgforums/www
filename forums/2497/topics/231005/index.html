Beckham told Reuters: "This week Real asked me to make a decision regarding my future and the offer to extend my contract for a further two seasons.<br><br>"After considering several options to stay in Madrid or join other major British and European teams, I have decided to join LA Galaxy." Beckham left Manchester United in July 2003 to sign for Real, who paid Â£25m for the midfielder's services.

The gaffe took the strained relationship between the two sides to breaking point, increasing the chances "Golden Balls" will reject Real's offer of a two-year contract.<br><br>Sources close to Beckham say there is no chance of him leaving this month. But his advisers, who will meet Madrid officials this afternoon, say the 31-year-old is being courted by several Premiership clubs, thought to include Everton, Tottenham, Bolton and West Ham.<br><br>Beckham has been stalling on signing the new deal in Spain because he is desperate for first team football and is unwilling to spend two more years on the bench. His spokesman added: "There's a great offer on the table from Real Madrid, but there are also great offers from Italy, France, Britain and America.<br><br>"We'll be having a meeting with Real. After that there will be a clearer view of where David's future lies after this season." Inter, AC Milan and Lyon will also have been alerted by Real's clumsy handling of the contract issue.<br><br>But the most likely destination for Beckham remains Los Angeles Galaxy. Football runs from April to October in the US, so it is possible Beckham could leave Madrid in May and play for Galaxy for most of the MLS season.<br><br>The idea of a move to California also appeals because of the lifestyle it would allow his family and the proximity of his David Beckham Academy, which was launched at the LA Galaxy stadium.<br><br>Beckham was bemused by news Mijatovic told Sky Italia that Madrid's offer of a new two-year deal had been shelved. When Beckham's representatives spoke to Mijatovic, he told them he had been misquoted and had simply said no contract had been agreed yet.<br><br><strong>Real scored own goal ? </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

No. I have never had any regrets throughout my life and career and I never want to. "I moved to Real Madrid in 2003. I have to say thank you to Florentino Perez for giving me the chance to actually play for this huge team and to play in that white shirt was an honor for four years.<br><br>"To play with the players I have played with, to play with Zidane was the biggest honor I have had in my career, to play with the likes of Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos you know, for me, there is no regrets there.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>HUGE DEAL</strong> </span><br><br>His deal is reported to be one of the biggest in global sport with Beckham set to earn more than $250 million over the duration of his contract following the removal of the salary cap in the MLS. Beckham will earn approximately <span style="font-style: italic;">one million dollars a week. </span><br><br>LA Galaxy had made public their interest in Beckham who runs a football academy that shares its home with the team and who has close links to the Anschutz Entertainment Group who own the club.<br><br>"David Beckham coming to MLS might be viewed by some as one of the most important moments for soccer in this country and perhaps the history of professional sport," MLS Commissioner Don Garber said in a statement. "David transcends the sport and is a cultural icon. David is clearly one of the most recognizable athletes in the world. People are going to feel really good about David Beckham spending the rest of his career in the U.S."<br><br>The news ends months of speculation about the future of the midfielder whose contract with Real expires at the end of the season.<br><br></div>
