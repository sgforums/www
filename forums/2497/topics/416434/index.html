              <p>Alex supposed to go for surgery, why is he still playing? He is clearly struggling and unfit to play on. I think he get injection to play on. I guess he delayed his surgery as Terry is out for quite a while.</p>

              <p>Before the match, I thought this would be an easy match for Chelsea cos Newcastle are without their 2 usual centre-backs and oldie Sol Campbell was playing his first match of the season...</p>
              <p>I didn't watch the front cos i thought this was a foregone conclusion so when I turn on to catch the match half way into the 2nd half with about 30 mins left, I was like, Wah... 1-1 Newcastle can still score one... Later I just saw how they got their goal...</p>
              <p>I guess a disappointing result for the Blues... And I am still wondering how come Lotti still haven't got the sack cos Roman normally won't accept this kind of results, 4 points from 15 kind... I think Scolari also didn't do that bad during their bad patch...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">CARLO ANCELOTTI hopes to have John Terry and Frank Lampard back in action next week to kick-start Chelsea's faltering title bid.</h2>
              <p>Blues captain Terry has missed the last three games with a nerve problem in his leg, while Lampard has been a long-term absentee with a groin injury.</p>
              <p>However, boss Ancelotti claims both are expected to resume training this week, and Terry in particular could be available for next weekend's clash with Everton.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: "Next week will be an important week for Terry and Lampard. They will start to train with the team.</p>
              <p>"We have a week to control their condition and I hope both, maybe more John Terry than Lampard, will be able to play against Everton.</p>
              <p>"They are very important players, not just technically, but because they have personality and character, and at the moment, we need to have that kind of player at our disposal."</p>
              <p>The news will come as a boost to the Blues, who had Salomon Kalou to thank for salvaging a point in the 1-1 draw with Newcastle at St James' Park.</p>
              <p>That result extended their league run to just one win in five attempts, a return which leaves them in second place.</p>
              <p>But Ancelotti remains hopeful his side will bounce back from their latest slump. He added: "It is important.</p>
              <p>"At the moment, it is not so easy and it is an opportunity to show our character and our personality and it will be a good motivation to do better.</p>
              <p>"We created a lot of chances but needed to convert more to win this game.</p>
              <p>"The reason for this result is the same — at the moment we are unable to convert our chances."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Brazilian defender Alex is expected to return to his homeland for knee surgery this week after delaying the operation in Terry's absence.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti added: "He will have the operation this week. He will go to Brazil for the surgery, maybe tomorrow."</p>
