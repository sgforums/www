              <p class="fecha">Realmadrid.com</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Real
              Madrid have agreed to transfer Robson da Souza Robinho to Manchester
              City. Based on prior events, such as statements made by the player, a
              decision taken by the coach, and a new offer on behalf of Manchester
              City, the club decided to transfer Robinho to the English side. <br> <br> The decision was made after taking into consideration all the human and
              sporting factors related to the case and while also considering the
              criteria set forth by the sporting director, coach, and secretary
              general of the club.<br> <br> The Board of Directors would like to reiterate the faith it has in the
              current squad and its ability to reach new heights in the sport.
              Finally, Real Madrid would like to wish Robinho the best of luck in
              future endeavors.</p>

              <h1>Chelsea left red-faced as Real Madrid agree to sell Brazil striker Robinho to Manchester City <br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1051563/Chelsea-left-red-faced-Real-Madrid-agree-sell-Brazil-striker-Robinho-Manchester-City.html"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09_01/RobinhoG0109_482x449.jpg" border="0" alt="Robinho" width="482" height="449"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid have confirmed they have agreed to sell Robinho to Manchester City, for a fee thought to be £32.5million. The Brazilian forward, a long-term target for Chelsea, must now agree personal terms with City if he is to complete a shock move.</strong>  </p>
              <p>A statement on Real's official website, www.realmadrid.com, tonight read: 'Real Madrid and Manchester City have reached an agreement for the transfer of Robinho. </p>
              <p>'Real Madrid have finally decided tonight to transfer Robson da Souza - Robinho - to Manchester City.' </p>
              <p>The news comes on the day Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment began the process to take over at City, entering a period of due diligence. Robinho's proposed move to Eastlands will have stunned Chelsea, who remained confident of signing the Brazilian early this evening.</p>
              <p>Blues boss Luiz Felipe Scolari viewed his compatriot as key to fulfilling his brief of producing attacking football at Stamford Bridge. But Real appeared unwilling to do business with Chelsea and criticised the manner of their pursuit yesterday.<br><br>The 24-year-old, capped 42 times, took the unusual step of calling a press conference yesterday morning when he reiterated his desire to join the Blues. Real blocked the move but Chelsea remained confident they would capture the former Santos marksman - until City's astonishing intervention tonight.<br><br>Bankrolled by Abu Dhabi United Group's takeover, City capped a remarkable transfer deadline day by offering £32.4million - with Real accepting. City had earlier grabbed the headlines by attempting to hi-jack Dimitar Berbatov's transfer to Manchester United but when the Bulgarian opted for Old Trafford they moved instead for Robinho.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid's decision to accept City's offer for Robinho was made for both<br>'sporting and human' reasons, the Spanish club's president Ramon Calderon has<br>said. 'We have sold Robinho for reasons of a human nature and for sporting reasons. The fact that he has accepted an offer from Manchester City says that he is not going for sporting reasons,' Calderon told Spanish television station Veo.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/09/02/article-1051563-018CC81600000578-5_468x488.jpg" alt="ramon calderon" width="468" height="488"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>'It's an important sum of money. It's not the objective of Real Madrid to sell players, neither do we need the money, but for reasons of human and sporting nature, it has been decided this is for the best.</strong><br><br>'It's a decision agreed by all the coaching staff, who understand it is best for the player and for the club. '(Coach Bernd) Schuster thought until yesterday that he could recover the player, but that has not been the case. Every time I have spoken with him he was very sad, crying and asking to leave Spain. Real Madrid are more important than any one player. 'He's a great kid, but badly advised.'</p>

              <p>I belief it was more than just money that got Robinho to City... Roman even made a last min call to the Real president but that guy just rejected him... Roman had the money, it was just Real wasn't happy with the way Kenyon behave these past few days leading up to the D day...</p>
              <p>Kenyon's behaviour was arrogant towards Real... He probably felt that no one else had the money to get Robinho. But a sudden change of ownership at City changed everything and caught everyone by surprise... Even United, who almost lost Berbatov to them.</p>
              <p>The one thing I just don't understand was... while Berbatov rejected a move to City, why did Robinho went along with the City deal? What happen to his "I want to play for Chelsea" thing?</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, I belief its the players choice of where they want to go... I must admit that the Robinho's move even caught me by surprise... I expected him to be at Chelsea by today honestly... cos there was no news of a City bid at all throughout the week... and no other club was in for him only Chelsea.</p>

              <p>Yea that was my thoughts too.. Money can buy sure, Berba also can afford mah but the thing is, Berba was for sure wanting to go MUFC, but Robinho to City? He's missing out on Champions League football.. There has to be an ulterior motive.. A pull factor.. Push factor from Real is just not convincing enough.. Hmm..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually, I don't think it was a big lost to Chelsea if base on player wise cos I still feel Robinho is overrated... Though I am not so sure why Scolari rated him so highly. The only thing that they lose out on was, if they knew earlier and had more time... They could get someone else in instead. But now its over and closed so they will have to make do with what they have which isn't bad we must say... and off course, their face factor...</p></div>
