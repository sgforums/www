              <p><strong>Manchester City could have just three fit defenders for Saturday's Premier League crunch with Chelsea. After Wednesday's 2-1 Carling Cup defeat at West Brom, Roberto Mancini revealed he is desperately short of defensive options for the visit of Carlo Ancelotti's men.</strong></p>
              <p>Unless Micah Richards recovers from a hamstring injury that kept him out at The Hawthorns, Mancini will have only Pablo Zabaleta, Vincent Kompany and Kolo Toure available to face the only side left with a 100% record.</p>
              <p>"We have big problems," he said. "I hope that Micah Richards can recover. If not I don't know who can play left-back."</p>
              <p>The obvious inference is that should Richards miss out, Zabaleta will play on the right side and City would look for an alternative on the left flank.</p>
              <p>That could either involve Adam Johnson being pressed into emergency service, or more likely a midfield such as James Milner or Gareth Barry.</p>
              <p>Either way, further injury fears shaped Mancini's team selection at The Hawthorns where, having taking a first-half lead through Jo, City were undone by two goals in as many minutes from Gianni Zuiverloon and Simon Cox.</p>
              <p>"We couldn't take any risks," he said "If I had more players available it would be a different team. "But when you play like us and Chelsea, on Saturday at 12.45, the time to recover is very short.</p>
              <p>"They would need minimum three days so to play tonight would have been dangerous."</p>
              <p>It is to be hoped owner Sheikh Mansour understands the dilemma. After spending £1billion on City in just over two years, he was presumably hoping for an early end to the club's lengthy trophy drought.</p>
              <p>That now cannot happen until May at the earliest, although Mancini has no regrets.</p>
              <p>"I don't regret making the changes," he said. "Saturday is more important, the FA Cup is more important. The Europa League is more important.</p>
              <p>"I did not regard this as a necessary sacrifice. We wanted to win. That is why I had four senior players on the bench. "But I knew there was a chance we could lose because we started with six young players.</p>
              <p>"I am happy with these guys. We might have lost the game but they can improve. If they do not play tonight, when will they ever play?"</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Frank Lampard is almost certain to miss Chelsea's next three matches because of his slow progress recovering from a hernia operation.</strong></p>
              <p>The 32-year-old was hoping to return for Chelsea's crunch games in the next 10 days with Manchester City and Arsenal, plus Marseille in the Champions League, as well as England's Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro on October 12.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">But he is understood to have suffered a setback in training and is now in serious danger of missing all three matches, ruling out any possibility of proving his fitness before England manager Fabio Capello names his squad on October 4.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Lampard had surgery on his groin at the start of the month in the belief that he would be back for the Barclays Premier League encounter at West Ham two weeks ago.</p>
              <p>The delay adds to manager Carlo Ancelotti's mounting injury list after losing Salomon Kalou and Yossi Benayoun, as well as Gael Kakuta, to injury during Wednesday night's Carling Cup defeat by Newcastle.</p>
              <p>Lampard will also be nervous about England in the wake of Steven Gerrard's commanding display in his absence in central midfield this season. The clamour for Lampard to be demoted to the role of Gerrard's understudy will intensify if the Liverpool captain continues to excel alongside Gareth Barry.</p>

              <p><br> </p>
              <p><strong>Roberto Mancini has already conceded the Premier League title to Chelsea. Mancini's Manchester City side tackle the champions at Eastlands on Saturday with a patched-up side containing just three fully-fit senior defenders.</strong></p>
              <p>It is hardly the backdrop he wanted heading into one of the key games of the campaign, and not one that was anticipated when City were spending in excess of £100million this summer.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">However, according to Mancini, the result will not have an affect on where the championship ends up this season.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'Chelsea are the best team in the Premier League at the moment,' he said. 'They are probably going to win the Premier League title easily.</p>
              <p>'They are a strong team, who have been playing together for many years. They have a fantastic manager and they have worked to reach this situation.'</p>
              <p>Chelsea certainly could not have started the season in better form and have registered a perfect 15 points from their opening five games, scoring a hatful of goals in the process.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">It seems Mancini does feel City are years behind Chelsea at present, even if they are making ground up fast.</p>
              </div>
              <p>'We must work hard to be their equals,' he said. 'We can be a strong club in one or two years. But we must improve, month after month, year after year.'</p>
              <p>The City faithful might not be impressed by such talk. In midweek the Blues crashed out of the Carling Cup, a competition that many felt was the easiest way of ending a trophy drought that dates back to 1976.</p>
              <p>'With the problems at this moment we couldn't play in four competitions,' said Mancini.</p>
              <p>Given the squad building they have undergone in the last couple of years, few will shed any tears at Mancini's complaints at being short of so many players.</p>
              <p>Yet when he was assiduously piecing together his squad this summer, he did so on the basis he was buying for the future, as well as the present, believing the day would come when City could hold their heads up alongside Chelsea as one of the Premier League's top dogs.</p>
              <p>'We have got strong players but we have also got young players,' he said. 'We have one of the youngest squads in the Premier League.</p>

              <p><strong>'David Silva and Yaya Toure played in the Champions League for many years, Mario Balotelli won it with Inter, Aleksandar Kolarov and Jerome Boateng are international players. We have bought strong players. When they play together we can change everything.'</strong></p>
              <p>However, Kolarov and Balotelli are out with long-term injuries after playing just one match. Boateng has not even managed that yet after aggravating a knee injury in a collision with an in-flight trolley.</p>
              <p>Boateng has finally managed to get a full week's training under his belt but is badly lacking match practice.</p>
              <p>Yet such is Mancini's desperate need for defenders, down to just three fit ones at the last count, he is among the options to fill the left-back role, along with the equally rusty Joleon Lescott, youngster Dedryck Boyata, James Milner and Gareth Barry.</p>
              <p>'Joleon has worked with us for one day. He is not ready to play 90 minutes,' said Mancini.</p>
              <p>'Jerome has been working with us for one week. He is not ready to play 100 per cent.</p>
              <p>'I do not know what I am going to do just yet. I will speak with Joleon and Jerome, but if they are not available I am not sure. Maybe Boyata, but I am not sure.'</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor should be fit enough to make the bench after a recent spell on the sidelines with a dead leg.</p>
              <p>However, with Shaun Wright-Phillips joining Aleksandar Kolarov and Mario Balotelli on the sidelines with a knee injury, Mancini cannot believe his squad has so rapidly been torn apart.</p>
              <p>'I am disappointed we have all these injuries at the moment,' he said. 'I only have 11 players who are 100 per cent fit.'</p>

              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Cech: We'll Kill Off City Today<br></h1>
              <p><img style="width: 280px; height: 390px;" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01132/cech_13_280x390_1132347a.jpg" alt="TIME TO DELIVER ... Cech reckons title rivals City must start winning trophies now"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">PETR CECH says Manchester City can have no excuses if they fail to repay Sheikh Mansour's millions with a trophy this season. And he reckons Chelsea will put a major dent in the title ambitions of Roberto Mancini's team if they win at Eastlands today.</h2>
              <p>With the Premier League campaign only five games old, the Blues keeper feels that today's clash is already make-or-break for City's big-time ambitions.</p>
              <p>He said: "If we can win this game against City, we will be 10 points ahead of them and that is a big advantage at any stage of the season.</p>
              <p>"We would regard that as a huge help in putting one of our rivals behind us for the rest of the campaign."</p>
              <p>The Czech international has watched the City revolution with keen interest since Sheikh Mansour launched his £220million takeover two years ago. And he is still not sure they have `what it takes to succeed, despite spending almost £350m on new players in the last two years.</p>
              <p>Cech added: "You can buy all the best players in the world, have a great squad, great stadium, top manager and fantastic facilities. "But money alone cannot buy success. You need spirit and atmosphere in the dressing room and in the club generally to make the team successful.</p>
              <p>"It's down to the players at City to build that but, right now, they have more pressure on them to deliver than ever before. "For the past two years, they've spent lots of money but everyone was prepared to say, 'City are in transition, it will take time'.</p>
              <p>"Now they don't have any more excuses. They can't say, 'We have a lot of new players and need time to settle'.</p>
              <p>"City have everything set up to win the league. Now all they need is some momentum on the pitch. "We are starting a period of the season when the top teams have a lot of big games and you need the whole squad to be ready to play.</p>
              <p>"Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal are all used to playing in these situations but City have never had to cope with it before, so only time will tell if they are serious title contenders this season."</p>
              <p>One City player who has impressed Cech with the way he has handled the pressure in recent weeks is goalkeeper Joe Hart.</p>
              <p>England ace Hart, 23, has broken into the first team for club and country this term.</p>
              <p>Cech said: "It's been difficult for him because he has had to show everyone that he deserves to play ahead of such a highly-rated keeper as Shay Given. "He started with a fantastic game at Tottenham and then he really came into the spotlight when he started playing for the national team.</p>
              <p>"So now, all of a sudden, everyone is looking at him in a different light. "He's no longer just one of the candidates for an international call-up, he is the No 1 for England and for a club with huge ambitions.</p>
              <p>"He has much more pressure on him now but has done really well so far."</p>
              <p>Cech, 28, needs no reminding that City were the only team to beat Chelsea home and away last season. And he insists there will be no further slip-ups this afternoon as Carlo Ancelotti's team look to maintain their 100 per cent start to the Premier League season.</p>
              <p>Cech recalled: "We made too many mistakes in both games. "In the away game, I made a mistake for their second goal and we missed a penalty.</p>
              <p>"And, at Stamford Bridge, we allowed Bellamy and Tevez to have so many counter-attacks and were caught three times, even though they were not dominating."</p>
              <p>Cech has seen his Chelsea team-mates burying their opponents in a blizzard of attacking football this season. And he reckons he is probably the only man at the club who is not encouraging his colleagues to keep piling forward.</p>
              <p>He added: "It's very difficult to keep the balance when we are winning 3-0 or 4-0 and everyone is excited to see more and more goals.</p>
              <p>"Of course it's nice to watch everyone down at the other end of the pitch and attracted to going forward. All the people in the stadium are happy and smiling.</p>
              <p>"But I am never happy when I concede. When Scotty Parker scored a brilliant goal in the last minute for West Ham, you could see by my reaction I was angry, even though we won 3-1.</p>
              <p>"Luckily, at Chelsea, we have really disciplined and organised players and we all know it's just as important to keep a clean sheet.</p>
              <p>"You can only build a team from defending well because, if you score two goals, you know at the back of your mind that the game is locked up. "But if the situation is the other way around and you go on the pitch thinking that two goals isn't enough because you always concede three, then even 2-0 isn't an easy score.</p>
              <p>"You know that teams who are not good defensively have an anxiety which you never see in Chelsea's game. "The main focus for Chelsea is always on winning the game. And the start of this season has been perfect in every way."</p>

              <p>The Stamford Bridge boss claimed City "have a lot of quality to fight for the title," after Carlos Tevez struck just before the hour for the only goal at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>He continued: "We didn't play how we wanted. We suffered from the pressure in midfield Man City put on us. We did not have the possibility to show our quality.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti tried to deflect criticism for replacing a bemused Didier Drogba with former home favourite Daniel Sturridge in the 75th minute but revealed the Ivorian was not injured.</p>
              <p>"It was a tactical decision," he revealed. "I wanted to use the speed of Sturridge on the right side."</p>
              <p>City boss Roberto Mancini said: "Our guys today played a strong, strong match.</p>
              <p>"We closed all the space for them and when we had the chance we played football."</p>
