              <p>I thought Chelsea played well but City just played better today...</p>
              <p>Missing was Chelsea's free-flowing attacking football that they displayed in their first 5 epl matches... Actually they seemed quite nervous to me from the start...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I feel City do deserve their victory and I was most impress with their 19 yrs old right-back... I was going oh my, such a big match and here was a young untested right-back going up against the free scoring Chelsea... But what a job he did on Drogba and Malouda... And yeah, that Ramires was really poor... I think he needs a lot more training...</p>
              <p>But this isn't the shock result of the day... Try looking at <span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal vs West Bromwich... Arsenal at home somemore. But match still not over so still got chance to come back.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">So I guess the CL got it's effect... cos Spurs also down by one to WH on 78 mins.</span></p>

Should have gone with 3 or even 4 upfornt, cos lose by 1 or 3 is still lose... 3 strikers might have given them a better chance at the end... What was that young boy for anyway... ? Did he do anything worthwhile? This was the strangest decision I seen Lotti made to date...</p></div>

              <h2>MANCINI STILL TIPPING CHELSEA</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/10/09/240/Carlos-Tevez-Man-City-Chelsea-Premier-League-_2507277.jpg" border="0" alt="Carlos Tevez is mobbed after scoring."></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Roberto Mancini</strong> is still tipping Chelsea to win the Premier League despite his Manchester City side ending the champions' 100% start to the season at Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Mancini raised eyebrows on the eve of the game when he claimed the Londoners were the best in England and would retain their title "easily".</p>
              <p>It was a startling claim from someone who has spent more than £100million on his own squad this summer.</p>
              <p>Yet even after Carlos Tevez had scored an excellent second-half winner to give City their third straight win against Chelsea after completing the double last term, Mancini did not change his view.</p>
              <p>"I still think they will win it easily because I think they are the best team in the Premier League," he said.</p>
              <p>"It is not possible for them to score five goals every game.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes you might get a result like this. But they are the better team."</p>

              <p>This Mancini played his mind games well...  First he build up Chelsea by saying so much this week like they are the favourite for the title and they will win it easily... Then when he put all the pressure on them, he go out and take them down...</p>
              <p>I must say this Mancini is very brave... First he go with Hart rather than Given when many would have gone with. Then today he throw in a 19 yrs old to take on Chelsea... Another very brave call to make.</p>
              <p>Looks like he won the battle of the Italians again... And he always seem to put one over Lotti, whether it's Inter v AC or City vs Chelsea... lol.</p>

              <p>would anyone with a sound brain, spent $100m in the summer and under pressure from his bosses to deliver, say anything stupid to jeopardise his team's chances?</p>
              <p>When he first came, he said that city has a chance to win the premier league despite being quite far off the first spot. Maybe he realised by telling the media that, the written reports put a lot of pressure on the players. So now he realises how important it is to make sure the team plays free of that.</p>
              <p>Now he further goes on to say that he believes chelsea will still win the EPL, haha.....words are cheap but heap a whole lot of pressure, so why not?</p>

Maybe they are good at playing the weak teams but when the better ones throw in vital tackles here and there, they are not able to respond. Well, chelsea v arsenal next week.

              <p><br>Yeah I agree with this statement... They just didn't had their usual flow... It was kind of weird when Drogba and Malouda didn't seem to post any real threat to City at all throughout the whole match...</p>
              <p>And I thought taking out Drogba, who looked kind of surprise by it was also not a good decision.</p>
              <p>This match is not just a 3 point or some call 6 pointer but more importantly, it also takes away the perceived invincibility some have come to think about them cos of their start to this season...</p>
              <p>Anyway, a good match to watch though not many goal mouth action...</p>
