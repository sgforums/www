              <p><strong>Cesc Fabregas sees no reason why Arsenal cannot now go on to complete a Champions League and Barclays Premier League double after knocking out European Cup holders AC Milan in the San Siro - although manager Arsene Wenger also wants to keep everyone focused and their feet firmly on the ground.</strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners produced a near-perfect, battling display, as they closed down the Italians at every chance on Tuesday night en route to recording a 2-0 second leg victory following the goalless draw at The Emirates.</p>
              <p>It was a performance which will have sent a stern message across Europe that the young Gunners are now without question a force to the reckoned with this season.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have a one-point lead at the top of the Premier League and Fabregas sees no reason why they cannot stay on course for both domestic and European success.</p>
              <p>"We do not have 25 internationals like Chelsea so we were never going to be able to challenge for all four trophies - but we are still in contention for the two which really matter," he insisted.</p>
              <p>"We are top of the Premier League and through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League after beating the holders at home, so why can't we win them both?"</p>
              <p>Wenger firmly believes his youngsters have what it takes to go all the way to Moscow, but knows it will not be an easy path for the 2006 Champions League finalists.</p>
              <p>He said: "The competition is very hard now. It is a cup competition and you have to take it like that. "We will go for it - we are in the quarter-final, so why should we not believe we can do it. "The growing process of a team is a bit like a wave, it goes up suddenly, then down with a few bad results, then it goes up high again.</p>
              <p>"This game was of huge significance for my team because in between they did not deliver a convincing result. "Subconsciously for the team, it was very important to see how good they are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Milan boss Carlo Ancelotti accepted Arsenal deserved their place in the last eight, and are genuine contenders. He said: "Arsenal are a strong team and played with great courage and have shown they have the qualities to reach the final of the Champions League.</p>
              <p>"Now our aim is the fourth place in the Italian league and we will do our best to reach this. "We have won so much lately, so one lost game is nothing if you think about what we have done. "So we will all continue on to pursue our goals."</p>
