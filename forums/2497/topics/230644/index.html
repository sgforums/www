It is Sir Jack's football club and if he chooses not to sell it at this time, that's his prerogative. He can do what he wants.<br><br>"I have a partner and I see the club having vast potential and I would put more money into it - if I got the opportunity.<br><br>"This is not a Johnny Foreigner coming along to make a quick buck. But Jez has told me the offer wasn't acceptable. That's the end of the matter but it is there on the table."<br><br>When questioned about the reports in the Daily Mirror, Moxey said: "It is not true that we are in negotiations with Graeme Souness or anyone connected to him.<br><br>"However, we do not want to conduct our business through the media and, as is company policy, will only comment on important matters when we have something substantive to report."<br><br>Souness attended Wolves' game against Barnsley at Molineux on New Year's Day as a guest of the club after meeting Moxey on a flight back from Florida.<br><br></div>
