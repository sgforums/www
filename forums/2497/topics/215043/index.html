            <div class='col-md body'>International football will be destroyed if Belgian club Charleroi win a landmark court case, says European football's governing body Uefa.<br><br>Charleroi are suing world body Fifa after player Abdelmajid Oulmers was injured playing for Morocco in 2004. Few countries could fund national teams if Charleroi won, Uefa told BBC Sport.<br><br>A spokesman said: "It would be the end of the national team game. A World Cup would take place with only Spain, Germany, Italy, France and England."<br><br>A Charleroi victory would mean clubs would become entitled to compensation while their players are away on international duty<br><br>The spokesman, William Gaillard, said international football was "in the end what people like the most".<br><br>Charleroi claim the loss of Oulmers damaged their hopes of winning the Belgian league title in 2004/5 and it wants compensation for having to pay the player's wages while he was out of action.<br><br>In May, the case was moved from a tribunal in Charleroi to the European Court of Justice, where it is waiting to be heard.<br><br>The club are being backed by the G14 group of clubs, who are unhappy with Fifa rules that players must be released for international football without entitlement to financial compensation.<br><br>A Charleroi victory "would be the end of national football for any football association outside of the big five in Europe," Gaillard said.<br><br>"I was talking to Brazilian, Scandinavian and Eastern European football experts, and they all said we would never see our stars playing for the national team again.<br><br>"A World Cup would take place with only Spain, Germany, Italy, France and England and that would be the end.<br><br>"There's no way the Brazilian FA could pay for one fifth of the players."<br><br>Newcastle are negotiating with the Football Association for compensation after Michael Owen was injured playing for England during the World Cup.<br><br>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger this week weighed into the debate by likening international coaches to joyriders.<br><br>"What the national coaches are doing is like taking the car from his (club manager's) garage without even asking his permission," Wenger said.<br><br>"They'll then use his car for 10 days and abandon it in a field without any petrol left in the tank.<br><br>"We then have to recover it, but it is broken down. Then, a month later, they'll come to take your car again -and for good measure you're expected to be nice about it."<br></div>
