              <p>playing the S league are not going to improve the Singapore
              teams. they dun seem to mind  winning or losing in the S
              league. most of them their mind will be on quickly finish this
              match and i'll be home to watch my EPL match on a saturday
              night.</p>
              <p>even the commentator said that sg team are basically walking and
              ball watching most of the time. the ball always lost in the 3rd
              pass.</p>
              <p>as i said before, if last night keeper is lionel lewis, we would
              have lost 8-0. the keeper is working extra hard because the
              defenders did not improve at all.</p>

              <p>Not maybe. We improved, but the Saudis improved faster. Maybe not faster, but they understood how we might have exploited any of their loopholes the last time, and closed it up. In that sense, it is totally unreasonable to say that we have not improved at all.</p>

For starters I would say thank god they are no longer in the Malaysia Cup and then with the FTs playing for Singapore.Nothing to be as many countries uses FTs these days cuz the also want to improve.To say that Singapore Soccer has not improve not one bit is just unjustifiable and that is why you need to start enjoying  ping pong cuz lioness also do play ping pong and they seldom lose.</p>

              <p>Besides exaggerating and hoping your home team falls flat on
              their faces what nice things can you say about the Lions? For
              starters I would say thank god they are no longer in the Malaysia
              Cup and then with the FTs playing for Singapore.Nothing to be as
              many countries uses FTs these days cuz the also want to improve.To
              say that Singapore Soccer has not improve not one bit is just
              unjustifiable and that is why you need to start enjoying  ping
              pong cuz lioness also do play ping pong and they seldom lose.</p>

              <p>ok im looking at the match objectively, Singapore is STILL the team that packs up and go home after the first half coz our fitness really like shiet. we did improve our midfield and attacking since the last time we got trashed by malaysia...thats probably how we won the last few tiger cups. raddy did instilled teamwork in the players, that's how we got the good results against iraq, china and won lebanon. however, if anyone expects us to win Uzbeks or Saudis, both had qualified for world cup before...i'd say fat fat FAT hope.</p>
              <p>gota improve on the fitness and defense, time to hire some ang moh fitness guru.</p>
