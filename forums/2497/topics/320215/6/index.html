              <p>To have the right to tell me that, you have to be a politician or be involved in politics first. And anyway, I have studied modules on politics at the university level. I've written and gotten an A- for my politics essay. So tell me, what have you accomplished to possess the right to put forward the above passage to me?</p>
              <p>But I've the right to tell you that your talk is cheap in this thread because I have represented Singapore and you have not. This is talking from the viewpoints and opinions of a ex-national representative(no, it's not sports) on your posts on fellow Singaporeans representatives wearing the national blazer. And that's the difference. You have totally disregarded the improvements from the hard work of people who are representing Singapore and slogging themselves out while you are just lazing away at a corner.</p>
              <p>The improvements might be small and might be insufficient, that I agreed with you. However, you are totally disregarding any improvements, although they might be very small.</p>
              <p> Let's recap:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>sorry no 4-0 scoreline, the best i can find is as above, still i
                                                              dont see we are how in 2007 we can get 1:2 and 2008 we lost 2:0
                                                              home and away as improvement.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It's ironic how you can use the scoreline as a support for you that there has been no improvements, yet tell me that</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>u claim singapore improve, in your opinion yes because u base on
                                                  we qualify for the first time the second qualifying round. i say
                                                  not so, coz qualifying is depend on who you play the previous
                                                  round.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, you said that</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>give credit for being lousy?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>and you tell me later that "i never say singapore are poor"</p>

              <p>well eagle, dont you think guus hiddink was well sought after manager because he is stern disciplinarian too? did you think he has any good to say about his own russia team after they lose 4-1 to spain? want me to quote what he say? and where is russia now? they have just qualify for the euro08 quarterfinals.</p>
              <p>a strong minded player will excel to prove critics wrong, while a weak one get weaker.</p>
              <p>maybe you are like steve mc claren style, keeping optimism and praising player dispite playing badly. get the team in a false impression they are fine and in the end. the england team never qualify and the manager got fired!</p>

              <p>Glad you understood this. Now back to the point, how can Singapore not have improved when they showed you their <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">result</span></strong> of qualifying for this stage of the world cup, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which they have never done before?</span></p>

              <p>well eagle, dont you think guus hiddink was well sought after manager because he is stern disciplinarian too? did you think he has any good to say about his own russia team after they lose 4-1 to spain? want me to quote what he say? and where is russia now? they have just qualify for the euro08 quarterfinals.</p>
              <p>a strong minded player will excel to prove critics wrong, while a weak one get weaker.</p>
              <p>maybe you are like steve mc claren style, keeping optimism and praising player dispite playing badly. get the team in a false impression they are fine and in the end. the england team never qualify and the manager got fired!</p>

              <p><br>Playing badly and playing at a new level, stage, where Singapore has never been at before, are totally different. No use drawing parallels between them.</p>

              <p>you are the one who say, i never represent singapore and why i am talking about soccer. but i had play at military unit level. counted? because by studying politics on a modules that is to say theorical, can criticise a govt policy, that to say, i had play soccer and should be more qualify to talk soccer, even though i never represent singapore. am i right?</p>

              <p>You still don't get the point.<br>Play at military unit level and comment about national level?</p>

              <p>Essay writing and commenting on politics in modules to essay writing and commenting on politics in forum on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">policies that affect us directly</span>?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One additional thing I forgot to mention earlier</p>
              <p>Politics is for the nation and it will affect our daily lives; everyone has the right to give comments.</p>
              <p>Soccer does not affect your daily life, and totally not giving credit when it is due, is something both you and me do not have the right to do so. The least you could do for someone else representing your country is to give some credit when it is really due. Your suggestions and comments on their fitness level were not wrong, and were not disagreed upon; it is your stand that they have not improved which I'm against.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But now, if you tell me Singapore start losing matches consistently to Thailand and Malaysia, then yes, they have not improved. I'm just as results-oriented as you in this manner. Fact is, they have won the Tiger Cup and move on to reach this stage of the WC.</p>
              <p>My stand is still the same. Singapore has improved, but it is still lousy.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Mr Reyes,you said that the National team should play like their lives depended on the match and I believe they did and lost,lets not forget they played against the likes of Uzkekistan and Saudi Arabia.We are talking Singapore soccer and not about their failure to qualify for 2010.Regional wise the Lions have proven to be champions and no matter how small that achievement may appear to you we stil have to give them credit for that.For the record, they got to this qualifying stage for the first time and so it is not wrong to say they have improved.</p></div>
