              <p>Think of this</p>
              <p>Supposed you fail your exams every single time (&lt;40% that kind), even though you studied damn hard. Then the next exam you suddenly passed even though most of your peers might be getting &gt;75%.</p>
              <p>What do you think the teacher or school or your parents will say to you? Praise? Or still scold you stupid?</p>
              <p>Let's be realistic. If there are improvements, then we will praise them. If they made a lot of careless mistakes, we shall condemn them. But if they are trying to outdo a much better team and failed, of course you would say they tried their best.</p>

              <p>i dont see singapore soccer team making progress.</p>
              <p>if we did improve, the other nation are making more progress than us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>precious are the worse. he has no pace and often been drawn out of position.</p>
              <p>the right back fail to track back to cover the overlapping saudis winger.</p>
              <p>the defender often take own time to cover their man, often seen them walking in own penalty area when the saudis are attacking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>overall, singapore players lack stamina, pace, power, strength, commitment.</p>
              <p>i suggest all singapore players to start gain weight build extra muscle, and focus more stamina and speed training.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for those who had praise singapore soccer team, either you had a low expectation or u dont know what we need to improve on.</p>

              <p>As expected, this group is a smooth transition period for both Uzb and saudi arabia. The other two teams are simply too weak for these two strong teams.</p>
              <p>Well, losing by 2 goals is actually normal. A team like saudi will never settle for a one-goal win as there is more risk. A team like manU will also not settle for a one-goal lead against a lousy club. Otherwise, suddenly the referee play dirty and give penalty to opposing team. haha 1-1 liao.</p>

              <h1>Saudi Arabia Down Singapore To Clinch Top Two Spot</h1>
              <h2>Saudi Arabia became the latest team to move into the final round of
              Asian qualification for the 2010 World Cup with a 2-0 win at Singapore
              on Saturday.</h2>
              <div class="C">
              <p>The result also means that Singapore’s faint hopes of reaching South Africa are officially dead.</p>
              <p>The win was a good start to Nasser Al Johar’s return to the Saudi
              hotseat as Brazilian Helio Dos Anjos was fired earlier in the week.</p>
              <p>Singapore started the game six points behind the second-placed Saudis and started the game at the National Stadium brightly.</p>
              <p>Saudi Arabia took the lead ten minutes before the break however.
              Saad Al Harthi fed Abdoh Autef and the midfielder made no mistake in
              shooting home.</p>
              <p>Despite the best efforts of Singapore, the Saudis sealed the win with 14 minutes remaining.</p>
              <p>Ahmed Al Fraidi’s fired a low shot into the net.</p>

              <p>was at the stadium as well...i will reserve judgement if this is really the last football match at the national stadium.....</p>
              <p>the match is a bore....testament why there are so many waves in the stadium.</p>
              <p>singapore would have lost by a few more if not for hassan sani's good pair of hands, he should be singapore's #1. the saudi keeper, on the hand, could have finished a harry porter novel on the side of the field. save for an early blitz by singapore in the 1st 15mins, the rest is rather singapore playing defensively.</p>
              <p>precious is so over-rated. good he may be in the s-league, but his lack of speed is telling as he gets side footed time and again in the game. he should be dropped.</p>
              <p>0-2 is no shame to singapore. but with half the team are `imported' players, i think things could have been better. neither was there any attachment to the team. the emotion isn't there. this is only a half national team.</p>

              <p>that miss really cause alot of fans to be pissed off.</p>
              <p>indra didn't even contribute in the 2nd half</p>
