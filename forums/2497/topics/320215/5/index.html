              <p>There are 2 ways you can play for another country other then the country of your birth:</p>
              <p>1) Prove your parentage, if your grandpa or grandma or father or mother or whatever is born in Papua New Guinea, you can choose to play for them based on parentage. But once you play for the national team for a country, you cannot play for another country ever.</p>
              <p>2) If you have not played for any national teams, you can renounce your citizenship in one country and take up the citizenship of another like what Singapore did.</p>
              <p>So every single FT that played in the Singapore National Team are Singapore Citizens and like all Singapore Citizens, we are not allowed to have Dual Citizenships so you are not allowed to hold 2 passports too. PRs is allowed to play in SLEAGUE but only CITIZENS can play in the national team.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>And to say they buy success may be abit harsh. Do note what they buy are potentials, not sure successes. To say they buy success would mean they buy tried and tested players. Li Jiawei was not anywhere near the top when she became a Singapore Citizen but she is now one of the top paddlers. So Singapore do invest alot in the training and development of the players and not just buy success. And of cos, as a singaporean, i still wish that one day i will be able to see a singapore born singaporean succeeding in the world stage of sports hehe. Anyway Remy Ong is singaporean born right and he has made us proud in the international bowling arena....</p></div>

              <p>Well, in my views... These bigger nations didn't went out of their way to get these"FT" in to play for them in the first place... If there was anything they did, they gave them an opportunity and help them develop their skill and potentials... and most of these have ancestral linkage like someone here mentionedÂ and could choose to play for either nations of their choice...</p>
              <p>On Sg ways, the FT that they brought in are either very old already or have pass their chance to represent their birth country... Some of these they brough in are consider not good enough in their home country that's why they are here...</p>
              <p>On some like Zidane, Eduardo and most of the Black French players, they went to that country before they even became football stars... They were in their youth when they left their country of birth for a new life in a new country... These country didn't go out of their way to nationalize them for their footballing talent unlike Singapore...</p>
              <p>I believe there are many so called "New Singapore Citizens" who are here only for the money or prize money... and when their time is up in the sports arena, be it Swimming, Badminton, Table-TennisÂ they go back to their country of origin again... I think its this kind of FT that the majority are not happy with... They just came to take and with no intention to give back...</p>
              <p>I see the happening and read the news of that young swimmer that Ang Peng Siong guided andÂ trained and i can't help but feel betrayed... Forget about asking forÂ loyally, it evidence even at such a young age, it all about money first... and sadly, she not the only one it seems... and when her time is up, we canÂ assume that she will just go back to China andÂ resume where her family have left off with all the new money they have made while being a FT in Sg as her dad and other sibling are still in China...</p>
              <p>Like what the Singapore NetballÂ President Ivy Singh-LimÂ said: 'I'm not against foreigners, But whats the point of imported glory?</p>

              <p><br>I don't think so lah... If Singaporean want to be a citizen of another country, they will demand that you give up your Sg citizen in order to make you think twice about it but it doesn't work the other way round tho...

              <p>a loser in my definition is when in the face of losing a match, still say we improve, we are alright and let move on. a winner is someone who lose a match, admit we are poor , what we need to improve further and get better.</p>
