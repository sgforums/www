              <p>Think of this</p>
              <p>Supposed you fail your exams every single time (&lt;40% that kind), even though you studied damn hard. Then the next exam you suddenly passed even though most of your peers might be getting &gt;75%.</p>
              <p>What do you think the teacher or school or your parents will say to you? Praise? Or still scold you stupid?</p>
              <p>Let's be realistic. If there are improvements, then we will praise them. If they made a lot of careless mistakes, we shall condemn them. But if they are trying to outdo a much better team and failed, of course you would say they tried their best.</p>

              <p><br>aiyah eagle, dun bother to aruge with pple like him. Singapore has definitely done a very good job. With Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan being one of the top teams in Asia, with our strength, it is already very commentable that we can reach this stage to fight with them.</p>
              <p>Our team is the champion of ASEAN and i bet when Singapore won the ASEAN football championship, dat guy dint even make a noise~ Our counterpart Thailand also didnt make it to the next stage u noe?</p>
              <p>WE are fighting against some of the Asia's very fine team. I ask zwei51, honestly have u watched the whole match between Uzbekistan VS Singapore, or Saudis VS Singapore? if ur answer is no, den i suggest u reserve the comments for yourself.</p>
              <p>Against Uzbekistan (a former Soviet Union country), they are playing Europe style of football, which Singapore football team has not much experience against. Against the Saudis, they are a very good attacking and defending team. Singapore has done their very best i must say. What WAS MOST commentable is that they still fought hard tooth and nail even though they are behind, 2 goals behind, 3 goals behind...blah blah blah. Were u there to cheer when Singapore had created scoring chances infront of Saudi's goalpost? Did u see how Singapore worked hard to try to pry open the Saudi and Uzbekistan defence? which many other countries even Japan or China the Asia top power house would find it difficult to pry it open????</p>
              <p>Singapore football has progressed from the 4-0 defeat of Malaysia to ASEAN champion, to top 20 teams of world cup qualifier. We can certainly do better, as we progress~</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>In my personal opinion, the lions have done quite a job so far. Yes, we may not be good enough but in terms of progressing, I think we are moving leh.. Just because we lost matches cannot say SG football cannot make it lah.. Its really unfair to the lions who gave their heart out.. Kudos for coming this far but I really really think the are better potential out there in SG.. Scouts are not looking hard enough. In fact, my question is, are there even any scouts? SG so small, cannot assemble a small team of scouts to go scout for better players meh? I think the problem in SG football lies in the talent scouting. If you got connections, you will get to play football. Otherwise, it's just typical Sunday football or school tournaments. But what to do, not say FAS also very rich mah want to invest so much into these talent scouting thingie..</p></div>

              <p>playing the S league are not going to improve the Singapore teams. they dun seem to mind  winning or losing in the S league. most of them their mind will be on quickly finish this match and i'll be home to watch my EPL match on a saturday night.</p>
              <p>even the commentator said that sg team are basically walking and ball watching most of the time. the ball always lost in the 3rd pass.</p>
              <p>as i said before, if last night keeper is lionel lewis, we would have lost 8-0. the keeper is working extra hard because the defenders did not improve at all.</p>
