              <p><span><strong>Listen and you might be able to hear the sound of Chelsea’s credibility crashing down around their ears. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The wild accusation that referee Mark Clattenburg hurled racist abuse at John Mikel Obi appears to be coming apart and it is taking the club’s reputation along with it. </span></p>
              <p><span>For unknown reasons that seem to defy any true appreciation of justice, Chelsea rushed into the public domain with claims that this experienced match official had racially abused two of their players during Sunday’s defeat by Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span>They claimed Juan Mata was called a ‘Spanish t***’ and —  staggeringly — that the referee told Mikel to ‘shut up, monkey’.</span></p>
              <p><span>They are charges so disgracefully damaging to Clattenburg, it is almost impossible to believe the Stamford Bridge board could proceed without making sure there was genuine substance to the claims.</span></p>
              <p><span>They will presumably have known how the stigma of any such charge would hang over the official. They would have been aware of the implications for the man and his career. But they did it anyway, two hours after losing a heated, bad-tempered match.</span></p>
              <p><span>Only it now seems their case is based on the flimsiest claims. We are told there is no television  footage. No audio recording. No corroborating testimony from the officials on the touchline wearing communication devices. And no witness who is likely to stand up to genuine scrutiny. In short, there is little proof that anything of the sort happened.</span></p>
              <p><span>On advice from lawyers, Chelsea have already withdrawn the Mata accusation, which is embarrassing in itself. Yet the Mikel charge still hangs in the air. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Not that Mikel heard this insult, you understand. It is based on the word of Brazilian player Ramires Santos do Nascimento, who apparently believes he was able to hear Clattenburg abusing his Chelsea team-mate. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>At this point, it is worth noting that Ramires speaks about as much English as I speak Portuguese — which is very little. His club interviews require the services of a translator and, on the pitch, he apparently asked David Luiz — another Brazilian — to explain what he thought he had heard Clattenburg say.</span></p>
              <p><span>Is this the evidence Chelsea are relying on to destroy a match official’s career? A piece of hearsay passed on second or third hand?</span></p>
              <p><span>In the absence of anything to the contrary, I prefer to listen to  common sense. I prefer to listen to the voice in my head telling me the way this has been conducted is plain wrong. </span></p>
              <p><span>I also have to admire the fact that Chelsea’s players suddenly appear to have developed improved listening skills. Not one of them heard John Terry shout ‘f****** black ****’ at Anton Ferdinand, despite being in close proximity to their captain’s sweary outburst, but now they are supposed to have ears as sensitive as a piano tuner when it comes  to hearing a referee’s remarks.</span></p>
              <p><span>If Ramires believes something insulting was said, he is right to report it to those in charge at the club. But the people paid huge sums to run Chelsea and protect their worldwide image should have had the decency and good judgment to examine the charges thoroughly before stampeding into the public domain with such a complaint. </span></p>
              <p><span>Instead, they reacted like fans. They got caught up in the emotion of the game. They lost a vital match and, in their perception at least, it was ‘the referee’s fault’.</span></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span><strong>In this scenario it is hard to avoid speculating about the possibility Chelsea were so aggrieved at being shown two red cards, they waved the race card too quickly.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Dealing with what we know from all the briefings and reports, let us employ the ‘balance of probability’ test that saw the FA punish Terry. Just ask yourself what is the more likely scenario:</span></p>
              <p><span>1) That a leading referee said ‘shut up, monkey’ to a player while wearing a microphone in front of 24 or more television cameras, 41,000 spectators and a global audience of half a billion? Or…</span></p>
              <p><span>2) That a Brazilian player misheard a Geordie referee saying ‘shut up, Mikel’ and the entire incident got completely out of hand due to the Chelsea players’ over-inflated sense of grievance?</span></p>
              <div class="floatRHS art-ins sport"><span>This is a referee with more than a dozen years of top-flight officiating experience, one who has been on the FIFA international list for the past six years. He took charge of the 2012 League Cup final and the Olympic final. I’m not saying he doesn’t make mistakes. Quite clearly, he does. </span></div>
              <p><span>But his reputation is being trashed by a club who can hardly boast a noble record of restraint when it comes to the treatment of referees.</span></p>
              <p><span>Anders Frisk was once accused by Chelsea of chatting with the then Barcelona manager, Frank Rijkaard, in the officials’ room at half-time. This was proved to be inaccurate and wrong but Frisk received death threats that drove him into retirement.</span></p>
              <p><span>Referee Tom Henning Ovrebo was branded a ‘thief’ and smuggled out of England by police for his own safety when Chelsea lost a Champions League semi-final to Barcelona again in 2009. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/11/02/article-0-04D6F9A6000005DC-582_634x369.jpg" alt="Hounded: Tom Henning Ovrebo is surrounded by Chelsea players after the final whistle at Stamford Bridge" width="634" height="369">

              <p><span><strong>Ex-referee Graham Poll says a clique of Chelsea players made accusations that he had threatened to ‘sort them out’ when he sent off Terry. Their claims were later retracted.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Add too that Chelsea club secretary David Barnard is handling this Mikel dispute. He is the Stamford Bridge official who was shown to have altered witness statements in the Terry case and provided what the FA described as ‘materially defective’ evidence with ‘very real concerns’ about its accuracy.</span></p>
              <p><span>Right now, the balance of probability is tipped about as far as gravity will allow, although Chelsea will probably demand action against Sir Isaac Newton for this.</span></p>
              <p><span>Don’t bother to tell me this is an ‘ongoing police investigation’, either. That is another farce.</span></p>
              <p><span>They are involved only because the Society of Black Lawyers made a formal complaint to the Metropolitan Police. ‘We weren’t there, but we don’t need to be in order to report an incident,’ said their chairman, Peter Herbert.</span></p>
              <p><span>Still, it got him in the papers, didn’t it? Well done.</span></p>
              <p><span>When this case collapses, as it surely will without an extraordinary silver bullet of evidence being produced, the Football Association cannot let Chelsea walk away without sanction. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>They cannot allow a club to throw around such vicious indictment of an official’s character and decency without suffering some consequence. The referees’ union need to step up, too.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Officials endure enough vitriol and hatred as it is. Week in and week out practically every single decision during a match is openly contested. Each corner, each throw-in, each free-kick is little more than the cue for a bout of snarling protest. </span></p>
              <p><span>Players steal a yard, dive at the merest touch, then stamp their feet like a child denied chocolate at the supermarket checkout when the official they have spent an entire match trying to dupe finally dares to make an error. </span></p>
              <p><span>It feeds a mood of hostility and confrontation the game is doing nothing to address. The FA’s reaction to this will no doubt be to tape referees’ conversations with their assistants during a match to prevent this kind of incident happening again.</span></p>
              <p><span>Really, it should be used to put the players’ outbursts on record and hold them to account for the abuse they hurl at officials. It’s the ideal way to change behaviour overnight. But is anyone listening?</span></p>

              <p class="introcopy"><strong>MARK CLATTENBURG'S fight to clear his name gathered momentum when the police last night dropped their investigation into allegations against him.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 17px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; font-size: 12px;">
              <div class="storycopy">
              <p class="storycopy">A statement by the Metropolitan Police revealed that they are “no longer investigating” a complaint that the referee racially abused <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span>’s John Obi Mikel.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">That leaves the way clear for the FA to conclude their own investigation without fear of compromising a criminal case, and the fact the police found no grounds for a charge must strengthen Clattenburg’s hand.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck gave a long interview yesterday which refereeing insiders interpreted as a defensive move – “getting his retaliation in first” – because the case against Clattenburg could now unravel. </p>
              <p class="storycopy">Clattenburg is facing a third weekend without a game.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The FIFA official has not been given a fixture since Chelsea alleged that at least one player had heard the referee call Mikel “a monkey” during the home Premier League defeat against Manchester United on October 28. </p>
              <p class="storycopy">Clattenburg vehemently denies the accusation. The police became involved when Peter Herbert, the chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, complained.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The police statement read: “Inquiries were made and no victims have come forward.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“If the situation changes and a victim and/or evidence to support an allegation of a crime comes to police attention, then further inquiries will, if appropriate, be made.”</p>
              <p class="storycopy">The statement’s reference to no victims coming forward infers that Chelsea did not contact the police and that the police did not interview any players. Now the pressure will be on the FA to decide quickly whether to bring a misconduct charge against the 37-year-old County Durham official. </p>
              <div class="padding7north">
              <p class="storycopy">There is frustration within the Premier League and the Professional Game Match Officials Board that, again, the FA appear to be dragging their heels.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Buck’s interview, with a friendly journalist in a London newspaper, gave the club’s authorised version of events.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Buck, an American lawyer, maintained that Chelsea were duty bound to report the accusation against Clattenburg. But he confirmed that Mikel and manager Roberto Di Matteo did try to confront Clattenburg after the match.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">They could face a charge for their behaviour if the FA, like the police, decide not to proceed.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">In the interview, Buck said: “I spoke to the players involved, either because they were allegedly the recipient of that abuse or had heard it, three separate times.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I asked them if they could be mistaken. I asked them if they might have heard ‘Mikel’ instead of ‘monkey’.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">“I thought I had covered the base.”</p>

              <p><span>The FA had found the club’s accusation that referee Mark Clattenburg called John Mikel Obi a ‘monkey’ did not stand up to scrutiny.

              <p><span>What is more, Clattenburg speaks with a Geordie accent. Anyone who has spent time in a Newcastle pub will tell you how those tones can be faintly indecipherable to English ears let alone to a Brazilian, namely Ramires, who thought he heard the insult despite the backdrop of a noisy stadium. Ramires’ recollections were translated for the rest of the team by David Luiz, another Brazilian. Mikel, the supposed victim who has good English, did not hear the word monkey spoken.</span></p>
              <p><span>Despite all this — and after the shameful saga of John Terry,  Chelsea’s totem, calling Anton  Ferdinand a black **** — the club were going public within hours about Clattenburg’s supposed crime. They also claimed Juan Mata was called a ‘Spanish t***’, an accusation later withdrawn.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span>Why did they not keep quiet while they considered if a complaint was worthwhile? That is a question for Ron Gourlay, the chief executive. A second question for him is: will you resign after this fiasco?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span>Harsh? Hardly. This is a club drunk on its own oxygen and wealth.</span></p>
              <p><span>Take Rafa Benitez’s unveiling as the ninth manager of Roman Abramovich’s nine-year reign. He is the latest pawn in a billionaire’s game where normal employment rights — like reward for success — do not count because he can afford to override them.</span></p>
              <p><span>No wonder the men on the pitch and in the boardroom adopt such high-handedness when the boss sets such a rebarbative example.</span></p>
              <p><span>The litany of modern Chelsea’s bullying of referees is without parallel in British football.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>The crime sheet goes back as far as February 2005, when the then manager Jose Mourinho accused Anders Frisk of collusion with Barcelona boss Frank Rijkaard during Chelsea’s defeat at the Nou Camp that saw Didier Drogba sent off. Chelsea were charged with inappropriate conduct and Mourinho was banned from the touchline. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Frisk retired after receiving death threats.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mourinho was cast as an ‘enemy of football’ by UEFA referees’ committee chairman Volker Roth.</span></p>
              <p><span>Since then the wrath has been incited not just on the continent but also closer to home. Chelsea have gone from the enemies of European football to the pariahs of the Premier League.</span></p>
              <p><span>In November 2006, Graham Poll sent off Terry as Chelsea lost to Tottenham for the first time in 16 years. Terry accused the referee of changing his explanation over why he had shown the red card.</span></p>
              <p><span>The delightful Ashley Cole chimed in, saying Poll had warned Chelsea players he wanted to ‘teach us a lesson’. A fortnight later, Chelsea withdrew the accusation and Terry was fined £10,000.</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Fast forward to May 2009, when Norwegian Tom Henning Ovrebo turned down four Chelsea penalty appeals. Admittedly, it was a shocking refereeing performance but not as wayward as the reaction of Drogba and Jose Bosingwa, who both turned on Ovrebo at the final whistle. Drogba screamed ‘It’s a f***ing disgrace’ into a television camera. Ovrebo was still being  subjected to vile emails from  Chelsea fans as late as this spring.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Last October after that infamous game against QPR, Chelsea were fined £20,000 for failing to control their players. Drogba and Bosingwa were dismissed in the first half. Manager Andre Villas-Boas called it a ‘very poor display’ — by the  referee, that is, not his players.</span></p>
              <p><span>The unfortunate referee then was Chris Foy. By coincidence, he takes charge of Chelsea’s game against Manchester City on Sunday.</span></p>

              <p><span>It smacked of the usual one-eyed, self-serving nonsense that fails to acknowledge a wider obligation to football itself or the lightly trampled reputation of a blameless referee.</span></p>
              <p><span>We are Chelsea. We snarl and we smear. Who says we should say sorry?</span></p>

              <p><span><strong>Chelsea refused to offer Mark Clattenburg any kind of apology last night for wrongly accusing the Premier League referee of racially abusing John Mikel Obi.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The Football Association concluded their three-week investigation into events during the explosive clash between Manchester United and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on October 28 by completely exonerating a match official who, it was alleged, had called Mikel a ‘monkey’. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Mikel was charged by the FA over the angry confrontation in Clattenburg’s dressing room following the match.</span></p>
              <p><span>But even after the FA exposed the irrational nature of the accusations yesterday, Chelsea officials did not have the decency to say sorry to a 37-year-old family man who spoke of this being the most stressful time of his professional life and feared the case would wreck his career.</span></p>
              <p><span>After a visit from a <a id="_GPLITA_1" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Savings Sidekick" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2497/topics/#">member</a> of the FA’s governance team yesterday, Clattenburg emerged from 26 days of personal turmoil to issue a statement.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘I am looking forward to putting this behind me and concentrating on refereeing in the Premier League and other competitions,’ he said.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘The messages of encouragement from those inside and outside of the game have helped me through the most stressful time of my professional life.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘To know you were innocent of something but that there was the opportunity for it to wreck your career was frightening.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘Racism has no place in football and this experience should not discourage those to speak out if they genuinely believe they are a victim of abuse. However, there are processes that should be adhered in order that any investigation can be carried out in a manner that is fair for all parties involved.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘I know first-hand the ramifications of allegations of this nature being placed into the public domain ahead of a formal process and investigation. I hope no referee has to go through this in the future.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘We are fortunate to be working in the world’s most watched and scrutinised football league. With that comes a responsibility in regard to how the different parts of the game <a id="_GPLITA_2" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Savings Sidekick" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2497/topics/#">work</a> together.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Clattenburg’s statement highlights the fact that Chelsea’s briefing of the media prior to a formal process and investigation offended him deeply.</span></p>
              <p><span>The referees’ union, Prospect, will lobby to ensure Chelsea compensate Clattenburg and issue a public apology, while it is also understood they want the club to make a sizeable donation to anti-racism charity Kick It Out.</span></p>
              <p><span>Alan Leighton, national secretary of Prospect, said: ‘There was no doubt he was innocent.There are lessons to be learned. Mark is very upset his reputation has been dragged through the mud by this process. There was no need for Chelsea to make the public aware of the allegation.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘There is also an issue of flimsiness about the evidence provided. We need Chelsea to accept the verdict, apologise to Mark and compensate him for that.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>The FA statement highlighted ‘the essential facts’ that proved there was no substance in  Chelsea’s allegations.</span></p>
              <p><span>It said: ‘The evidence for the allegation came from one witness, Ramires. Ramires, whose first language is not English, explained that his instinctive reaction was to seek confirmation from John Mikel Obi as to what the referee had said.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>’John Mikel Obi, who was being spoken to by the referee, was much closer to the referee than Ramires and did not hear what it is suggested was said to him. </span></p>
              <p><span>’Three other witnesses, i.e. the other match officials, to whom everything said by referee was relayed via their communication equipment, are adamant the alleged words were not uttered. There is nothing in the video footage to support the allegation.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>’For completeness, but of lesser weight, two other players, whose first language is English and were in the vicinity, did not hear anything untoward.’ </span></p>
              <p><span>The FA said they had to re-interview Ramires ‘to show him the previously unseen video footage provided by the club’. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>‘At this stage, for the first time, the exact point at which the comment was alleged to have been made was established,’ the statement continued.</span></p>
              <p><span>The complaint collapsed with the emergence of that video. All the witnesses were then interviewed again, with Ramires even unsure as to when the alleged incident occurred.</span></p>
              <p><span>Mike Riley, general manager of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, said: ‘It is PGMOL’s considered view that Mark is completely exonerated of the allegation and he will return to active duty shortly without any stain on his character or reputation.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘Regrettably, Mark has had to endure four weeks that have brought massive disruption to his professional and personal life through no fault of his own.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Despite widespread criticism, Chelsea were adamant last night they followed all FA protocol over their allegations.</span></p>
              <p><span>The club’s case was based largely on evidence given by Mikel’s team-mate Ramires, who claimed he had heard the referee refer to Mikel as a  ‘monkey’ in the 69th minute.</span></p>
              <p><span>The FA said yesterday they believed Ramires had acted ‘in good faith’ but Mikel did not hear anything himself.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea were yesterday satisfied the FA, in their statement, said the club had acted in an appropriate way.</span></p>
              <p><span>While Clattenburg has been cleared, Mikel has been charged by the FA with using ‘threatening and/or abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour in or around the officials changing room’ after hearing of the accusations made by his team-mates against Clattenburg.</span></p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span>FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION STATEMENT</span></p>
              <p><span>'The FA has concluded its investigation into alleged misconduct by Mark Clattenburg during the match between Chelsea FC and Manchester United FC on Sunday 28 October 2012. No disciplinary action will follow against Mr Clattenburg.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Following the conclusion of the match, Chelsea FC reported to the match delegate that two of their players had been separately subject to abuse by the match referee, Mark Clattenburg.</span></p>
              <p><span>'On Monday 29 October 2012, The FA contacted Chelsea FC to establish whether the club and individual players wished to make a formal complaint in relation to the allegations reported to the match delegate.</span></p>
              <p><span>'On Wednesday 31 October Chelsea FC contacted The FA and confirmed that the club had conducted an internal enquiry and that they did wish to proceed with a formal complaint in relation to one of the allegations of abuse. The club did not wish to proceed in relation to the other allegation. The club provided witness statements from two players, Ramires Santos do Nascimento ("Ramires") and John Obi Mikel.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The details of the allegation were that following one or the other of the red cards issued during the second half of the game, Ramires heard Mark Clattenburg say to John Obi Mikel, "shut up you monkey". John Obi Mikel did not hear the alleged comment.</span></p>
              <p><span>'On 1 November 2012, The FA requested that Chelsea disclose full details of their internal investigation.</span></p>
              <p><span>'On 5 November 2012, Chelsea FC provided The FA with witness statements from other Chelsea FC players and officials.</span></p>
              <p><span>'On 5 November 2012, The FA interviewed Ramires and John Obi Mikel, using the TV match footage obtained by The FA.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Between 7 and 8 November 2012, The FA interviewed all four match officials.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'On 9 and 14 November 2012, further to FA requests, Chelsea FC provided unbroadcast video footage of the game from static cameras.</span></p>
              <p><span>'On 15 November 2012, The FA re-interviewed Ramires to show him the previously unseen video footage provided by the club. At this stage, for the first time, the exact point at which the comment was alleged to have been made was established.</span></p>
              <p><span>'In light of this new information, between 15 and 19 November 2012, The FA interviewed the players who were in the vicinity of the alleged incident, and re-interviewed John Obi Mikel and the match officials.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Chelsea FC was offered the opportunity to provide any further information or evidence that they believed could be relevant to the allegation.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The FA then sought advice on the evidence gathered from independent Queen's Counsel.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'The evidence for the allegation came from one witness, Ramires. Ramires, whose first language is not English, explained that his instinctive reaction was to seek confirmation from John Obi Mikel as to what the referee had said.</span></p>
              <p><span>'John Mikel </span><span>Obi</span><span>, who was being spoken to by the referee, was much closer to the referee than Ramires and did not hear what it is suggested was said to him.</span></p>
              <p><span>Three other witnesses, i.e. the other match officials, to whom everything said by referee was relayed via their communication equipment, are adamant the alleged words were not uttered.</span></p>
              <p><span>'There is nothing in the video footage to support the allegation.</span></p>
              <p><span>'For completeness, but of lesser weight, two other players, whose first language is English and were in the vicinity, did not hear anything untoward.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Having considered all of the available evidence it was the opinion of David Waters QC, independent counsel, that the evidence of Ramires was not supported by any other evidence. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Moreover it was contradicted by other witnesses and does not cross the evidential threshold required to bring a charge against Mark Clattenburg.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Having considered Counsel's opinion, and in view of all the circumstances of the case, The FA does not believe that there is a case for Mr Clattenburg to answer.</span></p>
              <p><span>'Equally The FA is satisfied that the allegation against Mark Clattenburg by Ramires was made in good faith. It is entirely possible for a witness to be genuinely mistaken and convincing in his belief.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'The FA receives and investigates numerous allegations of misconduct over the course of a season. All allegations are properly investigated. It is not uncommon for investigations to lead to no disciplinary charge being brought.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The FA encourages all players who believe they have been either subject, or witness to, discriminatory abuse to report the matter immediately to the match officials on the day.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>'Furthermore, all Participants are advised to report any such alleged misconduct to The FA. In this case, the player and club were correct in reporting the matter to The FA and it was appropriate and proper for such an allegation to be thoroughly investigated.'<br></span></p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea made the first move towards a reconciliation with referee Mark Clattenburg when the club's chairman, Bruce Buck, paid him a personal visit yesterday.</strong></p>
              </span>
              <div class="body ">
              <p>Buck travelled to St George's Park in east Staffordshire where the 16-strong group of select referees were having their regular meeting in an attempt to explain why Chelsea pushed ahead with their allegation of racism by Clattenburg towards midfielder John Obi Mikel.</p>
              <p>Since Thursday's decision by the Football Association that Chelsea's evidence that Clattenburg called Mikel "a monkey" during the game against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge on 28 October was not strong enough to warrant a charge, talks have been ongoing between the club and Mike Riley, general manager of the referee's association.</p>
              <p>While Chelsea's decision to push ahead with the complaint was judged to be justified by the FA, despite the evidence of midfielder Ramires being judged to be insufficient, the club have been looking at ways of building bridges with the refereeing community.</p>
              <p>There are elements among the referees in the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMO) who are understood to be very unhappy about the manner in which Chelsea approached the issue and determined that some such acknowledgment be made by the club.</p>
              <p>The discussion with Buck is also believed to have touched on the possibility of Clattenburg taking charge of Chelsea games in the future.</p>

              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Chelsea" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></span></a><strong> have expressed regret over their handling of aspects of the complaint of racist abuse lodged against </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Mark Clattenburg" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mark-clattenburg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Mark Clattenburg</strong></span></span></a><strong>, with all parties involved now seeking to draw a line under the controversy ahead of the official's return to top-flight refereeing on Wednesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>The Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, had met face to face with Clattenburg at the National Football Centre in Burton upon Trent on Monday, discussing the issue with all 16 of the elite referees, the Professional Game Match Officials Limited general manager Mike Riley, and the Premier League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore. Those talks were deemed as frank but constructive, with <a href="http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2993363/title/joint-statement-from-chelsea-fc-the-premier-league-and-pgmol"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">a joint statement duly issued by the club, PGMOL and the Premier League</span></span></a> in which Chelsea admitted they should have "given more consideration" before making their allegation public.</p>
              <p>The Football Association determined last week that no charges would be brought against Clattenburg after investigating a claim by the Chelsea midfielder Ramires that he had heard the official describe Mikel John Obi as "a monkey" during <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/28/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">the 3-2 defeat by Manchester United on 28 October</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>The club had confirmed in the immediate aftermath of that game that they had lodged a complaint to the Premier League match delegate, alleging "inappropriate language used by the referee and directed at two of our players". They made a formal complaint to <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on The FA" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fa"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">the FA</span></span></a> the following week over the alleged incident with Mikel, but dropped their accusation over comments allegedly made towards Juan Mata.</p>
              <p>"There was a constructive and open discussion," read the joint statement issued on Wednesday. "The club regrets not having given more consideration before issuing a statement on the evening of Sunday 28 October. The club also regrets the subsequent impact the intense media scrutiny had on Mark Clattenburg and his family. The referees accept that given Chelsea had received a good faith claim from one of their employees, the club had an obligation under FA rules to report the allegation."</p>
              <p>The statement fell short of issuing the public apology demanded by the referees' union, Prospect, with Chelsea conscious that Ramires still resolutely stands by his original testimony and that the FA welcomed the manner in which the club followed the formal process with their complaint. The PGMOL has also accepted the club followed protocol in <a id="_GPLITA_0" style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Savings Sidekick" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2497/topics/#"><span style="color: #0000ff;">lodging</span></a> the complaint once their employee had made his claim.</p>
              <p>Yet there has been recognition within the club's hierarchy of the personal pressures placed on Clattenburg, who had always denied any wrongdoing but had been omitted from the referees' roster for the four weekends since the game at Stamford Bridge while the FA conducted its inquiry. Having been fourth official for Tottenham Hotspur's victory over West Ham on Sunday, he will take charge of Wednesday's game between Southampton and Norwich at St Mary's.</p>
              <p>Buck made a point of stressing the club saw no issue with the 37-year-old officiating at games involving Chelsea. "There was recognition by all parties that the impartiality and integrity of refereeing in this country remains paramount," concluded the statement. "Chelsea made it clear they would welcome Mark Clattenburg back to Stamford Bridge in the future and PGMOL would have no issue in appointing him to a Chelsea FC match going forward. It was a thoroughly professional meeting. All parties now believe it is time to draw a line under this incident, learn from it and move on for the good of all Premier League clubs, players and match officials."</p>
              <p>Prospect's national secretary, Alan Leighton, said the use of the word "regrets" in the joint statement was "an important move forward in confirming Chelsea's recognition of Mark's integrity and impartiality". </p>
              <p>Mikel has requested a personal hearing having been charged with misconduct for using threatening or abusive words and/or behaviour after he stormed into the officials' changing room after the final whistle. If the charge is upheld, he is expected to face at least a three-match ban. That could be extended to as many as five if the mitigating circumstances are rejected.</p>
