            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/2803/parkcharltonwu1.jpg"><br><br>Manchester United maintained their six-point cushion at the top of the Premiership with a scrappy 2-0 win over struggling Charlton Athletic at Old Trafford.<br><br>Park Ji-sung's first-half header, and Darren Fletcher's late finish, killed off a spirited effort from Charlton, who belied their lowly position in the table to give the leaders a fright.<br><br>And from United's point of view, Sir Alex Ferguson will perhaps look on this match as a positive sign for his side's title hopes in picking up three points on a day when they were some way off their best.<br><br>Park lashed a first minute volley off target, but was much closer with his next attempt, picking up a loose ball 30 yards from goal and driving forward before bringing a flying save out of Scott Carson.<br><br>Charlton had come to frustrate the league leaders, but they also posed an attacking threat early on with Dennis Rommedahl firing into the side-netting after being released by Marcus Bent.<br><br>With United being harried out of possession, led by the manful efforts of Bent, Charlton almost claimed the opening goal on 11 minutes.<br><br>Osei Sankofa curled in a fine cross from the right, Darren Ambrose climbed well to head towards goal, but Tomasz Kuszczak, in for the injured Edwin van der Sar, produced a superb one-handed stop at full stretch.<br><br>United gradually started to find space between the visitors' defence and midfield, but with Cristiano Ronaldo tucked up in bed nursing a cold, there was a lack of thrust about their attacking play.<br><br>Largely untidy in possession, it was no surprise that the breakthrough on 24 minutes arrived in scruffy fashion, although Alan Pardew will doubtless rue his team's defending.<br><br>Patrice Evra's cross looped into the air and Park rose well to beat the static Ben Thatcher to the ball. The South Korean's header from six yards was directed beyond Carson, who perhaps should have been out to claim the deflected centre.<br><br>The goal appeared to knock Charlton off their stride and there was suddenly a ragged edge to their attempts to stifle United.<br><br>The one genuine moment of class in the first half came on 37 minutes when Ryan Giggs beautifully picked out Rooney, whose control was exquisite. He flicked the ball over Souleymane Diawara, but skewed his shot wide from close range when off balance.<br><br>Charlton started the second half in positive fashion, although finding a way behind the United defence was a problem, with Chinese debutant Zheng Zhi and Ambrose both off target from range.<br><br>The interval had failed to bring about an improvement in United's cohesion and Giggs' mis-hit volley was the Welshman's last contribution before being replaced by Henrik Larsson.<br><br>Louis Saha, looking rusty on his first start since New Year's Day, prodded a weak shot at Carson before Charlton came agonisingly close to an equaliser on 76 minutes.<br><br>Bent met an inviting free-kick first and his glancing header nicked off his marker Gary Neville and just beyond the far post, with Kuszczak beaten all ends up.<br><br>United were increasingly having to play on the counter-attack and again Saha's lack of sharpness proved costly as he shot meekly at Carson from Rooney's pass after the pair had sprung clear from a Charlton corner.<br><br>A crucial, if ill-deserved, second goal came eight minutes from time when Rooney's persistence reaped a reward for Fletcher. The striker's first shot was saved by Carson's legs and from the rebound, he found Fletcher, perhaps fortuitously, in a position to head into an exposed net.<br><br>Fletcher was denied a second of the afternoon when his attempted lob was charged down by Carson, while Rooney and Alexandre Song were involved in a bit of late handbags.</div>
