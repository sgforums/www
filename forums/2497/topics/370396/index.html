              <p><em>Liverpool have refused to budge but their hand may now be forced as the Spain international has made his intentions clear.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Liverpool midfielder </strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=13842"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Xabi Alonso</strong></span></a><strong> has reportedly handed in a transfer request at Anfield to ensure he gets his move to Real Madrid this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool have refused to budge from an asking price for Alonso in the region of £30m, which has stalled any potential move to the Bernabeu, but their hand may now be forced as the Spain international has made his intentions clear.</p>
              <p>Alonso has been at the centre of a long-running transfer saga as La Liga giants Madrid have made no secret of their desire to secure a deal.</p>
              <p>Speculation suggests a fee will be struck with Madrid within the next couple of days for a sum reported to be in the region of £25m.</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has said publicly he doesn't want to sell Alonso, especially as <span style="color: #000000;">Javier Mascherano</span> was said to be interesting Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Alonso is eager to join Real, rather than spend another season playing for Benitez, a manager with whom he no longer has a relationship, but has not, until now, confirmed his desire to leave Anfield in writing.</p>
              <p>Alonso signed from Real Socieded for £10.5m in 2004 shortly after Benitez arrived at the club, and appeared to on his way out last summer as Liverpool chased <span style="color: #000000;">Gareth Barry</span>'s signature.</p>
              <p>Some reports claim it is that saga that prompted Alonso's request to leave Anfield, with Real Madrid his preferred destination.</p>

              <p><strong>Striker Fernando Torres has insisted it would be "a serious loss to Liverpool" if Xabi Alonso completed a move to Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>Benitez has threatened to pull the plug on negotiations if Madrid do not meet his £30million valuation of the player before the weekend - and Torres is hoping his compatriot stays with the club.</p>
              <p>"It would be a bad piece of work if Xabi left - he plays his cards close to his chest so I don't know what is going to happen," Torres told The Sun.</p>
              <p>"I'd put Xabi's own wishes ahead of everything else, of course, but he's got three years left on his contract with us and I'd love it if he stays.</p>
              <p>"It would be a serious loss for Liverpool if he left this summer."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Torres' views are in stark contrast to former Reds goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, who yesterday claimed a move to Real Madrid would represent a "dream come true" for Alonso.</strong></p>
              <p>Dudek, now the back-up goalkeeper to Iker Casillas at the Bernabeu, said: "He is Spanish and all the Spanish guys want to play for Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>"This is a dream come true for them and Xabi knows that he's not the only one."</p>

              <h1>Liverpool midfield mutiny: Javier Mascherano's brother calls for Barca move as Real Madrid close in on Xabi Alonso<br></h1>

              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/30/article-0-05CE99E7000005DC-934_306x518.jpg" alt="Javier Mascherano " width="306" height="518"></p>

              <p><strong>Javier Mascherano's brother has poured more misery on </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>boss Rafa Benitez by reiterating the Argentina captain's desire to leave Anfield.</strong></p>
              <div class="floatRHS">
              <p class="imageCaption">Benitez looks set to lose his battle to keep Xabi Alonso from Real Madrid's clutches and has another battle trying to keep Mascherano happy on Merseyside.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Mascherano's agent Walter Tamer has already made it clear that the 25-year-old is 'tired of life' in England, though the club are prepared to triple his wages to make him see things differently.</p>
              <p>But with Barcelona keen to make the former West Ham man their midfielder anchor, Sebastian Mascherano told Spain's COM Radio: 'If Barcelona really come with a very good cash offer, I believe Javier may leave Liverpool as it would be the best for him and his family. 'But I think that if there is no good offer, they will not let him go."</p>
              <p>Sebastian believes that one of the reasons his brother wants to go to Nou Camp is to link up with Argentina colleague Lionel Messi, who has not hidden his desire for Mascherano to join the European champions.</p>
              <p>'I am sure Messi and Javier have spoken,' he said. 'Leo is one of the people who have been pushing the most for Javier to play at Barca.'</p>
              <p>Benitez will be determined to keep Mascherano if Alonso's move to Spain goes through as expected.</p>

              <p><strong>Barcelona do not have the desire to splash cash around in the way that Real Madrid have this summer and are already looking at alternatives.</strong></p>
              <p>Mascherano is the first choice of coach Pep Guardiola and technical secretary Txiki Begiristain, but they have all but given up on signing him or second choice, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> skipper Cesc Fabregas, because they would bust their budget.</p>

              <p><strong>After shelling out £39m plus Samuel Eto'o for Inter Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the Catalans have been hit by news that they must pay another £4.25m to the Italians because Alexander Hleb did not keep his part of the bargain, refusing to go to the San Siro on loan for a year.</strong></p>
              <p>Former Arsenal winger Hleb is instead heading to Stuttgart.</p>
              <p>Barca, who already have Yaya Toure, Seydou Keita and Sergi Busquets as holding midfielders are now looking at Plan B: to recruit a cheaper, up-and-coming player.</p>
              <p>They have identified AZ Alkmaar's Mendes da Silva, Galatasaray's Mehmet Topal and Ajax's Jan Vertonghen as alternatives.</p>
              <p>The X-factor would be if they decided to take a gamble on future earnings and splash out on Mascherano after all.</p>
              <p>The mayor of Barcelona has approved a land deal that would see Barca selling off their Mini Estadi and other sites for an estimated £260m.</p>
              <p>However, much of the funds have already been earmarked for improvements to the Nou Camp that would see an increase in capacity and the addition of a roof designed by Sir Norman Foster.</p>

              <p>Liverpool shall never buy Spanish players. In the end, they will like to go back home and play football. Just like an English player who will long to go back to EPL. Nothing wrong. Plus La Liga got 2 super clubs. RM and Barcelona. Any top soccer player of the world will love play for them.</p>
              <p>Liverpool may have improve due to Spanish link. But it will always be a English club.</p>
              <p>One fine day, Torres will also want to be backk for Spain. Definitely not for RM but maybe for Barcelona.</p>
              <p>Liverpool shall stick to what they are good at. Local english boy for talent.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">XABI ALONSO is expected to complete his £28million dream move to Real Madrid on Monday. The Spanish midfielder stunned Liverpool by slapping in a written transfer request. And Real pounced to make him their latest big-money arrival after upping their offer from £24m.</h2>
              <p class="article">Kop boss Rafa Benitez wanted £30m but will accept slightly less after conceding defeat in his battle to keep him. A Bernabeu source said: "We expect a positive solution between the clubs in the next few days."</p>
              <p class="article">Losing Alonso will be a blow to Benitez but he will use some of the cash to make a £12m raid for Wigan's England Under-21 star Lee Cattermole.</p>
              <p class="article">The Latics turned down a bid from Sunderland for their prized asset last week. But they are unlikely to stand in his way if Liverpool come calling.</p>
              <p class="article">Roma's Alberto Aquilina and Athletic Bilbao's Javier Martinez are possible replacements. Benitez could also launch a raid for Alonso's Spanish team-mate David Villa, despite the striker saying he wants to remain with Valencia.</p>
              <p class="article">Alonso hopes his exit can be arranged hastily. But full-back Alvaro Arbeloa, who has completed his £3.5m switch from Liverpool to Real, said: "It wasn't easy for me to get here because Rafa defends his interests hard.</p>
              <p class="article">"I also understand he is currently coaching the team and that he's left negotiations aside for now. "I hope Xabi joins because he is a good player and a good friend."</p>

              <p><strong>There is some confusion over whether Xabi Alonso has actually handed in a transfer request at Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The usually reliable Liverpool Echo reported yesterday morning
              that Alonso had given the club a written transfer request, something
              that sources at Anfield confirmed to the Press Association yesterday
              afternoon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All that apparently remained was for Real Madrid to come up with
              around £28million and the deal would be complete, but reports this
              morning suggest it might not be quite as clear cut.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Times, a paper that has been convinced of Alonso's departure
              all summer, reports that the midfielder has not formally requested a
              move.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The paper reports: 'Sources at Liverpool said that Alonso
              submitted a transfer request on Wednesday evening in an effort to
              hasten a move to Real, but the suggestions were dismissed by Alonso's
              representatives, who insisted that the player had taken no such
              action.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Times also claims that a 48-hour deadline put in place by
              Rafa Benitez has expired, while The Guardian reports that Liverpool are
              holding out for over £30million for the player.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Sun is rather more certain that a deal will be done, predicting that Alonso's move could be wrapped up as early as Monday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There has been no official confirmation from either party on whether a transfer request has been submitted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Alonso does leave Anfield, Lee Cattermole, Athletic Bilbao's
              Javi Martinez and Alberto Aquilani have all been mentioned in the press
              as potential replacements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Alvaro Arbeloa, who completed his own move to Real on
              Thursday, is quoted in The Sun as saying: "I hope Xabi joins because he
              is a good player and a good friend."</p>

              <p>It looks like Real doesn't want to pay the priced Pool wants... or even the bargain sum... They are instead trying to convince Pool to take some of those players they are having problems trying to get rid of from their club and pay a lesser cash amount...</p>
              <p>Alonso will leave, I belief it will most likely happen... Its only a matter of when and how much... and even where its hard to say given Chelsea and City have now come in for him as well... So many people want him after what he showed last season but I think Real is the most likely place he will end up.</p>

              <div><span><strong>Xabi Alonso is due to fly back to Spain with Liverpool on Saturday as the negotiations over his possible transfer drag on.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Liverpool are playing in a friendly against Espanyol on Sunday to open the Barcelona club's new stadium and at the moment Alonso is expected to be in the travelling party.</p>
              <p>A final decision is likely to be taken after the squad have trained on Saturday morning ahead of an afternoon flight.</p>
              <p>But with both Liverpool and prospective buyers Real Madrid digging their heels in over the fee for the 27-year-old international, a decision on the deal is now not expected until Monday.</p>
              <p>Real are believed to now have offered players in part-exchange while Chelsea, Manchester City and an unnamed Italian club are still monitoring the situation.</p>
              <p>But Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez is still demanding £30million for the Spain international and has previously said that he is not interested in taking any Real players in the deal and wants a cash-only agreement.</p>
              <p>The players on offer are Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Alvaro Negredo and Rafael van der Vaart.</p>
              <p>Alonso handed in a transfer request earlier this week, and is known to want to make his Madrid debut in his home town of San Sebastian on August 15, when the Bernabeu club play in Real Sociedad's centenary match. Alonso started his career with the Basque club.</p>
              <p>Reports in Italy claim that midfielder Alberto Aquilani has been lined up as Alonso's replacement. Cash-strapped Roma are willing to sell for around £15million and the player is happy with a five-year contract worth around 4million euros a year.</p>
              <p>But formal negotiations cannot take place until the Alonso deal is settled.</p>

              <p class="article">Midfielder Alonso is expected to seal a £30million move to Real Madrid today - and Liverpool boss Benitez aims to pair Villa with current Kop frontman Fernando Torres in the double act that has been so deadly for the Euro 2008 champions.</p>
              <p class="article">Anfield skipper Steven Gerrard would move back into central midfield, alongside Javier Mascherano, with Benitez changing his formation to 4-4-1-1.</p>
              <p class="article">Villa, 26, has already turned down moves to Real and Barcelona this summer but Liverpool feel Torres can persuade his pal to leave Valencia for England.</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez, however, recognises potential difficulties in nabbing Villa and does have a Plan B.</p>
              <p class="article">Roma midfielder Alberto Aquilani, 24, is seen as a possible replacement for Alonso, 27, who asked for a transfer to force through his move.</p>
              <p class="article">Bernabeu bigwigs are haggling over the fee and have suggested a cash- plus-player swap. Liverpool, though, would much rather take a full cash payment.</p>
