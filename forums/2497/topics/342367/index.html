              <p><strong>Real Madrid hope to complete the signing of Wigan Athletic star Luis
              Antonio Valencia in the first week of January, according to the Ecuador
              international’s agent.</strong></p>
              <p>Valencia, who formerly played for Villarreal in La Liga, is believed
              to be a prime target for new Real boss Juande Ramos and has been linked
              with a possible £17 million move to the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p>While Real have already secured the signing of Portsmouth’s Lassana
              Diarra, a winger remains a priority for the Spanish giants and with
              Ashley Young seemingly staying at Aston Villa, it is believed that
              Ramos has settled on Valencia.</p>
              <p>Reports in Spain claim talks are ongoing between the two clubs
              regarding the talented 23-year-old and Valencia’s agent, Diego Herrera,
              has told the Spanish press that Los Merengues are keen to complete a
              deal for his client.</p>
              <p>“It would be a dream for Antonio to sign for Madrid, a beautiful opportunity,” Herrera told AS.</p>
              <p>“Until there is something official I cannot say anything. When you
              have an official statement from a person with authority in Madrid, such
              as [sporting director Predrag] Mijatovic, confirming the offer, then we
              can talk.</p>
              <p>“I understand that Madrid wants to close the signing in the first week of January. We will see what happens in the coming days.</p>
              <p>“Antonio is not going to make any statement until there is something official with the Madrid club.”</p>

              <p>But I feel they are paying a bit over the top for Diarra... Portsmouth paid only $5.5m for him just 1 yr ago... $12m would be a more proper price... Valencia also... last season he was mentioned at around $6m to United... Now suddenly go up to $17m...</p>
              <p>Real kenna chop carrot head already because everybody know they are desperate to add players to their squad... so when they come asking, up the price a lot... lol</p>

              <p><em>Wigan winger Antonio Valencia could be on his way to Real Madrid in a mega-money move</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1103330" rel="1103330_3" href="/sport/football/article-1103330/Wigan-tell-Real-Valencia-cost-20m-Pennant-Bernabeu-bound.html"></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Wigan </strong></span><strong>will demand £20million for Antonio Valencia if Real Madrid follow up their interest in the Ecuador winger, it emerged on Tuesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>As<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"> Liverpool's</span></a> Jermaine Pennant indicated that his move to the Bernabeu could be revived after confirming <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail's</span> exclusive last week that Real had agreed a shock £3.5m deal with Liverpool, Valencia's agent spoke of the 'beautiful opportunity' his client would find difficult to turn down.</p>
              <p>'It would be a dream for Antonio to move to Real Madrid,' said Diego Herrera, who insisted he had not had any direct contact with the Spanish giants, their sporting director Predrag Mijatovic or his assistant Carlos Bucero.</p>
              <p>'Until there is something official I don't want to say anything. When there is an official announcement from someone with authority at Madrid, called Mijatovic or Bucero, telling us of an offer, then we will talk. 'I have understood that Madrid want to close the signing they are chasing during the first week of January.'</p>
              <p>Wigan believe Valencia, 23, is second only to Cristiano Ronaldo among the top wingers in Europe. The club suspect Real have underestimated their desire to keep a player who signed permanently on a three-and-a-half-year deal from Villarreal in January after impressing on loan at the JJB Stadium.</p>
              <p>Owner Dave Whelan does not have to sell and will hold out for an offer of £20m, although he might be prepared to accept a figure closer to the £16.6m being reported in Spain if Real pay the majority of it up front rather than try to break it down into instalments.</p>
              <p>Either way, it appeared increasingly likely last night that Madrid will try to make Valencia their third signing of the transfer window following the capture of Portsmouth midfielder Lassana Diarra and Ajax striker Klaas -Jan Huntelaar.</p>
              <p>Herrera's colleague Pedro Romero added: 'Next week it will be known if Antonio will finally become a Real Madrid player.</p>
              <p>'Valencia doesn't want to say anything because people could misunderstand his words. Also, he wants to concentrate solely on his team, Wigan, and put to one side all the rumours about his transfer.'</p>
              <p>Wigan are already battling to keep striker Emile Heskey, who has been confirmed as a nonstarter for Friday's FA Cup third round tie at Tottenham with a hamstring injury.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/30/article-0-01BC4856000004B0-257_468x464.jpg" alt="Liverpool's Jermaine Pennant leaves the pitch after getting a red card from referee Lubos Michel during their match with Porto in a Group A Champions League soccer match, Tuesday Sept. 18, 2007 at Drag" width="468" height="464"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they decide to sell Valencia, manager Steve Bruce would be almost certain to move for Pennant. The former Arsenal winger could have joined Wigan or Stoke in the summer but was unable to agree personal terms, as was the case when new Madrid coach Juande Ramos shocked the football world last week by trying to buy a player who has only three Barclays Premier League appearances for Liverpool this season.</p>
              <p>However, Pennant yesterday broke his silence over one of the most unexpected transfer stories of this or any other season and expressed his interest in a move to La Liga.</p>
              <p>'I know Real Madrid made an offer for me,' said Pennant. 'Real Madrid are a great club, as are Liverpool, but I'm not sure of the situation now. I'm flattered that a club as huge as Real has shown interest in me, so we will have to see.</p>
              <p>'I just want to play regular football and one of my dreams is to be able to do it in Spain one day. I love the way teams like Sevilla, Barcelona, Valencia or Real play. They keep the ball and use wingers. The technical ability of the players is huge.</p>
              <p>'I think my style of football will suit La Liga, a competition I follow closely on television.</p>

              <p><br>Maybe the Real bosses want to get inside info from Pennant of Pool's weakness and their strength so when the CL match comes around, they know what to expect from Pool and how to deal with them... After one season, sell Pennant back to some English club for $7m cos they will have a 3 yr contract left so cost more... Like this, get inside info and also make $$$... Snaky Real...</p>
              <p>Otherwise I can't think of a good reason why a top club like Real would want Pennant for? This seems a bit weird, just when they are draw against Pool then they show interest in Pennant...</p>

              <p>much as i would agreed with what was mentioned in the thread, the other reason being currently the very best out there are being brought by the English teams hence other clubs ard the world had no choice but to buy those 2nd best from EPL... hahahahahahhaha... EPL rocks...</p>
              <p>on a serious note, Ramos just returned from EPL hence his most up to date info are generally from ard EPL hence its not a surprise that he choose to go English based players..</p>
