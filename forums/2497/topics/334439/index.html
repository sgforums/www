              <p>I actually feel that Mourinho was the one that brought the art of diving to a new level in the EPL... Not that it wasn't around before him but since he came to England... More players started diving. I don't recall the Chelsea squad diving very much at all or almost not but when he took over, players like Robben, Drogba started diving like crazy... The thing about their diving was so bad that everyone could see it very clearly... The first year Drogba was at Chelsea, even their own fans didn't like his ways... Cos not only does he dive, he also had stimulation to go with it...</p>
              <p>But it shouldn't be too surprising cos Mourinho's Porto was diving a lot too on their way to the CL title...</p>

              <p><em>Arc of a diver? Didier Drogba goes down under pressure from Liverpool's Jamie Carragher.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>José Mourinho has finally admitted that Didier Drogba, the Chelsea forward, is a diver. The Inter Milan coach, who had to defend the player against the accusation during his time as manager at Stamford Bridge, also labelled Fernando Torres, of Liverpool, Cristiano Ronaldo, of Manchester United, and Robin van Persie, of Arsenal, as among the players that he believes regularly deceive referees in the Barclays Premier League.</strong></p>
              <p>Drogba has been the target of criticism from several managers in recent seasons, notably Rafael Benítez, who was furious about Drogba's behaviour in the Champions League semi-final, first leg in April. The Liverpool manager said that he was “really disappointed” by the sympathetic view taken of Drogba's regular falls by Konrad Plautz, the Austrian referee.“I am not the Chelsea manager any more and I don't have to defend them any more, so I think it's correct if I say Drogba is a diver,”</p>
