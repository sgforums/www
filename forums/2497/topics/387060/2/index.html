              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> are confident of seeing off fierce competition for Marouane Chamakh and agreeing a deal to sign him on a free transfer at the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>Bordeaux's Morocco striker has confided to friends that he sees his future in England, when his contract runs out in the summer, and talks have already taken place over making Anfield his new home.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal</span></a> have been tracking him for months and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/tottenham-hotspur.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Tottenham</span></a> are also keen, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> understands <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span></a> are also attracted to the idea of expanding their attacking options without paying a fee after relying heavily on Didier Drogba in recent seasons.</p>
              <p>Last month, Chamakh reiterated his desire to see out the season with <span style="font-style: italic;">Ligue 1</span> leaders - and current champions - Bordeaux.</p>
              <p>But the 25-year-old will leave the Stade Chaban Delmas on a free at the end of the season, with Arsene Wenger perpetually linked with a move to the Emirates as a potential replacement for the injured Robin van Persie.</p>
              <p>Chamakh has not been short in coming forward, telling the Moroccan media of his various suitors.</p>
              <p>'My agent has been contacted by Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/everton.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Everton</span></a>, Chelsea and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/sunderland.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Sunderland</span></a> in the Premier League along with other clubs like Sevilla, Inter and Juventus.</p>
              <p>'However, we do not have a concrete offer on the table at the moment and it is still a bit soon for such things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/01/07/article-1241512-05E956D8000005DC-875_468x300.jpg" alt="Bordeaux's forward Marouanne Chamakh" width="468" height="300">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>In demand: Chamakh has suitors across the continent</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em></em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>'When the season ends, I will meet with my agent and we will evaluate all of the offers and decide what is the best for me from a footballing point of view. The economics are not the only important thing for me.'</strong></p>
              <p>Despite being highly rated, Chamakh has rarely showed signs of becoming a prolific goalscorer.</p>
              <p>After previously failing to register more than 10 goals in a season, Chamakh hit 14 league goals in 34 last season, but has returned just six in 19 Ligue 1 outings this campaign.</p>

              <p>yes zocoss i agree with you.. but you will have to see the performance level too..<br><br>for example player A and player B.<br>Player A score 20 goals from tap ins.. headers etc.<br><br>Player B score 5 goals.. but from his own skill.<br><br>you should get my drift eh..<br>furthermore you can search like..<br>rooney top 50 goal.. but you cant search voronin top 50 goal right? :P hahahah<br><br>but i also disagree with liverpool signing chamakh, what they need now is a big strong striker. like hulk. not some small speedy ones. we already have torres.<br><br>but if they do buy chamakh, i believe 10million pounds would be his price tag.. not more than that..</p>

              <p>Yeah of course, of course... I was just saying youtube sometimes can't be taken too seriously like what you mentioned, the different set of rules...</p>
              <p>We can search and come up with a few Shevchenko's wonderful strikers but at the end of the day, he still turn out to be a big money flop at Chelsea... Clips taken from selected moments are hard to be taken seriously... Not to mentioned when it was taken... 3, 4 yrs ago ?</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't find Andriy Voronin to be a really bad player... Honestly I don't... I recalled he was the most outstanding player in the Ukraine 2006 WC squad... And he did rather well in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen then Hertha Berlin... scoring hat-trick as well... When he was at Leverkusen, he scored 2 more than <span style="color: #000000;">Van der Vaart for the whole season... At Hertha Berlin, he scored 1 more than Miroslav Klose and 2 more than Franck Ribery... and Klose played 6 more matches than him too... That's a surprise isn't it... </span></p>
              <p>On Marouane Chamakh, I think its a good buy. I think he has the potential and will be a lot better than Ngog. I don't see any harm in taking him. Afterall, he is free... Though free players normally come with a high salary too and it will be quite difficult to off load them to another club willing to pay a transfer along with the salary he is on if they don't perform... Only thing is just to let them run out their contract... </p>
