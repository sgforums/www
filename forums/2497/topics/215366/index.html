            <div class='col-md body'>Petr Cech suffered a depressed fracture of the skull following his clash with Reading's Stephen Hunt, with Chelsea now facing a goalkeeping crisis for Wednesday's meeting with Barcelona.<br><br>Cech, the 24-year-old Czech Republic goalkeeper, was knocked unconscious in the opening minute at the Madejski Stadium in a clash that left boss Jose Mourinho fearing for his player's life.<br><br>Chelsea have confirmed that Cech underwent surgery after being transferred to the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford to their specialist neuro-surgical unit. It is unknown when he will return to action but he is expected to miss the Barca game.<br><br>Reserve goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini could also miss the Champions League clash at Stamford Bridge after he was also knocked unconscious against Reading, although he was discharged from hospital on the same evening as the match.<br><br>A statement from Chelsea confirmed: 'The operation was successful but it is too early to give an accurate assessment of his condition.<br><br>'Naturally everybody at Chelsea wishes Petr, and Carlo Cudicini - who was discharged last night after being knocked unconscious - a speedy recovery from their injuries.'<br><br>It means Chelsea are set to start third-choice goalkeeper Hilario. The 30-year-old joined the Premiership champions on a free transfer from Portuguese top-flight club CD Nacional and has yet to make his debut.<br><br>Mourinho was furious with Hunt following Saturday's 1-0 victory, claiming the Royals player was laughing after inflicting the injury.<br><br>He also believes Hunt's challenge is similar to Ben Thatcher's infamous clash with Pedro Mendes, for which the Manchester City defender received a lengthy ban.<br><br>'I am not surprised by what Petr has - to be alive he was lucky,' Mourinho said after the match.<br><br>Chelsea have backed Mourinho's comments, and their statement added: 'Chelsea FC has reviewed the video of both incidents. We endorse the post-match comments of Jose Mourinho regarding the seriousness of these incidents.<br><br>'Chelsea will be writing to the Football Association with our observations.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Chelsea goalkeepers lucky to escape with lives<br>tribalfooball.com - October 15, 2006<br><br>Chelsea goalkeepers Petr Cech and Carlo Cudicini escaped with their lives after their heavy clashes in Saturday's win at Reading.<br>Cech could be out for the season with a depressed fracture of the skull following a challenge by Reading's Stephen Hunt on Saturday.<br><br>And Cech's back-up Cudicini was warned he could risk his life if he rushes his return after being laid out by Ibrahima Sonko and swallowing his tongue during the Blues' 1-0 win.<br><br>Czech international Cech underwent emergency surgery yesterday and is unlikely to play again this season after being caught on the side of the head by Hunt's knee with just 15 seconds played at the Madejski Stadium.<br><br>Although he was conscious immediately after the challenge, his condition deteriorated in the visitors' dressing room as further tests were carried out.<br><br>As worried medics waited for an ambulance, Cech collapsed and lost consciousness.<br><br>He was joined at the Royal Berkshire Hospital by Cudicini, the victim of a thunderous mid-air collision with powerhouse defender Sonko.<br><br>The Italian stopper had already swallowed his tongue and was turning purple by the time chief medical officer Bryan English reached him.<br><br>Luckily, English was able to release Cudicini's tongue by manipulation of the player's jaw before he was rushed to hospital in a neck brace.<br><br>Referee Mike Riley did not even award a free-kick for Sonko's challenge and Cudicini was lying unconscious in the goalmouth when Didier Drogba cleared off the line.<br><br>Both keepers underwent brain scans and spinal x-rays before Cudicini was discharged late on Saturday night.<br><br>Cech was transferred to the specialist neurosurgical unit at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford for yesterday's operation.<br><br>Blues boss Jose Mourinho revealed: "I am not worried about the Barcelona match right now. I am worried only about the health of our two friends Petr and Carlo. They both lost consciousness, completely knocked out.<br><br>"Petr recovered a little bit in the dressing room but a few seconds later he passed out again and had to go to hospital. Carlo was out cold.<br><br>"It's difficult to lose two keepers in the same match. I could accept if it was due to a red card and a muscle injury or something like that. But not because of violent conduct.<br><br>"Carlo was injured by the violent way he hit the ground. Sonko pushed him, not in a dirty way, but he deserved a second yellow card.<br><br>"But the challenge on Cech was unbelievable. To go in on a sliding goalkeeper with the knee is an unbelievable action.<br><br>"There is no chance that was an accident. You'll have to ask Hunt if he meant to put Cech in hospital but he knew what he was doing, that's for sure." </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Chelsea keeper Cech could be out for season<br>tribalfooball.com - October 15, 2006<br><br>Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech could be out for the season after an emergency op on his fractured skull yesterday.<br>Chelsea's keeper, 24, had surgery to relieve pressure on his brain.<br><br>Cech was caught in the head by the knee of Reading's Stephen Hunt. In the same match on Saturday, deputy Carlo Cudicini swallowed his tongue following a collision and is out for 10 days.<br><br>Cech's wife Martina was in tears after visiting him before his op. The one bit of good news for Cudicini was that he was discharged from hospital.<br><br>He was hurt in a massive collision with Reading defender Ibrahima Sonko during the clash at the Madejski Stadium.<br><br>Third-choice keeper Henrique Hilario will now have to play in Wednesday's Champions League showdown against Barcelona.<br><br>Chelsea last night confirmed that Cech, operated on in the neuro-surgical unit of Oxford's Radcliffe Infirmary, has a depressed fracture of the skull.<br><br>They do not yet know when their Czech international star will be fit to play again.<br><br>FA insiders admit it will be virtually impossible to take further action against Hunt.<br><br>But Jose Mourinho believes the FA set a precedent when they hit Manchester City's Ben Thatcher with a retrospective eight-match ban for elbowing Portsmouth's Pedro Mendes.<br><br>Yet the FA's disciplinary committee must be able to prove Hunt set out to injure Cech.<br><br>And they do not feel this incident is anything like as clear-cut as the Thatcher challenge.<br><br>Ironically, Sonko could still be punished for his challenge. The player had already been booked and, if Riley now feels he deserved a second yellow, Sonko would get a one-match ban. </span><br><br></div>
