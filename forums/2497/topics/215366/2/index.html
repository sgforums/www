            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech has been warned a return to action too soon after an operation on his fractured skull could prove fatal.<br><br>The stark warning comes from Peter Hamlyn, consultant neuro-surgeon and director for centre of sports at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London.<br><br>Hamlyn wrote: 'If Petr Cech returns too soon from his head injury, the result could be fatal.<br><br>'He risks what is known as `second impact syndrome'. This happens when a second blow causes swelling to the brain before it has recovered fully from an earlier injury. It is a situation that could prove fatal, even if the first blow is deemed not to be serious.<br><br>'With that in mind, I would think Cech is likely to be out for at least six months. 'That is about the length of time it takes for stout bone healing to take place.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JOSE MOURINHO was last night warned he could face legal action after repeating his claim that Stephen Hunt deliberately tried to injure Chelsea keeper Petr Cech.<br><br>The champions confirmed that Cech is on the mend after he regained consciousness yesterday following surgery for a fractured skull. And Hunt has written to the Czech Republic international, apologising for his challenge.<br><br>But that has not stopped Mourinho from going on the warpath - and piling pressure on the FA to punish the Reading midfielder. Mourinho raged: "It's one of the worst I saw in football because the goalkeeper is sliding on the wet pitch and has the ball in his hands, so the ball is not even half-and-half - it is completely safe in his hands.<br><br>"Then this boy goes to him with the knee in front and he knows what he's doing. And when he saw what he did, he was laughing.<br><br>"For me it was a very, very bad situation.<br><br>"Maybe the boy is only professional for a year, maybe was an amateur and has no sense of responsibility. I don't know.<br><br>"Maybe he didn't sleep before the game and was too excited about playing against Chelsea. The FA is there to do something and I will be curious waiting for the decision."<br><br>Players' Union chief Gordon Taylor believes 25-year-old Hunt could take legal action over the Chelsea manager's allegations.<br><br>Taylor said: "That course of action is open to any individual if someone has made those comments."<br><br>Hunt vehemently denied trying to harm Cech.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mourinho complaints against Reading FC's medical staff and the Berkshire ambulance service following the injuries to Petr Cech and Carlo Cudicini on Saturday.<br><br>One of the ambulance men who took Cech to hospital said yesterday: "Our reputation has been tarnished." He could hardly have been further from the truth. Only one reputation was tarnished in the aftermath of the unfortunate and regrettable injuries to Cech and Cudicini, and that belongs to Mourinho himself.<br><br>And this is, of course, a reputation that was discoloured long ago. The trouble with Mourinho's outbursts is that no objective outsider can now believe a word he says. After the unfounded suggestion that Frank Rijkaard visited the referee's room at half-time in the Nou Camp two seasons ago, and the much advertised 120-page dossier of alleged misbehaviour by Arsenal towards Chelsea, which turned out to be nothing more than a bunch of press cuttings, Chelsea's manager forfeited a great deal of his credibility. A bit more of it disappeared when he compared Stephen Hunt's collision with Cech to the notorious and heavily punished assaults committed in the last year by Michael Essien and Ben Thatcher, and the rest went over the horizon when he alleged that his No1 goalkeeper's transfer to hospital had been unnecessarily delayed, blaming everyone but his own medical staff.<br><br>Reading's response was notable for its precision and suffused with a controlled anger. Doubt had been cast on the integrity of their efforts on behalf of an injured man, and they were able to produce evidence in their own defence. Given the identity of their accuser, they had little trouble finding a sympathetic audience.<br><br>Mourinho's approach, however, is not the way to do it. Such wild accusations do greater damage to the accuser than to the accused, and a gifted coach will have lost even more admirers outside the little world of Stamford Bridge.<br><br></div>
