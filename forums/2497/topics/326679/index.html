              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ROBINHO is ready to stage a revolt at Real Madrid to force a £24million move to Chelsea. And Phil Scolari’s Blues last night confirmed they had made a formal offer for the Brazilian striker.</h2>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea say they have bid £19.75million — though sources close to the player suggest the offer is nearer to £24m. His representatives have held discussions with Chelsea who have offered him a five-year deal worth £70,000 a week — <strong>DOUBLE</strong> his wages at Real. But the Spanish giants will fight tooth and nail to keep the hitman after failing to land Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Robinho is desperate to join boss Scolari and will try to force Madrid to sell. The West Londoners are keen to maintain good relations with Real but the player is itching to move. An insider in the Robinho camp said: “While it is true that after Ronaldo’s decision to stay at Manchester United it is harder for Robinho to leave, he will do everything he can to make it happen.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Real are now faced with the situation they hoped Ronaldo would create at United. They wanted him to go on strike to force a move. Instead, the Spanish champions are faced with the prospect of a Robinho rebellion. He became unsettled after the club leaked news they would offer him as make-weight to United for Ronaldo.</p>
              <p class="article">Robinho, 24, already felt under-valued at a club where he is not one of the highest earners. Madrid have tried to commit him to an improved five-year deal but he met them with fierce resistance.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Meanwhile, former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is furious at being branded arrogant and a bragger by current Stamford Bridge chief Scolari. Mourinho — now in charge of Inter Milan — snapped: “They attack me because the next day it’s in the newspapers. It’s free publicity.”</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">He also hinted Brazilian Scolari was already feeling the heat to deliver at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho said: “I don’t feel pressure in succeeding at Inter but you have to ask Mr Scolari what he feels.”</p>

              <p><span class="heading"><strong>ROBINHO FURY AT REAL TREATMENT</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://images.sportinglife.com/08/05/330/Robinho_864329.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span class="italic"><em>Robinho - not a happy man.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Robinho's agent has revealed the Chelsea target's anger and dismay at his treatment by Real Madrid and says that he cannot stay at the club if he wishes to become the world's best player. Wagner Ribeiro pulled no punches as he told reporters that the Brazilian star has become completely disillusioned with life at the Bernabeu after the club's treatment of him this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Now Chelsea have made a former offer for Robinho the split between the player and Madrid has become even wider and the problems have now been exposed by Ribeiro. "Chelsea have made a formal proposal to Real Madrid for Robinho. I do not know the amount, but the offer has been made," he is quoted as saying in <em>Marca</em>.</p>
              <p>"Robinho is very angry with the way that the directors of Real Madrid have been behaved towards him. "He calls me every day to see if anyone has told me anything about his future and I have to tell him that I have received no calls. "I have spent three days trying to speak with some of the directors at Madrid, but they have all disappeared.</p>
              <p>"Robinho does not understand anything. He wants to be the best player in the world, but at Real Madrid he cannot achieve that because they treat him like a normal player. "He has liked nothing about the way that Real Madrid have gone about their transfer activity this summer."</p>
              <p>Madrid were reported to be ready to include Robinho in a swap deal with Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo and it is the Spanish club's pursuit of the Portuguese star that caused the problems, according to Ribeiro. "Real Madrid wanted to sign Cristiano Ronaldo and have not been able to. The second option was Van der Vaart. The third one was Villa and then in fourth place is Robinho;" he continued.</p>
              <p>"Things cannot be like that because he wants to be the best and he does not have the support at Real Madrid. He is also certain that Real Madrid is trying to sign David Villa."</p>
              <p>In recent months, Robinho stated that he only wanted to stay with Real Madrid, but that was before being made to feel like he was down the list of the club's priorities. "Robinho's plan has been to play for Real Madrid for many years and then go back to Santos. Where is he going to find a better club than Real Madrid," Ribeiro said.</p>
              <p>"But now he does not have the support he needs, and he knows that Scolari is wiling to give him that because he knows him and speaks to him often."</p>

              <h3>Calderon dismisses talk of Chelsea move</h3>
              <p class="ss-text-bold">Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon has ruled out 'any possibility' of Robinho leaving the Spanish champions for Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The Blues revealed on Thursday that they had made a bid - reported to be in the region of £20million - for the Brazil forward following a summer of speculation.</p>
              <p>Robinho's agent has outlined his client's desire to move to Stamford Bridge, but Calderon is adamant the 24-year-old will be going nowhere.</p>
              <p>"Definitely he (Robinho) is going to stay with us. The coach (Bernd Schuster) has said he wants him in our team," Calderon told <em>Radio Five Live</em>.</p>
              <p>"We don't see any possibility of him leaving Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>"We know Chelsea have been interested in signing him. He's one of the best players we have got in our team - we need him for the next season."</p>
