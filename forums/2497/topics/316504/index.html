              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Liverpool fans could be welcoming their new Kop heroes sooner than later if boss Rafa Benitez has his way.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Time is of the essence to Benitez, who has
              revealed the Reds are trying to sign new players this month, and not
              wait until later in the summer.</p>
              <p>Co-owner Tom Hicks has agreed to a summer spending spree of
              more than £30million, and Benitez has given chief executive Rick Parry
              a list of top targets.</p>
              <p>The Reds have already been linked to Aston Villa captain Gareth Barry and Wigan's Antonio Valencia.</p>
              <p>And any new faces will be coming quickly, hopes Benitez.</p>
              <p>He told the Daily Star Sunday: "We will not be waiting until
              August to sign players. I think we will do things well before. Perhaps
              you will see some evidence in a few weeks.</p>
              <p>"It will help me if the signings of new players are done early.
              It needs to be as soon as possible really, because then you know the
              situation and you can control the pre-season.</p>
              <p>"Rick knows the necessity of early deals. Our conservation the other day was very positive.</p>
              <p>"We are trying to fix the targets and progress. He knows that we want to sign the players right now.</p>
              <p>"We aren't working on signing new players in June or July - but to sign them in May if that is possible."</p>
              <p>After a trophyless season this term, Benitez is determined to return to winning ways.</p>
              <p>He said: "We want to win the next two games and we want to win silverware next season.</p>
              <p>"We have Pepe Reina, who can be the best keeper for another year, with more clean sheets than anyone if he has one more.</p>
              <p>"We have scored 116 goals. We want to be the best team in England - and people talk about us being defensive!"</p>

              <p><br>Peter Crouch is such a consistent player - keep scoring goals. Should have played him ahead of Dirk Kuyt. I can't understand Benitez. He is wasting a talent.</p>
