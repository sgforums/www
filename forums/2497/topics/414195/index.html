              <p><span>Liverpool players will wear poppies on their kit this November after the personal intervention of manager Roy Hodgson. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The Anfield club were one of only two sides to ignore last year’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>call for Premier League teams to have commemorative strips over the Remembrance weekend.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Manchester United, the only other side who refused, have so far not said whether or not they have had a change of heart. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Blackpool
               and Manchester City, who both wore the poppy with pride last year, were
               last night unable to confirm they would do so again. <br></span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Backing: United defender Rio Ferdinand has told

              </div>
              <p><span>All other 17 clubs have told the Premier League they will be wearing the symbol on their kits. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Last year’s campaign saw six clubs change their minds and rally to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>cause. <br></span></p>
              <div class="floatThirdRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/10/28/article-1324698-0BD0AD8C000005DC-594_196x617.jpg" alt="graphic.jpg" width="196" height="617"></div>
              <div class="floatThirdRHS"><br></div>
              <p><span>Hodgson has been the moving force
              behind Liverpool’s change of mind. A club spokesman said: ‘Roy Hodgson
              wore a poppy at the last game against Blackburn and he feels it is very
              important. We will be wearing shirts with poppies against Stoke on
              November 13.’<br></span></p>
              <p><span>The club
              will donate the commemorative shirts to the Royal British Legion for
              them to use to raise funds, and Liverpool will hold a collection when
              they entertain Chelsea on November 7.<br></span></p>
              <span>Sadly,
              United are maintaining their stance in defiance of public opinion. Last
              year, Sir Alex Ferguson’s side faced Chelsea on Remembrance Sunday at
              Stamford Bridge in poppyless shirts, upsetting Chelsea Pensioners in
              the stands. </span>
              <p><span>The club refused 
              to discuss the matter last night, but last year said: ‘We are proud of 
              the work we do with the armed forces and we do not feel a poppy on the 
              shirt would add to our contribution. Our staff and officials will be 
              wearing them as usual and we are confident we are doing the right 
              thing.’ <br></span></p>
              <p><span>High-profile individuals at the club are known supporters of the poppy appeal.  <br></span></p>
              <p><span>Ferguson
               sported one at press conferences last year and this week United 
              defender Rio Ferdinand has repeated a message sent by one of his 140,000
               followers on Twitter. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>The
               message read: ‘Can you please use your Twitfam to remind everyone to 
              wear their poppy with pride. I salute you’. Ferdinand’s reply was: 
              ‘Great shout.’<br></span></p>
              <p><span>When <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>launched the campaign last year — in response to an investigation by Charles Sale’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Sports Agenda</span> — only 12 top-flight clubs had informed the Premier League of their 
              intention to have a poppy sewn on the kit. By the end of our campaign 
              six further clubs — Portsmouth, Fulham, Bolton, Aston Villa, Blackburn, 
              Stoke — had been persuaded to produce special kits.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>United
               and Liverpool said the flower symbol would not show up on their red 
              shirts, but that excuse was made to look absurd by Arsenal’s poppy 
              display and subsequent auction. <br></span></p>
              <p><span>A
               Premier League spokesman said last night: ‘Football has a proud 
              tradition of honouring the nation’s troops and all of our clubs maintain
               close links with the armed services throughout the year. It is down to 
              each individual club to decide how best to do this, and we are sure all 
              20 will mark Remembrance Day appropriately.’ <br></span></p>

              <p><span><em><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail’s</span> campaign last year spread to rugby as both the All Blacks and Wales wore poppies on their shirts for their Test in Cardiff. </em><br></span></p>
              <p><span>Tottenham
               boss Harry Redknapp said: ‘I’m in favour of everybody wearing poppies. 
              We keep seeing young lads in Afghanistan getting killed. It’s horrific. 
              They are so brave. You look back over the years and the people we’ve
