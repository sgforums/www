              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">RAFA BENITEZ admitted the title was out of Liverpool's hands after Middlesbrough ended their 14-game winless run.</h2>
              <p class="article">Xabi Alonso's own goal and Tuncay's fine clincher wrecked Liverpool's 15-match unbeaten stretch in the Premier League - and took Boro out of the bottom three.</p>
              <p class="article">Kop boss Benitez said: "Before the game, it was very difficult - after the game, it is more difficult. "It depends on United. It will be more difficult, clearly."</p>
              <p class="article">Boro, without a league goal for 526 minutes of football, saw Alonso stick out a leg to put in-form Stewart Downing's 32nd minute cross past his keeper Pepe Reina. </p>
              <p class="article">Then on 63 minutes, as Liverpool struggled to exploit their large share of possession, Tuncay angled home the first Premier League goal by a Boro player since January 10 following Jeremie Aliadiere's precision cross.</p>
              <p class="article">Frustrated Benitez, whose side fell seven points behind leaders Manchester United, said: "In the first 30 minutes, we had five chances and you have to take your chances. </p>
              <p class="article">"After the own goal, we still had chances." Benitez's new contract remains unsigned and chief executive Rick Parry is quitting Anfield in the summer. But the Spaniard denies Liverpool are being unsettled by these off-field issues. And he said: "My advisers are in contact with the advisers of the owners, so maybe they will have a conversation and we will see if we can progress."</p>
              <p class="article">In contrast, Boro chief Gareth Southgate claimed his side deserved their shock triumph. Southgate said: "I am pleased for the players because they have had to endure a long period of frustration. "But their work ethic and their togetherness over the last seven or eight weeks in particular, as we have been building towards this, has been excellent and we have got to continue that now. </p>
              <p class="article">"Today is a huge lift because there will be teams sitting at home watching the scores coming in and they won't have expected us to get anything today.</p>
              <p class="article">"It will have dragged a lot of teams back into the fight at the bottom. "We are still in the cup, we are fighting in the league and we have shown that as a group this week, the fight is very much in them, and the quality is there as well, which is pleasing to see." </p>
              <p class="article">Certainly , though, for the opening half-hour, Liverpool looked the far more likely winners. Boro keeper Brad Jones had already kept out close-range efforts from Nabil El Zhar and Dirk Kuyt by the time Gary O'Neil forced Reina into a fine reaction save in the 11th minute. But, even even the craft of Alonso and returning skipper Steven Gerrard, on his 300th start for the club, failed to break down the Teessiders consistently.</p>
              <p class="article">Instead, Boro stole a surprise and fortuitous opener, unlucky Alonso diverting the ball in. That goal clearly settled Boro, who almost doubled their lead four minutes before the break when Downing robbed full-back Martin Skrtel and forced Reina to block well.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool, though, really ought to have levelled within three minutes of the restart. Gerrard ghosted into the box and pulled the ball back invitingly for El Zhar, who hammered his shot high. </p>
              <p class="article">O'Neil was just as wasteful three minutes later following Jeremie Aliadiere's pass. Mostly Liverpool continued to push forward, albeit struggling to create clear openings against a stubborn defence. And Benitez's side finally paid a heavy price. </p>
              <p class="article">But ultimately it was Liverpool who had most to rue.</p>

              <p>I find it very hard to understand even after all these years... How can a side win the Spanish champions then a few days later lose to a side that has not won in their last 14 matches and second from the bottom... Its reallt puzzle me...</p>
              <p>What puzzle me is how Rafa's Pool can consistently over the years win one big match only to lose or draw the next to a lowly side?</p>
              <p>I don't know about others, but every manager will leave a legacy behind when they leave the club. Like what i think of Wenger could be... He brought in lots of youngsters during his time and they also played attractive football. Jose, had his arrogance and good motivational skills but also his boring brand of football... Rafa, I am afraid could be remembered for only being a cup specialist and apart from this... this strange thing like his Pool can lose to the lowest of low... Like last season top lose to bottom of the table kind of stuff... weird...</p>

              <p>It is obvious that Ah Ben is king at Europe and flop at EPL.</p>
              <p>His selection of players are more suited for european style of play and suffered in EPL.</p>
              <p>At the same time, the players echoed the manager's preference towards champion league and EPL.</p>
              <p>To win the EPL, Liverpool would seriously need to strengthen its squad, which means digging deeper into the money.</p>
              <p>The american bosses are already to rolll out at the end of season.</p>
              <p>Ah Ben know this factor so he is not signing the contract till the end of the season.</p>
              <p>What is the point if you have the power and no money ?</p>

              <p>I think Rafa started out wanting to win the EPL, just like all his players too... Gerrard and Carragher have came out and said they would rather win the premiership than Europe and I think many Pool fans will agree with them too as they have already won the CL a few years back... The thing is, when they start to fall back in the league, they end up putting more or all their energy into Europe... This has become a yearly event until maybe even the mindset of the players thinks its normal...</p>
              <p>I honestly think Pool will be better off with a new manager... Rafa has been given enough time, more than enough funds, but the same problem still remains... And that is consistently losing to smaller clubs in the league year after year... This is a deep problem I think it reflect on the coach himself...</p>
              <p>I think if Rafa stays, he will have very little time left as the players that has saved his butt most of the time, Gerrard and Carragher are now coming to 30 or are there and about... They won't have much time left... And without them, I think Rafa's chances are very much slimmer... Its a real pity when they look back one day and realize they were good enough for premier league medals but have nothing to show for from their lifelong career at Liverpool...</p>

              <p>As for EPL, I agree with zocoss that unless he can bring out a strong second team to replace steven and jamie, we have no continuation of players.</p>
              <p>The money that will be given to him for the next season is zero.</p>

              <p>u know for a period of time, they were leading? well in soccer, the ball is round and anything may happen. im support man u, but they once were leading with over 10+ points but they still lost the title to arsenal. so anything can happened. who knows maybe liverpool can fight back after if suay suay man u lose a game, morale rised. they won the 2005 champions league by fighting from 3-0 to 3-3 and win the cl. so yeah, anything can happen.</p>

              <p>Ah Ben is king of Europe as he defer all expectations and beat
                  the european club at their home ground most of the time.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting he is using a normal team.</p>
              <p>As for EPL, I agree with zocoss that unless he can bring out a
                  strong second team to replace steven and jamie, we have no
                  continuation of players.</p>
              <p>The money that will be given to him for the next season is
                  zero.</p>
              <p>So, that may be the reason why he dun want to sign the
                  contract.</p>

              <p>u know for a period of time, they were leading? well in soccer,
              the ball is round and anything may happen. im support man u, but
              they once were leading with over 10+ points but they still lost the
              title to arsenal. so anything can happened. who knows maybe
              liverpool can fight back after if suay suay man u lose a game,
              morale rised. they won the 2005 champions league by fighting from
              3-0 to 3-3 and win the cl. so yeah, anything can happen.</p>
