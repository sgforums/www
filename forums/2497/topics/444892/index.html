              <p>I think he will come good... eventually. 2, 3, 4 or 5 years down the road perhaps, but still doesn't justify paying $35m for him at this moment in time though.</p>
              <p>Ba's form has only made things looked worse for him. One cost $35m, the other is free...</p>
              <p>Can't imagine if Ba was at Pool, i think they might be challenging for the title as well possibly or in the mixed withing the place 2, 3, 4 rather than in 6th all the time.</p>

              <p>SunSport can reveal that former club Newcastle would be willing to buy back the England striker.</p>
              <p>But for an astonishing £25m <strong>LESS</strong> than he cost the Merseysiders almost a year ago.</p>
              <p>The dramatic development comes after a top agent rang the club to offer them 23-year-old Carroll for just £20m.</p>
              <p>Newcastle flatly rejected the idea and a further proposal of £15m plus add-ons.</p>
              <p>They are prepared to offer £10m, though, for Carroll — who was a hero on Tyneside and would welcome a move back to his native North East.</p>
              <p>Newcastle refused to comment publicly but a Toon source said: "Andy's a Geordie boy and it would be great to bring him home.</p>
              <p>"But while he left on his terms he'd have to come back on ours."</p>
              <p>Carroll would have to take a massive cut to his £90,000-a-week wages to return to Toon and finally end his Anfield nightmare.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, who face Manchester City in the Carling Cup semi-final tonight, are denying trying to off-load their record signing.</p>
              <p>But rumours of a rift with Kop boss Kenny Dalglish are rife.</p>
              <p>Carroll's career has nosedived since the £35m move, exclusively revealed in SunSport last January, which made him the most expensive British footballer in history.</p>
              <p>He was injured when he first joined Liverpool so had to wait until March to make his debut.</p>
              <p>But he has struggled to justify the huge price tag and has been totally over-shadowed at Anfield by Uruguayan star Luis Suarez.</p>
              <p>Carroll has scored just six goals in 31 games in all competitions — way off the 33 in 90 matches he notched for the Toon.</p>
              <p>He was bought to partner Suarez in the wake of Fernando Torres' £50m switch to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>But the pair have failed to hit it off — and Carroll has spent long periods on the bench.</p>
              <p>There are also rumours that Carroll's growing frustration has led to clashes with Dalglish over his role at the club.</p>
              <p>Carroll argues the team are not playing to his strengths and only Steven Gerrard provides him with the service he needs to succeed.</p>
              <p>But it remains to be seen whether he is desperate enough to call it quits so soon — and whether Liverpool would stomach such a heavy hit.</p>

              <p>Torres is still providing assists and he need more play time with the rest of his team mates.</p>
              <p>As he is not the only top player, he is not the automatic choice for starting a match.</p>
              <p>But, that is what he wanted when he left Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Carroll is a different case where he was a pauper turn millionaire.</p>
              <p>Now, he dun have any motivation to play well since he is paid even if he is benched.</p>
              <p>He is also a static player where he have rely heavily on his team mates to provide him the proper pass for him to score.</p>
              <p>But, he is not doing himself any favour by his substitution last night.</p>
              <p>He tripped himself over and have to change his soccer boots.</p>
              <p>He also useless in providing any assists to his team.</p>
              <p>It is Liverpool's fault to buy a dumb pony from Newcastle in the time of panic.</p>
              <p>I find him lacking in a lot of areas and guess Liverpool is trying too hard to prove themselves right.</p>
              <p>One thing I find amazing is that some of fans are too forgiving in saying he is a good buy for the next 2 - 3 years.</p>
              <p>But, we need goals from him NOW and not 2 - 3 years later.</p>

              <p>Torres is just having bad luck in front of goal, but you will never know when he is back to his epic goal scoring form.</p>
              <p>Carrol is beyond useless, he need pin point pass for midfield in order to score. But i believe with good support from midfield any striker would be able to score.</p>
              <p>What a good striker needs is someone who can create slight chances out of nothing, someone who still give a threat to the opponent defence when the support is lacking.</p>
              <p>With gerrard heading towards retirement (stay to be a coach for young player) , carrol should be following soon (out of liverpool).</p>

              <p>Torres is still class as he can create his goal and possess intelligent football mind.</p>
              <p>Carroll is hopeless even he is given a perfect pass from midfield as he cannot shake off his marking.</p>
              <p>But, that is what he is made of and cannot expect he to change suddenly.</p>
              <p>He should be loaned to Sunderland where he belong.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Andy Carroll's Liverpool nightmare hit a new low as Kenny Dalglish's side stuttered at Anfield once again. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Substitute Carroll was given a huge Kop ovation when sent on by Dalglish in the 58th minute to try to break Stoke City's dogged resistance. </span></p>
              <p><span>Instead, the £35million man spent most of the time on his backside, either slipping over or vainly appealing for fouls. </span></p>
              <p><span>His only meaningful contribution in front of goal was to block shots by team-mates Jordan Henderson and Glen Johnson that might otherwise have crept in. </span></p>
              <p><span>Carroll has scored only four Premier League goals since being signed from Newcastle a year ago and the frustration is showing. </span></p>
              <p><span>He regularly complained to World Cup final referee Howard Webb about being held by Stoke defenders Ryan Shawcross and Robert Huth but Webb barely gave him a decision, clearly feeling the 6ft 4in striker was throwing himself over too easily. </span></p>
              <p><span>At other times, Carroll blamed his footwear for regular slips. </span></p>
              <p><span>The ex-Newcastle striker changed his boots, but it barely made any difference to his ability to stay on his feet. It would be unfair to lay all the blame for Liverpool's blank at Carroll's door, however. </span></p>
              <p><span>They have drawn seven of their 11 Premier League games at Anfield, which is too often for it to be a coincidence. </span></p>
              <div id="ext-gen4707" class="artSplitter">
              <p><span>Maybe Dalglish got it wrong with his unusual 3-4-2-1 system even though it worked against Stoke last season. </span></p>
              <p><span>The choice of Dirk Kuyt as a lone striker was strange given the Dutchman has not scored in the league this season. Ironically, he had the game's only clear chance from Jose Enrique's deflected 77thminute cross but headed wide from six yards. </span></p>
              <p><span>Liverpool's inability to finish off teams at home could cost them a Champions League spot and Dalglish did not look for excuses.</span></p>
              <p><span>'The responsibilty was on us to be more imaginative,' he said.</span></p>

              <p><span>'There was nothing wrong with the effort or determination but on the day we just weren't good enough.' </span></p>
              <p><span>The Kop roared for a penalty every time a Liverpool player went over, which was often in the second half.</span></p>
              <p><span>Webb talked to both sets of players because of the amount of tugging and jostling in the area at set-pieces. </span></p>
              <p><span>But the only couched criticism from Dalglish at Webb failing to deal with Stoke's tactics came when the Liverpool boss added: 'It is difficult to comprehend when they [the officials] say, "You need to stop holding people back", then it's not punished.' </span></p>

              <p><span>Stoke manager Tony Pulis put the wild appeals at every corner and free-kick down to 'desperation' and seemed to blame Liverpool fans more than the players.</span></p>
              <p><span>'They are a fantastic crowd. We were digging and they thought their players needed help. Some referees might have buckled but Howard Webb is experienced and strong enough not to. I'm not sitting here saying our goalkeeper made save after save. They only had one clear chance when Kuyt should have scored.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Dalglish used three central defenders in beating Stoke 2-0 in February and adopted the same system again, despite being unable to use either goalscorer on that occasion, Raul Meireles and Luis Suarez.</span></p>
