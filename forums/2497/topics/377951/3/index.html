              <p>There was a lot of luck involved though in that win. They were 3-0 up remember and Milan got complacent and totally let go of the accelerator.</p>
              <p>Just like in 1999, i remember when Bayern were leading the match 1-0 and the time almost up, their midfielder Mario Basler and some others took his own sweet time and even went to chat up with the fans.</p>

              <p>It is strange why he is not quitting even given such lousy resources to fill up the squad.</p>
              <p>Maybe he want to prove that he can clinched the BPL title before he moved on.</p>

              <p>liverpool can win major tittle. as long as they change rafa benitez. gerrard is aging, and he havnt win EPL? i like gerrard as england's player. but he is missing the EPL tittle. sad isnt it?</p>
              <p>rafa benitez is good in europe football, not in the EPL.</p>
              <p>arsenal and man utd are still more successful in terms of team management, under the two best manager in modern day soccer, arsene wenger and sir alex ferguson. look at arsenal's and man utd's youth player.</p>
              <p>there are always victim on every team.<br>liverpool - lucas<br>arsenal - diaby<br>man utd - foster</p>
