              <h1>George Gillett blames Rafael Benítez for Liverpool's poor start</h1>

              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00869/Rafa_Benitez_280x39_869988a.jpg" alt="Rafa Benitez" width="280" height="390"></p>
              <p class="small bold">ACCUSED ... Rafa Benitez</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">GEORGE GILLETT has sparked another war with Rafa Benitez by claiming the Liverpool manager is solely to blame for the club's ongoing title misery.</h2>
              <p class="article">Gillett insisted he and co-owner Tom Hicks should have had some return for the £128million they have invested in players over the last 18 months. But the American pointed the finger squarely at Benitez for the lack of success.</p>
              <p class="article">Gillett said: "The money we have invested means it should be getting better. "Now, if it's not getting better, it's not Gillett and Hicks, it's the manager, it's the scouting.</p>
              <p class="article">"You have to make sure you balance out your analysis. "There was plenty of money, so if you have any complaints, take a look at the ins and outs."</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez splashed £40m this summer on Glen Jonson, Alberto Aquiliani and Sotirios Kyrgiakos. But Gillett claims there was at least a further £12m available for team strengthening, with the Reds hoping to end their 20-year wait for the league title.</p>
              <p class="article">Gillett was speaking to fans group Spirit of Shankly outside the club's training ground before the 6-1 thrashing of Hull last week.</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez has recently tried to avoid confrontation with the Reds moneymen following numerous bust-ups in the past. But these latest comments are sure to put the fiery Spaniard back on the warpath.</p>

I never really saw lucas played back in Brazil before but he is actually good enough to earn a few caps and that he won the Bola de Ouro shows quality in him.

              <p>Scouts are impt, n ah ben can't be doing all  the scouting work if he has to run the team..as for motivation coach, it's more on training mental strength which i tink benitez can't do.. as for tactician, well..it's all up to benitez if he still really tink lucas is fit to wear the red jersey...</p>

              <p><br>Even if a rich owner was to takeover, with the new rule going into effect in the near future, pool will not be allowed to splurge the cash. Actually now i am also worried for the future, especially since benitez has brought in so many youngsters, i hope some of them do make the cut to be the next gerrard, torres, carragher and so on. stevie and carra are getting old.</p>
              <p>As for now, the season is only getting started and lets pray that pool get into top gear and start going into a winning streak, thats where they CAN be a title contender and the rest is up to fate.</p>
              <p>Aquilani has not played yet so I shall leave any judgements on him after a few matches. Lpool's best player so far has to be torres and benayoun, especially the israeli who has been their spark in attack.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">RAFA BENITEZ has been left stunned by Liverpool co-owner George Gillett's latest outburst.</h2>
              <p class="article">American Gillett told a Reds fan group that any failures on the pitch are down to boss Benitez, rather than himself and partner Tom Hicks. The fans group are one of many who want to try to oust Gillett and Hicks.</p>
              <p class="article">But the former insisted that if the team is not getting better, it is entirely down to the manager.</p>
              <p class="article">Benitez refused to react publicly but is less than happy at the club airing its dirty linen in full view once again.</p>
              <p class="article">An Anfield source said: "He's not saying anything but it's safe to say he wasn't exactly delighted about what's been said."</p>
              <p class="article">Anfield top brass are maintaining their silence over Gillett's comments but are fully behind the boss.</p>
              <p class="article">They insist Benitez's relationship with managing director Christian Purslow - the man appointed by the Americans - is as strong as ever.</p>
              <p class="article">And bizarrely, Gillett has helped strengthen Benitez's position, with fans taking the side of the manager as the club stumbles into more off-field chaos.</p>
              <p class="article">Despite some below par displays on the field, there is no suggestion Benitez's position is under threat.</p>
              <p class="article">But the latest embarrassment hardly strengthens an already fragile relationship between the Anfield chief and the owners.</p>
              <p class="article">And it will do little to help preparations for a crucial eight days after the international break.</p>
              <p class="article">Liverpool travel to Sunderland, face Lyon in a must-win Champions League clash and then have an Anfield showdown with Manchester United.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>sad to hear that the boss is accussing its own manager...if i were Benitez,i think i would have gone to a better club. No unity and no faith in a manager. Look at SAF and Wenger,they enjoy so much support from the management. Even though Arsenal did not win any Trophies, they are somehow spared from the media cristicism...SAF took 10 yrs to build his Empire..the support they receive is enormous.</p></div>
