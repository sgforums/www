              <h1>Bernabau stunned by Benayoun.</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Benayoun2.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="161"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A late goal from Yossi Benayoun gave Liverpool a deserved win against
              Real Madrid as they put one foot in to the Champions League
              quarter-finals.
              <br> <br>The decisive moment came in the 82nd minute when Benayoun headed home a beautifully delivered Fabio Aurelio free-kick.
              <br> <br>While the free-kick and header were both textbook, questions have
              to be asked of the Madrid defence, who gave the little Israeli a free
              run and header.
              <br> <br>The finger will also be pointed at Gabriel Heinze, who needlessly
              bundled over Dirk Kuyt while the ball was in the air to give the Reds
              the chance to whip a cross in.
              <br> <br>Throughout the game, the home side rarely threatened the Liverpool
              rearguard, being limited to shots from distance, with only Dutch winger
              Arjen Robben providing any spark.
              <br> <br>Madrid golden boy Raul was handed the first chance of the match, firing a shot at Pepe Reina who saved comfortably.
              <br> <br>Liverpool's first opportunity came from a long ball by Reina which
              evaded everyone but Fernando Torres. The Spanish striker raced into the
              box and fired across Iker Casillas, who saved well.
              <br> <br>The rest of the half saw efforts coming from distance, twice from
              Robben, as well as Gonzalo Higuain and Junior Marcelo, while a
              trademark 60-yard shot from Xabi Alonso almost caught out Casillas on
              the stroke of half-time.
              <br> <br>The second half provided more of the same from the Reds, as they
              continued to snuff out any pressure from Madrid and looked to counter
              through the likes of Benayoun and Kuyt, who toiled away endlessly.
              <br> <br>After Liverpool lost Torres with an ankle knock that he had picked
              up in the first half, Madrid began to play further up-field. The only
              chance they mustered came through Robben, who fired a vicious shot
              which moved through the air and was parried by Reina. <br> <br>However, the final say came from the away side, as Benayoun's
              header gave the Reds a famous win in front of a stunned Bernabeu crowd.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Liverpool deservedly won 1-0 against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu with a late strike from Yossi Benayoun.</p>
              <p>The Reds looked comfortable throughout against a disappointing Madrid team.</p>
              <p>The home side were restricted to long range efforts as Liverpool always
              had that control, the only threat coming from an Arjen Robben effort.</p>
              <p>Fernando Torres and Benayoun had chances to catch Madrid on the
              break but with eight minutes remaining it was the Israeli international
              who, unmarked, headed home Fabio Aurelio's free kick.</p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez was delighted with the result.</p>
              <p>"We knew it was going to be very difficult," admitted Benitez.
              "They were winning games in a row so we knew they had a lot of
              confidence.</p>
              <p>"We needed to work very hard, we had some chances and at the
              end from the free kick we scored a very good goal and without Gerrard
              and Torres in that second half the team was doing well.</p>
              <p>"He (Torres) twisted his ankle in the first half and we were
              waiting but we could see that he wasn't fully fit and would be a risk
              for the next games.</p>
              <p>"It's important in Europe not to concede but especially here
              because they've been scoring so many goals, but teamwork was very good.</p>
              <p>"I was very pleased with the team's defending and also we were
              going forward and trying to score and at the end 0-1 is a very good
              result."</p>
