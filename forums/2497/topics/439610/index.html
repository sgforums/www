              <p>Former Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez has played down Sir Alex 
              Ferguson's role in the success of Manchester United, insisting that 
              money has been the decisive factor in the club's triumphs and not the 
              Scot's management skills.</p>
              <p>Benitez
               and Ferguson were Premier League rivals for six seasons, with the 
              pair's relationship in that time somewhat tempestuous.</p>
              <p>And ahead 
              of this weekend's clash between United and Liverpool, Benitez has opened
               up old wounds by questioning Ferguson's influence on the Red Devils' 
              success in an interview with<em> BBC Radio Merseyside</em>.</p>
              <p>After it
               was put to him that Ferguson's personality has been critical in driving
               United forward, Benitez responded: "No, I think it's the money they 
              were spending. If you analyse the transfer record and the history ... 
              Rooney, or Ferdinand, for example ... £30 million for a young player or a
               centre back.</p>
              <p>"Every year they [United] are very well-off. It's 
              not just because of the interviews or the press conferences; it's 
              because they had money."</p>
              <p>Benitez and Ferguson's troubled 
              relationship came to a head during the 2008-09 season, when Liverpool 
              ran United close before the Red Devils pipped them to the Premier League
               title.</p>
              <p>During that campaign, Benitez delivered a pre-prepared 
              critique of his opposite number, listing a series of "facts" that 
              suggested Ferguson influenced both the Premier Leage fixture list and 
              choice of match officials.</p>
              <p>But Benitez has once again dismissed 
              the notion that the infamous "facts" press conference was responsible 
              for Liverpool's failure to beat United in the title race.</p>
              <p>"To be 
              fair, I didn't like it when the press was talking about mind games 
              because I was just focused on my team, and the things I had to do for 
              the team," Benitez said.</p>
              <p>"If you say something in a press 
              conference I can guarantee you that it has no impact on another manager.
               It can happen perhaps one in one hundred times, but the press likes to 
              talk about mind games, but what they don't realize is that you cannot 
              win mind games if you have a bad team.</p>
              <p>"You can be the best in the
               press conference, but after, if you have a bad team you will lose. It's
               easy to talk about mind games when he [Ferguson] has a good team and he
               has won, and that was the case."</p>
