              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Milking the applause: Gerrard celebrates his opener at West Ham</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>captain Steven Gerrard has seen off the challenge of six </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Manchester United</strong></span></a><strong> players to be named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year.</strong></p>
              <p>Gerrard topped the writers' poll, followed by Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney, Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Cristiano Ronaldo and Michael Carrick.</p>
              <p>The England midfielder succeeds Ronaldo, winner for the past two years. Gerrard is the first Liverpool player to win the prestigious award, which dates back to 1948, since John Barnes in 1990.</p>
              <p>Initially Gerrard thought it was a wind-up when he was told but said: 'I am proud to win the award though I would not have been able to do so without the help of everyone else at Liverpool.'</p>
              <p>The choice of Gerrard has echoes of 1999 when Tottenham Hotspur's David Ginola was named Footballer of the Year even though Manchester United won the Treble that year.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has never let football writers forget this 'unforgivable' oversight but 10 years on the United vote was once more split to an extent it allowed an 'outsider' to come through.</p>
              <p>It will be of little consolation to Ferguson but United players have been a victim of their own success again as far as the Footballer of the Year is concerned with six of the top eight choices.</p>
              <p>While most Liverpool fans would agree Gerrard has been the Reds' outstanding player this season and Lampard would no doubt be the selection of the majority of Chelsea followers, United have had more outstanding performers than any other club.</p>
              <p>That, of course, is why they have already won the World Club Cup and Carling Cup this season are are favourites to complete the unprecedented Quadruple by retaining their Barclays Premier League and Champions League crowns.</p>
              <p>Gerrard will receive the award at a dinner in London on May 29.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard admits he was surprised to be named the Football Writers' Footballer of the Year.</p>
              <p>He is the first Liverpool player since John Barnes in 1990 to claim the honour.</p>
              <p>"I'm delighted but I'm a little bit surprised," said the 28-year-old.
              "When you look at the quality of the players there are in this league,
              it's a great privilege to win this kind of award.</p>
              <p>"It's not just the Manchester United players. When you look at
              the players the likes of Chelsea and Arsenal and other teams have got,
              they all have fantastic players throughout their squads now.</p>
              <p>"The quality is getting better and better each year so to win this award is a great achievement for myself.</p>
              <p>"It's made even more special for me because I am following in
              the footsteps of Liverpool players like John Barnes, Steve Nicol and
              Kenny Dalglish who were heroes of mine.</p>
              <p>"Then further back players like Ian Callaghan and Terry McDermott who were heroes to my dad and so many other Liverpool fans."</p>
              <p>Gerrard will receive the trophy at an Football Writers' Association gala dinner in London on May 29.</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez had nothing but praise for his
              captain, who has been the driving force behind their bid to challenge
              Manchester United for the Premier League title.</p>
              <p>"I'm really pleased for Steven," Benitez told <em>liverpoolfc.tv</em>. "It is fantastic for him because he was competing with a lot of good players.</p>
              <p>"For him to be named player of the year is massive credit to him and shows just how much he has achieved."</p>

              Football Writers' Association Player of the Year on Wednesday and Reina
              said there was no-one more deserving. </strong></p>
              <p>"I am happy with it. It's fully deserved - and not just in terms of England, but for the whole world," he said.</p>
              <p>"This season he has been superb - our best player, the best player in England and the best player in the world.</p>
              <p>"Liverpool are a different team without him. We have to play and compete as a whole squad but he is key for us."</p>
              <p>Many thought Gerrard should have also won the Professional
              Footballers' Association's award last month but that went to Manchester
              United veteran Ryan Giggs, who was second in the FWA poll with
              team-mate Wayne Rooney third.</p>
              <p>Reina said the media had got it right in selecting form over sentiment.</p>
              <p>"To be honest, when it got out that Ryan Giggs had been given
              Player of the Year by the PFA, well it was fair because he's played for
              a long time, but for me Stevie was the one," Reina told liverpoolfc.tv.</p>
              <p>"But the media have given the right award - it's fully deserved."</p>
              <p>Gerrard was quick to credit manager Rafael Benitez and his team-mates with having a hand in his personal success.</p>
              <p>"I've had fantastic help along the way from everyone at this
              football club," said the 28-year-old, who has scored 23 goals this
              season, with his 15 in the Barclays Premier League helping Liverpool
              sustain a title challenge with United.</p>
              <p>"My family and friends come every time I play and everything I
              achieve in football they are a very big part of that because they are
              there for me 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
              <p>"But the biggest thank yous have to go to the manager, the coaching staff and my team-mates.</p>
              <p>"Individual awards are great but you don't win them without great help from those people."</p>
              <p>Benitez paid tribute to Gerrard for the season he has had.</p>
              <p>"I'm really pleased for Steven. It is fantastic for him because he was competing with a lot of good players," Benitez said.</p>
              <p>"For him to be named player of the year is massive credit to him and shows just how much he has achieved."</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Tottenham boss Harry Redknapp says Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard stands alone as the world's best player.</p>
              <p>In his column for <em>The Sun</em>, Redknapp wrote: "There is only one
              player who could walk into any of the best teams in the world — and
              it’s the Liverpool captain.</p>
              <p>"He is world class in every department and that’s not just the
              usual platitudes or me gushing over Gerrard a couple of weeks before he
              plays against my team in the hope we get an easy ride.</p>
              <p>"I still firmly remember going up to Anfield one night when I was manager of West Ham.</p>
              <p>"It really was like playing against a one-man team, it was as if he could have beaten us on his own.</p>
              <p>"Thinking back to it, it was like watching Roy of the Rovers.
              Every pass was inch-perfect, every run was expertly timed and his
              engine in midfield was relentless. His class has not dipped over the
              years, he is still a magnificent footballer — not an athlete — a
              footballer.</p>
              <p>"The five best teams in the world at the moment are Manchester United, Barcelona, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"And he would stroll into any of those teams in my opinion.</p>
              <p>"I’m delighted he has been voted Footballer of the Year by the
              Football Writers’ Association — the guys who sit in freezing Press
              boxes all season long and watch the best we have on parade in front of
              them."</p>

              <p><strong>Guus Hiddink disagrees with John Terry’s choice of Player of the Year, insisting Steven Gerrard was the worthy winner. </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/premier_league/liverpool/gerrard_quiet_480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>

              colleague to the Football Writers award, but Hiddink has a very
              different viewpoint. </strong></p>
              <p>The temporary Chelsea manager has had time to work closely with Lampard, but he admits nobody can deny Gerrard his success.</p>
              <p>"Gerrard deserved it fully, what he was nominated for," said Hiddink.</p>
              <p>"He had a tremendous season, not just in his efficiency on the pitch, but also in his appearance as a professional player.</p>
              <p>"He is very warm-hearted towards his club. You could say the same for Frank Lampard. He is well respected all over England."</p>
