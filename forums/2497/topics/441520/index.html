              <p><strong>Patrice Evra has been informed that he may have difficulty proving he was the victim of racial abuse from </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Luis Suárez" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/luis-suarez"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Luis Suárez</strong></span></a><strong>, because of a counter-argument that certain variations of the N-word are not deemed offensive where the </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong> player grew up, in Uruguay.</strong></p>
              <p>The <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Manchester United" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchester-united"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester United</span></a> defender has accused Suárez of using racist language during a 1-1 draw at Anfield on 15 October and is waiting to discover whether, almost a month later, the Football Association will charge the Liverpool striker with misconduct. Top-level sources at Old Trafford say the offending word was uttered in Spanish and allegedly was a derivative of "negro", with Evra stating that it was used "at least 10 times".</p>
              <p>However, Suárez has categorically denied racially abusing the Senegalâ€‘born France player and the FA's investigators are having to consider the different context with which words that would be considered offensive in England are commonly used in Uruguay and other Spanish-speaking countries.</p>
              <p>"Negrito", for example, could have shocking connotations for someone without full knowledge of the nuances of the language. But the counter-argument is that this is one of several derivations that are used in many countries, with no derogatory meaning – often in the same way someone could be called "pal" or "</p>
              <p>mate". An illustration of this comes in the form of the message Dani Pacheco, the Liverpool player who is currently on loan at Rayo Vallecano, sent to his Spain Under-21 team-mate Thiago Alcântara via Twitter on Friday. It begins: "Negrito, enjoy yourself …"</p>
              <p>This was a conversation between two friends. In Uruguay, it is quite common for commentators to use the same word to describe Premier League players. Visitors to the country can be taken aback by this form of language. But other derivatives are also commonly used, often to describe people of all races in affectionate terms, including family members.</p>
              <p>Whether Evra was aware of these nuances at the time is not clear, but he and United have subsequently been informed that the case does not merely rest on what Suárez said but also, crucially, the context in which his words were used. The two players were arguing at the time and it is beyond argument that Suárez was trying to wind up his opponent, but the crux of the matter is the meaning of whatever was said and differentiating between something that would not be offensive in one country but shocking in another.</p>
              <p>Suárez, backed by Liverpool, has repeatedly protested his innocence. The forward, who scored all four goals as Uruguay beat Chile 4-0 on Friday, has not publicly disclosed the words he used. He said last week that it was not an insult but just a "way of expressing myself. I called him something his team-mates at Manchester call him, and even they were surprised by his reaction."</p>
              <p>The complexities of a difficult, highly sensitive case help to explain why the FA has taken so long to decide whether to take action against Suárez. The player's poor grasp of English has also contributed, as all his interviews have been in Spanish, requiring careful translation.</p>
              <p>Any case against him would also have to prove that, having played in Europe since 2006, he should be aware of what is acceptable or not. However, this would be a difficult task. If Suárez accepts he used one of the Nâ€‘words, he would have the scope to argue it is a common and inoffensive term for someone of his background, citing a clash of language and culture between one player from South America and Europe.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have let it be known they will ask the FA to take action against Evra if the governing body concludes that Suárez has no case to answer. However, the latest revelations throw up the possibility that both players have given a legitimate account of what happened, rather than it being a case of one man's word against another.</p>
              <p>Kenny Dalglish, the Liverpool manager, has voiced his objections about the length of time the case is taking the FA, but it is still not clear when an announcement will be made. The case is so complex it may be that the FA needs to take advice from South America about the relevant linguistic issues before deciding whether or not to proceed any further.</p>

              <p>The striker was accused by the Manchester United defender following the 1-1 draw at Anfield last month.</p>
              <p>Speaking after the game, Evra told French TV: "There are cameras. You can see him saying a certain word to me at least 10 times.</p>
              <p>"There is no place for that in 2011."</p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Suarez told Uruguayan media earlier this month: 'There is no evidence I said anything racist to him. I said nothing of the sort.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'There were two parts of the discussion, one in Spanish, one in English. I did not insult him. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'It was just a way of expressing myself. I called him something his team-mates at Manchester call him, and even they were surprised by his reaction.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Evra reported his complaint to match referee Andre Marriner who included it in his report.</span></p>
              <p>But Suarez denied the allegation, saying: "I'm upset by the accusations of racism. I can only say that I have always respected and respect everybody.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>"We are all the same. I go to the field with the maximum illusion of a little child who enjoys what he does, not to create conflicts."</p>
              <p>The FA however have decided there is a case to answer, issuing a statement of a charge shortly after FIFA President Sepp Blatter claimed there was no racism on the pitch in football.</p>
              <p>It read: "The FA has today charged Liverpool's Luis Suarez following an incident that occurred during the Liverpool versus Manchester United fixture at Anfield on October 15 2011.</p>
              <p>"It is alleged that Suarez used abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards Manchester United's Patrice Evra contrary to FA rules.</p>
              <p>"It is further alleged that this included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>"The FA will issue no further comment at this time."</p>
              <p>Liverpool have vowed to stand by the Uruguayan, who they say will plead <strong>NOT</strong> guilty to the charge.</p>
              <p>They said: "The club this afternoon received notification from the Football Association of their decision to charge Luis Suarez and will take time to properly review the documentation which has been sent to us.</p>
              <p>"We will discuss the matter fully with him when he returns from international duty, but he will plead not guilty to the charge and we expect him to request a personal hearing.</p>
              <p>"Luis remains determined to clear his name of the allegation made against him by Patrice Evra.</p>
              <p>"The club remain fully supportive of Luis in this matter."</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>United and Swansea players will warm up in anti-racism T-shirts at the Liberty Stadium, but Ferguson said: 'We have been asked by the FA not to say anything about the Evra situation and we have abided by that.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I think Liverpool have been drip feeding a lot of stuff in the last couple of weeks but the FA will deal with it.

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'I can understand he wants to support someone from his country but he's got to think more about it. I don't know how the question was put to him, but it seems his criticism of Evra is a bit silly.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Having accused Evra of 'crying like a baby' in the row with Suarez, Poyet yesterday said that he would go to court to defend his compatriot's reputation.
