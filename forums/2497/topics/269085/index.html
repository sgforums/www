            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Carlos Tevez's representatives have accused West Ham of making misleading public statements about the player.</strong><br><br>The Argentine's proposed move to Manchester United has been held up after a dispute between West Ham, Manchester United and Tevez's agent Kia Joorabchian.<br><br>Tevez arrived in Manchester on Tuesday to undergo a medical, but West Ham refused permission for the medical to go ahead and the player has now gone away on holiday with his future still up in the air.<br><br>The wrangle over his ownership rights continues with West Ham claiming they own Tevez, while Joorabchian's Media Sports Investment group say they own the economic rights of the player.<br><br>Manchester United have asked Fifa to intervene to try and resolve the dispute, while West Ham have also referred the matter to football's world governing body.<br><br>Joorabchian has now also revealed he plans to take the affair to Fifa and the Football Association to try and sort out the wrangle and he has accused West Ham of lying over what they are saying about Tevez.<br><br>In a statement released by the businessman's lawyers, Joorabchian said: "Press statements both today and over last few weeks are wholly inconsistent with the real circumstances and the situation presented to us by West Ham concerning Carlos Tevez.<br><br>"We as a company have patiently kept away from the issues including West Ham in order to give the club the opportunity to resolve the matter in a legal and agreeable way acceptable to all parties.<br><br>"West Ham have consistently provided private assurances while at the same time making contrary statements to the public at large.<br><br>"We can no longer allow these inconsistencies to continue unaddressed.<br><br>"During his time at West Ham Carlos Tevez performed at a high standard. He was voted Hammer of the Year by the club's fans.<br><br>"There was a period at the end of last year when Carlos had the opportunity to leave the club and yet he decided to stay to successfully help West Ham survive in the Premier League.<br><br>"We wish to make clear that at all times it has been our intention to find an amicable solution and Carlos Tevez has, at no time, acted improperly in relation to his move to Manchester United Football Club as he was given permission via his representatives to talk to other clubs to reach an amicable agreement.<br><br>"Over the last six months West Ham have made repeated promises and assurances which they have not acted upon or performed. It is now time for these inconsistencies to be brought to an end.<br><br>"We see no alternative but to bring the true circumstances to the attention of a higher authority to aid a rapid conclusion to this issue."</div>
