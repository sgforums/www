              <p>Liverpool
              boss Rafa Benitez admits they'll be cheering on Manchester City in
              today's derby against Premiership leaders Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Benitez's men are above Manchester United on goal difference
              following the 3-0 win at Liverpool, courtesy of two goals from Steven
              Gerrard and a late Ryan Babel strike.</p>
              <p>The focus is now on how United, with two games in hand, get on against their neighbours.</p>
              <p>"We have done our job," Benitez said. "We have to keep winning,
              that's all we can do. We needed to get three points and put them under
              pressure, and now we will be cheering and supporting Manchester City.</p>
              <p>"It's a derby and if they make a mistake they will be feeling
              the pressure. Manchester City are a difficult team to play against."</p>

              Nabei this fag always go around telling other team BEAT MANU, come his team play them then say WE'RE GONNA OWN YOUR ASS.
              
              Honestly I'm not only saying this cuz I'm a united fan but frankly this kind of behaviour is making me sick. He really should concentrate on his own team's performance rather than playing mind games, which are'nt exactly working either

              <p>I think Rafa's attempt at mind games is rather poor...</p>
              <p>He should have said something more like City are inferior to United all these year... The players are not as experienced as United's... And he find it hard to belief City will be of any threat to United... Like this the City players will be more fire-up to prove him wrong and may have an extra gear to their game... Afterall, its still a derby match and pride is at stake, and bragging rights too...</p>
              <p>But just saying, We needed to get three points and put them under pressure, and now we will be cheering and supporting Manchester City. "It's a derby and if they make a mistake they will be feeling the pressure. Manchester City are a difficult team to play against."</p>
              <p>This is like, nothing leh... Just saying if they make a mistake they will be feeling the pressure... City also will feel the pressure...</p>
              <p>Years ago how Fergie crack up Keegan was after his match, he gave an interview that questioned Leeds honesty to the sport... Keegan's Newcastle was to meet Leeds next and Fergie some how hint that cos Leeds hate United so much that they may throw away the match... lol...</p>
              <p>Leeds of course came out fighting to prove Fergie wrong and Keegan was really upset that he lost control and made that "I'd love it if we beat them’ rant on live television"</p>
              <p>Newcastle 12 points lead at one stage was eventually overtaken cos they came under pressure from United and Fergie's mind games... Keegan didn't know how to deal with it...</p>
              <p>This time, Rafa's mind games... despite trying so many, almost every week got one, didn't seem to work...</p>

              <p>Agree.. the difference for liverpool this season is that they beat manchester united twice as compared to last season which they lost twice. Take 6 points away from liverpool in the current standings and they will be behind chelsea in third place.</p>
              <p>Not much difference between the consistency to beat smaller teams as compared to last season, althought they are slightly better. Championship form? Not quite.</p>
              <p>I think the only improvement is their goal scoring ability. They are the top scorers this season, well done.</p>

              <p>well, Mancity beat MU twice last season too, but hey, look at where they are at.. I think the key is not how many U put into the net, but when to score, and of course, when not to allow other teams to score.. As such, Rafa seems to get it against Spanish teams, perhaps he needs to return to La Liga..</p>
