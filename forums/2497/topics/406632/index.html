              <h1>The Glazers are doing a great job, says Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson <br></h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has defended the Glazer family, claiming 
              Manchester United’s American owners have been treated unfairly by fans 
              desperate to get them out of Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has 
              consistently defended the Glazers since their controversial takeover in 
              2005 but made his latest comments because of the unrest caused by 
              United’s inability to match neighbours City in the transfer market.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Glazer: Criticised by fans</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Although chief executive David Gill reiterated this week that 
              Ferguson has cash for new signings if he needs it, fans fear the money 
              needed to service the £716million debt heaped on the club by Malcolm 
              Glazer and his family means their manager has no choice but to build 
              from within.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson said: ‘You know very well that no matter which business is bought nowadays, it’s usually bought with debt.</p>
              <p>‘Because
              it’s a football club it seems to attract a different type of negative
              reporting via the media or particularly some of our fans.</p>
              <p>‘It’s
              unfair that because a particular family like the Glazers have bought
              the club, they should come under criticism when anybody could have
              bought it.</p>
              <p>‘I have to say they’ve done their job well. They
              support myself and they’ve supported the players. I’ve never been
              refused when I’ve asked for money for a player so what can I do other
              than carry on the way we’re doing it? I’ve no complaints.’</p>
              <p>Those waging the green and gold campaign in an attempt to force out the
              owners will not bepleased to hear Ferguson’s public show of support.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <p>But
               Fergie says he has staked United’s future on his new generation of 
              players and promised that they will be his legacy when he quits Old 
              Trafford.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/28/article-0-0A72A0BD000005DC-665_306x423.jpg" alt="New boy: United defender Chris Smalling" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>New boy: United defender Chris Smalling </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>While City's spending is set to exceed £100million, United have so 
              far paid out £17m - £10m on Chris Smalling and £7m on Javier Hernandez -
               during a quiet summer in the transfer market, with Ferguson instead 
              relying on his young players to make the step up.He is adamant they will
               reward his faith by becoming United's new golden generation.</p>
              <p>'There
               will be a point obviously when I do quit,' said Ferguson. 'Now when the
               time comes I think the club will be OK. 'Whenever I do go, and I don't 
              see it being tomorrow, what you have to do is maintain the success of 
              the club and make sure that the club is always in good hands and there's
               no need for a complete overhaul of the playing squad.</p>
              <p>'I've got probably 12 players all under 21 which is a fantastic average age. The future should be pretty secure with them.</p>
              <p>'Over
               the years we've bought players for quite high amounts like Berbatov, 
              Ferdinand, Veron and Rooney. We try to equate how we're going to get the
               proper value before we do it. 'But we're in such a competitive world 
              that you're hamstrung in relation to the borders people will stretch to 
              get the best players.</p>
              <p>'When I see some of the values, and 
              you're talking about players at £40m or £30m-odd, I don't think the 
              enormous amounts of money they're paid rests easy with supporters, not 
              just for the transfer fees but for their salaries.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Putting pen to paper: Sir Alex Ferguson signing autographs in the United States</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'Now we take a quite good view of it and say let's look at our own 
              young players. Have they got the ability? How much can we trust them? Do
               we see a top player in that young player?</p>
              <p>'And we're not 
              bad, you know. There are some good young players who have come through 
              the system. They understand the club, they're loyal to the club and we 
              can build through that.'</p>
              <p>Chief executive David Gill 
              reiterated this week that Ferguson has cash for new signings if he needs
               it. However, fans fear the money needed to service the £716m debt 
              heaped on the club by the Glazers means their manager has no choice but

              <p>'The debt has come through the club being bought out by an owner,' 
              he said. 'You know very well that no matter which business is bought 
              nowadays, it's usually bought with debt.</p>

              they've supported the players. I've never been refused when I've asked 
              for money for a player so what can I do other than carry on the way 
              we're doing it, and the way I'm allowed to carry on? I've no 
              complaints.'</p>

              <p>United continued their tour of North America in Houston against the MLS All-Stars in the early hours of this morning.</p>
              <p>Asked
               what keeps him going at the age of 68, Ferguson added: 'The most 
              important thing is I'm at the right club. 'It's a fantastic football 
              club which demands a challenge all the time. Every day of every year we 
              have the challenge of being at the top. I think that helps me.</p>
              <p>'The
               second thing is that you need good natural energy which I've been 
              blessed with. The third is that I can keep going as long as my health 
              keeps going. If I have my health I will carry on.</p>
              <p>'I tried quitting a few years ago and it was a disaster. Agony. My wife made me change my mind and she was right.'</p>
              <p>Jose
               Mourinho remains one of the favourites to take over from Ferguson when 
              he retires, and the United boss offered an insight into the kind of 
              character required to succeed him.</p>
              <p>'We're a massive club, there's
               no question about that, and you have to ingrain yourself into the 
              fabric of the club immediately,' he said.</p>
              <p>'That gives you a 
              good chance in terms of understanding the history. It's not a history 
              you should be afraid of. I was never afraid of it, I was proud to be 
              part of the history. 'Then, after that you need a strong personality, a 
              strong mentality and, of course, you need to know the game.'</p>
