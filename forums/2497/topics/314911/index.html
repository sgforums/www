              <h2>Gareth Barry has admitted to being "flattered" by reports that some
              of the country's top clubs are keen on his services, but maintains that
              his mind is firmly on ensuring that Aston Villa have a spot in Europe
              to look forward to next season.</h2>
              <p>The Villans' skipper has been increasingly linked with a move to
              Liverpool or Chelsea, with Reds' manager Rafa Benitez believed to be
              especially keen on luring the 27-year-old.<br><br>"It's certainly
              flattering to be linked with them [Chelsea and Liverpool], but I'm
              enjoying my football here," insisted the industrious England midfielder.<br><br>"At this moment in time it's just speculation.<br><br>"It's
              something I've dealt with before and I will approach it exactly the
              same way as I have done in the past, until the manager says something
              different, or I hear something different.<br><br>"My job is on
              (playing) Birmingham City and helping Aston Villa finish this season. I
              don't see why else I should be sidetracked at this moment."<br><br>Barry,
              who has two years left on his contract at Villa Park, refused to rule
              out the possibility of leaving the club that he began his professional
              career with 10 years ago, however.<br><br>"I'll be lying if I sit here today and say I don't think about my own future," he said.<br><br>"But as I've always done I'll take it one year at a time and assess things at the end of the season.<br><br>"There's so much to play for, for Aston Villa, and that will be my job until we play West Ham away at the end of the season."<br><br>Villa
              boss Martin O'Neill, in the meanwhile, has admitted that losing Barry
              in the summer would be a massive blow to the club's plans for the
              future.<br><br>"We're going to do everything possible to keep him at the football club," said O'Neill over the club's coveted skipper.<br><br>"We're desperate for him to stay because he's a major part of it but I'm not surprised that loads of people are chasing him."<br><em><strong><br></strong></em></p>
