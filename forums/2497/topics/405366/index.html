              <h1>Aston Villa striker Emile Heskey retires from England duty after 
              World Cup debacle (and just seven goals in 62 caps)<br></h1>

              </div>
              <p>Emile Heskey has retired from international football after a 
              disappointing showing with England at the World Cup, where he failed to 
              score.</p>
              <p>The Aston
               Villa striker had been Wayne Rooney's partner of choice during the 
              reign of Fabio Capello, but lost his place to Tottenham's Jermain Defoe 
              after the first two games in South Africa this summer.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/15/article-1294948-0A1AE07C000005DC-497_468x348.jpg" alt="Emile Heskey and Fabio Capello" width="468" height="348">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Thank you and good night: Heskey (left) shakes 
              boss Capello's hand in South Africa</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Heskey won 62 caps for England, scoring just seven times, and divided
               opinion among fans and pundits alike.</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/15/article-1294948-0A2AB15E000005DC-46_233x362.jpg" alt="Emile Heskey's WAG Chantelle Tagoe " width="233" height="362">

              watches in South Africa</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'I have enjoyed every moment of my England career and 
              worn the shirt with pride every time I have been fortunate enough to 
              have been selected,' he said.</p>
              <p>'I would like to thank every 
              manager I have 
              played under, everyone at The FA and the fans for all their support over
              the years.</p>
              <p>'I wish the management team and the playing squad all 
              the best for the future.'</p>
              <p>The 32-year-old started the matches 
              against the United States and Algeria at the World Cup but was dropped 
              for the final group game against Slovenia, when Defoe stepped in to 
              score the only goal in the must-win game.</p>
              <p>While his contribution 
              to the Three Lions cause was often questioned by supporters, he remained
               a popular choice for several England managers.</p>
              <p>And despite a less
               than impressive strike-rate, he was a popular foil for Rooney, who was 
              able to feed of the strong big man's work with his back to goal.</p>
              <p>Heskey
               was handed his international debut by Kevin Keegan when he came on for 
              Kevin Phillips in the friendly against Hungary in Budapest on April 28, 
              1999.</p>

              <p>He played in the European Championships of 2000 and 2004 and was an 
              ever-present at the 2002 World Cup, scoring against DenmarkÂ  in the 
              first knockout round.</p>
              <p>After a three-year break Steve McClaren 
              brought him back into the England fold and he won his 50th cap against 
              Belarus in Minsk in October 2008.</p>
              <p>In addition to Villa, Heskey
               has also played club football for Leicester, Liverpool, Birmingham and 
              Wigan.</p>
