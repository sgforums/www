The manager, Jose Mourinho, has insisted that Shevchenko has not been match fit following a niggling back injury. But Shevchenko, who played for 55 minutes in Ukraine's 2-1 friendly win over Uzbekistan on August 22, appears to disagree.</strong><br><br>The striker is now back with the Ukraine squad to prepare for their Euro 2008 qualifying ties, away to Georgia on Saturday and at home to Italy next Wednesday. He is primed to start against Georgia. "At Chelsea, I am not playing and I don't know why," he said. "I have not understood this but I am waiting for my chance."<br><br>Shevchenko played in Chelsea's three matches on their pre-season tour of the United States and then appeared in the subsequent friendlies against Feyenoord and Rangers. He did not travel to Denmark for the final pre-season friendly with Brondby but he did train in the countdown to the Community Shield showpiece against Manchester United on August 5 and expected to feature.<br><br>Mourinho has not included Shevchenko in any of his match-day squads in the Premier League this season, most recently at Aston Villa on Sunday. He signed Claudio Pizarro on a Bosman free transfer from Bayern Munich over the summer to swell his attacking options that already included Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou, and Shevchenko has been left under no illusions that he must fight for prominence.<br><br>Abramovich has ordered Mourinho to play more entertaining football and although the Portuguese is trying, starting with two wingers and, until the defeat at Villa, two strikers as well, the team has not yet clicked this season. A frustrated Abramovich made an early exit from his Villa Park seat and he expects to see Shevchenko return to action. Pressure will be on Mourinho to select him after the international break, on Saturday week, when Blackburn visit Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Meanwhile, Michael Ballack's Chelsea future will come under further scrutiny after Germany's coach, Joachim LÃ¶w, yesterday claimed the player was mystified by the club's decision to omit him from their squad for the Champions League group stage.<br><br>Ballack was left out after his club insisted an ankle injury would prevent him from being fit. But LÃ¶w, preparing Germany for their qualifier against Wales, said: "I discussed it with Michael and he could not fully explain Chelsea's decision to me. Chelsea's doctors estimate he will not be able to play for two to three more months, but Michael is much more optimistic and expects to play sooner. For us, Chelsea's decision isn't justifiable."<br><br></div>
