              <p>Tevez
               is widely expected to leave the Premier League this summer after five 
              years, playing for West Ham United and Manchester United before the move
               to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>City are expected to want £50 million for their top scorer, who is just behind <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/12724/Dimitar-Berbatov">Dimitar Berbatov</a> on 19 league goals for the season. But that means there will only be a handful of clubs able to afford him.</p>
              <p>"It's difficult to be far from my daughters,'' Tevez was quoted as saying by
              <em>El Mundo </em>after helping <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/316112?cc=5739">City beat Stoke 1-0</a>.</p>
              <p>"I
               will think hard about what is best for me, first I want to clear my 
              head, I'm very well, very calm, but l also want to make it clear that I 
              have no problem with the board, nor with Roberto (Mancini).</p>
              <p>"As there has been a lot of talk that I have a problem with Roberto, I want to
              clear that up. If I stay at City I have to start thinking about what I can bear and it's
              very difficult, that's the truth.''</p>
              <p>City boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=150">Roberto Mancini</a> was adamant after the Cup final that Tevez would not be leaving the 
              club ahead of their first ever season in the Champions League.</p>
              <p>Asked
               if Tevez would be staying, Mancini said: "Yes. Tevez has a five-year 
              contract staying with us. He has a five-year contract with us, he 
              doesn't want to leave."</p>
              <p>Director of football Brian Marwood wants Carlos Tevez to reflect on what he would giving up if he decides to leave Eastlands.</p>
              <p>He
               said: "We are working hard to keep Carlos Tevez, as we are with 
              everybody. I just hope Carlos reflects on the season, reflects on 
              yesterday, reflects on the fact we are going to be playing Champions 
              League football and thinks: 'this is something I want to be part of'. 
              That is up to Carlos to think through in the summer.</p>
              <p>"You would 
              like to think Manchester City is going to be an interesting place over 
              the next few years Carlos asked for a transfer in January and the club 
              refused that. He is a massive player for us. He is our captain, he is 
              our top goalscorer. Everyone can see that when he steps over that white 
              line he gives everything.</p>
              <p>"He came into the final yesterday having
               just recovered from a very nasty hamstring injury but once again showed
               great leadership qualities.''</p>
              <p>Marwood believes City can now 
              challenge Manchester United: "In many respects when you look back it has
               been a missed opportunity not just for Manchester City but other clubs 
              at the top to put a bigger challenge on Manchester United.</p>
              <p>"It was
               a great day for Manchester and congratulations to United. They have 
              shown fantastic consistency in terms of another trophy. We believe we 
              can sustain a challenge not just on Manchester United but Arsenal, 
              Liverpool, who will be much stronger next season and Spurs. They have a 
              fantastic squad and will probably make one or two changes.</p>
              <p>"I 
              believe it is going to be a very exciting Premier League next season. We
               feel we are in a good position to compete. I look at our squad and I 
              see a lot of players who have come together in a
              short space of time. It is a team that is evolving.</p>
              <p>"It has been 
              an incredible season. The aims and objectives were to get into the top 
              four and really press ahead with that. The bonus has been the FA Cup.</p>
              <p>"I
               don't think there will be major changes, just tinkering with the squad.
               We have put together a group whose average is 24-25. We believe there 
              is a good four years with this group to develop even further. We are 
              really excited about that prospect.</p>
              <p>"There is a huge amount of 
              ambition with Manchester City starting with Sheikh Mansour right the way
               through the club. You have seen that with the players, you have seen 
              that with the manager (Roberto Mancini).</p>
              <p>"He is very focused and 
              not afraid to make tough decisions. It has got us into a position where 
              we can hopefully move on. But we have still got an awful lot left to 
              achieve. What you cannot afford to do an be is complacent."</p>
