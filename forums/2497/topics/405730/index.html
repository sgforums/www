              <p>This guy is a joke. He actually ask for parity wif Terry or Lampard in terms of pay at $130m pounds @ least.</p>
              <p>When the club offers him $95m pounds max, he quit Chelsea &amp; went looking ard for his $130m pounds pay.</p>
              <p>In the end when he couldn't find a club that pays that much, he panicked &amp; has to settle for a lesser $90m pounds pay.......</p>
              <p>Carlos was right, he did quit Chelsea for "financial reasons".</p>

              <p>Liverpool
               have signed former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole on a free transfer.</p>
              <p>The
               28-year-old England international left Stamford Bridge at the end of 
              last season after failing to agree a new contract with the Barclays 
              Premier League champions.</p>
              <p>Cole and has agreed terms on a four-year
               deal believed to be worth nearly £90,000 a week at Anfield and he will 
              undergo a medical in the next 48 hours.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/03/article-1271454-06F48AD8000005DC-61_468x379.jpg" alt="In demand: Joe Cole is seen by Liverpool as having the star 
              quality to spark a revival" width="468" height="379">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Blue Monday: Cole has joined Liverpool after 
              quitting Chelsea</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The England midfielder received offers from Arsenal and
               Tottenham,
               
              and also attracted interest from Manchester
               United only for his wage 
              demands to scupper a move to Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Teams in Italy were also linked, but after turning down the chance to
              play Champions League football, he has instead chosen to join new Reds 
              boss Roy Hodgson at Anfield.</p>
              <p>The capture of Cole was seen as being a key factor in proving to the 
              likes of Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres that Liverpool can still 
              compete for quality signings.</p>
              <p>Cole is the second summer arrival at
               Liverpool after Serbia forward Milan Jovanovic joined following the 
              expiration of his contract with Standard Liege.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/19/article-1295951-0A6F4881000005DC-899_468x357.jpg" alt="Joe Cole of England " width="468" height="357">

              </div>
              <p>Cole will be seen as a direct replacement for Yossi Benayoun, who 
              moved to Chelsea for £5.5million earlier this month, and only time will 
              tell who got the better of that exchange.</p>
              <p>Hodgson is still on the 
              look-out for a new left-back with Emiliano Insua on the verge of 
              completing his move to Fiorentina and Fabio Aurelio already released.</p>
              <p>After
               that the Liverpool boss will hope to secure commitments from Gerrard 
              and Torres about their futures.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/19/article-1295951-0A5E8205000005DC-7_306x319.jpg" alt="Milan Jovanovic signs on at Liverpool" width="306" height="319">

              </div>
              <p>Former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp, whose father Harry was 
              keen on signing Cole for Spurs, said reports the player was holding out 
              for the most lucrative contract were unfair.</p>
              <p>'From what I know, 
              compared to other players in the Premier League now, he's not being 
              greedy at all,' Redknapp told Sky Sports News.</p>
              <p>'He just wants a 
              good deal and rightfully so - he's a free agent and he's worked that 
              situation nicely - but I know he's not asking for anything astronomical,
               like what is being portrayed in the press.</p>
              <p>'He's just looking for
               the right club and he needs to play football now. He missed a lot of 
              time at Chelsea last season with his knee injury and didn't quite get 
              back to the level he showed previously.</p>
              <p>'He needs to go somewhere,
               be loved, and play football and get back to being the Joe Cole we all 
              know.'</p>

              <p>Cole is a good player, the only concern there might be is his fitness... Cos he is also quite injury prone like Harry Kewell... and being 29 soon, there is a real chance he could lose it by the time he reach 30... $90k per week is quite ok for his level of players but the problem I feel is, Pool gave him too long a contract... They should have just offered him a 2 yrs deal with an option to extend another if they think he can still bring it by then instead of a 4 yrs one cos wingers like his type might not be good once they reach 30...</p>
              <p>I recalled Fergie was looking around to replace Giggs when he was coming to 30 with much younger Kewell and Duff the target choice. Cos Giggs was seen as losing it at that time... But Harry Kewell was also injury prone and Duff went to Chelsea cos Roman paid big $$$ for him... In the end, Giggs re-invent his game like staying effective on the left-wing without his speed and also manage to convert himself into a central-midfielder...  The guy has manage to prolong his top level career by extra 6 years... But not everyone can do this... Kewell and Duff were also finished before they reach 30... Not that they cannot play anymore but have moved on to lesser clubs cos of drop in form due to injury or ageing...</p>

              to be honest, after Joe Cole's injury, he just does not seemed like the old Joe Cole anymore.</p>
              <p>I feel his best position is still on the wings rather than AMC or MC. MC he can't string passes like how Lampard/gerrad does.</p>
              <p>the thing he can do is a bit of trickery to get pass players at either sides of the pitch. but at the centre of the park, if you try to do tricks when theres no space, joe cole is effectively shut out.</p>

              <p>that is the problem with clubs too eager to get players they want.  they offer long contracts to entice them.  4 yr at 90k per week is crazy.  if he loses form or gets long term injury he becomes a 4 yr liability.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">JOE COLE will pocket a whopping £19MILLION at Liverpool.The England midfielder has signed a four-year deal worth £90,000 a week.</h2>
              <p>Cole, 28, gets the No 7 shirt - the same as Reds icon Kenny Dalglish - after leaving Chelsea as a free agent this summer.</p>
              <p>Anfield skipper Steven Gerrard is a massive fan. He said: "Joe's as good as Leo Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo on the ball and he'll give any player a run for their money when it comes to tricks."</p>
              <p>Kop legend Ian Rush added: "It's fantastic news for the club."Skill-wise, Joe is the best in England - there is no one better."</p>
              <p>Cole becomes new boss Roy Hodgson's first signing and is due to undergo a medical this morning in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>Hodgson has promised he will make signing more English players a priority as part of his Liverpool masterplan.</p>
              <p>Liverpool finished just seventh in the league last season but Hodgson lured Cole to Anfield with his vision for the future.</p>
              <p>Chelsea withdrew their offer of a new contract for Cole some months ago and he was officially released before flying out to the World Cup with England.</p>
              <p>Ironically, Liverpool's £5.5m sale of playmaker Yossi Benayoun to Chelsea cleared the way for his free-transfer move.</p>

              <p>have to agree, 4 yrs is abit too long and a risk to take. 2-3 years should be better considering that he's already 28. let's just hope he will turn out well and prove to worth the 90k per week pay.</p>
