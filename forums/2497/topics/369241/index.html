              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> is full of praise for LA Galaxy midfielder <abbr><span class="glossary-term">David Beckham</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: "Beckham is a great player but not exceptional. However, he won me over with his attitude and his character.</p>
              <p>"On the pitch he sees things long before most players and his vision of play is far beyond what it was when he played for <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr>. He has nothing to envy even a player like <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Kaka</span></abbr> in that department. He's slower than <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Kaka</span></abbr> but he's stronger than <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Kaka</span></abbr> tactically and technically.</p>
              <p>"At the end of 2008 when the club told me that they were going to be
              able to sign him and that he'd be able to start training with us in
              December I had no thought of playing him at the start of the second
              half of the season.</p>
              <p>"Immediately I saw him train I changed my view. He was
              consistently the first to arrive and the last to leave. I had literally
              no option but to include him in the playing group and then the team."</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> have joined the race for LA Galaxy midfielder <abbr><span class="glossary-term">David Beckham</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>, <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Fulham</span></abbr> are all understood to be ready to offer Beckham a route home should the
              American dream turn to a nightmare for the former England skipper.</p>
              <p>Should he remain loyal to the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">MLS</span></abbr> side, then the best any <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> club could hope for would be a loan deal. While Beckham's commitments
              with LA Galaxy could be over by the end of October, he would not be
              allowed to play for another club until January when the transfer window
              opens.</p>
              <p>According to one top-flight chairman, a move for Beckham only
              makes sense if you are a top eight club willing to sign him on a
              permanent basis.</p>
              <p>"The only way Beckham would benefit our revenue from shirt sales is on a worldwide level and most of the clubs in the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr> wouldn't have that sales ability," said the chairman.</p>
              <p>"If you weigh up a £15m transfer plus wages for a 34-year-old,
              whether you get 6,000 extra through the turnstiles and sell 10,000
              pairs of Beckham underpants with a club crest, it still won't recoup
              your money. It doesn't make very good business sense for most of the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Premier League</span></abbr>."</p>
