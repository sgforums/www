              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">TOTTENHAM striker Emmanuel Adebayor has vowed to shoot down Arsenal on Sunday.</h2>
              <p>But the former Gunner insists he has no plans to wind up his old club's supporters if he gets on the score sheet at White Hart Lane.</p>
              <p>Adebayor sparked controversy when he ran the length of the pitch to celebrate in front of Arsenal fans after scoring for Manchester City in a 4-2 victory in 2009.</p>
              <p>He has scored three goals in three games since moving to Spurs from City on loan in the summer.</p>
              <p>And he is desperate to add to that tally this weekend.</p>
              <p>He said: "If I have to go back to the Emirates and play I will just be a professional and play for my team.</p>
              <p>"I have already said several times that what happened at Manchester City was a big mistake.</p>
              <p>"I just wanted to take the emotion out of my body and I did it.</p>
              <p>"It was a big mistake and I regret doing it — not scoring against Arsenal — just the celebration.</p>
              <p>"But if I have to go to Arsenal and score at the Emirates I will do it but I won't do that celebration again."</p>
              <p>Adebayor, 27, admits he is in debt to Wenger for turning him into one of Europe's leading strikers.</p>
              <p>But he insists he was happy to turn his back on the red side of London.</p>
              <p>He added: "I had the chance to play for Arsenal for three and a half years and had some fantastic moments there.</p>
              <p>"I learnt a lot from the club and Arsene Wenger made me one of the best strikers in the world.</p>
              <p>"But at the end of the day I had to move on and today I cannot say I regret it because it's a decision we all have to make in life.</p>
              <p>"A couple of weeks ago it was Samir Nasri, before then it was Cesc Fabregas — we all have to move on."</p>

              <p><strong>Wojciech Szczesny has revealed that </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Arsenal" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong>'s defensive problems this season mean that they go into the north London derby at </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Tottenham Hotspur" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/tottenham-hotspur"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></span></a><strong> on Sunday having switched from a zonal to a man-marking system. Arsène Wenger decided on the change following the 4-3 defeat at Blackburn Rovers a fortnight ago. Those goals made it 14 conceded by Szczesny in the league after four games.</strong></p>
              <p>The Polish goalkeeper admits a preference for zonal marking, but he is happy with Wenger's decision. "I really don't mind as long as it works. I personally prefer zonal marking but it is the manager's decision what we are going to do," he said.</p>
              <p>"We have decided to change it since Blackburn. It really doesn't matter what you do as long as you do it correctly and it works. I think zonal works better for us. We have worked on it during pre-season where we never conceded from a set piece and it looked like it was working.</p>
              <p>"We did concede a stupid goal at Blackburn [Alex Song's 50th-minute own goal when no defender dealt with a free-kick] and I hope the man-marking will work for us now."</p>
              <p>The third goal allowed by Arsenal that day was also due to lax defending as Laurent Koscielny allowed a high ball to pass him at a corner. Szczesny admits that their problems from dead balls and aerial deliveries are now acknowledged by the squad and manager.</p>
              <p>"We do realise what our weaknesses are and defending set pieces was our weakness last season. We spent a lot of time working on it during pre-season and we can only get better on it as time goes on," he said.</p>
              <p>Szczesny cited Gaël Clichy's departure for Manchester City, Per Mertesacker's arrival in August and Thomas Vermaelen's long-term injury absence as factors in Arsenal's poor defensive record. He said: "It's a new defence and some of the players have to get used to playing with each other. You can see from game to game we are getting better, but it takes time. I hope we can avoid all the mistakes that we have made at the beginning of the season and if we stick together and keep working hard I am sure we are going to have a lot of clean sheets by the end."</p>
              <p>The injury list at Arsenal is a long one. While tests to Theo Walcott, who has a knee problem, Gervinho (muscular), and Koscielny (ankle), will establish if they can play at Spurs, Johan Djourou, Yossi Benayoun, Jack Wilshere, Sèbastien Squillaci and Abou Diaby are all unavailable for selection.</p>
              <p>Last season the two league fixtures between the old rivals ended with a 3-2 win for Spurs at the Emirates and a 3-3 draw at White Hart Lane. Regarding those four dropped points Szczesny said: "It doesn't really make a difference because when you go to White Hart Lane you forget about everything that happened in the past. It is all about being switched on and being focused for the game. If we are at our very best I am confident we can get the three points."</p>
              <p>"It is a game you always look forward to playing in. You train every game to play in those kinds of games. There are a few players who have never played at White Hart Lane and it will be a new experience for them. I am sure everyone will be at their very best."</p>
              <p>Emmanuel Adebayor faces his former club for the first time in a Spurs shirt and Szczesny, who arrived at Arsenal a year before the striker departed, is keen deny him a goal. The 21-year-old said: "I would love to keep a clean sheet against him, I'm not going to lie. But I am very confident we can do that and get the three points. He is a quality player – probably one of the best strikers I've ever trained with. We won't approach the game in a different way than we usually do. Ade is a great striker and we know how dangerous he is but it is to our advantage that we know how to deal with him. I'm not going to tell you because it's our little secret."</p>

              <p>My take is a Spurs win...</p>

              <p>I thought Bale didn't had a good game but at times when he got the ball and started running with it... No Arsenal players can catch him man... It was just amazing watching how fast his each step seems to take him...</p>
              <p>So the goal that won the match... Was it a great strike or a goalkeeper fumble?</p>
              <p>I thought it was kind of both, a great strike that the ball changed direction towards the end and Szczesny kind of fumble too... lol... He should have punched it away rather than tried to catch it...</p>

              <p>Actually that kyle walker shot swerved at the last second and that's why the apparent fumble by serchessny (can't spell damn it). And he basked in all that adulation and glory judging from the smiles and victory appreciation after the match. There you go....another English inflated ego. He had an ordinary game save for some headless running and mediocre tackling.</p>
              <p>And I think Arsenal had it coming. The only reason why they could score was because VDV tired out. Other than that, it's been an arsenal show of poor defending, poor positioning and naive passing.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting I lost count of how many times modric got muscled off the ball. Once the opposing team employs physicality, his game is as good as gone.</p>

              <p>its still early days.</p>
              <p>arsenal may be out of contention for the title but definitely still in for 4th place.  liverpool arent playing any better and they are only 6 pts ahead with 31 games to go.</p>
              <p>i believe newcastle wont hold on to 4th until the end of the season.  as for spurs their game in hand is against everton.  its not a sure win.</p>
              <p>the current arsenal squad is not good enough to match man u, man city and chelsea.  so even before the season started they're only good for 4th place.</p>

              <p>It's still early......but the signs are ominous with arsenal having lost 4 games already. The new buys like per mertersacker and gervinho aren't exactly top draw. Chamakh has faded and with only van persie carrying the team, it's like tremendous boulders on his already bony frame lol.</p>
              <p>Spurs seem more fired up, especially that footballing of a lesson from the utd thrashing earlier in the season.</p>

              <p>That can only happen after Jan transfer window which by then more than half a season will be gone, and there will be not many good players avaliable in mid-season as clubs only sell their fringe players(unless the club is in deep financial problem).</p>
              <p>Their main problem is defence, and that didn't just happen recently, it was a problem since last season, and new defence line need time to gel if gooners get in some new defenders in Jan, therefore I believe it will be too little too late for the season.</p>
