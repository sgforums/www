              <h1>Marlon King bailed after arrest for alleged attack on girl in London club<br></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/11/article-0-02B7CE11000005DC-132_306x423.jpg" alt="marlon king" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>King for a day: the Hull striker celebrates his winner against Middlesbrough, hours before the alleged assault.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/hull-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Hull</strong></span></a><strong> striker Marlon King was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly punching a girl in a London nightclub at the weekend after she turned down his advances.</strong></p>
              <p>The 28-year-old married player was also questioned on suspicion of indecently assaulting the 20-year-old who was rushed to hospital with a suspected broken nose and a cut lip after the alleged attack.</p>
              <p>Witnesses said married father of two King, who earns £25,000 a week, had danced near the girl and then grabbed her bottom, then turned on her when she asked him to leave her alone.</p>
              <p>Police were called, but King had already gone. He was arrested after attending a police station by appointment on Wednesday morning. It is understood that he refused to comment and was released on police bail.</p>
              <p>CCTV footage has been seized from the Soho Revue Bar in London's West End where King, on loan from <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/wigan-athletic.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Wigan</span></a>, was celebrating after scoring a late penalty to secure Hull's 2-1 win over <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/middlesbrough.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Middlesbrough</span></a>.</p>
              <p>A source said: 'He was repeatedly pestering the girl and grabbing her bottom. She kept asking him to leave her alone and at one point he just turned and punched her. 'It was not a slap and it looked like she had a broken nose. There was blood dripping on her clothes and handbag.</p>
              <p>'Some of his friends were trying to make out that it was all perfectly justified because she was pestering him but it seemed very much like it was the other way round.'</p>
              <p>King was arrested on suspicion of actual bodily harm and indecent assault. A police spokesman said: 'We are investigating an allegation of assault on a 20-year-old female in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p>
              <p>'A 28-year-old man has been arrested today in connection with the incident. He has been bailed to return on a date in February.' A spokesman for Hull City refused to comment.</p>
              <p>Only last month, King was fined two weeks' wages after a 3am fight in a Scarborough casino with fellow Hull striker Dean Windass. The pair had to be pulled apart by stunned colleagues.</p>
