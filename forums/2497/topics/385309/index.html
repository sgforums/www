              </div>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Manchester City have decided that Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is the man to replace Mark Hughes as manager at Eastlands, according to a report in <em>The Daily Star</em>.<br><br>Former
              Arsenal player Brian Marwood, believed to enjoy a close relationship
              with Wenger, was appointed as City's football adviser in March of this
              year.<br><br>Marwood has now apparently persuaded City owner Sheikh
              Mansour that Wenger is the man to turn the Mancunians into Champions
              League winners and Premier League champions.<br><br>The City hierarchy are reportedly not convinced that Hughes can achieve those aims.<br><br>Wenger is rumored by <em>The Star</em> to be growing increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of funds
              available to him at the Emirates. Money, of course, is no object at
              Eastlands, though Wenger would expect complete control over transfer
              dealings.<br><br>The Frenchman's current Gunners contract expires at the end of next season.</span></p>

              HUGHES is set to be axed this weekend - even if his Manchester City side beat 
              Sunderland at Eastlands today.</h2>
              <p class="article">Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and owner Sheikh Mansour finally 
              lost faith following City's 3-0 drubbing at Tottenham on Wednesday.</p>
              <p class="article">Guus Hiddink and Jurgen Klinsmann are understood to be on 
              City's wanted list of replacements for Sparky.</p>
              <p class="article">Russia coach Hiddink excelled as Chelsea's stand- in boss last 
              season and his agent yesterday claimed there has already been contact from City. But former Germany chief Klinsmann is also in the frame - 
              especially as he is currently out of management.</p>
              <p class="article">Hughes, 46, was appointed as City boss in June 2008 and has 
              spent £250million on the team. But the club's Abu Dhabi owners have not seen the 
              return on their investment they were expecting.</p>
              <p class="article">I understand Hughes came close to getting the sack on November 
              28 after his team yet again surrendered a lead to draw at home to Hull.</p>
              <p class="article">Chairman Khaldoon left Eastlands furious but decided to give 
              Sparky more time following a long phone conversation with him the next day.</p>
              <p class="article">It was the third successive time City had thrown away an 
              advantage, having also drawn 2-2 with Fulham and 3-3 with Burnley.</p>
              <p class="article">Hughes appeared to have turned things round by reaching the 
              Carling Cup semi-finals with a 3-0 win against Arsenal and following that with a 
              2-1 triumph over Chelsea. But City then drew 3-3 at struggling Bolton and the hammering 
              at White Hart Lane has now forced his bosses' hand.</p>
              <p class="article">City have lost just twice this season but are currently eighth 
              in the Premier League after a run of eight draws.</p>
              <p class="article">The performances of some of the high-profile stars like Robinho 
              and Emmanuel Adebayor have not helped Hughes. But he has also spent big on a defence that has already shipped 
              24 goals in the league.</p>
              <p class="article">City defender <strong>PABLO ZABALETA </strong>has signed a new 4½-year 
              deal with the club.</p>

              <p>just brings to mind that at the time when abramovich bought over chelsea in 2003....it was a three horse race among man u, pool and arsenal. Spurs, aston villa, chelsea were nowhere. And then chelsea managed to squeeze into the top 4 and Champions League followed, and of course world class players came too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These days, EPL still has the Big Four with the addition of chelsea. And they also have Spurs and Man City on the rise. Aston Villa are dark horses. It will soon be the Big Seven.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mark Hughes just doesnt have an easy job. It would be interesting to see what Hiddink or Klinnsman can do for City if they were ever appointed lol.</p>

              <p>These days, EPL still has the Big Four with the addition of chelsea. And they also have Spurs and Man City on the rise. Aston Villa are dark horses. It will soon be the Big Seven.</p>

              <p><br>The big seven reminds of the big seven of serie A last time. Internazionale, Ac Milan, Juventus, Parma, Fiorentina, Lazio, Roma.</p>
              <p>So now BPL also got the 7 liao. Interesting.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Mark Hughes</span></abbr> is set to be dumped by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> this weekend, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak and owner Sheikh Mansour finally lost faith following City's 3-0 drubbing at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Guus Hiddink and Jurgen Klinsmann are understood to be on City's wanted list of replacements for Sparky.</p>
              <p>Russia coach Hiddink excelled as <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>'s stand- in boss last season and his agent yesterday claimed there has already been contact from City.</p>
              <p>But former Germany chief Klinsmann is also in the frame - especially as he is currently out of management.</p>
              <p>Hughes, 46, was appointed as City boss in June 2008 and has spent
              £250million on the team. But the club's Abu Dhabi owners have not seen
              the return on their investment they were expecting.</p>

              <div><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333; font-style: italic;">Tevez insist he is "100 per cent" behind <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">Hughes</span>.</span></div>
              <p><br><br></p>
              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez has urged the club's owners to keep 
                  faith with Mark Hughes, insisting he is "100 per cent" behind the manager. </strong></p>
              <p>Newspaper reports on Saturday suggest Hughes will be sacked regardless of 
                  City's result against Sunderland, with the agent of former Chelsea boss Guus 
                  Hiddink claiming City have already made an approach to his client.</p>
              <p>But Tevez, who signed for City in the summer after a two-year stint with 
                  their rivals United, believes the club need to be "a bit patient".</p>
              <p>"When I first joined the club I had a long chat with Mark Hughes and he gave 
                  me a vision of how the club was going to go forward," Tevez told the <em>Daily 
                  Telegraph</em>.</p>
              <p>"The reason I joined was because I believe in his vision. I believe in what 
                  he had to say."</p>
              <p>The Argentina international added: "I understand the desire to be the best.</p>
              <p>"I believe in the club. I also believe in Mark. We will be a big club. I'm 
                  100 per cent behind the manager. I'm really surprised that a question about his 
                  future even exists at such an early stage.</p>
              <p>"Of course, we can do even more. Every team in the Premier League will say 
                  they can do better and we are no exception. But the team is in transition with a 
                  lot of new players coming in and we have had a lot of injuries.</p>
              <p>"It will not happen straight away but I will assure you of one major point. I 
                  will give the club, the fans and Mark Hughes my 100 per cent support.</p>
              <p>"We need to have stability and calm to allow the club to move forward. People 
                  should not panic. There is a great desire and atmosphere to achieve that exists 
                  and that comes from the manager." </p>
