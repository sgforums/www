There is a huge amount of loyalty towards Mark, the players respect him as a manager and as a person and they can't believe he's being treated as shabbily as this.<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">"This has been done without any class whatsoever. The players were getting messages on their mobiles telling them what was going on and they decided they had to do something. </p>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Roberto Mancini will be unveiled as Manchester City's new manager on Monday 
              knowing his first task is to restore order to a dressing room in revolt. </strong></p>
              <p>But the Italian will also come into a job where predecessor Mark Hughes found 
              the expectations of the club's owners changed, it has been claimed.</p>
              <p>Hughes' sacking, straight after the 4-3 win over Sunderland on Saturday, 
              triggered an angry reaction from a group of players who remain solidly behind 
              the Welshman.</p>
              <p>While Robinho, a £32.5million purchase imposed on Hughes, and maybe even the 
              axed Emmanuel Adebayor, will shed no tears at Hughes' exit, the core of City's 
              side, including Shay Given, Craig Bellamy and Gareth Barry, were part of a 
              deputation that urged chief executive Garry Cook to reverse the decision to 
              dismiss a man who was only appointed 18 months ago.</p>
              <p>Predictably, given Hughes' exit had been plotted for over a fortnight, it had 
              no effect.</p>
              <p>However, resentment remains, which Mancini must restore calm before his first 
              match in charge against Stoke on Boxing Day.</p>
              <p>Having been handed a £3million-a-year contract that it is said will be 
              extended to a full three seasons should City qualify for next year's Champions 
              League, Mancini has a fortnight to assess the troops at his disposal before 
              deciding how much of the Abu Dhabi billions he must invest during the January 
              transfer window.</p>
              <p>The Italian takes over amid claims from League Managers Association chief 
              executive Richard Bevan that Hughes was unaware of his fate prior to Saturday's 
              game.</p>
              <p>City chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak revealed the decision had been taken in 
              response to a run of just two wins in 11 in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>City's woes stem largely from too many drawn matches, the club having lost 
              just two games all season - one of those an unfortunate reverse in a thrilling 
              Manchester derby.</p>
              <p>Hughes' demeanour during and after Saturday's win at Eastlands indicated he 
              was aware of the board's decision to terminate his contract prior to the game, 
              but that was not the case, according to Bevan.</p>
              <p>"I spoke to Mark last night and he found out immediately after the game when 
              he was called into a meeting and informed that his contract was being 
              terminated, but I think the decision had probably been taken some time ago," 
              Bevan told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme.</p>
              <p>"I think Mark and everybody else in this country realises that you can't buy 
              trophies in one season.</p>
              <p>"If they [overseas owners] feel that, then we'll continue with the sackings 
              and we'll continue with affinity lost to our clubs in England, because I'm 
              pretty sure the Manchester City fans will be sorry to see Mark go.</p>
              <p>"If you come in as an overseas owner, you need to embrace the city, the 
              supporters, not just the trophy cabinet."</p>
              <p>Saturday's win over the Black Cats moved City into sixth place in the Premier 
              League, a position in line with the board's pre-season targets, and Bevan has 
              accused the club's owners of shifting their expectations midway through the 
              campaign.</p>
              <p>"Mark is very realistic about the situation," Bevan said.</p>
              <p>"He knew the key goals he had to hit. His target actually was the top six. He 
              was very disappointed because they were on target for that.</p>
              <p>"For me, his reputation is still intact.</p>
              <p>"Only two defeats - the fewest in the league - semi-finals of the Carling 
              Cup, to me it looks like the goalposts were moved and the decision was made some 
              time ago that he wasn't to continue in his role past today.</p>
              <p>"I'm very disappointed for Mark and indeed the City fans.</p>
              <p>"Mark would have delivered continued success without doubt if more time had 
              been afforded to him and his staff, but he's left a platform for the next 
              manager without doubt."</p>
              <p>A City statement released last night on behalf of chairman Khaldoon 
              al-Mubarak said: "Prior to the current season beginning the consensus between 
              the board and coaching staff was that appropriate agreed targets should be set 
              for the 2009/2010 season.</p>
              <p>"The targets were agreed as a result of the player acquisition strategy of 
              the club being radically accelerated in the summer as a result of very 
              favourable conditions for any buying club.</p>
              <p>"A return of two wins in 11 Premier League games is clearly not in line with 
              the targets that were agreed and set. Sheikh Mansour and the board felt that 
              there was no evidence that the situation would fundamentally change."</p>
              <p>Khaldoon added: "Roberto is a hugely experienced manager with a proven track 
              record of winning trophies and championships.</p>
              <p>"What is absolutely clear is that Roberto believes in Manchester City's 
              potential to achieve at the highest level and importantly in his own ability to 
              make this happen."</p>
              <p>The games against Stoke and Wolves, on December 28, before an FA Cup meeting 
              with Middlesbrough and a Carling Cup semi-final first-leg clash with Manchester 
              United now take on a whole new dimension, for City's opponents as well as 
              themselves. </p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>Roberto Mancini reportedly could be on his way from <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> at the end of the season.</p>
              <p>The <em>Sunday Times</em> says Mancini, a three-time winner of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Serie A</span></abbr> when boss of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Inter Milan</span></abbr>,
              agreed a contract to take charge of City worth £3m net per year, one of
              the most lucrative deals ever handed to a British club manager.</p>
              <p>The contract will run until 2013 though there is speculation —
              denied by Mancini’s camp — that it can be broken after six months,
              should the Italian fail to pilot City to a top four finish.</p>
