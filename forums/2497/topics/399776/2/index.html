              <p>The Catalans are desperate to reduce the prohibitive £80million demanded by the Gunners for their captain and are considering several players to offer in part-exchange.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <div class="thinArtSplitter"></div>
              </div>
              <p>Arsene Wenger would be keen on midfielder Yaya Toure if he is to lose Fabregas, but the Ivory Coast midfielder is holding out for better offers.</p>
              <p>The Emirates boss is also not keen on a straight swap for Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but throwing Hleb into the mix could give the Frenchman something to think about.</p>
              <p>The 29-year-old did not leave north London in the best of circumstances two years ago, but admitted last summer that he should never have left the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>'For me, Wenger was like a father. I consider him one of the best managers in the world,' he said last July.</p>
              <p>'For such a boss one wants to die on the pitch. Arsene managed to create a smashing team with a wonderful atmosphere inside of it.'</p>
              <p>The Belarus international has suffered an unhappy second half of the season on loan at Stuttgart and has signalled his intention to return to the Nou Camp and fight for his place.</p>
              <p>However, Barca were all too keen to offload him last year, initially offering him to Inter Milan as part of the Ibrahimovic deal, and Fabregas's arrival would give him even less chances of figuring in Pep Guardiola's first team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/20/article-1279891-057C0F690000044D-258_468x286.jpg" alt="Old pals: Hleb and Fabregas (centre) during their days together at Arsenal" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Old pals: Hleb and Fabregas (centre) during their days together at Arsenal</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wenger counted on Hleb for three seasons after signing him from Stuttgart for more than £11m in 2005. A regular primarily on the right of midfield, he scored 11 goals in 130 appearances before angling for the ill-fated move to Barca.</strong></p>
              <p>Aston Villa, Manchester City and Sunderland have also been linked with a summer move for him.</p>
              <p>The Sol Campbell deal apart, Wenger rarely goes back to old player and he remains in no mood to do business with Barca despite Fabregas telling him on Tuesday that he wants to reutrn to his boyhood team.</p>
              <p>Should an £80m bid be forthcoming - an offer they can't refuse - Wenger is likely to prefer the cash to launch moves for players normally only within the grasp of Barca, Real, Chelsea, Manchester United and, more recently, Manchester City.</p>

              <p>insist on a straight swop with Ibrahimovic and cash. value fabregas at 60, amd Ibra at 30, so barcelona still need to cough up 30m in cash to buy fabregas. if Ibra doesnt want to come, the deal is off.</p>
              <p>play hardball with barcelona and blame it on Ibra reluctance to come and not that the club is unwilling to sell him to barcelona. then retain him for 1 more season and see how it goes. if barcelona still wants him next season, it will do whatever it takes to pay for fabregas, even to the tune of 70m.</p>

              <p>The Arsenal chairman, Peter Hill-Wood, has told the Spanish side that their captain is not available for transfer and claims the club's board have not discussed a fee for the player.</p>
              <p>"We have made it perfectly clear we don't want to lose him. The message has been given to them we don't want to lose him and will do our damnedest to keep him," Hill-Wood told Goal.com. "We haven't had an official approach from them and have made it perfectly clear we don't want to lose him."</p>
              <p>Barcelona, who signed David Villa from Valencia for £34m earlier this week, are reported to value Fábregas at £30m. However, though Arsenal value him much more highly than that, the club have refused to put a price on his head.</p>
              <p>"It's not an issue," said Hill-Wood. "We haven't even discussed it. I don't know if he will stay. I've really got little to say but we very much hope he stays with us and we're confident he will."</p>
              <p>Barcelona have long courted Fábregas, often in public and in the media. It is a tactic that Hill-Wood called "a funny way of doing business" but he did concede that, should the midfielder leave, that Arsenal would cope. "We have done pretty well without one or two other star players," he said in reference to the departures and retirements of Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Dennis Bergkamp and Tony Adams."</p>
              <p>The chairman confirmed that the club's manager Arsène Wenger has money to spend this summer but added that he would only do so for the right player. He added that Arsenal expect to sign Marouane Chamakh soon and that the defenders William Gallas and Sol Campbell have been offered new one-year contracts.</p>
