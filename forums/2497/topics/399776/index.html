              <p><em>A number of options are available to Arsenal, Yaya Toure, Bojan, Ibrahimovic or Rafael Marquez would fit Wenger's desire?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p><strong>Barcelona have confirmed their interest in signing Cesc Fabregas and insist the </strong><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal </strong></span><strong>skipper is itching for a move to the Nou Camp.</strong></p>
              <p>The Catalan giants admit they are close to sealing a deal for Valencia striker David Villa - but the recruitment won't stop there, with Fabregas earmarked for a possible swap deal with Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p>
              <p>Nou Camp vice-president Rafael Yuste said: 'Both Villa and Cesc want to come and that is very important. But Cesc’s signing is more complicated because long negotiations with his club would lie ahead.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Yuste was speaking after the newly re-crowned <span style="font-style: italic;">La Liga </span>champions held a 'technical summit' on Monday in which they discussed ways to improve a squad which is already bursting with stars.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Sources in Spain claim Fabregas will now speak to Arsene Wenger about his future today, strengthened by Barca declaring their hand, though he has been pictured this week working on his fitness in the Collserola mountains near Barcelona.</p>
              <p>The deal for Villa could go through before the end of the week, with the fee thought to be about £40million, while Barca are preparing to offer a number of players in part-exchange for Fabregas.</p>
              <p>A number of options are available, with midfielder Yaya Toure and 19-year-old striker Bojan long been mooted for moves to north London, though the latest option could be to offer Ibrahimovic to Wenger.</p>
              <p>Mexico defender Rafael Marquez, 31, is another possibility and would fit Wenger's desire to add experience to a central defence which is likely to lose William Gallas this summer.</p>
              <p>Sweden striker Ibrahimovic has been criticised for a lacklustre season, scoring a relatively disappointing 21 goals in 41 appearances for the free-scoring side since a move from Inter Milan last summer that cost £40m plus Samuel Eto'o.</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>revealed last week that Chelsea and Manchester City had been offered the 28-year-old for about £40m and Barca value Fabregas at the same amount. The Arsenal midfielder has been diplomatic in handling constant questions about his return to Catalonia.</p>
              <p>Few doubt he will one day return to the club he adores but left as a 16-year-old, though Fabregas has also shown immense commitment to Arsenal after the way they have shaped his career.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old has a further four years left on his contract at the Emirates Stadium and the Gunners are reluctant to let go of their midfield marvel.</p>
              <p>However, Wenger has rarely stood in the way of those who want to leave and would seek a hefty transfer fee if the deal was to be done this summer.</p>

              <p><strong>Fabregas set the tone at a promotional event last week when he confirmed his desire to eventually pull on the <span style="font-style: italic;">blaugrana </span>shirt once more.</strong></p>
              <p>'You see your (Spain) team-mates succeeding here (in Barcelona) and it is exciting because you have worked alongside them for so long.</p>

              <p><strong>However, Yuste's comments confirm there is work to be done on the deal, while a move for Villa is much more straight forward.</strong></p>
              <p>Spain hot shot Villa has been courted by Europe's top clubs after hitting 20 goals or more in each of his 11 full seasons as a professional.</p>
              <p>His 28 in 42 games in this campaign helped Valencia to third in <span style="font-style: italic;">La Liga </span>and Champions League qualification, but the cash-strapped club could definitely do with the £40million they would receive from Barca.</p>

              <p>i don think aw is shock la.</p>
              <p>staying in arsenal is just too tiring. in arsenal he has to carry the club while in barca, he has so many players to share the responsibility. plus there so many spainish player in barca shirt, it sure play like spain even in barca squad. gurantee trophy season in and out in the golden generation. no pt of holding a player whose heart is not there and might cause unrest and uncertainty in the dressing room. against his will, he might end up having a poor season and cause arsenal to lose big in the transfer fees demand.</p>
              <p>it just a matter of money.let him go. he has serve well. 40million + yaya. i say deal!!</p>

              <p>Once Fab has so openly stated he wants to leave, Gunners can't get too much for him any more... cos the ball is now in Barce's court... Unlike in the Ronaldo case where the deal was probably agreed a while before it happened, here Wenger was still keen on keeping Fabregas but now that he has almost asked for a transfer out, it's very difficult to get the maximum sum. I guess Barce were already more or less aware of something when they came out boastfully that Fabregas wants to join them just days before Fab met Wenger...</p>
              <p>In present market where almost very player is valued so high let alone a 'star player', $30m is just too low considering Fabregas age and potential not to mention his current abilities already...</p>
              <p>But there is a problem for Arsenal. I think he may be allowed to buy himself out if Arsenal play hard ball. Not too sure how that works out though. And if he does so, I think Arsenal would get at most $25m for the balance 4 yrs of his salary.</p>
              <p>For the gunners now it's to try and squeeze Barce for as much as they can... $50m sounds a good deal for them. </p>
              <p>Although I guess almost everyone expect Fabregas to leave Arsenal someday, but it's a little earlier than my expection... I thought he would go in another 1 or 2 yrs time when Xavi would be older and Fab reach the prime of his game...</p>
              <p>Oh well, one more talented Premier League player lost to the LaLiga...</p>

And sentimentality will be the weapon Fabregas and Laporta use to convince Arsene Wenger of a deal.</p>
              <p>"A meeting with his manager was the first step but Wenger is not expected to accept any deal without a significant number of things in return - particularly money. The battle will start with Barca looking to keep Cesc's price around €40m but Arsenal will only open talks if the figure is raised to €50m.</p>
              <p>"In a bid to keep the price lower, Barca will include Ibrahimovic or Yaya Toure in the deal."</p>

              <p><strong>J.Gil/E.Blasco write: </strong>"Extensive contract talks are expected between the club and it seems there is no turning back now that the player has taken the decision to leave. In principle Barca will be willing to offer a figure close to €35m euros but Arsenal will hold out for more for their most emblematic player.</p>
              <p>"In England it is believed Arsenal will only accept a fee in the region of €45m. It is thought both parties will battle it out to find an agreement and despite Yaya Toure's refusal to go to Arsenal being a setback, it is far less critical than ensuring Cesc is with Barca next season."</p>

              <p>"Cesc Fabregas has told Arsene Wenger he wants to abandon his career at Arsenal and return to Barcelona next season. The midfielder yesterday flew back to London to meet with his coach and ask that the club enters negotiations with the Catalan club. He would also have asked for any deal to be completed before the World Cup gets underway.</p>
              <p>"Last week Cesc publicly expressed his desire to one day return to the Nou Camp but the Spanish club have noted that Arsenal will not part with the midfielder for less than €40m. Barca are keen to pay no more than €35m given that they received no payment when he originally moved to the Emirates-based club in 2003."</p>

              <p>"Arsenal have asked for €45m but it will total €50m including a series of bonuses in the proposed deal.</p>
              <p>"Cesc Fabregas has one foot in the door at Barcelona, he will share the dressing room with Iniesta, Guardiola will have a luxurious midfield and the club will recover one of its most talented homegrown players. But Barcelona must pay nearly €50m in order to resign their player - an astronomical fee, one few could muster, particularly for a player who came from your own quarry."</p>

              <p><strong>Arsenal last night hit back at Barcelona as they battle to cling on to their talismanic skipper Cesc Fabregas.</strong></p>
              <p>The Premier League club said Fabregas is going nowhere unless the Spanish giants stump up a fee in the region of the £80million that lured Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid from Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Barcelona had hoped to unveil both Fabregas and David Villa at the Nou Camp tomorrow and believe they have agreed terms with the Arsenal player.</p>
              <p>His club, however, remain in no mood to do business despite the 23-year-old telling Arsene Wenger on Tuesday that he wants to quit the Emirates to go back to his boyhood team.</p>
              <p>After signing Villa from Valencia for £34m yesterday, Barcelona’s focus has switched to tying up a deal for Fabregas with the same speed.</p>
              <p>Indeed, Barca’s desire to rush through the midfielder’s capture — they want to<br>conclude a deal before he joins up with the Spain World Cup squad in Madrid on Monday — could prove to be their undoing.</p>
              <p>Having intimated the club would take an offer in the region of £50m to even consider doing business, Wenger and the Arsenal ’s board are now so determined to hang on to their captain that they are adamant it will take somewhere in the region of £80m for them to sell.</p>
              <p>That would provide Wenger with the funds to land players normally only within the grasp of Barca, Real, Chelsea, Manchester United and, more recently, Manchester City.</p>
              <p>There is no prospect of Barca parting with that kind of cash for Fabregas, although there is every possibility that an opening bid in the region of £30m will be faxed through to Arsenal today. As of last night no offer, official or otherwise, had been forthcoming.</p>
              <p>The fact that Fabregas has five years remaining on his deal at the Emirates, not four as previously believed, certainly strengthens Arsenal’s hand.</p>
              <p>Barca were yesterday playing a cagey game, no doubt mindful of remaining on the right side of FIFA’s regulations regarding transfers.</p>
              <p>Sporting director Txiki Begiristain said: ‘It’s great news that he wants to come here and I think that one day Cesc will have to come to Barca. But what matters is Arsenal and what their decision is. They think he is a very important player for them. We have to respect that.</p>
              <p>‘I wish it was as soon as possible. But we have to respect Arsenal’s wishes and the contract he has. At times the wishes of players do not come true because they are under contract.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/05/19/article-1279797-08F35C96000005DC-904_468x286.jpg" alt="If you can't beat them...

              </div>
              <p><strong>Fabregas was doubtless hoping for a much more committed message from Barca after plucking up the courage to tell Wenger of his desire to leave.</strong></p>
              <p>As Arsenal dig in, Fabregas could even be forced to hand in a written transfer request. Such an unedifying end to his seven years at Arsenal is the last thing the 23-year-old midfielder wants even if he has made his mind up to go.</p>
