              <h1>EXCLUSIVE: Spain For The World Cup, Ivory Coast Are Dark Horses - Edgar Davids</h1>
              <h2>The
              former midfielder, famous for wearing chic spectacles when playing, met
              Goal.com for a unique and exclusive insight into the world game...</h2>
              </div>
              <div id="small_article_image_container"><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/61109_news.jpg" alt="Edgar Davids (Red Bull)"></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>Former Juventus, Inter and Milan midfielder Edgar Davids has exclusively told <strong>Goal.com</strong> his Champions League and World Cup predictions in a 360 degree interview, in which he also touched upon his new-found love for street soccer.</p>
              <p>Davids, who spent most of his career in Serie A with the big three, now spends much of his time playing street football.</p>
              <p>He has revealed players like Ronaldinho, Cristiano Ronaldo and
              Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be in his street team, and believes Spain have
              a big shout for the World Cup.</p>
              <p>In addition, he thinks Inter can finally win the Champions League after a 45-year drought.</p>
              <p><strong>Goal.com</strong> caught up with the ace who continues to gander at the world game.</p>
              <p>"The World Cup? I can see Spain doing really well, but we must not
              forget the big teams from South America and Europe. We should also keep
              an eye on the Ivory Coast," Davids told <strong>Goal.com.</strong></p>
              <p>"As for the Champions League? I want the most spectacular team to
              win that. I think Inter can win the Champions League as they have a
              very competitive squad. As for Milan, they are an institution who
              always aim for the top."</p>
              <p>Street soccer involves skill, speed and panache - things Davids
              displayed as a midfielder. He showed he hasn't lost those traits as he
              fired back quick answers when asked who would play for his ideal side.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldinho would be in my team as he knows the spectacle of
              football. Robinho, Ibrahimovic, Cristiano Ronaldo and [Robin] van
              Persie would also be in it," concluded the Dutchman.</p>

              <p><span class="comment-item">Very hard to argue against Spain but
              tournaments can do funny things to teams. In 1998 Spain had a fantastic
              squad and couldn't make it out of the group stages - I doubt that will
              happen this time but it goes to show that nothing can be taken for
              granted. </span></p>

              <p>The Spain of now cannot be compared to past spanish teams. the spanish team now is more balanced than past spanish teams. past spanish teams seldom have spanish players playing outside of liga. now you see torres, fabregas, reina, riera and also alonso, arbeloa, garcia, del horno etc all are either playing or used to play at EPL. this will only give more exposure and is good for the national team. playing in EPL is not easy as it is more hustle, bustle and more tackles than other leagues, played at a frenetic pace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Spain must be one of the favourites to win the world cup, alongside brazil and holland. ivory coast as dark horses lol. in 2006 world cup, they were also termed as dark horses, but look what happened, out in the first round. the african teams all didnt fare well and surprise at the last world cup, except for senegal in 2002, where they beat france and qualify for the qfs. look at where senegal is now, nowhere to be seen.</p>
