              <p>Celtic completed a sensational transfer coup on Monday night as boyhood fan Robbie Keane finally pulled on the Hoops.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/01/article-0-081E0286000005DC-272_306x423.jpg" alt="Robbie Keane" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Golden Bhoy: Robbie Keane joins Celtic on loan </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The Spurs captain
              has travelled north on loan until the end of the season as manager Tony
              Mowbray sets about staging a remarkable SPL championship revival.</p>
              <p>And
              to complete one of the most dramatic days of transfer activity in the
              club's history, Celtic also rejected another £8million inquiry from
              Birmingham for fans' favourite Aiden McGeady.</p>
              <p>Now Republic
              of Ireland pair Keane and McGeady will team up in a bold bid to
              overhaul Rangers' emphatic 10-point lead in the title race, with the
              Active Nation Scottish Cup also firmly in Celtic's sights.</p>
              <p>Keane is available for a quickfire debut in Tuesday night's SPL clash at Kilmarnock.</p>
              <p>Chief
              executive Peter Lawell revealed how they finally got their man. 'We've
              been pretty persistent in the last few windows in terms of keeping in
              touch with what he was wanting to do,' he said.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/02/article-1247861-081EC0A4000005DC-638_468x362.jpg" alt="Robbie Keane" width="468" height="362">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Boyhood club: Robbie Keane is unveiled to the Celtic fans late on Monday night </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'Thankfully, today, we were able to do a deal. 'We've known for a
              while that Robbie is a Celtic supporter and he's a great connection
              with the club and our fans.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/01/article-0-081EBB79000005DC-289_468x294.jpg" alt="Turing up in their droves: Celtic fans await the arrival of new signing Keane " width="468" height="294">

              </div>
              <p>'Up until today, things were not looking very great at all. Things
              changed this afternoon and we were able to put a deal in very quickly.</p>
              <p>'His situation at Spurs was made, I think, pretty plain to him. He always knew we were very, very keen to get him.'</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/02/article-1247861-081EC150000005DC-119_468x334.jpg" alt="Robbie Keane " width="468" height="334">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Lucky number seven: Robbie Keane poses with his new Celtic shirt </em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Celtic legend Charlie Nicholas applauded the signing, saying:
              'Celtic fans have been waiting for a lift from a signing for a long
              time. At last, someone - be it Tony Mowbray or whoever - has shown a
              bit of imagination and asked if they can go out and break the bank and
              land Robbie Keane.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/02/article-0-081EB9D2000005DC-560_306x405.jpg" alt="Robbie Keane " width="306" height="405">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Old McDonald: Celtic fans show their delight in capturing the Spurs striker </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'I've been very critical of my old club in the recent past, but this
              is definitely one that will draw people out to watch Celtic again.</p>
              <p>'Celtic fans are like Liverpool fans, in my opinion. They will give
              everything for the cause, but if you don't give them what they want,
              then they get very angry indeed. This is one for them to savour.'</p>
              <p>Irish financier Dermot Desmond, the club's largest shareholder, has
              always wanted Keane's name across the back of the Celtic jersey and
              will fund the player's staggering £65,000 White Hart Lane weekly wages
              for the period of his stay in Scotland - but Tottenham have waived
              their demand for a £1m loan fee.</p>
              <p>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp only gave the deal the green light late
              yesterday and said: 'Going to Celtic is a dream come true for Robbie.
              I've decided to let him go on loan until the end of the season.</p>
              <p>'It's a move that appeals to him. He is a Celtic man. To go up there
              and play will be good for him, just like it was for Roy Keane when he
              left Manchester United a few years ago.'</p>
              <p>Incredibly, the Dubliner who grew up following the club, becomes the
              14th player to arrive in the Mowbray era - after just two transfer
              windows - as Desmond and Lawwell emphatically back Gordon Strachan's
              successor, despite a less than emphatic start to his Parkhead reign.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/02/article-0-081E2ACA000005DC-376_468x286.jpg" alt="Irish stout: Keane will team up with Ireland teammate McGeady at club level" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Irish stout: Keane will team up with Ireland teammate McGeady at club level</em></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To cap a frantic day at Parkhead, Keane joined Diomansy Kamara and
              Edson Braafheid in the arrivals hall and Mowbray now has five topline
              strikers to choose from - with Morten Rasmussen, Marco Fortune and
              Georgios Samaras all competing for places.</p>
              <p>But it is Keane's arrival that will thrill fans after no fewer than
              five years of rumours about him moving north to his beloved Parkhead.</p>
              <p>Those deals were always scuppered by finance - he has been involved
              in combined transfer deals of £70million - but last night ambitious
              Celtic were finally celebrating with the completion of his loan deal.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><span class="lightboxPopupLink"> <img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/02/02/article-0-081EBD3A000005DC-152_306x658.jpg" alt="robbie keane the facts.jpg" width="306" height="658"> </span></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The departure of Scott McDonald to Middlesbrough, meantime, scarcely
              registered with ecstatic Celtic fans last night, nor the apparent
              collapse of a bid for Spanish defender Ivan Ramis.</p>
              <p>The Real Mallorca star was booked on a flight to Scotland at one stage, but changed his mind.</p>
              <p>Top scorer McDonald rejoined Strachan for a fee of around £3.5m as
              the former Parkhead boss made it five ex-Celts at the Riverside.</p>
              <p>Sportsmail understands the little Australian, who scored 50 league
              goals in 88 appearances after a cut-price move from Motherwell, has
              landed a contract until the summer of 2014.</p>
              <p>Middlesbrough funded the move with the sale of Adam Johnson to
              Manchester City for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £6m.</p>
              <p>McDonald's lucrative Riverside contract will make him a millionaire
              six or seven times over as he joins Stephen McManus, Barry Robson,
              Chris Killen and Willo Flood at Boro.</p>
              <p>McDonald, 26, leaves Scotland as the third top scorer in the SPL
              alltime list with 94 goals - his last an equaliser in the Old Firm
              derby on January 3.</p>
              <p>As the Aussie departed Scottish football, Kamara arrived at Parkhead
              in a loan deal from Fulham with a view to a permanent move in the
              summer.</p>
              <p>He was joined by Bayern Munich left-back Braafheid, with the
              Dutchman also arriving on loan. Mowbray completed another 'project'
              signing in recruiting 18-year-old winger Paul Slane from Motherwell on
              a four-year deal.</p>
              <p>Senegal international Kamara spoke to John Hartson, once his
              team-mate under Mowbray at West Brom, about the move north and revealed
              Henrik Larsson was his hero as a youngster.</p>
              <p>'When I was younger my football hero was Henrik Larsson and for me it's a dream to play for Celtic,' said the 29-year-old.</p>
              <p>Braafheid, who has five full caps with Holland, revealed he spoke to
              international boss Bert van Marwijk and was given his seal of approval
              to come to Scotland.</p>

              <p>Berbatov is doing very well at United... At Spurs he hardly gets much attention only once in a while, at United, he is always being seen, followed and mentioned. He brings a different kind of play to United, one with more style and creativity. Without him, somehow they lack in that area, their style of play also isn't as attractive as with him. Keane probably missed him more than he miss Keane.</p>

              <p><br>Errr sorry but I think you are confuse... He did play in that Arsenal match, and despite the little time he was on the pitch, he created a very good chance for Rooney towards the end of that game only for Rooney to put it inches wide of the post. It all depends on tactics. Fergie wanted to play one striker only in an away match with 5 midfielders which was understandable when Arsenal was undefeated since Nov therefore United started without him as an extra midfielder was needed.</p>

              <p>yes, he did, only the last few minutes he played.</p>
              <p>but if he was a utility man like Rooney, he would have played atleast played more than 4/6 of the match already, and just a couple of minutes and he showed his class? No, more of a time-dragging, I guess</p>

              <p><br>Last few minutes also played didn't he? So he was used right?</p>
              <p>How do you play 2 strikers if Fergie choose to play a 4 5 1 and 4 3 3 interchange?  Tactics is the main reason here... Away match against a quality quick side and you commit 2 strikers could be suicide... But when Fergie decides to play a 4 4 2, his name is first on the list ahead of Tevez or Owen.</p>
              <p>And as you said, only a few minutes but despite the few minutes, he still created a great opportunity for Rooney didn't he? Had Rooney put that in, who will be credited with the assist?</p>
