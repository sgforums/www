              <p><span>Paul Jewell is the frontrunner to take over at Ipswich after Roy Keane was sacked to bring to an end his turbulent 20-month reign.</span></p>
              <p><span>Keane was dismissed by owner Marcus Evans with the Tractor Boys sitting 19th in the Championship after a run of seven defeats in nine games.</span></p>
              <p><span>Former Derby boss Paul Jewell, out of the game since leaving the Rams two years ago, is the favourite to take over.</span></p>
              <p><span>Chris Hughton, recently sacked by Newcastle, is also in the frame along with Portsmouth boss Steve Cotterill and Alan Curbishley.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ipswich will turn to coach Ian McParland as caretaker. He will be in charge for Sunday’s FA Cup third round trip to Chelsea.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/07/article-1344919-0239781B00000578-866_306x392.jpg" alt="New man? Paul Jewell" width="306" height="392">

              <p><span>Former Notts County boss McParland, 49, is in his second spell as a coach at Ipswich, having initially joined the staff under Keane in November 2009.</span></p>
              <p><span>The Scot left at the end of that season but returned after his replacement, former Everton and Liverpool defender Gary Ablett, was diagnosed with blood cancer just a few weeks into his role.</span></p>
              <p><span>Manchester United legend Keane was confident he would secure promotion to the Barclays Premier League, as he did with previous club Sunderland, but he managed just 28 wins from his 81 games in charge.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ipswich’s start to last season, when they failed to win any of their first 14 league games, was the worst in their history. Despite a more promising start to the current campaign, when they were undefeated after five games, they slid down the table after suffering six straight defeats.</span></p>
              <p><span>Keane spent £8million in an attempt to assemble a side capable of winning promotion but few of his buys paid off.</span></p>
              <p><span>With the club showing no sign of improvement it was no surprise that multi-millionaire Evans wielded the axe. But the decision came just three days before the club’s FA Cup third round trip to Chelsea.</span></p>
              <p><span>Keane also steered Ipswich into the semi-finals of the Carling Cup and a two-leg clash with Arsenal, the first of which is at Portman Road next Wednesday.</span></p>
              <p><span>But despite those money-spinning clashes Keane’s failure to turn Ipswich into promotion contenders is what has cost him his job.<br></span></p>
              <p><span>Keane seemed to sense he was on his way, his comments in recent weeks revealing he clearly feared the worst.<br></span></p>

              <p>Roy Keane will not succeed as a top manager lar. which top players in management now, is a top class manager. none. Gullit, van basten, keane are flops in management.</p>
              <p>what about ancelotti. he is a top player in his prime. his record as manager is not bad, winning 2 CL and Serie A with AC Milan. He also won double in his first season with Chelsea.</p>

              <p>examples of top player become manager as follow:</p>
              <p>franz beckenbaur</p>
              <p>carlo ancelloti</p>
              <p>fabio capello.</p>
              <p>anyway how do you define good manager? one who win many trophies or one who dont get sack so often? in real madrid, even the best of managers can get the sack if they cannot win la liga every year.</p>
              <p>frank rikaard win at barcelona but fail big time in turkey. does the credit go to barcelona players or manager?</p>
