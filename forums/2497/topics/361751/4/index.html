              the highest order still exist far beyond the Elysian fields of

              <p>"To call Barcelona the champions of Europe this morning is

              unquestionably, is champions of football." - James Lawton</p>

              <p><strong>BARCELONA FLATTEN UNITED'S EMPIRE</strong></p>
              <p>"Messi, so small of frame yet so immense a talent,
              industrious as well as inventive, ended the debate over who was
              the best player on the planet." - Henry Winter.</p>

              gifted footballers on the globe ended with Manchester United
              losing a European Cup final for the first time in four
              appearances and Barcelona's Lionel Messi asserting his
              domination over the Premier League's Cristiano Ronaldo."</p>
              <p><em>Daily Mirror</em></p>
              <p>"Manchester United were on the wrong end of one of the most
              one-sided Champions League finals there has ever been last
              night. They marched into the Stadio Olimpico with dreams of
              becoming the first team to retain the trophy but they were sent
              away with a flea in their ear for their impudence."</p>

              <p>"This resounding victory is a message to those who only
              believe in results and winning. Barca have imposed a style of
              play that has earned millions of eulogies from every corner of
              the world.</p>
              <p>"The most widely-broadcasted text message of 2009 has now
              been sent, in large, golden letters: It is possible to win

              <p>"Barca were brave in the face of adversity and stayed true
              to their convictions. To the exceptional merit of the players
              needs to be added the mark of their coach. Guardiola has
              overtaken the legendary Cruyff to become the principle
              reference in the history of Barcelona." -  Santiago Segurola.</p>

              <p>"There is no antidote to Barcelona's football. A treble,

              <p>"Pep knew he had to convert this team into a historical
              one. Before the start of the game he showed the players a video
              with examples of each one's best moves, interspersed with
              images of gladiators. Yesterday the best players in the world
              were artists when they had to be, and gladiators when

              <h1>Furious United fan kills four in Nigeria</h1>

              <p><strong>PORT
              HARCOURT, Nigeria - A Manchester United fan in Nigeria killed four
              people when he drove his minibus into a crowd of Barcelona supporters
              after his team lost the Champions League final, police said on Thursday.</strong><br> <br> The crowd in the town of Ogbo were celebrating Barcelona's victory
              after Wednesday night's match when the bus drove into them. A police
              spokeswoman said 10 people were injured and the driver was arrested.<br> <br> "The driver had passed the crowd then made a U-turn and ran into them," she said.<br> <br> Barcelona beat Manchester United 2-0 in what was hailed as a "dream
              final" between two of Europe's best clubs. Both teams have large fan
              bases in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation.</p>
              <p>Earlier this month in Nairobi, an Arsenal fan in football-mad Kenya
              hanged himself wearing his beloved team's shirt after their defeat to
              Manchester United in the Champions League semi-finals.</p>
