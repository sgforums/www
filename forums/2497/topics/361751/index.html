              <p><strong>ROME - Barcelona
              deposed Manchester United as European champions with a 2-0 victory
              forged by a superb display of controlled attacking soccer in the
              Champions League final on Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p>Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o
              struck the opener against the run of play after 10 minutes at the
              Stadio Olimpico when he cut past Nemanja Vidic with surprising ease and
              sent a low shot past United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar at his near
              post.</p>
              <p>Argentina's Lionel Messi added
              the second with a rare, and perfectly timed header after 70 minutes,
              sealing Barcelona's third European Cup win after their successes in
              1992 and 2006.</p>
              <p>Victory also completed a
              European and domestic treble for Barca in an extraordinary first season
              for coach Pep Guardiola, who ended Alex Ferguson's dreams of making
              United the first side to retain the European Cup in the Champions
              League era.</p>
              <p>The match, hailed as a "dream
              final" between two of Europe's greatest clubs, could not live up to its
              expectations because United were so far below their best.</p>
              <p>They did have their chances,
              especially in the first 10 minutes, but they could not reproduce the
              power, authority and precise passing that had already brought them
              three trophies over the course of the season, including the Premier
              League title.</p>
              <p>United manager Alex Ferguson
              told ITV afterwards: "I think the first goal was a killer for us. We
              had plenty of time, we had some half-chances in the second half but in
              fairness we were beaten by a better team."</p>
              <p><strong>MISSING PLAYERS</strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona's victory was all the
              more notable as they were without suspended full-backs Eric Abidal and
              Daniel Alves as well as the injured Rafael Marquez.</p>
              <p>Andres Iniesta, despite not
              being fully fit, dominated the midfield battle alongside Xavi and
              helped prise United's grip from the trophy they won against Chelsea in
              Moscow last year.</p>
              <p>Xavi, voted Man of the Match,
              cracked a free kick against a post at the start of the second half and
              his link play with his team mates frustrated United once Barcelona had
              taken a grip on the game with the early goal from Eto'o.</p>
              <p>That Eto'o strike shocked
              United, who had started so brightly as they attempted to extend a
              record 25-match unbeaten run in the competition.</p>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo had three
              chances, the best being a second-minute free kick which Barcelona
              goalkeeper Victor Valdes failed to hold.</p>
              <p>The ball bounced out of his
              grip but Park Ji-sung could not get to it in time and Barca's immense
              skipper Carles Puyol cleared for a corner.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo's influence faded as Messi's grew and it was the Barca man who came out top in the battle of the playmakers.</p>
              <p>He dazzled and jigged his way
              through United's ponderous defence and his sweet touches and
              intelligent movement were another key to Barcelona's victory.</p>
              <p>United's usual match winners,
              like Ryan Giggs and Wayne Rooney, were also strangely peripheral and
              even Carlos Tevez, who replaced the ineffective Anderson at half-time,
              had little influence.</p>
              <p>Thierry Henry, Messi and Eto'o
              - whose combined scoring total for the season is an astonishing 96
              goals - could all have added more as Barcelona finished the match in
              complete command.</p>

              <h1>Messi the master as Ronaldo flops in Rome</h1>
              <div id="storyBy"></div>
              <p><strong>ROME
              - Lionel Messi was hailed by his coach as the world's best player after
              he scored Barcelona's second goal in their 2-0 Champions League final
              victory over Manchester United and ended as the competition's top
              scorer.</strong></p>
              <p>The match in Rome had been
              hyped as a duel between the world's two best players, Argentine Messi
              and United's Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>Ronaldo was largely ineffective
              apart from an early flourish and it was Messi who came out on top,
              scoring his ninth goal of the Champions League campaign and improving
              his chances of snatching away his rival's FIFA World Player of the Year
              crown.</p>
              <p>"This is the most important win
              of my life," Messi told reporters. "I am the happiest man alive and I
              am happy for myself, for my family and for my country."</p>
              <p>Barca coach Pep Guardiola said
              Messi had been superb for the Primera Liga champions all season,
              helping not only with goals but also with plenty of assists.</p>
              <p>"He has done great," he told a
              news conference. "I think he is the best player and we didn't need to
              win to know he is the best."</p>
              <p>It might have been different if
              a dipping Ronaldo freekick in the second minute had slipped through the
              arms of Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes instead of rebounding away from
              goal.</p>
              <p>As well as the freekick, he had
              a couple of early shots but then drifted out of the match and was
              booked late on for an unnecessary barge on Barca captain Carles Puyol.</p>
              <p><strong>FORLORN FIGURE</strong></p>
              <p>He cut a forlorn figure trudging up last to collect his runners-up medal and was loudly whistled by the Barca fans.</p>
              <p>"I don't have any problems with anyone and I never will. It was just a game situation," Ronaldo said of the Puyol incident.</p>
              <p>"After the first goal things got complicated and we couldn't play our game," he told reporters.</p>
              <p>United manager Alex Ferguson
              said Guardiola's decision to move Messi further back into midfield had
              made it hard for his side to get back into the game after conceding the
              opening goal in the 10th minute.</p>
              <p>Messi made 51 passes on the night with a success rate of 84 percent, while Ronaldo made 31 and completed 68 percent.</p>
              <p>"Messi moving into midfield made it difficult to get the ball back off them," he told a news conference.</p>
              <p>"It was a disappointing performance and some individuals will feel that themselves."</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <h1>Guardiola: Bravery and hard work key</h1>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><strong>ROME - Barcelona's
              Champions League triumph over Manchester United on Wednesday was down
              to bravery and hard work, said record-setting coach Pep Guardiola.</strong></p>
              <p>"If you take the ball and you
              attack and you are daring you have more chances of winning," the
              38-year-old former Barca player told a news conference.</p>
              <p>While Barcelona ended United's
              reign as European champions and their bid to be the first side to
              retain the trophy since AC Milan in 1990, Guardiola made some notable
              marks on the competition's record books himself.</p>
              <p>He became the third youngest
              coach to lift the European Cup in the 54 seasons of the competition and
              the youngest to do so for 49 years when Miguel Munoz led Real Madrid to
              their fifth successive title in 1960.</p>
              <p>He also became only the third
              man to play for and then manage the same club to victory after being in
              Barcelona's first European Cup winning team in 1992 and is the first
              manager to lead a Spanish club to a Treble after winning the domestic
              Cup and League double.</p>
              <p>Quite some achievement for a
              man who was still playing three years ago, but he was happy to
              concentrate on his player's achievements rather than his own.</p>
              <p>"We have not been cowards,
              never in the match. There's no other way. There's nothing more
              dangerous than not taking risks," he added.</p>
              <p>"We have worked many, many
              hours throughout the season and I know there are many people who are
              very happy and this is our payment."</p>
              <p>Guardiola, who has won the
              Spanish league and cup as well as the Champions League in his first
              season in charge, paid tribute to Lionel Messi, scorer of the second
              goal against United.</p>
              <p>He said one of the reasons for
              his side's domination of United for long periods was his decision to
              move the Argentine forward back into the middle.</p>
              <p>"Messi went back into midfield because we wanted to be superior in possession," Guardiola said.</p>
              <p>"Without the ball we are a disastrous team, a horrible team so we need the ball," he added.</p>
              <p>"We are not the best team in history but we have played the best season in history to win the three titles."</p>
              <p>Guardiola had a spell in Italy
              towards the end of his playing career and he dedicated Wednesday's
              victory to AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini, who is in his final season
              after a 24-year career.</p>
              <p>Maldini's final appearance at the San Siro on Sunday was marred by fans unveiling a banner criticising him.</p>
              <p>"I think 20 or 30 people can't spoil his last game of football (at home)," Guardiola said.</p>
              <p>"I am very happy to have won
              this trophy and I am very happy to dedicate it to the player who was by
              far the strongest of the past 20 years."</p>

              <p><strong>ROME - Barcelona's
                  "killer" first goal and their ability to control a game once in front
                  were decisive in their 2-0 Champions League final victory on Wednesday,
                  Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said.</strong></p>
              <p>"I think the first goal was a killer for us," Ferguson told ITV. "We started brightly too. We got a bit nervous after that."</p>
              <p>United did make a good start
                  but Samuel Eto'o netted after 10 minutes and the English side faded
                  badly, with their defence looking especially shaky, and Lionel Messi
                  wrapped up victory midway through the second half.</p>
              <p>"The first goal didn't help
                  that's for sure," Ferguson said at a news conference. "It gave them the
                  opportunity to keep possession, which they do well.</p>
              <p>"We didn't deal with it well
                  enough. That really was the story. I think there's a disappointment in
                  the performance and some individuals will say that themselves."</p>
              <p>The Scot, who lashed out at a
                  reporter for asking if he still had the desire to win, could only
                  marvel at Barca's passing ability.</p>
              <p><strong>BAD GOAL</strong></p>
              <p>"At the start of game we did
                  really well," he said. "It was a bad goal to lose. You've got to give
                  credit to a very good Barca team. If they get in front of you they're
                  difficult to beat.</p>
              <p>"All the midfield players got
                  possession of the ball and made it very difficult for us to get it
                  back. When we did get possession after the goal we didn't do well
                  enough with it."</p>
              <p>He added: "They are among the best at what they do. They pursue their philosophy and don't change."</p>
              <p>United rarely fail to score and Ferguson had no explanation.</p>
              <p>"We had plenty of time,"
                  Ferguson told ITV. "We had some half-chances in the second half but in
                  fairness we were beaten by a better team."</p>
              <p>He also told Sky Sports: "They
                  were two bad goals to lose at this level especially when we have really
                  excelled defending this season."</p>
              <p>United central defender Rio
                  Ferdinand said his team, who failed to become the first to defend the
                  trophy in the Champions League era, had not produced their best
                  football.</p>
              <p>"I don't think there's one of us out there can say we played well to be honest, as individuals or collectively," he said.</p>
              <p>"(The first goal) was a bit of a sucker punch. We'd had a few good chances before that.</p>
              <p>"But no excuses, not on today's
                  performance. They were the better team. Special moments decide these
                  games and they were deserved winners today."</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p><strong>ROME - South Korean
              Park Ji-sung became the first Asian to play in the Champions League
              final but his memorable night ended on a low note as Manchester United
              were beaten 2-0 by Barcelona and deposed as European champions.</strong></p>
              <p>Park, 28, was named in the
              starting line-up by coach Alex Ferguson a year after he was left out of
              last season's Champions League final against Chelsea.</p>
              <p>He had an early chance to score
              in the second minute in Rome when he reacted first to a rebound off
              Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes after a free-kick from Cristiano Ronaldo
              but before he could shoot a superb tackle from Barca captain Carles
              Puyol forced the ball away for a corner.</p>
              <p>He failed to make much of an
              impact after that as United were largely outplayed by the opposition
              midfield before being replaced by Dimitar Berbatov in the 66th minute.</p>

              <h1>Police arrest Barcelona fans after riots-agency</h1>
              <p><br> </p>
              <p>MADRID, May 28 (Reuters) - Spanish police arrested more than
              40 people in Barcelona on Wednesday night as thousands
              celebrated Barcelona's victory in the Champions League final,
              the Europa Press news agency reported.</p>
              <p>Rioters overturning barricades, threw cans, bottles and
              stones at police, who responded with rubber bullets, television
              pictures from the centre of the city showed.</p>
              <p>Radio station Cadena Ser reported that fans set rubbish
              containers alight and smashed windows, signs and traffic lights.</p>
              <p>Police fired rubber bullets in an effort to disperse crowds
              in the city's main square and down its most famous thoroughfare,
              Las Ramblas, shortly after 2 a.m. local time (0000 GMT), Cadena
              Ser said.</p>
              <p>Ambulances took injured revellers away, a Reuters witness
              added.</p>
              <p>Police estimated 100,000 fans gathered in the city's
              Catalonia Square to watch the match and celebrate the team's 2-0
              victory over Manchester United in Rome, the third time the team
              has won Europe's top club competition.</p>
              <p>Police were not reachable for comment.</p>
              <p>Two weeks ago police arrested 45 people in the same area of
              Barcelona in violence following the team's victory in the King's
              Cup final against Bilbao.</p>

              <p>Just my opinion, Barcelona started the match nervously... They got a goal from a resultÂ ofÂ mistakes made by theÂ United side... And from then on, they settled in and started playing their passing game...</p>
              <p>What promised to be an exciting match of attacking footballÂ became a boring one after Barce took the lead...Â What they said of wanting to win playing beautiful football didn't happen... They stayed in their own half and centre of the pitch most of the time passing around for long periods each time they got the ball... It was like watching Barcelona playing Italian football...</p>
              <p>In the end, United side only have themselves to blame for not bringing it on the night... Especially their midfield...</p>
              <p>Anyway, congraz to Barce... cos they have probably just outdone whatever Real had in their longÂ history by becoming the only Spanish club to do the Treble...</p>
