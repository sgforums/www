              <div class="content">
              <p>Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has revealed how his tactics had Manchester United chasing shadows.</p>
              <p>With so much pre-match hype focused on United fullback Patrice Evra's
              clash with Lionel Messi, Guardiola admitted after the 2-0 win: "I saw
              in last year's matches that Leo had problems with Patrice Evra so I
              decided to play him in the middle.</p>
              <p>"It took him away from Evra, gave us an extra midfielder along with Iniesta and Xavi and helped us in attack."</p>
              <p>United striker Wayne Rooney admitted: "It's disappointing, but I
              thought Barcelona were the better team tonight and deserved to win.</p>
              <p>"They scored a good goal early on and Messi's was a great goal at a difficult time for us."</p>

              <p><strong>Lionel Messi will be pioneering a brand new set of boots during the Champions League final on Wednesday. </strong><br><br>The
              Argentine will be wearing the new Adidas 'SprintSkin' boots, also known
              as the 'F50i'. According to Messi, "I have never felt so good wearing
              new boots.<br><br>"With the extremely smooth external skin of the boot,
              I can play to my full potential. It allows me to make the perfect
              contact with the ball.<br><br>"It is also a fantastic colour."<br><br>The
              new material is flexible, synthetic and water-proof, and adapts
              perfectly to the foot. It is also one of the lightest boots available. <br><br>Messi
              will be the first player to wear these boots in an official game. The
              next occasion will be on June 6, when a host of international players
              affiliated to Adidas will be parading them in their respective World
              Cup qualifying matches.</p>

              Man Utd played well for the first 10 mins. Conceded a soft goal with Barcelona's first attack. Vidic deceived by Etoo's change of direction.
              
              From then on, Man Utd struggled as Barcelona play its keep ball, passing and possession game, which tire Man Utd players. Man Utd midfield was non-existent, as Xavi and Iniesta practically ran the show in the middle of the park.
              
              Man Utd stray passes and long balls didnt help its causes, as the ball just went to the feet of a Barcelona player. Maybe Fergie tactics played a part in this loss, but the players didnt gave a good account of themselves, especially the defenders, 2 sloppy goals conceded by Vidic and ferdinand as he did not mark the short messi for the headed goal.

              <div class="content">
              <p>Edwin van der Sar says Manchester United have no excuses after their Champions League defeat to Barcelona.</p>
              <p>"It was a disappointing evening," said the veteran Dutchman. "We had a
              good 10 minutes at the start but after that it changed a little bit.</p>
              <p>"We have come from behind plenty of times before, so the goal itself was not an issue.</p>
              <p>"But what it did was to allow them to start playing a little bit.</p>
              <p>"In situations like that you have to try and keep possession but at times I felt we lost it a little bit too easily."</p>
              <p>At 38, van der Sar might not get many more chances to make
              amends and add to the winner's medal he won last season, 13 years after
              his first triumph with Ajax.</p>
              <p>However, he is committed to another year with the Old Trafford
              outfit, when the desire is bound to be strong given the decisive nature
              of Barcelona's victory.</p>
              <p>Not that van der Sar is looking ahead too quickly. He wants a rest first.</p>
              <p>"We have got to get this disappointment out of the way," he said. "I will look at new challenges after the holidays."</p>
