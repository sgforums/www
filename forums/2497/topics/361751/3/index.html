              <div>
              <p>Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has revealed how his tactics had Manchester United chasing shadows.</p>
              <p>With so much pre-match hype focused on United fullback Patrice Evra's clash with Lionel Messi, Guardiola admitted after the 2-0 win: "I saw in last year's matches that Leo had problems with Patrice Evra so I decided to play him in the middle.</p>
              <p>"It took him away from Evra, gave us an extra midfielder along with Iniesta and Xavi and helped us in attack."</p>
              <p>United striker Wayne Rooney admitted: "It's disappointing, but I thought Barcelona were the better team tonight and deserved to win.</p>
              <p>"They scored a good goal early on and Messi's was a great goal at a difficult time for us."</p>

              <p><strong>Treble-winners Barcelona finally met their match on the streets of
              their home city as up to a million fans flocked to welcome them home
              from their Champions League final triumph on Thursday. </strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/jb2/barcelona_get41222.jpg" alt="" width="412" height="232"></p>
              <p><strong>The Catalans have outplayed all comers to win La Liga, Copa Del Rey and now the Champions League, but they
              struggled to make their way through the crowds to the Nou Camp
              to complete their celebrations.</strong></p>
              <p>Having beaten Manchester United 2-0 in Rome on Wednesday,
              the squad flew back to Barcelona on Thursday afternoon and it
              was coach Pep Guardiola and captain Carles Puyol who carried the
              European Cup down the steps from the plane.</p>
              <p>They boarded an open-top bus and with the trophies propped
              up inside the front windscreen, set off for a journey that would
              take over three hours. A second bus drove behind pumping out
              music.</p>
              <p>Up to a million fans thronged the streets to greet them.</p>
              <p>The players, who all wore blue shirts emblazoned with "Cup,
              League and Champions", danced, sang songs, waved flags and
              sprayed drinks over the fans.</p>
              <p>The club threw open the doors of the Nou Camp and a capacity
              98,000 crowd had to wait for over an hour past the scheduled
              arrival time for the team to make their entrance and kick off
              the evening's festivities.</p>
              <p>After the final on Wednesday night, around 100,000 fans
              celebrated in the centre of Barcelona, but events turned ugly
              later on.</p>
              <p>Local police told Spanish media they had detained 119 people
              mainly for public disorder offences and causing damage. Medical
              services dealt with injuries to 153 people, with 23 needing
              hospital treatment.</p>

              <p>"Messi was to be isolated from the ball. So we cut the supply from his team-mates and the plan worked! 'We deserved the victory. But in the end the only trophy that we can still win is the FA Cup."</p>

              <p>I dont think so, i think even if Man Utd had won the UCL, a Barca player will still grab the award.</p>
              <p>I can't think of any Utd player that can match the form of any Barca player. imo Vidic comes closest, but how often you see a defender winning the Ballon D'or?</p>

              <p>i think chelski players are not having anything against the goal scored by barca in the injury mins. but they are just unhappy about not getting the penalties.</p>
              <p>but i think they were up with an extra man for a good 20 mins of the game and didn't want to press on to attack. instead they sat back and defend, defend and defend and concede at the end. earlier in the game, they had couple of chances, if they had good finishing, they would have killed the game for barca. regarding the penalty claims, i think the only clear cut one was pique's handball. chelski players ought to know not always a penalty = goal. if the penalty was saved, it could still have gone barca's way.</p>

              <p><br>I think its part of hiddink's tactics that he want chelsea to focus on defence despite being 1 man extra. His tactics would have worked if chelsea dont have so many old legs who cant defend at the last moment.</p>
              <p>Feeling sore that his tactics had failed at the last minute (possibly last few seconds), hiddink decide to contest those penalties claims, when normally he would not.</p>

              <h1>One million line streets to welcome Barca back</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Barcelona_Bus.jpg" alt="Barcelona Bus" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>Treble-winners
              Barcelona finally met their match on the streets of their home city as
              up to a million fans flocked to welcome them home from their Champions
              League final triumph on Thursday.</strong></p>
              <p>The Catalans have outplayed all
              comers to win the Spanish League, King's Cup and now the Champions
              League, but they struggled to make their way through the crowds to the
              Nou Camp to complete their celebrations.</p>
              <p>Having beaten Manchester United
              2-0 in Rome on Wednesday, the squad flew back to Barcelona on Thursday
              afternoon and it was coach Pep Guardiola and captain Carles Puyol who
              carried the European Cup down the steps from the plane.</p>
              <p>They boarded an open-top bus
              and with the trophies propped up inside the front windscreen, set off
              for a journey that would take over three hours. A second bus drove
              behind pumping out music.</p>
              <p>Spanish media reported that up to a million fans thronged the streets to greet them.</p>
              <p>The players, who all wore blue
              shirts emblazoned with "Cup, League and Champions", danced, sang songs,
              waved flags and sprayed drinks over the fans.</p>
              <p>The club threw open the doors
              of the Nou Camp and a capacity 98,000 crowd had to wait for over an
              hour past the scheduled arrival time for the team to make their
              entrance and kick off the evening's festivities.</p>
              <p>After the final on Wednesday night, around 100,000 fans celebrated in the centre of Barcelona, but events turned ugly later on.</p>
              <p>Local police told Spanish media
              they had detained 119 people mainly for public disorder offences and
              causing damage. Medical services dealt with injuries to 153 people,
              with 23 needing hospital treatment.</p>

              <h1>Robinho delight at rivals loss in Rome</h1>
              <p><br> <img src="http://fourfourtwo.com/contentimages/news/Robinho30.jpg" alt="Robinho30" align="right"> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester
              City forward Robinho says he was delighted to see the Blues' city
              rivals Manchester United lose the Champions League final in Rome.</strong></p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson's side - attempting to become the first team to
              win back-to-back Champions League crowns - lost 2-0 to Pep Guardiola's
              free-flowing Catalans courtesy of goals from Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi.</p>
              <p>And Robinho, who joined the Eastlands oufit from Real Madrid last
              summer, has revealed he was rooting for his former club's arch-rivals,
              rather than his current ones.</p>
              <p>"I was cheering for Barca. First, because I have friends there and also because United are our biggest rivals," he said in <em>The Sun.</em></p>
              <p>"I was sure Barca would prove they are Europe's best team.</p>
              <p>"Not just Europe, they have the greatest and most powerful squad in the world."</p>
              <p>And the Brazilian took a second swipe at the Premier League and Carling Cup
              champions, by insisting their is no contest in the Ronaldo vs Messi
              debate.</p>
              <p>"Messi proved without a doubt he's the best," he said.</p>
