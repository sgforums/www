              <p class="introcopy"><strong>ARSENAL were under attack from another of their Premier League rivals last night after Liverpool turned to Gael Clichy in an attempt to solve their problems at left-back.</strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="padding7north" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 17px; margin: 4px 5px 4px 0px; font-size: 12px;">
              <p class="storycopy"> </p>
              <p class="storycopy">Liverpool have formally submitted a bid, believed to be in the region of £5 million for the France defender who has told Arsene Wenger he will not extend his contract, which has 12 months left to run.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">And with Manchester United making contact with the representatives of his France midfielder Samir Nasri, Wenger is finding himself with a battle on his hands to fend off northern raiders.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Liverpool’s offer for Clichy follows the £20m capture of Sunderland’s Jordan Henderson, which was formally announced last night, and further illustrates the ambition of owners Fenway Sports Group.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Clichy signed from Cannes in 2003 following a recommendation by Damien Comolli, who was working for Wenger at the time but is now director of football at Anfield.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">A host of European clubs are also circling Clichy, 26 next month, and Arsenal would prefer to sell the player abroad.</p>
              </div>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">
              <p class="storycopy">Nasri, who has one year left on his current deal, said last weekend that he wanted to know if United’s interest was “real”, although Wenger is adamant he will not sell to Sir Alex Ferguson’s club.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Wenger will also be reluctant to let Clichy, who is the only member of the ‘Invincibles’ side still at the club, move to another of Arsenal’s primary competitors but that stance could be compromised if the defender is open to a switch to Merseyside.</p>
              <p class="storycopy">Liverpool’s search for left-back reinforcements has been exhaustive, with last summer’s signing Paul Konchesky sent out on loan back in January and now surplus to requirements along with Emiliano Insua.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; overflow: hidden; text-decoration: none;">But the bid for Clichy indicates they have identified their man and they must now wait on Arsenal’s reaction<br><br></div>

              <div class="KonaBody"><strong>While Liverpool cannot offer Champions League football next season, they can promise a future that looks far more enticing on Merseyside now that it did six months ago. Given his age – Clichy does not turn 26 until next month – experience, reliability and reputation as a solid professional and even more solid citizen, it seems a relative bargain for Liverpool although the Frenchman can demand a significant hike on his £50,000-a-week (€56,000) Arsenal wages.<br></strong></div>
              <div class="KonaBody">.</div>
              <div class="KonaBody">Clichy’s options on the Continent have diminished in recent weeks. He has held informal talks with Inter but the Serie A giants are close to completing a deal to sign Japanese full-back Yuto Nagatomo for £7.5m (€8.4m) from Cesena following a successful loan spell at the San Siro in the second half of the season.<br><br>Juventus made an enquiry for Clichy but have signed Reto Ziegler from Sampdoria on a Bosman free, while Bayern Munich, who have also pursued the left-back, have shored up their defence by tying up a £5m (€5.6m) deal for Brazilian right-back Rafinha. Versatile club captain Philipp Lahm is expected to revert back to left-back, a position he has filled many times for the national team. <br><br>A possibility remains for Clichy at newly cash-rich Roma, who are in the market for a proven left-back but it now appears that Liverpool’s main rivals for his signature are Manchester City.<br><br>The Sheikh Mansour-bankrolled club have two senior left-backs in Alexander Kolarov and Wayne Bridge, who has returned to Eastlands following his loan spell at West Ham, as well as the versatile Pablo Zabaleta, who can fill in on either full-back position.<br><br>City will need to move on Kolarov and Bridge to create room for Clichy, although Goal.com understands that they have asked to be kept informed about the Frenchman’s situation.<br><br>It is in Arsenal’s interest that there is a bidding war for a player who has been in north London for eight years.<br><br>One thing is certain. It will now take a considerable U-turn for Clichy to accept the improved contract from Arsenal and commit himself once again to a club where the exit door could swing off its hinges in the coming weeks.<br></div>

              <p>Well, the only natural left-back City have are Wayne Bridge and Aleksandar Kolarov... Zabaleta isn't really one but he plays in that position for them too... With Bridge leaving, City has got a good and relatively cheap replacement in Clichy compare to their past standard of paying for defenders...</p>
              <p>Kolarov £16m</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Joleon Lescott £22m</span></p>

I had Damien Comolli, the sports director, on the phone, I have known him for a long time,” he told <em>L’Equipe</em>. <br><br>“There was also interest from Roma, with a great project and an interesting offer, but I wanted to stay in the Premier League. <br><br>“I like the football here and the mentality.

It is not the case. Manchester City are a big club with a big squad. It is an ambitious club which wants to shine in each competition.” <br><br>Clichy was part of the 'Invincibles' side that went a whole season unbeaten under Arsene Wenger, but have won nothing since they triumphed in the 2005 FA Cup final.<br><br>However, Clichy insists he left the Emirates on good terms with the club and believes they could win something next season.<br><br>He added: “I have nothing against Arsenal. I am not angry against Arsene Wenger, but I have been here for eight years – I felt it was the moment to leave Arsenal and that Manchester City were the good club.<br><br>“I don’t know if City will win something and maybe Arsenal will win a trophy next year. At the end of my career, what stays is the record of achievements. <br><br>“I think City is better fitted for that. [Arsenal] were in every competition until March, and then, after the loss of the Carling Cup against Birmingham, everything collapsed. City’s offer arrived quite late but I did not think too much.”<br></span></div>

              <p><strong>City-bound Clichy a man of his word </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>"I really believe 
              that if you are a player who thinks only about money then you will end 
              up at Manchester City. You have to think if you want to play for a big 
              club and have your image, or if you want to play for a good club and 
              earn big money."</p>
              <p>Those are the wise words of one Gael Clichy, 
              uttered back in July 2009 after former Arsenal team-mate Emmanuel 
              Adebayor made the decision to quit the "big club" at the Emirates and 
              head to Manchester City for the "big money".</p>
              <p>So imagine <em>Off The Ball</em>'s
               (lack of) surprise when the very same Gael Clichy decided to quit the 
              Gunners, as Adebayor did, this week and head to Eastlands to sign a 
              lucrative contract, as Adebayor did, in a reported £7 million move. 
              However, the Frenchman's move was of course not motivated by money but 
              rather by the fact that he no longer regards his new employers as just a
               "good club".</p>
              <p>"I am really happy to be joining such a great club,"
               Clichy told the club's official website. "I hope I can add to the 
              quality we already have here because we have a fantastic squad who I 
              believe will continue to get better. I can't wait to get started and I 
              think anything is possible with this team."</p>

              <p>Well, the City of today is very much the top dog of the premier league... So what if they lose Tevez, they have now line-up Samuel Eto'o and Sergio Aguero as possible replacements for next season.</p>
              <p>Seriously, it seems there is no limit to what they can do with the squad they have... For all we know, they may even win the Champions League title before Chelsea even does it...</p>
              <p>He choosing City is the best and smartest choice of the lot... Pool is if no one else in England wants him and he wants to leave Arsenal very badly... Here, he gets paid what Pool offered him but also with a genuine chance of winning silverwares next season.</p>
