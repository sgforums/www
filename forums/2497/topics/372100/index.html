              <p>He told the <em>Daily Mail</em>: "When Cesc Fabregas was a
              teenager, I would play him with Patrick Vieira and it did not work.
              Gilberto Silva and Vieira worked, Fabregas and Silva worked, but I
              could not play Fabregas and Vieira. But Fabregas was 19 and if he did
              not play I knew he would want to go, so we risked destroying
              everything, all the work we had put into this player. That is why I
              sold Vieira.</p>
              <p>"Now we have that situation with Jack Wilshere. He is 17 and we
              cannot ask him to play every game to win the championship. But next
              year he will be ready, he will want to play all the time and if we have
              bought a player in his position he will want to go."</p>

              <p>AW is talking like PAP spokesperson liao, we ask where is geylang, u tell me go jalan besar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AW, are you telling us you are going to sell cesc next season?</p>
              <p>i think most arsenal fans would agree arsenal need def midfielder. why talk abt wilshere and cesc. non is def midfielder.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>seriously AW is too obsesses with his philosopy that he will everything even trophyless to prove that he can win kids. how many more years do we need to wait? patience has a expiry date too.</p>

              <p>Injury will proof that you need a new signing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I may get some flak but i think arsene wenger motivation not as strong as last time. He knows no one in the current club management will de-throne him.</p>
              <p>Maybe its time for a new manager.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> insists his young team are continuing to improve rapidly.</p>
              <p>"We are young and have developed. Why should we not be better in August than we were in March?" said the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> manager, who will be without Walcott on Saturday, but hopes the England
              forward could be back for the Champions League qualifier against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> next week.</p>
              <p>"We lost two great players. However, we have bought Vermaelen to
              replace Kolo and we have Eduardo back, who for me is a great player.</p>
              <p>"We have players who develop very well and are young, like
              [Carlos] Vela, [Nicklas] Bendtner, Walcott, who are all strikers, so I
              do not feel we are short in these positions."</p>
              <p>Wenger insists his squad can deliver come May.</p>
              <p>"The ambition is to finish as high as possible. What is as high
              as possible is to finish first, it is as simple as that," he said.</p>
              <p>"The competition is of a high level and many aspire to that, so
              let's continue to play the game the way we want to play it and I
              believe we can show that we have made big steps forward."</p>
