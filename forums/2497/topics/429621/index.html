              <p><br> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Sian Massey was caught in a fresh storm after fury erupted online over Cardiff defender Kevin McNaughton's alleged deliberate shove on the female official.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The assistant referee, who earlier this season was at the centre of the sexism row that saw shamed duo Richard Keys and Andy Gray sacked by Sky Sports, was knocked to the ground by McNaughton without apology during the second-half of Cardiff's costly 3-0 home defeat to Middlesbrough.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The result saw Dave Jones' men hand automatic promotion to rivals Norwich, who secured their return to the Premier League later that evening with a 1-0 win at Portsmouth.</span></p>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But fans who watched Monday's game on Sky were enraged after it appeared that Massey had been 'violently knocked to the ground' by the 28-year-old Cardiff player who was blocked in a run by Boro's Rhys Williams.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">McNaughton is seen running to keep the ball in play when appears to steer, drop his shoulder and hurl himself into Massey, who was hit with such force that her head snaps back and she is flung across the pitch.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Some viewers have demanded that he should say sorry for his actions. However his agent has said he does not need to apologise for anything.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Fortunately, 25-year-old Massey took the event in good humour and was seen smiling as she got back up off the ground.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The crowd cheered as she falls to the ground but, keeping her composure and professionalism, she gets back up and even gives a goal kick before having a chuckle with referee Graham Scott.</span> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter">
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Some fans have speculated on YouTube that the actions appear to be deliberate. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">One user said: 'He changes direction. It's deliberate and disgusting. The fact that he just trots off makes it more obvious.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Another said: 'He makes the challenge on the Boro player and then deliberately side steps and increases his speed into the path of Sian Massey before using his body weight to barge her over.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'She's lucky not to have any broken bones.'</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>The incident happened on Monday afternoon when Cardiff was beaten 3-0 at home to Middlesbrough.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">A club spokesman said: 'Kevin didn't do it on purpose - he was trying to get the ball.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">John Viola, McNaughton's agent, said: 'He’s been around for a long time and there is no way he would do something like that.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He would never, ever intentionally collide with a match official.'</span></p>
