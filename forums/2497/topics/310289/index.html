              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>Brian Howard and Kayode Odejayi have expressed their delight at helping Barnsley reach the FA Cup semi-finals.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Striker Odejayi grabbed the only goal in the Tykes' shock 1-0
              win over Chelsea in the quarter-finals, while Howard was the hero in
              the previous round with the winner in a 2-1 win away at Liverpool.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They admit that their progression to the last four of the
              competition is nothing short of remarkable and that the whole squad
              feel that anything is now possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Unbelievable</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"The lads have put in an unbelievable performance today (Saturday)," Howard told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Odejayi has been outstanding and (Istvan) Ferenczi up front
              against two of the best centre-halves in the world and all the lads
              have put in 100 per cent effort and we're in the semi-finals of the
              cup.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It probably won't sink in until Monday morning or Tuesday night
              when we're back to the bread and butter of the league against Ipswich,
              but we will savour the moment of this for as long as we can.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I don't think they'll be a better chance for a Championship
              side to go on and win it, and every side that is left in it has got to
              fancy themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Obviously we've knocked out Liverpool at Anfield and Chelsea
              have come here, the holders, and we've knocked them out so there's no
              reason why we can't go on and win the thing."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h5>Deserved</h5>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Odejayi also admitted that after knocking out two of the best
              sides in the country there is no limit to what the Tykes could achieve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I'm still finding it hard to believed," he told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Everyone around the stadium is buzzing and we all deserve it for the shift we put in on the pitch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It's what dreams are made of. I'm just so pleased for the
              management staff, the fans, the boys on the pitch and all the way down
              to the kit man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Not many of us have been to Wembley, and this is the new
              Wembley, so it's a nice touch that we get to go there in the
              semi-finals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"With Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United not around it the latter stages it's there for anyone now."</p>

              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold">Chelsea manager
              Avram Grant admitted his side were second best as they suffered a huge
              giant-killing at the hands of Barnsley in their FA Cup quarter-final at
              Oakwell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kayode Odejayi scored the only goal of the game just after the
              hour to give Barnsley the most unlikeliest of wins - although Chelsea
              barely threatened at the other end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We started the game well then we conceded the goal and we couldn't score," he told the website.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"We didn't play well, especially in the first half, and all the
              credit to Barnsley. They won against Liverpool, they won against us.
              All credit to them and I congratulate them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"I am very, very disappointed and sad about this. It's an
              important competition. We had a chance to do something in this
              competition and we didn't do it so now we need to look forward for the
              league and Champions League."</p>

              <p>i dun see west brom as underdogs, they have scored quite a lot of goals in the FA cup and I dun see why they can't score against Portsmouth.</p>
              <p>They have enough to seal the victory against portsmouth.</p>
              <p>But they will be without their best player Fillipe Teixeira.</p>
              <p>But I think with their midfield players such as Zoltan Gera, Robert Koren and James Morrison, it will be a tight affair in the semi-finals.</p>
              <p>Though I must say that their defense is sometimes shaky but I think with Carl Hoefkens, Cesar, Paul Robinson, Leon Barnett, mistakes can happen.</p>
              <p>But I have to say my most favourite player of all is Roman Bednar, while he was at Hearts I watch him play, he's quite good, but not noticed by most popular clubs, like Liverpool. He score quite lots of goals. He's the player to watch.</p>
              <p>Again, there's Ishmael Miller who previously from Man City, scored a hat-trick in the previous round and is on good form.</p>
              <p>I'm going to say 2-0 to West Brom for a win.</p>
