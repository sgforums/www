              <p class="small bold"><em>WIN OR BUST ... Avram Grant</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>AVRAM GRANT has one game to save his job as manager of Chelsea. Sport can reveal Grant has failed to get any assurances about his future from Blues owner Roman Abramovich.</strong></p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Winning the Champions League final against Manchester United in Moscow on Wednesday appears to be his only chance of holding on to his job. Grant spoke with Abramovich on Thursday and yesterday — demanding to know if he will be in charge next season.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">However, he has not been promised anything beyond the final match of his first campaign in the hot-seat. And that has led the Israeli to believe he is unlikely to be in his job at the start of next season. It now seems only an extraordinary victory in the Russian capital will convince Red Rom that Grant is the man to take Chelsea forward.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">Grant had hoped to get a public vote of confidence from his bosses before now in order to end the speculation over his future. But despite running Alex Ferguson to the wire in the title race, that backing has not been given. Instead he has been told to get on with his work and that what happens after Wednesday will become clear at the time.</p>

              <h2>COLE: GRANT MUST LEAD CHELSEA CHARGE</h2>
              <div><span id="intelliTXT"><img src="http://images.football365.com/08/05/240/JoeColeAvramGrant_844029.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div><span><strong>Joe Cole maintains Avram Grant is the right man to drive Chelsea on towards both European and domestic glory. The Israeli coach - who took over from fans' favourite Jose Mourinho in September last year - continues to face speculation over his future despite pressing Manchester United to the last game in the race for the Premier League title and also guiding the west London club into their first Champions League final.</strong> </span></div>
              <div><span>.</span></div>
              <div id="articlebody">
              <p>Given such achievements, particularly in the Champions League, in which his predecessor never managed to reach the last two, Grant still finds it strange his long-term role is called into question. The 52-year-old - who has a strong relationship with Russian owner Roman Abramovich - insists he will be in charge at the start of next season, and midfielder Cole firmly believes Chelsea have the perfect blend for continued success.</p>
              <p>"It is part and parcel of being a manager or a footballer - there is always someone ready to have a pop at you," said the England international. "I don't pay any attention to what those people think of me, and I am sure Avram doesn't either. He has got broad shoulders."</p>
              <p>Cole, 26, continued: "There are people who will say if you win one game you are a God, and if you lose one game then you are the biggest duffer to have ever played football. "If you look back at it, with all that has happened here, you have to say the club is going in the right direction.</p>
              <p>"But we are not too interested in plaudits - you want trophies. "We fought United all the way for the title and we are disappointed not to have won, but credit has to go to the whole squad and everyone around the place who have kept it going, shown real steel and determination.</p>
