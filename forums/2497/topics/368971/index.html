              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> have slashed Carlos Tevez's final pay-packet after his home was trashed, it has been revealed.</p>
              <p><em>The Sun</em> says the club had paid the rent on the £1.5million home which needed up to £30,000 of repairs after the ace left.</p>
              <p>Insiders said posh Italian furniture was damaged and the Argentine's dogs allegedly ruined other items.</p>
              <p>Details of the damage at the house in Prestbury, Cheshire, emerged after Tevez, 24, was unveiled last week as a <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> player following a £26.5million move.</p>
              <p>A United source said: "The house was a tip and we made Carlos pay. We don't know who was responsible.</p>
              <p>"But the matter has now been resolved."</p>

              <p>New <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> signing Carlos Tevez admits he may not shake hands with his former <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> when the teams meet next season.</p>
              <p>He told the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>: "There is no mystery why I left United and Alex gave me all the reasons to leave.</p>
              <p>"I did not play an important role in any of the important games. In the
              Champions League I didn't play, I didn't play in the derby. I tried
              several times to speak to him, to express my feelings, but the only
              thing he'd say was 'Don't worry, don't worry, this is going to change'.</p>
              <p>"He never gave any justification or explanation - I don't know if I will shake his hand this season.</p>
              <p>"My team-mates tried several times to convince me to stay and that things would change.</p>
              <p>"I'm always very thankful to them and we had a very good relationship because we won a lot of things in two years.</p>
              <p>"I want to give the best to help the team develop and win trophies."</p>

              <p>I think it's not right for him to say that. His main reason of joining City is for the money, not anything else and certainly not the amount of games he played?? Towards the end of the season, he still expressed his desire to remain but suddenly make a 180 U-turn upon knowing ManCity calling for his service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the agreement between MSI and SAF is that Tevez's price will vary depending on how many games he plays for ManU.  That should be the main reason why he was restricted last season.</p>
