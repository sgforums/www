It was crucial in this game to keep the ball, defend well and press high.<br><br>'I paired him with Claude Makelele and Ballack is a team player. His contribution was great.'<br><br>It needed a good block from goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini in stoppage time from El-Hadji Diouf to deny Bolton an equaliser.<br><br>Manager Sam Allardyce, who had seen his team defeat Arsenal at the weekend, thought the Senegal striker could have done better.<br><br>'Diouf tried a little flick when he had enough time to bring it down and put it in,' said the Bolton boss.<br><br>'But it was a terrific second half performance by my team and really pleasing. Chelsea are always be difficult to play against, home and away.<br><br>'We are disappointed we have not nicked a point. We gave it our best shot and I cannot ask any more than that.<br><br>'We created chances and took the game to the opposition and tried to get back in it.<br><br>'I was hoping to get in at half time at 0-0 and we were a split second away from doing that.<br><br>'I know they deserved that goal for way played against us but the result could have been different.'<br></div>
