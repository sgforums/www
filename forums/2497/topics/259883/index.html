            <div class='col-md body'><strong>England's players have agreed to donate all their match fees leading up to the 2010 World Cup to charity.</strong><br><br>The gesture is expected to raise at least Â£1million for charitable causes, which should rise as individual players get involved in additional charity work.<br><br>The team have founded the Team England Footballers Charity trust, and England captain John Terry said: "Each player in the England squad works in some way with local or national charities but as a team we decided to use our role as England footballers to not only contribute money and our time but to also help raise awareness of particular issues. Every player to a man is looking forward to supporting our charity."<br><br>Among the charities set to benefit are the Association of Children's Hospices, WellChild, the Bobby Moore Fund for cancer research and the Professional Footballers Association Charity Initiatives.<br><br>Stephanie Moore, founder of the Bobby Moore Fund said: "Forty-five men and women die every day in the UK from bowel cancer, often needlessly because, if bowel cancer is detected early enough, more than eight out of 10 cases can be successfully treated.<br><br>"I'm overjoyed that the England squad has chosen to support the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK and know that Bobby would have been delighted. Their help and involvement will be crucial in raising awareness and funds for vital research."<br><br>Barbara Gelb, Chief Executive of the Association of Children's Hospices (ACH) said: "We are very proud to have been personally chosen by the players themselves and we are also incredibly excited about working with the team to make a real difference in so many ways to thousands of children who won't live to reach adulthood and their families. This really is teamwork at the highest level!"<br><br>Football Association chief executive Brian Barwick added: "I'm obviously very happy that the whole squad has taken this initiative and will distribute funds across a deserving range of charities. It puts an extra kick into them appearing for their country."</div>
