              <p><strong>Fernando Torres will remain a Liverpool player until 2013 after agreeing a new bumper deal at Anfield.</strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old star has agreed a new, improved contract with Liverpool, reflecting his standing as one of the world's top strikers. </p>
              <p>His latest deal will place him in the same salary bracket as Steven Gerrard, who earns slightly less than £120,000 a week. <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail </span>understands that Torress will pick up close to £110,000 a week.</p>
              <p>The Euro 2008 winner with Spain, who hit his 50th goal for the Premier League runners up in last Sunday's 3-1 victory over Spurs, was already tied to Anfield for the next four seasons after signing a six-year deal in 2007.  </p>
              <p>The new contract includes an option for a further year's extension to 2014.</p>
              <p>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez said: 'Fernando is one of the best strikers in the game today and, at his age, can only get better.</p>

              <p>Torres joins Dirk Kuyt, Daniel Agger, Gerrard and Benitez in agreeing new deals at Anfield over the past two months. </p>

              <p><br>All seems like before lah... Just like what Rooney, Ronaldo, Gerrard, Lampard... are all getting... Ribery's one is "special order" cos I think he hear Arshavin's complain that although he is being paid more at Arsenal... but he is taking home lesser than what he used to get in Russia cos of the 50% tax compare to his previous 13% in Russia... He said he wasn't aware of the high tax in the UK before he signed for the gunners... lol</p>

              <p><strong>Spain
              striker Fernando Torres has signed a new contract that could keep him
              at Liverpool until 2014, the Premier League runners-up said on Thursday.</strong></p>
              <p>The 25-year-old Torres, who had
              four years remaining on a six-year deal he signed in 2007, has been
              handed an improved package that includes the option of a further season.</p>
              <p>"Fernando is one of the best
              strikers in the game today and, at his age, can only get better,"
              Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez told the club's website.</p>
              <p>"Every major side would want
              him in their team, but he has shown how much he wants to achieve
              success at Liverpool by committing his future to the club. He's a
              special talent, but still has the hunger to improve his game."</p>
              <p>Torres, who hit his 50th goal
              for Liverpool in Sunday's victory over Tottenham, is one of the biggest
              names in the Premier League. His commitment to the club is a hefty
              boost as they look to end Manchester United's domination next season.</p>
              <p>"We've made huge progress this season and now we need to take the next step," Benitez said.</p>
              <p>"We are building something
              special here and securing such important players on long-term deals
              means we can move forward with confidence. This sends out a very
              positive message to everyone connected with the club."</p>
              <p>As well as Torres, Steven Gerrard, Dirk Kuyt and Daniel Agger have all agreed new contracts at Anfield in recent weeks.</p>
