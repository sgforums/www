              <p><strong>Catania administrator Pietro Lo Monaco could face action after
              ‘instigating violence’ in his war of words with Inter boss Jose
              Mourinho. </strong></p>
              <p>The feud began when, after Inter’s 2-1 win over Catania on Saturday,
              Mourinho said that his team deserved to win by four goals and added
              that, had he played in place of Inter goalkeeper Julio Cesar, “nothing
              would have changed".</p>
              <p>Lo Monaco responded by saying the former Chelsea boss had no respect
              and told him to keep his mouth shut in a phrase that translates
              literally as “Mourinho should be hit in the teeth with a stick”.</p>
              <p>He added: "Mourinho should think of his own problems, how much he and his team cost the club.</p>
              <p>"I hope he succeeds because, if he doesn't, he should take his beautiful suitcase and go back to his own country."</p>
              <p>Mourinho then hit back, accusing Lo Monaco of using his name to try to generate publicity.</p>
              <p>He said: "Some time ago, I said that there were people who wanted to
              be on the first page of the newspapers by using my name and talking
              about me.</p>
              <p>“I have a sponsor who pays me to advertise him, and I do not give free publicity to anyone.</p>
              <p>“As for Lo Monaco, I do not know who he is. With the name Monaco, I
              have heard of Bayern Monaco (Munich) and the Monaco GP, the Tibetan
              Monaco (Monk) and the Principality of Monaco.</p>
              <p>“I have never heard of any others.”</p>
              <p>That prompted Lo Monaco to rubbish suggestions he was interested in
              making the front pages and said Italian football would be better off
              without the Portuguese.</p>
              <p>“I don't think Italian football would lose anything without Mourinho,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Firstly, I certainly don't care about newspaper headlines. I have
              never looked for publicity. I just try to do the best I can with the
              humble funds our president can supply.</p>
              <p>“Secondly, it is disgraceful that Mourinho makes money through
              publicity and threw this in my face, along with the people of Catania
              and all the other smaller clubs, with his disgusting air of superiority
              and disdain.</p>
              <p>“Last of all, I am called Lo Monaco and not just Monaco.”</p>
              <p>But, despite continuing the feud, Lo Monaco stressed that his ‘hit
              in the teeth with a stick’ remark was not meant to be taken literally.</p>
              <p>“My comment wasn't meant to incite violence and I will apologise for that if some people think it did,” he added.</p>
              <p>“Inter have the strongest squad in Europe, but sadly they also have the biggest blabbermouth of a coach.”</p>
              <p>However, despite these remarks, Roberto Maroni, Italy’s Mininister
              of the Interior, has called on the Italian football authorities to take
              action against Lo Monaco.</p>
              <p>“I am frankly stunned by certain comments made by Serie A executives,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Their comments seem to instigate violence.</p>
              <p>“When a football executive tells a rival coach that he should be hit
              in the teeth with a stick, I would expect the sporting judges or the
              Italian football league or the Italian Football Federation to take
              action immediately.”</p>
