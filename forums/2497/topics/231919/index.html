            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/12/mourinhoAP1112_228x319.jpg"><br><br><span class="large"><strong>You can't win this, Jose</strong></span><br><br>Roman Abramovich heard the song, belted out with feeling, and looked on as Chelsea supporters stood up for the Special One. Deep down he was no doubt wondering precisely who was responsible for the clubÂ’s rise to power. Who, in fact, would be most sorely missed were they both to leave tomorrow? Jose Mourinho or Abramovich?<br><br>Fans may love the passion and charisma of Mourinho, the manager who delivered their first championship in 50 years and another the following season, but the correct answer is, of course, Abramovich. The man with the Â£10.8billion fortune. You can replace one world-class manager with another, especially when you pay them salaries of Â£5m, but wealthy benefactors happy to pour millions into a black hole in pursuit of shiny silver pots are few and far between.<br><br>Mourinho cannot win this power struggle, regardless of what the fans sing or what John Terry and his team-mates say about their beloved boss. Peter Kenyon may be trying desperately to maintain some sort of uneasy peace inside Stamford Bridge but the managerÂ’s days appear numbered.<br><br>By keeping him in place for the rest of the season, Abramovich can only strengthen MourinhoÂ’s hand. Imagine the uproar if Chelsea won the Champions League for the first time in their history and the boss was forced out days later. This is why whispers are starting to circulate that Abramovich may be ready to prove who is the boss at the club by sacking Mourinho before the end of the season.<br><br>The Russian no longer takes his football advice from the manager and has become convinced that his dream of copying BarcelonaÂ’s recipe for coupling success with popular appeal cannot be achieved with Mourinho at the helm. His football does not satisfy the purists and his volatile nature and unpredictability make long-term planning impossible. He has talked about almost quitting three times in less than three years.<br><br>There is evidence that MourinhoÂ’s agent, Jorge Mendes, is aware of shifting opinion inside ChelseaÂ’s corridors of power and has started groundwork in Madrid. Chelsea will sanction a move for a defender this month but it looks increasingly likely to be a stop-gap signing like Jorge Andrade, on loan until the end of the season, or BoltonÂ’s Tal Ben Haim.<br><br>The reluctance to allow Mourinho to spend millions only adds to the inkling that the board want his successor to spend any cash earmarked for transfers. Plans to move for Manchester CityÂ’s Micah Richards and ValenciaÂ’s David Villa have been shelved.<br><br>Abramovich is braced for a fans backlash if he fires Mourinho and must plan his replacement carefully. Guus Hiddink seems the obvious choice but Abramovich will not want to upset his fellow Russians by poaching the national teamÂ’s coach midway through Euro 2008 qualifying.<br><br>One partnership to placate fans would be ItalyÂ’s World Cup-winning coach Marcelo Lippi with popular former Blues boss Gianluca Vialli, who recently bought a Â£4m house near Stamford Bridge, as his No 2. While Lippi is not keen to work in England, Abramovich has a very persuasive chequebook.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Chelsea fans should be more grateful to Abramovich... The guy has practically spent half a billion of his own money just to win them 2 titles... What has mourinho done? He has used the Abramovich chelsea platform in the last 2 yrs to enhance his own name at the same time collecting million $ pay cheques from Abramovich.<br><br>Has Chelsea improve as a club after spending half a billion? To be honest i don't think so... and not because i am not a chelsea fan cos if anything, mourinho has only made them the most despise club in England and Wales some say even Europe...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   Borrow from PCK.<br><br>Whatever it is, the club's image has been damage by Jose Mourinhos' behaviour and Abramovich probably knows that by now.<br><br>Just too many problems with him...<br><br>The Barcelona matches...<br>The problem with Frank Rijkaard, Wenger, Rafael Benitez, Mark Hughes, Martin Jol...<br>Accusing Uefa officials and referees... and more recently accusing Reading players of attempted murder on cech... then accusing A Johnson of diving then only to apologise after AJ threaten chelsea with a law suit...<br><br>The list just go on and on... his nonsense is a liability to any club he is employ with... Real will be very silly to employ him cos winning the title is still a maybe but the problems he will cause for them will be huge... All the good work David Beckham has done for them in the marketing of the club in the last 4 yrs will go down the drain in a year with mourinho...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The only reason that mourinho could win so easily over that last 2 yrs was mainly because Arsenal and Man utd were going through a transitional period where they brought in a lot of young players to replace the older ones... and having lots of injury problems too. Whereas chelsea just went out to buy ready made players at super high prices and they didn't seem to have to much problems with injuries unlike this year.<br><br>As we can see from this year, the gap is closing... despite spending another $80 million this year in the transfer market, Chelsea are still not able to power themselves away from the rest like they did the last 2 yrs... Arsenal and Man u could still manage to stay close to them. By right, the title should be Chelseas' without a doubt... But we can see that players like Van Persie &amp; Fabregas from the gunners and Rooney &amp; Ronaldo of man u coming of age...<br><br>Should mourinho stays, next year should be even harder... If he runs, I will pity the next manager cos it would definitely be more difficult for him as Arsenal and Man u have improve since 2 yrs ago... and Arsenal will only get better in the next 2 years from the looks of their team play...<br></div>

I think that only the clubÂ’s top management is capable of resolving those issues."<br><br>That admission will do little to promote harmony at the training ground but, despite the rift, Chelsea sources insist relations between owner and manager are improving. Mourinho, who says he needs more defensive cover, will be appeased by the impending arrival of Bolton defender Tal Ben Haim. The deal was close to completion last night, with a fee of around Â£2m being discussed, and Bolton manager Sam Allardyce is already casting around for a replacement central defender.<br><br>Ben HaimÂ’s father, Emmanuel, said last night: "There are advanced negotiations between the clubs. We are hopeful that Tal will be moving to Chelsea in the next week." Though Ben Haim could be available in time for ChelseaÂ’s match at Anfield, Abramovich himself has told friends he may not be there and club officials last night admitted there was a strong possibility he would be absent.<br><br>But officials insisted he is in Russia this week on business and may not be back in time for those reasons alone. He will definitely miss a club event at the House of Commons tomorrow. It is almost unheard of forAbramovich to miss a match as crucial as the lunchtime encounter with Liverpool, but sources say that his mood has definitely changed.<br><br>In the past he would have made every effort to be there. Now, however, he may make life easier for himself by not rushing back from Russia to attend the match.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zocoss:</div><div class="quote_body">The only reason that mourinho could win so easily over that last 2 yrs was mainly because Arsenal and Man utd were going through a transitional period where they brought in a lot of young players to replace the older ones... and having lots of injury problems too. Whereas chelsea just went out to buy ready made players at super high prices and they didn't seem to have to much problems with injuries unlike this year.<br><br>As we can see from this year, the gap is closing... despite spending another $80 million this year in the transfer market, Chelsea are still not able to power themselves away from the rest like they did the last 2 yrs... Arsenal and Man u could still manage to stay close to them. By right, the title should be Chelseas' without a doubt... But we can see that players like Van Persie &amp; Fabregas from the gunners and Rooney &amp; Ronaldo of man u coming of age...<br><br>Should mourinho stays, next year should be even harder... If he runs, I will pity the next manager cos it would definitely be more difficult for him as Arsenal and Man u have improve since 2 yrs ago... and Arsenal will only get better in the next 2 years from the looks of their team play...<br></div></blockquote>true, but look at Liverpool, they spent alot too and on ready-made players.<br><br>I think generally, people are not giving Pool the spotlight, cause they won the European Cup. but recent cries of "I don't have enough" will raise some eye-brows...considering their main song was "you'll never walk alone"...<br><br></div>
