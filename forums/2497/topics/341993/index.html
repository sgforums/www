              <p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger admits his young team are a year away from challenging for top honours.</p>
              <p>After their 2-2 draw at Aston Villa, Wenger told <em>arsenal.com</em>:
              "I think we have to keep the belief we have in the squad, because we
              have played Villa, Man United, Chelsea and Liverpool and lost just
              once. We have improved in the last two months tremendously, and we look
              more solid. We are young and I think the same team today with one year
              more, would not let Villa come back.”</p>

              <p>if a person stay a job too long, he tends to develop some kind of believe and obsession. i think AW are overly obsess to prove to the other top 4 that youngster can win EPL and trophy. but he is doing it at the expense of the fans who deserve more than what AW is giving that is a trophy!!</p>
              <p>season ticket at emirates are among the higest is not the highest in whe whole EPL.</p>

              </p><h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">ARSENE WENGER last night sensationally accused Martin O’Neill of intimidating 
              referee Lee Mason as Arsenal’s Premier League title hopes were shattered.</h2>
              <p class="article">Wenger claimed the Aston Villa boss deliberately put the official under 
              pressure at half-time in the 2-2 draw before he gave the home side a 
              penalty.</p>
              <p class="article">The Gunners boss raged: “I know how it works here. At half-time the ref gets 
              stick, in the second half a 50-50 decision goes the other way.</p>
              <p class="article">"I waited at half-time to see what happened and I was not disappointed.</p>
              <p class="article">"There is nothing more to explain. I had no discussion with O’Neill. You 
              should ask him about that. The dugouts are close together.”</p>
              <p class="article">The two bosses clashed on the Villa Park touchline after Villa were awarded 
              their controversial second-half spot-kick and had to be separated by 
              backroom staff.</p>
              <p class="article">Gareth Barry scored to put Villa back in the game.</p>
              <p class="article">Arsenal had swept into a two-goal lead through Denilson and Abou Diaby. 
              Wenger’s misery was completed when Zat Knight levelled in injury-time.</p>
              <p class="article">The result left Arsenal 10 points behind Premier League leaders Liverpool.</p>
              <p class="article">Wenger added: “The penalty was the turning point. Now we have to keep our 
              belief. We have the quality.”</p>
              <p class="article">Villa chief O’Neill confirmed his assistant John Robertson had spoken to the 
              referee at half-time.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “The referee did not give a foul against Gabriel Agbonlahor and was 
              all of three yards away. I think John wanted to speak to him about that. 
              Arsene Wenger has his own opinion</p>
              <p class="article">“It was much ado about nothing. We deserved a point totally.</p>
              <p class="article">“I thought we were brilliant in the first half but we were rocked by the 
              opening goal. We were a goal behind and should have been four or five up.”</p>

              <p>after reading the above news, I have totally no more respect for this frenchman, for he has disregard all that Martin has done and achieved.</p>
              <p>and the question is, has he not talked to refs before??</p>

              <p>sad to say, my respect for wenger is lost as well.</p>
              <p>he seem to have lost his plot, then start accusing opposite manager for their draw.</p>
              <p>instead, he should start to have a look at their team and rebuild before their season start to collapse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>teams like everton, are starting to push arsenal into six spots!!</p>
