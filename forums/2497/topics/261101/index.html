            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Bent in Â£17m snub to Hammers</span><br><br>DARREN BENT has snubbed a Â£17million move to West Ham. The Charlton striker, 23, does not want to work with Hammers boss Alan Curbishley. And Bent even insisted he would rather play in the Championship than move to Upton Park.</strong><br><br>The England star was expected to sign for the Hammers today on a five-year contract worth an incredible Â£75,000 a week. His decision will come as a massive blow for Upton Park chairman Eggert Magnusson Â— who also received a transfer request from midfielder Yossi Benayoun last night.<br><br>Liverpool have been interested in the Israeli star, 27, and he could become part of boss Rafa BenitezÂ’s Kop revolution. Bent spent yesterday in talks with Magnusson. The Addicks were to receive Â£16m plus Â£1m-rated midfield ace Hayden Mullins. But Bent stalled last night. And, while he is believed to be willing to play for both Liverpool and Spurs, he would still be prepared to turn out at The Valley next term.<br><br>Kop side and Martin JolÂ’s Tottenham have had Â£10m bids turned down by the Addicks board. Bent has been No 2 on BenitezÂ’s hitlist and, after being told by Barcelona he had no chance of landing Samuel EtoÂ’o, he switched to the Englishman.<br><br>Like Liverpool, Spurs are offering Bent Â£35,000-a- week and guaranteed first-team football. But Charlton have told both clubs they will only listen to offers of Â£14m plus extensive add-ons Â— including goals, appearances and England caps. Charlton chief executive Peter Varney revealed: Â“We set a valuation for Darren and West Ham were the only club prepared to meet that.Â“This morning we gave them permission to speak to Darren and he decided not to join West Ham.<br></div>
