              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Aston Villa" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/aston-villa"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Aston Villa</strong></span></a><strong> have banned one of their own players from attending the </strong><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Carling Cup" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/carlingcup"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Carling Cup</strong></span></a><strong> final after he was caught selling tickets for the Wembley showpiece on Facebook. Nathan Baker, an England Under-19 international who is currently on loan at Lincoln City, was forced to issue an apology after Villa learned that he had sold his five tickets for the match against Manchester United for £200 each on the social networking site.</strong></p>
              <p>Villa had previously warned their players that the tickets, which go on general sale on Monday, were for friends and family only and they have been forced to reiterate that message to the entire squad in the wake of Baker's actions. The club has stressed "it shouldn't be forgotten that Nathan is just 18 years old and has a lot to learn" but, at the same time, Villa felt compelled to take disciplinary action and have withdrawn the youngster's tickets and told him that he will not be able to attend the final.</p>
              <p>Martin O'Neill, the Villa manager, will be deeply upset, not least because a similar situation occurred when he was in charge of Leicester City, albeit on a much grander scale, when five players and two members of staff were found guilty by the Football Association of irresponsibly distributing tickets for the 1999 Worthington Cup final. The seven involved were fined and also banned from receiving tickets for home internationals, cup finals or cup semi-finals for varying periods.</p>
              <p>There is, however, no suggestion that Baker will face any further punishment, with Villa having dealt with the matter swiftly themselves. "The club is saddened that Nathan has been so foolish," said an Aston Villa spokesperson. "All of the players were made aware that tickets for the Carling Cup final are available for their own use only and, following this incident, the message has been repeated to them. It shouldn't be forgotten, however, that Nathan is just 18 years old and he has a lot to learn. His actions were naive and he is extremely embarrassed and regretful at having let down himself, the club and Aston Villa fans."</p>

              <p>Baker, who has yet to make an appearance for Villa's first team but is regarded as a promising prospect, has apologised for his behaviour and accepted the club's decision to prevent him from attending the final at Wembley on 28 February. "I wish to apologise unreservedly to the fans for my actions," he said. "I appreciate it is a privilege to be part of Aston Villa Football Club and one day I hope to play in the first team, but I understand that my behaviour off the pitch must speak as loudly as my actions on the pitch.</p>
              <p>"I have been informed by the club that I will no longer be receiving any tickets for the Carling Cup final and, while I will be sorry not to be able to cheer Aston Villa on at Wembley, I understand and appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to have these tickets given my actions."</p>
