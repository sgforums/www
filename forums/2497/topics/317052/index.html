              <p><strong>Wenger wants to block Hleb move</strong></p>
              <p><strong><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/hleb_getty.jpg" alt=""></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Arsène Wenger came out fighting yesterday in regards to the future of Alexander Hleb, insisting Arsenal are willing to take legal action to prevent the midfielder from joining Internazionale.</strong></p>
              <p>A day after Hleb's agent Nikolai Shpilevski publicly stated the Belarus international is "leaving Arsenal," with the Italian champions his most likely destination, Wenger said he was "confident" of keeping the midfielder and played down the possibility of him buying out the remaining two years of his contract under Article 17 of Fifa's transfer regulations, otherwise known as the "Webster Clause", which permits players to terminate their deal after a "protected period."</p>
              <p>Wenger made it clear Article 17 can be challenged and Arsenal are prepared to do just that. "It is not as simple as it looks, this Webster clause, you can't just come in next day and buy out, there is no rule that says that. And you should not forget what clubs can do," said Wenger. "You have to first go to a Fifa tribunal and if you don't agree with Fifa, you have to go to Acas. It takes a lof of months. You can be banned for the whole period if it's not done in a proper way."</p>
              <p>Hleb has long been courted by Inter, a source of great irritation for Wenger who has threatened to report the club to Fifa over what he described as the "disrespectful" pursuit of the player. Losing the 27-year-old, who signed from Stuggart for £11.5m in July 2005, would represent a huge blow for the Frenchman who has already had to say goodbye to one first-team player in the closing stages of this season.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/wenger_pa.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>WENGER launched an unprecedented attack on AC Milan</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Wenger could not hide his disappointment yesterday with Mathieu Flamini's decision to join Milan on a free transfer, especially after the midfielder had given assurances that he would sign a new deal at the Emirates, and claimed that while Flamini's wage will swell at the San Siro, he is joining a club with less integrity.</strong></p>
              <p>"I know the rules in this job, the guy [Flamini] is free, he can go to somebody who pays him more," said Wenger. "But he said he wanted to stay. If you say 'no I want to go somewhere' that is ok. But you cannot say 'I want to stay but I go.'</p>
              <p>"This club here has a history of being built by people of values. I'm not sure that in the history of Milan you'll find the same values, even if you dig well." Despite his frustrations, Wenger is sure he will not struggle to replace Flamini in the centre of Arsenal's midfield, claiming the hole can be filled by Abou Diaby, Denilson, Gilberto Silva who, Wenger indicated, has not made up his mind to definitely leave the club, or a new recruit.</p>
              <p>"There are plenty of players who want to join us, I go to my office and I have 220 calls from players who want to come in, we have no problem on that front," he said. But there is less assurance inside the Arsenal dressing room. One senior player feels that in Flamini the team has lost someone willing to make "dirty" tackles and that is essential in a side which has struggled at times to assert itself in attritional encounters.</p>
              <p>Some solace can, however, be found in the assurances Emmanuel Adebayor gave yesterday regarding his own future. It had been reported that the Togo striker, who has scored 30 goals this season, wanted a pay increase otherwise he too would walk away, but the 24-year-old insists he is happy where he is.</p>
              <p>"These reports are rubbish," he said. "I love the club and the fans, we have a great set of players and a fantastic team spirit. We've had a good season and we want to go one better next season by winning a trophy."</p>

              <h1>I won't let Arsenal rebels quit, says boss Arsene Wenger</h1>
              <p><img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05_03/Hleb0905_468x353.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger is refusing to accept that Alexander Hleb will leave Arsenal for Inter Milan and dismisses Emmanuel Adebayor's new wage demand as nothing more than an agent's desperation to do business in the transfer window.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Arsenal boss also delivered a withering attack on AC Milan, who have snapped up Mathieu Flamini, saying the Gunners have far better values. And he went on to warn Inter that other clubs can try to lure players by buying out the final period of a contract.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: 'We have the players to compete next season for the Premier League and 98 per cent are staying. Only Flamini and Jens Lehmann will be gone.' Then, switching to the attack, he said defiantly: 'There are plenty of players who want to join us, don't worry. We have no problem on that front.'</p>
              <p>And with Aston Villa's Gareth Barry being linked o Arsenal, Wenger added: 'With the players we already have, there will be big competition for the central midfield if we bring somebody in. To Flamini I just say, “Goodbye and good luck”.'</p>
              <p>Adebayor's demand — exclusively revealed in Sportsmail — for a wage increase from £35,000 to £80,000 a week was shrugged off by Wenger, who said: 'Agents always get nervous in May and then calm down at the end of August. It will be all quiet then until January 1.</p>
              <p>'Adebayor certainly will not be allowed to go and it is more likely he will be challenged to prove himself again in the opening months of the new season before a new contract offer is made.' However, it emerged yesterday that the striker is Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri's top transfer target and he is prepared to meet his wage demands.</p>
              <p>Taking the opportunity of praising Arsenal's standing as a club which does the right thing, and aiming a blow at AC Milan for capturing Flamini, he added: 'This club has a history of being built by people with values. I'm not sure in the history of AC Milan you'll find the same values that this club has. 'This is a big club that comes out of people's desire for values. It is clean a big club.'</p>
              <p>He then turned on Inter and insisted: 'Yes, I am confident of keeping Alexander Hleb. Flamini said he wanted to stay and then left. But the rest are all under contract and if anyone wants to buy a player they have to call me.' Hleb has identified a route out to Inter by buying out the remaining two years of his contract. The only player to do that, however, has been Rangers' Andy Webster when he left Hearts for Wigan two years ago.</p>
              <p>Wenger said: 'It's not as easy at is looks, the so-called Webster clause. 'There is no rule that says what it is about. You have to go to FIFA, to tribunal and it can take a lot of months where the player can be banned for the whole period.' He also warned Inter and any other clubs looking to use such a loophole by saying: 'You should not forget what clubs do to us we can do to them as well.'</p>
