            <div class='col-md body'><strong>SVEN GORAN ERIKSSON admits he will lead the race if ever David Beckham decides to return to England.</strong><br><br>The ex-Three Lions coach makes no secret of his admiration for the midfielder who was his captain for more than six years.<br><br>BecksÂ’ American club LA Galaxy have said this week they would not be willing to let him play elsewhere on loan before their season starts on March 29.<br><br>But Eriksson, whose team face a tough FA Cup tie at Sheffield United on Sunday, keeps in touch with the former Manchester United ace, 32, and reckons he can still perform at the top level.<br><br>He said: Â“If David wants to come back to England I would say yes, come to Manchester City.<br><br>Â“I still believe he deserves to be in the England team. Not just because of it being his 100th cap but because he is still a great player.<br><br>Â“His right foot is still as good as it ever was. Even if he is in America, David can still fight for his place in the team.<br><br>Â“But I canÂ’t see him coming back here. I think he will finish his career in America.<br><br>Â“He has a long contract and he is very keen to make football popular in America. And if anyone can do that, itÂ’s David.<br><br>Â“Now and then I speak with David and his agent. And I saw David recently at a dinner in London, so weÂ’re still in touch in a way.Â”<br><br>Eriksson is keeping his fingers crossed new England boss Fabio Capello allows Becks to reach three figures against Switzerland on February 6.<br><br>He added: Â“I would agree 100 per cent that Beckham deserves his 100th cap. Of course he does.Â”<br><br>At least 12 Premier League clubs will be out of the FA Cup after this weekend and Eriksson is dreaming of finally getting to sit in a Wembley dugout.<br><br>He never took charge of a match at the famous venue during his time in charge of England and it remains a strong ambition.<br><br>Eriksson, 60 next month, added: Â“I would love to sit on the bench at Wembley just once before I retire Â— it is still one of my dreams.<br><br>Â“It seemed it was destiny it would not happen while I was in charge of England. If it does not happen I will survive but it would be great.<br><br>Â“I hope we can win the FA Cup. We are not the favourites if you ask people.<br><br>Â“But itÂ’s a cup competition and weÂ’ll do everything we can to stay in it and go as far as we can.Â”</div>
