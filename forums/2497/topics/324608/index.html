              <p><strong> Arsene Wenger maintains he has money to
              spend, but must weigh up the cost of "killing" the chances of Arsenal's
              talented youngsters by bringing in a big name transfer.</strong></p>
              <p>Long-serving midfielder Gilberto Silva joined Greek side
              Panathinaikos on Thursday to follow both unsettled winger Alexander
              Hleb and the combative Mathieu Flamini out of Emirates Stadium.</p>
              <p>As a result, the Gunners may now up their interest in Aston
              Villa's England international Gareth Barry, who is rated at £18million
              and has been a target for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>However, Wenger insists it is not just a matter of opening the
              cheque book and that there were other concerns he had to consider other
              than simply looking for a quick fix.</p>
              <p>Wenger told Arsenal TV OnLine: "Of course I am in a position where I can spend the money.</p>
              <p>"But every time we have done such a great job with the young
              players that you are concerned 'do we kill a young player or not by
              bringing another player in?'</p>
              <p>"It is a very sensitive subject which is not specially linked with money."</p>
              <p>Arsenal have already moved to bring in promising Wales teenager
              Aaron Ramsey from Cardiff for £5million and paid £12million for
              21-year-old France attacking winger Samir Nasri as Wenger again puts
              faith in youth.</p>
              <p>While some of that outlay has been recouped by the sales of
              Hleb and Gilberto, the Gunners boss rejected criticism over the club's
              unwillingness to shatter their wage structure purely in a bid to keep
              players happy.</p>
              <p>Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor is one who has suggested he
              could get better terms elsewhere, and has been tracked by both AC Milan
              and Barcelona.</p>
              <p>"There is a lot of talk in the press, but we have always managed at this club by balancing the budget," Wenger said.</p>
              <p>"We should not be criticised for that and should be respected for that."</p>
              <p>Arsenal open their pre-season campaign at Barnet tomorrow, where
              Wenger has named a youthful squad and is expected to give Ramsey his
              debut.</p>
              <p>However, when the action begins for real, the Gunners will
              again be fighting all out to close the gap on champions Manchester
              United and runners-up Chelsea.</p>
              <p>"We were very close, we were in the race and next year we want to show we can win it," Wenger said.</p>
              <p>"The team is performing well, but the target of a top-level
              sportsman is to always improve and I believe we can be more clinical,
              we can score more with the chances we create."</p>
              <p>Wenger - whose last piece of silverware was the FA Cup in 2005
              - declared: "It is important you fight for the championship and to win
              it. All the other trophies are more of a consolation than anything
              else.</p>
              <p>"I will try to achieve my best to develop the players, to fight in every game. I am more motivated than ever to achieve that.</p>
              <p>"For the rest, you have to accept that it will never be be good enough. People always want more - that is normal."</p>

              <p>the board saw no reason to fire him even he dont delivered trophy.</p>
              <p>arsenal are in debts.</p>
              <p>Aw helps arsenal to keep playing in the champion league every season ie top four in EPL by spending limited amount of money on players to finance the debt repayment for their new stadium.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it will be crazy for the board to fire him for not winning trophy, which could cause outrage among fans.</p>
