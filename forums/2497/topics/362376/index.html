              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong><span class="entry-title">Milan realistic over Kaka</span></strong></p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>AC Milan have admitted they would find it hard to turn down a huge bid for Kaka this summer. </strong></p>
              <p class="ss-text-bold"><img src="http://img.skysports.com/09/02/218x298/Kaka-Celeb_1858052.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><strong>The Brazilian, who has previously been linked with a
                  move to the Premier League, is now believed to be a top target for Real
                  Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>A number of clubs outside Italy are also interested in
                  teenage superstar Alexandre Pato and Milan general manager Adriano
                  Galliani is realistic about the club's chances of keeping the pair.</p>
              <p>However, Galliani intends to fight for the duo as part of a wider battle to prevent what could become a mass exodus from Italy.</p>
              <p>He explained: "With the risk of sounding boring, if we continue like this, we will become a small league.</p>
              <p>"We
                  have had requests for Kaka and Pato from two of Europe's biggest clubs
                  and we will try and resist the assault from these European clubs who
                  have more money than us.</p>
              <p>"But there is an uneven playing field.</p>
              <p>"I remember when we signed (Marco) van Basten and we competed with Barcelona for his signature, and he chose us.</p>
              <p>"Today, Barcelona and Real Madrid have an income which is double that of ours."</p>
              <p><span class="main-content">
              </span></p><h4>Bigger issue</h4>
              <p>Clubs in England and
                  Spain are able to offer more attractive wages due to more beneficial
                  taxation rules and Galliani does not expect many top players to come to
                  Italy in the near future.</p>
              <p>He said: "In the mid to long term, players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are not going to come here.</p>
              <p>"Thierry
                  Henry had the same offer from Milan than he did from Barcelona but he
                  told us he could get 50% more in Spain, so he joined Barcelona.</p>
              <p>"We have got to ask ourselves why nobody is thinking of coming here.</p>
              <p>"The
                  problem with Kaka and Pato is a bigger issue. You can discover any
                  player you like but if you cannot pay them the wages of a big club,
                  then they go somewhere else.</p>
              <p>"That was the case with Cristiano Ronaldo with Sporting Lisbon and Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Ajax. They had to move on."</p>
              <h5>Wanted</h5>
              <p>New Milan coach Leonardo also seemed unsure about whether Kaka would remain at his disposal.</p>
              <p>He said: "I think that Kaka, like any world-class player, is always wanted by other clubs.</p>
              <p>"He
                  is a man who will always be in the market. I cannot deny that I hope he
                  continues to play for us as he is a key player for this club.</p>
              <p>"But it is normal that he is wanted on the market."</p>
              <p></p>

              <p>I think the message is more for the AC Milan board and owner rather than the other clubs... AC need the money, selling Kaka will be a good way to rise money... I belief the club is tempted to cash in as they have shown when they considered City's offer... and he is trying to tell them he doesn't want to move, he wants to continue to stay in the city... </p>
              <p>Anyway, I think a bid of $50m to $60m, AC will grab it with both hands... They can also reduce their weekly salary by a great deal...</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CHELSEA failed with a spectacular bid to land Kaka last night, as the Brazilian joined Real Madrid for a world record £62million. </h2>
              <p class="article">New Blues boss Carlo Ancelotti tried desperately to bring Kaka with him from AC Milan to Stamford Bridge. But he was powerless to stop new Real president Florentino Perez sealing the deal. </p>
              <p class="article">As SunSport exclusively revealed, Chelsea will now go all out for Milan striker Alexandre Pato - though an initial £30m offer has been rejected. </p>
              <p class="article">Perez staged his Kaka coup after intense talks with Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani. </p>
              <p class="article">A Chelsea source confirmed: "Mr Ancelotti tried very, very hard to get Kaka to begin the new era at the club. "But in the end Real Madrid had more money to spend. Now Chelsea are even more determined to get Pato." </p>
              <p class="article">Kaka's dad Bosco Leite helped the player thrash out personal terms. The negotiations took place a day after Perez was confirmed as Real president after all rival candidates quit the race. </p>
              <p class="article">Kaka, 27, had tried to deny a deal was on, insisting he wanted to stay at the San Siro. The Samba superstar was on his way back to Brazil to join up with the national team while his dad was negotiating a deal believed to be worth £160,000 a week with the Spaniards. </p>
              <p class="article">Kaka's £62m move will eclipse the £47m Perez paid Juventus for Zinedine Zidane in 2001. Milan are still open to offers for striker Pato - as long as Chelsea now increase their £30m opening bid.</p>

              <p class="article">Real president Florentino Perez is on the verge of spending £62m on Brazilian superstar Kaka. But he insists the £75m it could take to capture Ronaldo from Manchester United remains good value for money. </p>
              <p class="article">Perez denied there is an agreement in place with United to sign the World Player of the Year. But he said: "What I am sure of is that which seems expensive is often the cheapest. </p>
              <p class="article">"Without knowing who we can get, there will be a massive effort for the great players of the world, because that is the Real Madrid model. "We will lay the foundations to create a magnificent team." </p>

              <p><strong>AC Milan have denied general manager Adriano Galliani was negotiating the sale of Kaka to Real Madrid during a visit to Spain.</strong></p>
              <p>Speculation has been mounting that the Brazilian playmaker will swap the San Siro for the Bernabeu following Florentino Perez's return as Real Madrid president, and reports on Tuesday evening in Spain claimed a deal had been agreed between the clubs during talks in the Spanish capital.</p>
              <p>But in a statement released on the club's official website, Milan insisted Galliani had only travelled to Madrid to attend a dinner for Perez.</p>
              <p>The statement read: "The general manager of the Rosseneri, Adriano Galliani, is in the city of Madrid exclusively for the investiture dinner of Florentino Perez, the new president of Real Madrid."</p>

              <p><strong>The future of Brazilian midfielder Kaka was shrouded in mystery on Tuesday night after Spanish radio station <em>Cadena Ser</em> reported he had joined Real Madrid for £56m - only for the player's spokesman and AC Milan to both deny any deal had been agreed.</strong></p>
              <p>Real are set to go on a spending spree following the return of Florentino Perez as the club's president. Despite Kaka not wishing to leave AC Milan it is believed the offer was too good to turn down and, unlike with Manchester City in January, it seems unlikely the player will reject the move.</p>
              <p>The fee would represent a new world record, surpassing the £46m Real paid to Juventus for Zinedine Zidane in 2001. It would also mean Real hold the three highest fees paid, with the £37m for Luis Figo from Barcelona in 2000 completing the set.</p>
              <p>The radio station reported a fee of €65million (£56million) which had been confirmed by Kaka's father and agent, Bosco Leite.</p>
              <p>But in a statement released on the club's official website, Milan insisted Galliani had only travelled to Madrid to attend a dinner for Perez.</p>
              <p>Kaka's spokeman, Diogo Kotscho, said on Tuesday evening: "Kaka will listen to Real and decide whether or not to make the transfer.</p>
              <p>"What I can say for certain is that the Spaniards and Milan have not reached any agreement."</p>

              <p><br>Kaka can play as an attacking midfielder or a 2nd striker behind the main one... Moreover, Chelsea wants to bring down the age of their team... Ballack, Lampard, Drogba are just a few of their 30 somethings... Anyway, he will just take Deco's place... so not much difference there... But Lotti wants him badly.</p>

              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Milan have denied the widespread reports which state that flamboyant Brazilian Kaka is on the verge of joining Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.setanta.com/Global/Images/sport/football/2008-2009/italy/Milan/kaka_back.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="270"></p>
              <p><strong>It was reported on Tuesday night that the world-record £56 million transfer of Kaka to El Bernabeu was virtually a done deal.</strong></p>
              <p>Returning Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has outlined his
              intentions to revive the 'Galacticos' and they don’t come much more
              glamorous than the former World Player of the Year.</p>
              <p>But, while Milan have been sending out what amounts to distress
              signals in their attempts to keep the 28-year-old out of the clutches
              of their more wealthy rivals, the Rossoneri are adamant that no deal
              has been agreed.</p>
              <p>Reacting to suggestions that a fee has been agreed between Real and
              Milan and that the only sticking point is now negotiations between Kaka
              and his prospective employers, a statement on the Serie A's
              side official website claims that the motivation of vice-president
              Adriano Galliani's visit to Madrid was to attend Perez's inauguration.</p>
              <p>A statement released by the club read: "The general manager of the
              Rossoneri, Adriano Galliani, is in the city of Madrid exclusively for
              the inaugural dinner of Florentino Perez, the new president of Real
              Madrid."</p>

              <h1 class="heading">Chelsea bid to hijack Kaká deal</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00295/kaka-360_295107a.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="360"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Chelsea blew the summer transfer window wide open last night with a last-ditch attempt to lure Kaká away from a move to Real Madrid.</strong></p>
              <p>The Spanish club have an agreement in place with AC Milan to sign the Brazil forward for a staggering €65 million (£56.2 million). Real had offered the player a five-year contract on a salary of £150,000 a week after tax. However, sources in Milan said that Chelsea — who were also targeting Andrea Pirlo — had offered the player “extraordinary” personal terms after they were advised that there was a hitch in the Kaká deal.</p>
              <p>The news of the tense negotiations came only hours after Gareth Barry, the England midfield player, left Aston Villa to join Manchester City for a fee of £12 million.</p>
              <p>Chelsea will try to persuade Kaká to come to Stamford Bridge and join up with Carlo Ancelotti, his former coach at the San Siro who is now in charge at the Barclays Premier League club.</p>
              <p>Kaká, who is on international duty, is believed to favour Real, but, in a further twist last night, Bosco Leite, the player’s agent and father, halted talks with the Spanish club after the interest shown by Chelsea and disagreements over his agent’s commission.</p>
              <p>The transfer had earlier been thrashed out by Leite, Florentino Pérez, the newly returned Madrid president, and Adriano Galliani, the Milan vice-president. The Italian club, however, claimed last night that Galliani was in Spain purely as a guest at Pérez’s inauguration dinner.</p>
              <p>The dramatic events come after Kaká had reiterated his desire to stay in Italy. “I say it for the last time: I don’t want to leave Milan,” he insisted.</p>
              <p>Pérez seems determined, however, to recreate his infamous galácticos regime at the Bernabéu. He is expected to follow up the move for Kaká with a ¤45 million swoop for Franck Ribéry, the Bayern Munich winger, although, incredibly, that may still not be enough to end Pérez’s interest in Cristiano Ronaldo, the Manchester United forward.</p>
              <p>Pérez risked incurring the wrath of United by claiming that he would have no hesitation paying more than ¤80 million for the Portugal player.</p>
              <p>“I have not seen anything about him [Ronaldo] that would prohibit him from playing at Real Madrid,” Pérez said. “What I am sure of is that which seems expensive is the cheapest. Without knowing who we can get, there will be a massive effort for the great players of the world because that is the Real Madrid model.”</p>
