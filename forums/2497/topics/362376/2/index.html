              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>According to <em><span style="color: #333332;">Radio Onda Cero</span></em>, Kaka will be unveiled by Real Madrid during a press conference on Monday. "We know that they have reached a deal. €65million for Milan, and €9m per season for Kaka over five years," Arancha Rodriguez of Radio Onda Cero told </strong><span style="color: #333332;"><em><strong>Sky Sport Italia.</strong></em><br><br></span>"He could be in Madrid for the presentation on Monday." In additon, new details have emerged in <em><span style="color: #333332;">Marca </span></em>suggesting the Brazilian will be given the number 5 shirt which belonged to Zinedine Zidane, and more recently Fabio Cannavaro.<br><br>Meanwhile, Brazil coach Carlos Dunga is indifferent regarding all the hype surrounding Kaka and his possible move to Real Madrid, but the 1994 World Cup winner thinks his man would succeed at any club.<br><br>Both the Italian and Spanish media are convinced that the Milan ace is on the verge of joining los Merengues. The speculation was heightened when Adriano Galliani was invited by Florentino Perez to the Spanish capital for <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important;" href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/10/italy/2009/06/03/1302503/kaka-to-be-unveiled-by-real-madrid-on-monday-report#"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; color: #0464d1! important; border-bottom: #0464d1 1px solid; font-family: Verdana,Arial; position: relative; background-color: transparent;">dinner</span></span></a> on Tuesday night.<br><br>Although Kaka is staying quiet over the whole affair, Dunga has shed some light on the move, believing his star man would excel at any club. "Kaka is a player with great quality and he can adapt without any problems in any country," Dunga told <em><span style="color: #333332;">Il Corriere Dello Sport</span></em>.<br><br>"Kaka has already shown what he can do and if he has done it in Italy, he can do it anywhere." The player himself was chased around Brazil's retreat in Teresopolis by reporters but he showed great dribbling skills to dodge their questions.</p>

              <p>Last season milan did intended to sell kaka to man city leh... it's the player's decision to stay... As for T. Henry, why would arsenal want to sell their best striker(as of that season) to their title rivals... Moreover, I think he don't want to risk soiling his "legendary" reputation like the mercenery ashley cole...</p>

              <div id="div_article_main_content">
              <p><strong>Chelsea have categorically denied ever making a bid for Milan superstar Kaka.</strong></p>
              <p>The Blues have insisted they have not dramatically entered the race
              to sign the Brazilian, who has appeared on the brink of joining Real
              Madrid this week.</p>
              <p>The classy playmaker has stressed he is staying at Milan but that scenario is appearing less and less likely.</p>
              <p>With some reports claiming Carlo Ancelotti called his former player
              on his mobile to convince him to delay signing for Real, rumours were
              rife that Chelsea had tabled a record-busting offer for the South
              American.</p>
              <p>However, in a statement on their official website, Chelsea stressed:
              "We have never made an offer to AC Milan for Kaka and therefore not one
              at this extraordinary level.</p>
              <p>"As a consequence, we have not discussed a salary with the player either.</p>
              <p>"Any reports to the contrary are totally untrue."</p>
              <p>The West Londoners are believed to be interested in acquiring Kaka
              but Real still seem to be in pole position following the official
              denial of any firm bid.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">CARLO ANCELOTTI made a dramatic phone call to Kaka yesterday and begged: Don't join Real Madrid. The new Chelsea manager rang the Brazilian superstar in a bid to stall his world record £62million switch from AC Milan to Madrid. </h2>
              <p class="article">Milan sources were adamant last night that Kaka will still go to Real - and the deal will be confirmed on Monday. But Blues owner Roman Abramovich discovered yesterday morning that Kaka's transfer was still not legally concluded. </p>
              <p class="article">That sparked Ancelotti's call and speculation mounted throughout the day that Chelsea had offered a staggering £73.5m for the playmaker - and were willing to pay him £17m in wages. </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea issued a statement officially denying that last night - although the club did not deny the phone call from Ancelotti. </p>
              <p class="article">Ancelotti was Kaka's boss at Milan for six years and forged a close relationship with his star player. A pal of Ancelotti's confirmed: "Carlo called Kaka in Brazil. "Carlo is hopeful that Chelsea can be a tempting destination and his personal bond with the player can make a difference." </p>
              <p class="article">But a Milan insider last night insisted Ancelotti's pleas are too little, too late. They said: "He is not going to Chelsea - even though Ancelotti has been asking him for some time to come with him. </p>
              <p class="article">"The will of the player in this case is paramount. And we know that he wants to join Real Madrid, not Chelsea. This is no longer a moving story. The announcement will come on Monday." </p>
              <p class="article">Milan's owner, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, was facing a backlash from Italian fans yesterday - who also revolted when Kaka, 27, nearly joined Manchester City in January. </p>
              <p class="article">Berlusconi, whose political party faces European elections on Sunday, promised them he would announce a decision once the voting was over. </p>
              <p class="article">Berlusconi even likened Kaka's transfer to Andriy Shevchenko's switch to Chelsea, saying: "I can only say that we were very attached to Sheva. </p>
              <p class="article">"When an offer arrived that we could not equal, because I had a great friendship with him, I did all I could to convince him - but in the end I left it up to him.</p>
              <p class="article">"It is always our lads who must decide where they want to play. Now we will see." </p>
              <p class="article">Meanwhile, Real sporting director Jorge Valdano was last night desperately trying to seal Kaka's transfer to the Bernabeu. The player is currently on international duty with Brazil.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span> <strong>have conceded defeat in their pursuit of</strong> <span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Kaka</strong></span> <strong>with the Brazilian due to be confirmed as a</strong> <span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Real Madrid</strong></span> <strong>player for a world record £56.2m on Monday, leaving the</strong> <span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Premier League</strong></span> <strong>club's attention fixed on Bayern Munich's Franck Ribéry and David Villa of Valencia as they attempt a marquee summer signing of their own.</strong></p>
              <p>Kaka, who is in Brazil preparing for his country's forthcoming World Cup qualifiers, is understood to have agreed terms with Real and, just as significantly, the Spanish club have agreed a commission fee with the player's father and agent, Bosco Leite. There were reports that Chelsea had formalised their long-standing interest with a £73.5m bid but the London club issued a statement denying any offer had been made.</p>
              <p>It is understood that Kaka, despite his public utterances, had actually informed team-mates at Milan by late on Tuesday night that he is to leave the club for Madrid to become the returning president Florentino Pérez's first eye-catching signing of his second spell in charge.</p>
              <p>The prospect of missing out on the former world player of the year will come as a blow for the new Chelsea manager, Carlo Ancelotti, who worked with Kaka at San Siro, but also to the club's owner, Roman Abramovich. Yet their interest serves as a statement of intent that the oligarch is prepared to spend heavily this summer in a throwback to the lavish first few years at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>There is interest in Milan's young Brazilian striker, Alexandre Pato, though the Rossoneri will be resistant to selling another of their younger attacking players. Pato himself said today that he wished to remain at Milan.</p>
              <p>Instead, Chelsea are likely to focus their attentions on Villa and Ribéry, who had been expected to favour a move to Real should he leave Bayern Munich. Now that the Spanish club have secured Kaka, and with interest in Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo maintained, the France international appears less of an obvious option. Ancelotti expressed his admiration for the 26-year-old in his autobiography, published last week, and has been in regular contact with Chelsea's head of youth development and scouting, Frank Arnesen, in recent days. The new manager is believed to have visited Cobham for the first time today.</p>
              <p>Bayern, too, will be resistant to losing their creative inspiration. Their general manager, Uli Hoeness, has discussed Ribéry's future with the club's new coach, Louis van Gaal, and stressed today that the player is not for sale. "Van Gaal really wants to keep him," he said. "We will not let Ribéry go. There will be inquiries for Ribéry in the next four to six weeks, I'm sure. We will be polite but we will not negotiate. We are not going to celebrate on the telephone when somebody offers a certain amount."</p>
              <p>The pursuit of Villa is just as complicated. The striker is likely to be made available by Valencia, who are heavily in debt and failed to qualify for the Champions League, yet he has made no secret of his desire to remain in Spain. Much may depend upon whether Barcelona lodge a bid for his services. Chelsea are pursuing other targets just as wholeheartedly, with the teenage Manchester City striker Daniel Sturridge, a free agent having failed to agree a new contract at Eastlands, expected to join along with the CSKA Moscow midfielder Yuri Zhirkov, who can also play at left-back. The club's interest in Arsenal's Emmanuel Adebayor is unlikely to be followed up, however, after they offered Didier Drogba a new three-year contract to remain at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Another of Chelsea's stalwart players, Ricardo Carvalho, is expected to rejoin Jose Mourinho at Internazionale after confirming that he is "open to offers" to leave London after five years. The prospects of Ancelotti being accompanied by his assistant at San Siro, Filippo Galli, appeared to be receding tonight with the Italian considering a proposal to remain at Milan on improved terms.</p>

              <h1 class="titlestory">Chelsea boss Ancelotti urges Abramovich to meet price for Ribery</h1>
              <div class="content">
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti wants Chelsea to push the boat out for Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says Ancelotti has urged Roman Abramovich to
              redouble his efforts to sign Franck Ribéry after the club conceded
              defeat in their pursuit of Kaká, who will join Real Madrid from AC
              Milan, last night.</p>
              <p>The Bayern Munich winger is also wanted by Real, but Ancelotti
              is hoping that Abramovich's pride will not allow him to be beaten to
              the signature of two players by the Spaniards. Bayern are publicly
              insisting that Ribéry is not for sale, but have privately conceded that
              they would accept a fee of £40 million. Chelsea are willing to pay an
              outlandish transfer fee this summer, but Abramovich may be reluctant to
              sanction such a level of spending for a player he could have had for
              less than half that sum two years ago.</p>
              <p>“We will not let Ribéry go,” Uli Hoeness, the Bayern general
              manager, said yesterday. “Most clubs only ended their season recently
              and when the players go on holiday, the bosses start with their
              planning.</p>
              <p>“There will be inquiries for Ribéry in the next four to six
              weeks, I'm sure. But we have not had any decisive inquiry. We will be
              polite, but we will not negotiate. We're not going to celebrate on the
              telephone when somebody offers a certain amount.”</p>
