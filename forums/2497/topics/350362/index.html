              <p><strong>After more than a one-year injury layoff, Ronaldo finally returned to action with his new club Corinthians.</strong><br><br>Ronaldo may have only played 29 minutes, but he looked very lively, and even came close to getting on the score-sheet.<br><br>He replaced Jorge Henrique in the 21st minute of the second half and one minute later he had his first touch of the ball.<br><br>The
              excited crowd at the Juscelino Kubitschek stadium in Itumbiara roared
              each time Ronaldo came close to the ball, and the former FIFA World
              Footballer of the Year tried to impress them with some of his trademark
              trickery.<br><br>He showed no signs of an injury, although it was
              evident that he was lacking the necessary fitness to play a competitive
              football match.<br><br>But Ronaldo, 32, constantly asked for the ball,
              and instead of passing the ball as soon as he got it, he preferred to
              take on his opponents, and with good results.<br><br>Towards the end of the match Ronaldo looked to mark his debut with a goal. <br><br>He
              fired a long-range effort wide of the right post, and minutes later he
              forced his way into the area, but was penalized for pushing.<br><br>The
              former Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter and AC Milan striker was without
              doubt the main focus of attention in a match that Corinthians won 2-0.
              The match corresponded to the first round of the Copa do Brasil.<br><br>At
              the final whistle several excited reporters mobbed Ronaldo, and he was
              hurt in the process. He quickly made his way into the tunnel while
              touching his sore head.<br><br>Ronaldo is likely to start for the first time in the top-of-the-table Paulista derby with Palmeiras on the weekend.</p>
