              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Arsene
               Wenger says he is proud of his recent achievements and prouder 
              still of the way he has built his current crop of Arsenal tyros.<br><br>Since
               the Invincibles' astonishing unbeaten league season of 2003-04 the 
              Gunners have yet to win a trophy, while the new money of Chelsea and Manchester 
              City has threatened to eclipse the London club entirely.<br><br>Arsenal
               have in recent years been out-powered in individual matches against 
              their closest competitors and outlasted in the title race.<br><br>However,
               Wenger has during this time developed such stellar talents as Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie
               and Emmanuel Adebayor into leading lights of the Premier League.<br><br>And
               he says his moneyed rivals are taking the easy route to success.<br><br>His
               present side have an average age as low as 22 and are still in the 
              title frame as the contest with leaders Chelsea and holders Manchester 
              United enters its closing stages.<br><br>And while Wenger 
              recognizes the might of Chelsea and the inexorable rise of the Sky 
              Blues, he claims victories that cannot be displayed in a trophy cabinet.<br><span class="main-content">
              </span></span></p><p>"City will get it right, they need time," Wenger told the <em>Telegraph</em>.</p>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"><span class="main-content">
              </span></span></p><p>"We have to 
              count City as a competitive force in the future because of the money; 
              City and Chelsea have a way to be successful.</p>
              <p>"Buying players of 27, 28 is the easiest way to do management.</p>
              <p>"We have gone a different way: we have created a special spirit 
              because our players have lived together from 16 onwards."</p>
              <p>For Wenger this spirit is closely allied to the spirit and well-being
               of football itself.</p>
              <span class="main-content">
              <p>He added: "It is important for football in general that Arsenal are 
              successful; it will make people believe there is not only one way.</p>
              <p>"I listen to people who say: "We lost but we had five or six players 
              of 22'.</p>
              <p>"We have an average age of 22 and we're fighting for the 
              championship.''</p>
              <p>Arsenal also remain in the hunt for the Champions League, in which 
              they were beaten finalists in 2006, as well as continuing to delight 
              with their nimble swift-passing game - two more reasons for Wenger to 
              believe in his methods.</p>
              <span class="main-content">
              <p>"Trophies are cherry on the cake," Wenger said.</p>
              <p>"People say in the last five years Arsenal have achieved nothing.</p>
              <p>"Which would you prefer? Winning the Carling Cup or reaching the 
              Champions League final?</p>
              <p>"Champions League final of course.</p>
              <p>"In 2006 we have been in the final, but because we did not get the 
              trophy, people say the achievement was rubbish.</p>
              <p>"But it's the first time Arsenal have reached the Champions League 
              final - that's an achievement."</p>

              <p>of course its better to be in the CL final than winning the carling cup.  but can arsenal reach the CL final every season?</p>
              <p>carling cup may be a cup that is of little value but it is definitely a consolation to at least finish the season with a silverware for all the hard work throughout one long season.</p>
