              <p>Dalglish's confirmation as the long-term successor to Roy Hodgson is a formality having taken the club from 12th in the Premier League to the brink of European qualification inside four months and is expected to be announced before the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Several FSG officials, notably the principal owner, John W Henry, and Liverpool's chairman, Tom Werner, have voiced their support for the 60-year-old Scot and backed him on the combined £57.8m purchases of Andy Carroll and Luis Suárez in January. They are now pursuing Young, another target of Dalglish and the director of football, Damien Comolli, and have emerged as favourites to sign the £15m-rated England international despite competition from United, the Premier League champions-elect.</p>
              <p>Young enters the final year of his Villa contract this summer having rejected the offer of an improved deal, which contained a get-out clause in the region of £15m, at the start of this season. The 25-year-old insisted on delaying talks with Villa over a contract extension until this campaign had ended but his employers are privately resigned to losing the player four years after his £9.65m arrival from Watford.</p>
              <p>United and Liverpool are vying for Young's services but the prospect of a significant increase on his £65,000-a-week Villa salary at Anfield, plus more regular first-team football than he may receive at Old Trafford, is understood to have tilted the contest in Dalglish's favour.</p>
              <p>United are only one point away from overtaking Liverpool on 19 league titles and can guarantee Champions League football next term but, unlike their Anfield rivals, they are well-stocked on the left and right of midfield and in Young's preferred position behind the lead striker. The chance to establish himself in a team with renewed momentum under Dalglish is believed to have tempted Young towards Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Dalglish and Comolli are also keen on Young's team-mate Stewart Downing, whose performances have eclipsed the Stevenage-born forward at Villa Park this season. Although Villa are loth to lose either player and have proved to be tough negotiators under Randy Lerner, as Liverpool and Manchester City can testify over their moves for Gareth Barry and James Milner respectively, Young's contractual situation has left them little room for manoeuvre once a tempting bid arrives.</p>
              <p>Young forms part of an ambitious spending programme planned by FSG for this summer, an added appeal for a player who has established himself in the England set-up, with Blackpool's Charlie Adam still on Liverpool's agenda following a thwarted move in January and a new central defender among the targets. Bolton's Gary Cahill and Phil Jones of Blackburn are under consideration.</p>
              <p>Enticing Young to Anfield, and away from Old Trafford, would be a further indication of Liverpool's determination to offer a sterner challenge to Sir Alex Ferguson's domination of the Premier League than they have managed for much of the past two decades.</p>

Just a year ago, Villa valued him at more than £20m (€23) but they can no longer demand that kind of sum for a player who would be available on a free transfer at the end of the season.<br><br>This suits FSG, who were shocked by the high transfer fees and bloated contracts handed out by their predecessors and have committed to signing young and talented players who will not lose their value. If Liverpool could bring Young in for £14m (€16m), he would probably be worth £20m (€23m) the day after – it makes complete business sense.<br><br></div>

              </div>
              <div class="KonaBody">There is also the fact that Liverpool seem to be willing to offer more wages than United and would put into the shade the £75,000-a-week (€86,000) four-year deal from Villa that has been rejected by the player.<br><br>Make no mistake, this is important to Young. He decided against putting in an official transfer request last summer because he did not feel it was worth it for the £70,000-a-week (€80,000) salary that Tottenham were willing to offer him.<br><br>At Anfield, he could expect to pick up a wage similar to the £90,000-a-week (€103,500) earned by Joe Cole, who the club are looking to sell in the summer after a poor season following his free transfer from Chelsea in July.<br><br>Young will also know that a move to Liverpool will significantly increase his profile at home and abroad, bringing with it more lucrative endorsement contracts.<br><br>Another factor that is heavily influencing Dalglish's transfer strategy is his desire to have a British core in the Liverpool side – and as an England international Young certainly fits the bill in that sense. He also has an excellent appearance record – he has played 45 times this season – and does not have a concerning injury history that would make him a waste of money or a squad place.<br><br>The Reds are desperate to add at least two wingers to the squad, with Comolli scouring Europe to find young and hungry players who can offer pace, delivery and genuine width to the side. Rennes midfielder Sylvain Marveaux is expected to arrive on a free transfer while Young's team-mate Stewart Downing and Juan Mata of Valencia are also being closely monitored.<br><br>Liverpool's desire for wide men means that Young knows that he will be considered a first-team regular at Anfield. The same could not be said at United, where he would have to compete with Valencia, Nani and Park Ji-Sung for a wide role.<br><br>Able to play both on both wings as well as behind a striker, Young's versatility would give Dalglish plenty of options and his direct style would enhance Liverpool's fluid attacking philosophy that was exemplified in the 5-2 win at Fulham on Monday night.<br><br>It is an exciting time on Merseyside and Liverpool are second in the form table behind only Chelsea since club legend Dalglish took over from Roy Hodgson in January.<br><br>Victory against Tottenham on Sunday will secure fifth place and Europa League football for next season and confirm a dramatic turnaround under the Scot.<br><br>And the feeling around the club is that Liverpool are only three or four players away from a genuine title challenge after the £57.8m (€66.5m) purchases of Andy Carroll and Luis Suarez in January.<br><br>Perhaps Dalglish is taking inspiration from his own template of the successful Liverpool team of the late 1980s. If Suarez is his Peter Beardsley and Carroll his John Aldridge, could Young be the John Barnes of Liverpool 2011?<br><br>The winger is fiercely ambitious and he knows his summer move will be a big decision. He wants to win trophies while being personally successful both on and off the pitch. As things stand, a move to Liverpool must make perfect sense.<br></div>

              </strong>
              <p><strong>Darren Bent says he is doing everything he can to persuade team-mate Ashley Young to remain with Aston Villa this summer.</strong></p>
              <p>Young has only one year remaining of his current contract at Villa and is being linked with a move to either Manchester United or Liverpool. But Bent hopes Young can stay for at least one more season at Villa as the duo prepare to meet up next week for England's Euro 2012 qualifier against Switzerland at Wembley on June 4.</p>
              <p>Bent, Villa's record signing at £24 million, said: ''Every day I'm in Ashley's ear going 'please just give us one more year, one more year, one more year!' I'm sure when we're away with England, I'll be giving it the same.</p>
              <p>''Ashley has been fantastic for Aston Villa. There's not one person who could say that he hasn't served his time here in the last four or five years. He's won club award after club award. I think he's been fantastic and if we could get another year out of him - or two years - then it would be brilliant.''</p>
              <p>But Bent concedes that the lure of Champions League football - if Young signs for United - would be hard to resist.</p>
              <p>He said: ''When you've got teams like Manchester United and other Champions League sides coming in for him, then it makes it very difficult. But if we can keep hold of him, I'll be delighted. I don't know if it's a done deal yet.</p>
              <p>''It's about ambitions at the end of the day. When Manchester United and Chelsea and those kind of clubs come calling it makes it difficult. I don't know whether the other players have been trying to convince Ashley to stay but I know I have!</p>
              <p>''Every day I'm on at him asking him to stay. He'll probably try to get away from me! But he's been fantastic and I really hope we can keep him.''</p>

              <p>Young and Sneider are totally different players... One is to replace Giggs or act as a back-up striker while the other is mainly centre-midfielder only...</p>
              <p>Just buy both lah if possible... lol.</p>
              <p>But I would rather Modric than Sneider cos at least he got Premier league experienced and we know what he can do... Sneider comes from Serie A, wait he turn out to be another aquaman, do see liao... waste all that money cry father, cry mother also no use... lol...</p>
              <p>Maybe there must be a reason why he couldn't 'perform' at Real leh? Must be careful...</p>
