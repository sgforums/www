              <p><img title="Chelsea 6 West Brom 0" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01105/CHELSEA_1105930a.jpg" alt="Chelsea 6 West Brom 0" width="516" height="250"></p>
              <p class="link-ccow linkro-ccow"><em>Didier Drogba threw down the gauntlet to title rivals Manchester United as his hat-trick helped Chelsea to a 6-0 thrashing of West Bromwich Albion at Stamford</em>  </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">DIDIER DROBGA was at his imperious best as Chelsea demolished West Brom in their season opener.</h2>
              <p>The Blues would have been keen to overcome their Community Shield defeat to title rivals Manchester United last weekend. And they surely did that with a dominant display at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Florent Malouda opened the scoring before Drogba netted on the stroke of half time. The striker grabbed a second before Frank Lampard made it four and Drogba had his hat-trick soon after. Malouda rounded off the rout with a sixth in the final minute to complete a stunning victory.</p>
              <p>There was a warm welcome for Baggies boss and former Chelsea star Roberto Di Matteo before kick-off. But once the match was underway there was no room for sentiment as the Blues started in emphatic fashion.</p>
              <p>Malouda struck from close range on six minutes after Scott Carson had spilled Drogba's free-kick. West Brom refused to lay down in the face of the oncoming seige and played some decent passing football. But they were made to pay for conceding too many fouls around the box when Drogba smashed in a free-kick just before the break.</p>
              <p>After the break, it was much of the same with the Baggies sticking to their principles. However, Chelsea's class was never in doubt and Malouda drilled a 20-yard effort wide.</p>
              <p>Graeme Dorrans' deflected shot was also off target from a similar range at the other end. The Scotland midfielder chipped a free-kick over the wall but the ball dropped onto the top of the net.</p>
              <p>Drogba netted his second when Terry flicked Malouda's inswinging corner goalwards. Mulumbu hacked it off the line but the ball was not cleared and Drogba was quick to smash it in from close range.</p>
              <p>Lampard walked in a fourth after a clever exchange between Nicolas Anelka and Ashley Cole down the left. Both sides rang the changes with Lampard given a rest and Ishmael Miller coming on for Bednar and Dorrans replacing by Simon Cox.</p>
              <p>It made no difference, though, as Drogba completed his hat-trick with a 20-yard effort which cannoned off Gabriel Tamas into the bottom corner.</p>
              <p>The Ivory Coast striker was next to be handed a well-deserved break when he was replaced by Salomon Kalou for the final 20 minutes.</p>
              <p>Chris Brunt had a late chance to sneak a consolation but his powerful shot flew over the bar. Malouda had the final say as he rounded Baggies keeper Scott Carson for a tap-in off the post.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Carlo Ancelotti</span></abbr> has described their 6-0 thrashing of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West Bromwich Albion</span></abbr> as "nothing special".</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Didier Drogba</span></abbr>'s
               hat-trick sent the double winners straight back to the top of the table
               after handing the newly-promoted Baggies a lesson in clinical 
              finishing.</p>
              <p>Florent Malouda set <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> on their way after only six minutes, with Drogba's free-kick making it 
              2-0 on the stroke of half-time which seemed to break the visitors' 
              belief.</p>
              <p>It was more one-way traffic after the restart as the Ivory Coast striker netted from close range with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Frank Lampard</span></abbr> then making it four. Drogba's deflected effort and a last-minute strike from Malouda sealed an emphatic win for the champions.</p>
              <p>However, Ancelotti said: "We did our job, nothing special.</p>
              <p>"This team can show this kind of play, scoring a lot of goals. We had a 
              difficult pre-season, but now everything has come back to be OK.</p>
              <p>"We played a good game with a lot of goals and I am happy.</p>
              <p>"We kept a high tempo, but West Brom were in the game until the second 
              goal, and then it was more easy because there was more space."</p>
              <p>Ancelotti added: "Players who were at the <abbr><span class="glossary-term">World Cup</span></abbr> can improve their condition and in two weeks, we will be 100%."</p>

              <p>Blues boss Ancelotti piled pressure on Manchester United by saying his side are good enough to repeat last season's success following Saturday's 6-0 demolition of West Brom.</p>
              <p>He said: "Our aim is to do better if it is possible. "We have started better than last year, showing more confidence, and I think we can do better."</p>
              <p>Next up for Chelsea are games with Wigan, Stoke, West Ham and Blackpool. And Ancelotti insisted his champs can set the early pace and stay top until the end.</p>
              <p>He added: "Last year we started very well, we won the first six games and that was the key to winning the title.</p>
              <p>"We want to do the same this season."</p>
