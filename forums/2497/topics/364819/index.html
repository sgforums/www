              <h1>Thomas Vermaelen completes move to Arsenal</h1>
              <p><img src="http://www.arsenal.com/assets/_files/images/jun_09/gun__1245425430_vermaelen_thomas1.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="250"></p>
              <p><strong>Arsenal Football Club is delighted to announce that Belgian international defender Thomas Vermaelen has joined the Gunners from Dutch Eredivisie side Ajax on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee.</strong><br><br>Vermaelen
              (23), who was the Ajax club captain last season, made his first team
              debut for the Dutch club at just 18, after playing at Youth level for
              Belgian side KFC Germinal Beerschot. During his 143 appearances with
              the Amsterdam side, Thomas, who is predominantly a central defender,
              gained experience in both the UEFA Cup and UEFA Champions League
              including two appearances against Arsenal in the 2005/06 Champions
              League Group Stages. He has made 21 appearances for Belgium, now being
              a regular in his country’s set-up since making his full international
              debut in March 2006.<br><br>During his time with Ajax, the club won the
              Dutch League Championship in 2003/04, with Vermaelen also winning the
              Dutch National Cup on two occasions (in 2006 and 2007) and the Dutch
              Super Cup twice (in 2006 and 2007).<br><br>Manager Arsène Wenger said:
              “Thomas is a great signing for Arsenal Football Club, and we are all
              delighted that he is joining us. Thomas is a solid performer with good
              experience of Champions League and UEFA Cup football and is also a
              regular with the Belgium national team.<br><br>Thomas is primarily a
              left-footed centre back, but he’s multi-functional and can also play at
              left back. He is strong technically with a positive winner’s attitude
              and I have no doubt his arrival will strengthen our team. Thomas Vermaelen will be a huge asset to Arsenal.”<br><br>After
              completing his move to the Gunners, Vermaelen said: “Firstly, I have to
              say that I’m sad to be leaving Ajax and I would just like to thank
              everyone for their help and friendship towards me over the past eight
              years.<br><br>“I’m just so happy to be joining Arsenal. This is a great
              Club with a world class manager, high quality players and a fantastic
              stadium. Everything is set up for Arsenal to be very successful for
              years to come and I joined this Club because I know Arsenal will be
              challenging for trophies.<br><br>“I have had a good taste of the
              Champions League during my time with Ajax and this is something I am
              looking forward to experiencing again with Arsenal. I’m also looking
              forward to playing in the English Premier League, which for me, is the
              best league in the world. Also, I just want to assure the Arsenal fans
              that I will give everything for this Club and I hope we can enjoy
              winning some trophies together next season.”<br><br>Thomas will join up with his new team-mates for pre-season training in early July.</p>

              <p>Only days after signing with <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr>, former Ajax defender Thomas Vermaelen is already eyeing off Cesc Fabregas' captaincy.</p>
              <p>The Belgium international told the <em>Daily Star Sunday</em>: “If the trainer wants me to take responsibility, I will. If he sees I am the right person for it, I will take it.</p>
              <p>“I am very young, this is a big club but I am used to the pressure.</p>
