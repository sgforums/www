              <p>Harry Redknapp fears he will not be able to buy the players he
              requires to sustain Tottenham's Champions League challenge this year
              because he is struggling to move players on to provide the transfer
              funds he needs.</p>
              <p>Redknapp has been linked with Manchester City's Craig Bellamy and AC
              Milan's Klaas-Jan Huntelaar but would need to sell the likes of Robbie
              Keane, David Bentley, Jermaine Jenas and Alan Hutton before he could
              spend.</p>
              <p>Redknapp said: 'We're not going to win the league, not unless we
              improve. But if we get the players I want then we've got a chance. I
              have three players on my list but I would say our chances of getting
              them are slim because it's very difficult to do deals at the moment.'</p>

              <p>At least one opportunity may present itself this week, with 
              James Milner moving to Manchester City for Â£26million, allowing Aston 
              Villa to make a move for Robbie Keane.</p>
              <p>The Tottenham striker was 
              in fine form yesterday, scoring twice as Tottenham beat Fiorentina 3-2 
              in a friendly at White Hart Lane, and Redknapp claimed that his current 
              form meant that he would not be easily parted from the Irishman.</p>
              <p>There
               were two great finishes from Robbie and those are the type of runs and 
              finishing he's been showing all through pre-season,' said Redknapp. 'I 
              don't want to sell him. It's all very well talking of letting players go
               but you have to find some better.'</p>

              </div>
              <p>Redknapp took a similar view of Giovani dos Santos, a target for AC Milan and a possible makeweight in any deal for Huntelaar.</p>
              <p>The
               Mexican was a revelation yesterday and Redknapp said: 'He has 
              outstanding ability and we want to keep him. He now has to show that he 
              can do that consistently.'</p>
              <p>Keane scored his first after a 
              delightful through-ball from Tom Huddlestone. His second came with a 
              minute to go, 20-year-old Jake Livermore providing on this occasion.</p>
              <p>Dos Santos had earlier set up Spurs' first goal by robbing the dawdling
               Gianluca Comotto and dashing goalwards before pulling back for Roman 
              Pavlyuchenko to tap in.</p>
