            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho showed when he declared himself a "special one" on the day he arrived at Chelsea that he does not underestimate his own importance, and he has confirmed that by saying he makes an "enormous contribution"<br><br>"There are managers who, at first sight, earn little but in reality earn too much because they don't produce," he said. "Call me vain, but I produce because there are titles.<br><br>Chelsea were hardly giving away tickets before Mourinho took over but the former Porto coach's success has bred greater income and his considerable personal marketability, including advertisement work.<br><br>Mourinho, whose total annual earnings are estimated at Â£7.5m, told the Portuguese magazine Maxima. "For clubs to pay me and the players well, they have to generate an income.<br><br>A claim by Mourinho in the interview that Chelsea are almost self-sufficient seemed hard to square with the enormous financial underwriting of the club's owner Roman Abramovich and a Â£140m loss for the year ending June 2005.<br><br>Chelsea's chief executive, Peter Kenyon, has said the club hope to break even by 2009-10. "If we took away two or three multimillion-pound signings from the budget, the club would run itself," said Mourinho. That, though, would leave the manager with a squad unlikely to achieve his or Abramovich's ambitions.<br><br>Andriy Shevchenko's signing this summer was part of a plan to lift Chelsea on to a higher level, and the striker is confident he will come good. I am not worried at all at this stage. It is normal that it takes a while for a new player to get used to a new team and a new style of football.<br></div>
