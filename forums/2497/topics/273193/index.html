The Primera Liga champions are also set to clinch the signing of Holland Under 21 international Royston Drenthe, according to the reports. Robben's future has been the subject of intense speculation this summer and it appears a resolution is now close. </strong><br><br>The Dutchman, who has long been a transfer target of Madrid president Ramon Calderon, is thought to have agreed a move to the Bernabeu. However, Chelsea are insisting that they have not received a formal offer for the former PSV Eindhoven man.<br><br>Robben joined Chelsea for Â£12million in 2004 and has scored 19 goals in 104 appearances for The Blues. Real have also been chasing Feyenoord's Drenthe this summer and it is understood an accord has finally been reached between all parties.<br><br>The 20-year-old will reportedly move to Spain for 14million euros (Â£10million) and sign a five-year contract. Robben and Drenthe could be unveiled as Real players at a press conference on Friday.<br><br>Ajax's Wesley Sneijder could complete a trio of Dutchmen moving to Real Madrid this summer. Real coach Bernd Schuster is rumoured to be closing on completing the capture of the Holland international midfielder as well.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something must be wrong at chelsea to let Robben leave... They are letting go probably the only player that they have got that can come on and change the game for them... If anyone deserve the $100 over thousand salary i think its him... Anything less than Shev's transfer fee wouldn't be worth it especially when he is still so young. I think they can sell him in 2, 3 yrs time and they can still get the same fee if not more... Anyway, i will be glad if he really leave chelsea...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
