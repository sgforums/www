              <p><em>The Sun</em> says calls for Anfield legend Kenny Dalglish to step in as an emergency caretaker intensified yesterday.</p>
              <p>Owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett must re- finance the debt they accrued buying <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> so cannot promise a huge transfer kitty for any new boss.</p>
              <p>They believe Birmingham manager McLeish would be the ideal manager to
              get the best out of the current squad and operate within a limited
              budget.</p>
              <p>The Scot has 18 months left on his Brum deal, worth around £800,000 a year.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Liverpool</span></abbr> believe they would have to pay around £1million compensation to get their man now but a lot less if they wait until the summer.</p>

              <p>you need more than better or not bad managers to win you trophies and dominate the EPL. I am sure alex mcleish, mark hughes or keegan are not bad managers, but will that win you the trophy you craved since 1990?</p>
              <p>haven you learnt you lesson that successive managers like first souness, evans, houllier and now rafa, have all failed to win that coveted trophy. although rafa almost won it and finish second, but that is not good enough as nobody will remember runner up or almost won it. people only remmeber winners.</p>
              <p>you need proven winners like wenger, ferguson, mourinho, hiddink etc to win you trophies. whereever they go, they will always be a winner. capello have successs at home in Italy and won 2 titles with RM, so he can also be considered as winners as well.</p>

              <p>Exceeded Board Expectation?! Are u kidding me? What is the board expectation then? To stay in the premier league and avoid relegation? Is that all they ask for - for a club that is of Top 4 quality?</p>
