              <p><strong>LONDON - Britain will enter a team into
              the 2012 Olympic football tournament but it will only include
              English players after a compromise between the Scottish, Welsh,
              Northern Irish and English football associations.</strong></p>
              <p>The plan is expected to be ratified by world governing body
              FIFA at its annual congress next week in the Bahamas although it
              would also have to be rubber-stamped by the British Olympic
              Association (BOA), which has always sought a team open to all
              British players.</p>
              <p>A British team has not competed at the Olympics since
              1960 but the Government is determined to have one at the London
              Games even if it is not representative of all the nations that
              make up the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p>Despite assurances from FIFA president Sepp Blatter that
              their independent status would not be eroded by contributing to
              a British Olympic team for 2012, Scotland, Wales and Northern
              Ireland have remained vehemently opposed to taking part.</p>
              <p>FIFA set a deadline of May 31 for the four nations to come
              to an agreement and the Scottish FA is confident that the
              proposal to have an England team playing under a British banner
              will be approved.</p>
              <p>"FIFA had asked the four associations to find a common
              solution to the issue of a British team," Scottish FA spokesman
              Rob Shorthouse said on Friday.</p>
              <p>"One thing is absolutely clear, we are completely opposed to
              the four home associations coming together to play under a
              unified banner in 2012 or in any other competition. This is a
              view shared by our colleagues in Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p><strong>FIERCELY PROTECTIVE</strong></p>
              <p>"However, we acknowledge the fact that the English FA wish
              to have an involvement in the 2012 Olympic football tournament
              as it is being held in their country.</p>
              <p>"A proposal has therefore gone forward to FIFA which states
              that England will field a team in the 2012 Olympics made up
              exclusively of English players. Scotland, Northern Ireland and
              Wales will not play any part."</p>
              <p>Although the four British football associations are
              recognised as separate entities by FIFA, the International
              Olympic Committee (IOC) recognises Britain only as an entity to
              compete in the Olympics.</p>
              <p>The IOC said on Friday that the selection of players for a
              British team would rest with the BOA.</p>
              <p>"Whether or not Britain has a football team competing at the
              2012 Games is a decision that needs to be worked out between the
              home associations, the British Olympic Association (BOA) and
              FIFA," IOC press office Sandrine Tonge said.</p>
              <p>"We look forward to being informed in due course by FIFA and
              the BOA of the final outcome of their discussions."</p>
              <p>Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are fiercely protective
              of their individual status within FIFA and feel that by allowing
              their players to compete would set a precedent for future
              tournaments and ultimately lead to a British team.</p>
              <p>The BOA is committed to entering a British team at
              the 2012 Games but said no final decision would be made
              until after the FIFA congress.</p>
