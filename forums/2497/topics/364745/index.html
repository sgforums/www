              <h1>EXCLUSIVE: City eye top four as Santa Cruz signs up for £18m</h1>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/06/19/article-0-00B9CD2000000259-916_468x553.jpg" alt="Cruz control: Manchester City have finally landed Blackburn striker" width="468" height="553"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Cruz control: Manchester City have finally landed Blackburn striker</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Manchester City have agreed an £18million deal to sign Roque Santa Cruz from Blackburn as they begin to build a squad to break into the Premier League's top four.</strong></p>
              <p>Manager Mark Hughes will finally be reunited with the striker he wanted to bring with him from Rovers to Eastlands last summer in the first of several blockbuster signings before the end of August.</p>
              <p>Santa Cruz will cost £15m, with the rest of the fee dependant on appearances and team success, but he is likely to have to compete for a place with Carlos Tevez - who is ready to reject Manchester United and Liverpool - and Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o next season.</p>
              <p>City are confident they are making progress in their pursuit of two of the most respected goalscorers playing in Europe - despite Eto'o's exorbitant wage demands of £192,000-a-week after tax - as chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak continues to back Hughes in the transfer market.</p>
              <p>The signing of Santa Cruz, who missed the end of last season with a knee injury, shows that the manager remains in charge of the club's transfer targets.</p>
              <p>Al-Mubarak has admitted his frustration at the perception of City as a club who do not deserve a place at the game's top table. The Cruz deal highlights his reluctance to pay wildly inflated fees, as the initial figure is £5m short of the price Blackburn quoted them in January when their bids were unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>Hughes first signed Santa Cruz for Blackburn from Bayern Munich for £3.8m in 2007 after he had fallen out of favour at the German club. He scored 23 goals for Rovers in his first season but suffered with injury last term after the Welshman had move on.</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong><em>Sky Sports News</em> understands Roque Santa Cruz has edged a step closer to joining Manchester City after passing his medical. </strong></p>
              <p>The 27-year-old underwent a number of tests with the
              club's medical staff, a process lasting a total of four-and-a-half
              hours, with doctors paying considerable attention to the front-man's
              knee which kept him out for sustained periods last term.</p>
              <p>The
              Paraguay international is now expected to travel to the City of
              Manchester Stadium where he is expected to put the finishing touches on
              his contract.</p>
              <p>However, Santa Cruz is not expected to be
              officially unveiled as a City player until some time next week to allow
              for manager Mark Hughes to return from his holiday.</p>

              <p><strong>Roque Santa Cruz has finally renewed his successful working
              relationship with Mark Hughes by becoming the delighted Blues manager's
              second major signing of the summer at the City of Manchester Stadium.</strong></p>
              <p>Hughes
              plucked highly-rated Paraguay striker Santa Cruz from Bayern Munich two
              years ago for Blackburn and he responded by scoring 23 goals in 43
              games in a great debut season for Rovers.</p>
              <p>City's boss was keen
              for Santa Cruz to join his Blues revolution both last summer and in
              January, when the clubs were unable to agree a deal, but now the
              27-year-old centre-forward follows Gareth Barry into the senior squad.</p>
              <p>Roque
              began his professional career in with Olimpia Asuncion in his home
              town, helping them to two championship titles and himself to the
              Paraguayan Footballer of the Year award in 1999.</p>
              <p>His eye-catching
              form earned him a move to Germany and he spent seven years with Bayern,
              making 155 appearances and helping them to three Bundesliga titles, the
              domestic double, and the Champions League in 2001.</p>
              <p>Roque's
              brilliant debut season for Rovers - including a hat-trick in a
              thrilling 5-3 defeat at Wigan - soon convinced other top managers that
              he would make the Premier League grade, but he went to the head of
              Hughes' wish list almost as soon as they had parted company at Ewood
              Park.   </p>
              <p>Roque made his debut for Paraguay as a 17-year-old and
              has gone on to win 60 more caps. He is expected to lead their attack at
              the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and clock up a third appearance in
              the finals.</p>
