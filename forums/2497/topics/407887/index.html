              <p>Santos sources allege that Chelsea approached the Brazilian superkid before he starred for his country against the USA in New York on Tuesday night.</p>
              <p>The English club are expected to contest the allegation. Late Wednesday night, Stamford Bridge executives were unavailable for comment.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">Chelsea have been interested in the 18-year-old all summer - as first revealed by Sportsmail - but have seen at least one bid rejected.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Santos insist they will not do a deal for less than the £29.6million release clause in Neymar’s contract.</p>
              <p>However, transfer go-betweens claim a deal could be completed if the Barclays Premier League champions’ bid tops £20m.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><strong>Having successfully overturned a UEFA transfer embargo last season following the controversial transfer of French attacking midfielder Gael Kakuta from Lens, Chelsea are expected to vigorously deny any wrongdoing.</strong></p>
              <p>When rejecting the opening offer from Chelsea last month, the Brazilian club said: ‘Santos FC received an official offer from Chelsea for the economic rights of Neymar. President Luis Alvaro de Oliveira Ribeiro has sent a response to the English club thanking them for their interest and reiterating the fact that Santos FC have no interest in opening negotiations.’</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">

              </div>
              <p>Neymar has scored 32 goals in 33 games this year and there was an outcry in Brazil when national coach Dunga overlooked him for the World Cup.</p>
              <p>This week, having been called up by new coach Mano Menezes, who has taken over with a commitment to restore the Beautiful Game, Neymar delivered a star-studded performance on his full international debut against the USA , scoring the first goal after 29 minutes.</p>
              <p>He said: ‘Everyone was very comfortable playing together. Mano gave us a lot of freedom to do what we always do on the field and that helped a lot.’</p>
              <p>While Santos continue to insist they will only do a deal if the release clause is met, they took the same position with promising striker Andre, who had a £41m buyout fee written into his contract, only to be sold to Dynamo Kiev for £6.5m in June.</p>

              <p><strong>Chelsea were last night branded ‘unethical’ over their transfer conduct in a bid to sign Brazil striker Neymar. Talks with Santos have collapsed after an initial £17million offer, on July 20, for the exciting 18-year-old was rejected.</strong></p>
              <p>Now Santos are threatening to report Chelsea to FIFA, as revealed in later editions of yesterday’s <span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span>.</p>
              <p>Club president Luis Alvaro de Oliveira Ribeiro said last night: ‘This kind of attitude of the English club is unethical. They made an offer a few weeks ago and we refused it, but the harassment continues. They are still talking with the player behind our back. That’s not right. We are ready to go to FIFA to protect our rights.’ </p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">A report is being prepared by Santos naming at least two Chelsea employees and a well-known British-based transfer negotiator.</p>
              </div>
              <p>There are claims in Brazil that Chelsea held talks with Neymar in New York this week.</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sportsmail</span> understands this meeting was between Neymar’s father and agent Wagner Ribeiro, so no rules were broken.</p>
              <p>Neymar was in the States, making his debut for Brazil and scoring in their 2-0 win over the United States.</p>
              <p>Chelsea will refute any allegations of wrongdoing and are expected to increase their earlier offer, although it will not meet Neymar’s £29.6m buy-out clause.</p>
              <p>Alvaro added: ‘Yesterday there was a telephone call. They (Chelsea) asked for our fax number. That doesn’t mean we opened negotiations. Santos have no interest in negotiating.</p>
              <p>‘The contract between the player and the club provides a clause. Compensation must be paid in the event of no agreement. If the clause is satisfied, we can’t do anything (to keep Neymar).’</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">A Chelsea spokesperson said: ‘We are aware of the claims but we will not comment  on reports of documents we haven’t seen.’ Chelsea are close to landing Neymar’s Brazil team-mate Ramires after the 23-year-old midfielder was granted a work permit.</p>
              </div>
              <p>A fee of £18m has been agreed with Benfica and Ramires is expected to arrive in England today to sign a four-year contract.</p>

              <p>However, Santos insist they will not sell for less than the player's release clause - set at almost £30m - and are upset at Chelsea's conduct.</p>

              <p><strong>Santos heroes Robinho and Pele have been drafted in to talk Neymar out of a move to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazilian sports minister Orlando Silva has also been asked to intervene, while new national team boss Mano Menezes and World Cup winner Mario Zagallo embarrassed the 18-year-old by calling for Neymar to stay in the country as they sat alongside him at a press conference.</p>
              <p>The immensely talented teen has been unsettled by the public attention about his future and responded to Menezes's and Zagallo's comments by admitting: 'I don't know if I will stay or go.</p>
              <p>'There is a lot still left to happen. But I won't leave to be a reserve, it would be better to stay. Of course I'll take into account the advice of Mano and Zagallo - it may be too early to leave.' His words will give Santos hope as they go into a meeting with Neymar's father of the same name, and his agent Wagner Ribeiro in which improved terms will be offered on a contract that already runs till 2014.</p>
              <p>It is understood that the player is reluctant to pass up the chance of going to Chelsea, but getting Manchester City's Robinho and the greatest player of all time to try and persuade him otherwise could make an impact.</p>
              <p>The Barclays Premier League champions had an initial £17million bid rejected, but are ready to return with a £25m offer. Santos, who have threatened to report Chelsea to FIFA over their conduct, insist he won't be sold for less than his near-£30m release clause.</p>
              <p>Zagallo tried to reason that Neymar was not yet ready for the physical English game, where so few Brazilian players have prospered.</p>
              <p>'I think it is very early for a player of 17, 18, or 19 years to leave Brazil,' said Zagallo, who won the World Cup as a player in 1958 and '62, and as manager of the great 1970 team. 'The groundwork has to be done here.</p>
              <p>'It is clear that from a financial point of view players always want to go, but in Neymar's case he would be going to an environment this isn't good for his body type. He needs to put on weight, so it's better to leave when he is 21 or 22.'</p>

              <p><strong>Menezes, who gave Neymar his Brazil debut in the 2-0 win against the United States last week, agrees with his predecessor.</strong></p>
              <p>Alongside Neymar at a publicity event in Sao Paulo, the new Brazil manager said: 'Maybe I more than anyone else wants our players to stay in Brazil. In this case I am very similar to Zagallo.</p>
              <p>'We still haven't found the formula to make our players stay here longer.</p>
              <p>'Of course I have to respect the interests of Neymar, but, thinking about Brazilian football, staying here is beneficial.'</p>
              <p>Agent Ribeiro, speaking ahead of meeting the Santos management, said: 'There are times when (Neymar) says he wants to stay to play the Copa Libertadores (South American championship).</p>
              <p>'But in the game in which he missed a penalty (against Vitoria in the Brazilian Cup final), his father was nearly attacked at the Vila Belmiro (Santos's home stadium). At the time, he came to me and said "let's go". He changes his mind and that's why we need to talk.'</p>
              <p>Santos will argue that Neymar shouldn't be swayed by the riches available at Chelsea, pointing out that Robinho moved from Real Madrid to Manchester City for a great pay day, only for the transfer to damage the forward's career.</p>

              <div class="sp-story">
              <p>Chelsea plan to step up their pursuit of highly-rated Brazilian striker Neymar by tabling a £25 million take-it or-leave-it offer with Santos in the next 24 hours.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Representatives of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich are currently in Brazil attempting to resolve an escalating row over the 18-year-old who recently made his debut for the <em>Selecao</em>.</p>
              <p>Chelsea had a £17 million bid for Neymar rejected last month and are set to follow it up with a £25 million final offer, but that still might not be good enough as Santos are holding out for the £29.6 million buyout clause in his contract.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian giants won't budge from their stance despite Neymar - who has publicly expressed doubts about leaving - privately informing his club that he wishes to join Chelsea.</p>
              <p>According to <em>Soccernet</em> sources close to the deal, the economic rights of the player are owned by investors, who believe that they need to persuade Neymar to sign a new contract because his value has already soared to beyond his buyout price.</p>
              <p>An insider told <em>Soccernet</em>: "There is a big fight still on to convince Santos to part with the player. There is strong pressure on the boy to stay.</p>
              <p>"In the next few days we shall know one way or the other whether a deal with Chelsea can be achieved."</p>
              <p>Chelsea have been caught up in an amazing tug-of-war for Neymar, with Santos threatening to report them to FIFA for tapping up the striker.</p>
              <p>But the source said: "The President of Santos had dinner with agent Pini Zahavi and the people from Chelsea.  How can that be tapping up?</p>
              <p><strong>"The boy was forced to go onto Brazilian TV to say he wants to stay with Santos, when the truth is that he wants to go to Chelsea."</strong></p>

              <p>Cannot like that leh...</p>
              <p>Like that next time all the clubs will hold out for the release clause and chop Chelsea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got a feeling this deal will not go through though, believe Santos will reject the bid. Its all up to Neymar right now.</p>
              <p>And looking all the transfers Chelsea are making, seems like Chelsea is getting more serious into grooming HG talents.</p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Brazil wonderkid Neymar has snubbed a move to Chelsea and agreed to sign a vastly improved contract with Santos.</strong></p>
              <p>The Barclays Premier League champions were prepared to pay £25million and offer the 18-year-old a five-year contract worth £55,000 a week.</p>
              <p>But despite presure from his family and advisers to leave, Neymar felt it was too soon to leave Brazil and was shocked by the counter offer from Santos.</p>
              <p>The Brazilians have effectively tripled his wages to £40,000 a week by doing an image rights deal with sponsors, using the same model that allowed Robinho to join the club on loan from Manchester City.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">They have promised to formulate a similar deal for outstanding 20-year-old playmaker Paulo Henrique Ganso, who has interested Manchester United, Real Madrid and Lyon.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Santos dazzled Neymar and his advisers by promising to not only increase his pay, but also boost his profile by bringing in specialist public relations experts with knowledge of the English, Spanish and Italian markets.</p>
              <p>They have a dream of making him the first player for generations to be recognised as the best player in the world while still playing in Brazil.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><strong>The decision is a blow to Chelsea, who have tracked the supremely skilful forward for two years and thought they would get their man after meeting his father in New York earlier this month.</strong></p>
              <p>It remains to be seen whether Santos will continue with threats to report Chelsea to FIFA for supposedly 'harassing' the player, though the Barclays Premier League champions are confident they broke no rules.</p>
              <p>Santos, who are far from one of the big powers in Brazil football these days, have struck a blow by holding on to one of the country's jewels after years of quality players quickly leaving for Europe.</p>
              <p>Pele, Robinho and new Brazil boss Mano Menezes had all advised Neymar to stay and the teenager said: ‘I’ve taken into account the advice I received, but the decision to stay at the club is mine.</p>
              <p>'It was tough, but I think that God gave me wisdom to decide what was best. I’m very happy here and now I’m just thinking about winning more titles with Santos.’</p>
              <p>Santos president Luis Alvaro de Oliveira Ribeiro said: ‘He has the head of a man, but the body of a boy. He was able to make this tough decision about the coming years of his career’</p>

              <p>Next target already....</p>
              <p>I don't think Chelsea will target Neymar again.</p>
              <p>I believe the reason why Chelsea want to sign him was beucase he is still 18yo, which means he can be "HG" at the club.</p>

Neymar seemed undecided for a period, but he has now told a press conference that he won’t be moving to England yet.<br><br>“The final decision is always that of the player,” he stated. “I talked to my father, my family, and I have decided to stay. I am happy, and that's what I want. I think this decision will help me a lot in my game, because I'm happy. Money alone does not buy happiness.”<br><br>Club president Luis Alvaro de Oliveira was left delighted.<br><br>“The decision of Neymar is not based on a simple comparison of numbers, because otherwise Santos would have lost. This is a much more thoughtful decision, which shows that a child of 18 years is capable of taking the decisions of a mature man,” he said.<br><br>Neymar has already been capped once by Brazil, scoring against the USA on his international debut last week.<br><br></span></div>

              <p>dunno why chelsea, for its riches, go buy robino or pato?</p>
              <p>when kaka is back to full fitness, chelsea can consider buying kaka to take over from lampard in the long term. lampard is already 32 right, whereas kaka is 28, another 2 more years to 30. by the time kaka is 30, lampard is slow and old.</p>

              <p>well depending on tax rates.. 40k over there might just be the same as 55k in england.. but this im not so sure..</p>
              <p>but anyway, i truly believe that he should have stayed, not that i dont think he's an exciting young talent, but because it might ruin his whole career.</p>
