              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Chelsea have had a £22million bid for Valencia winger Juan Mata rejected by the Spanish club. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Roman Abramovich made the offer - £18m up front and £4m to follow - on Wednesday after Andre Villas-Boas identified the 23-year-old, also a target for Tottenham and Arsenal, as the man he wants out wide to help bridge the gap on champions Manchester United.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Valencia are determined not to let Mata go so close to the start of the season in Spain - they play their first match on Saturday - but the player is desperate to leave for Stamford Bridge. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Such is Chelsea’s desire to sign Mata, who was the star of this summer’s Under 21 European Championship, that Abramovich is considering flying to meet Valencia president Manuel Llorente to push through the deal. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>An extra £4m should be enough to force Valencia’s hand, which would be a huge bonus considering there was a buy-out clause of £22m which expired at the end of July.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Mata has been keen on a move to Chelsea all summer and has been promised a pivotal role, a pay rise and Yossi Benayoun’s No 10 shirt by the London club. That should be enough to see off the persistent interest from Arsenal and Tottenham.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Mata scored nine and set up 15 goals for Valencia last season, coming on the back of being part of Spain’s World Cup-winning squad. </span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Chelsea are ready to make an emphatic title statement by  bidding £29million for Valencia winger Juan Mata and upping their offer for Tottenham’s Luka Modric.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Andre Villas-Boas has told Roman Abramovich he needs to inject more flair into his side and the billionaire Chelsea owner is backing his young manager to the tune of £60m.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>So far this summer, Chelsea have watched Manchester City and Manchester United splash more than £50m to breathe fresh life into their teams, and now Abramovich is ready to make his move.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>As revealed by <em>Sportsmail</em>, Chelsea had a £22m bid for Mata rejected by Valencia this week. They will now return to the Spanish club with an offer of £27m, plus £2million in top-up payments.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Mata was the star of this summer’s European Under 21 Championship, and he is believed to be desperate to move to the Premier League. He has also been tracked by Arsenal and Tottenham.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Villas-Boas has also persuaded Abramovich to dig deep in an attempt to wrap up the signing of Tottenham star Modric. Chelsea have previously bid £27m, and Spurs boss Harry Redknapp reluctantly indicated on Wednesday that he might have to sell his star midfielder. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>There is a substantial block to any deal in the shape of Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, who has declared that Modric is not for sale ‘at any price’.</span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Villas-Boas chose his words carefully yesterday when pressed about Modric, saying: ‘The only thing I can say is just that it can happen. I don’t know to what extent we can go regarding his price because we are speaking about a high amount and nothing else, basically. End of story.’</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>He added: ‘Whatever comes from Harry’s mind is his own opinion about the situation. I just have to study the rest of the market and hopefully find a solution for my team. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘It depends on a lot of things. It depends on Chelsea’s decision - if they are willing to go forward or not; up to which value and to decide whether they want to keep the interest in the player. It doesn’t depend on me. It’s not my money! </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘Luka, on this particular occasion, is a young player but there would be for sure a sensible price to pay.’ </span></p>

              </span></p><p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Villas-Boas acknowledged the impact a star signing - such as £38m striker Sergio Aguero at Manchester City - could make to his side. He is optimistic they will deliver at least one big-name player this summer, with a midfielder the priority in light of Michael Essien’s six-month absence after knee surgery.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Villas-Boas said: ‘We are happy with what we have running into the West Brom game. With Essien’s injury, it’s fair to say we might go to the market regarding a midfielder.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘For the first competitive games, bearing in mind the group phase of the Champions League, the start of the Carling Cup, we might just add a number in midfield.’</span></p>

              <p>It's because of the style Chelsea plays that Torres isn't as dangerous as he should be... I still think Lampare playing will always be a disadvantage to him... He needs a midfielder who create for him and not one who wants to go forward and score himself...</p>
              <p>He used to be the "go to guy" at Pool... Now he seems to be the "fetch the ball from the wing guy" at Chelsea... which he will take time to adapt...</p>

              <p>There is a difference, last season Spurs concentrated on CL football, and rested some of the 1st team players in PL matches before &amp; after CL matches, which resulted in losing quite a number of points.</p>
              <p>This season Spurs will concentrate on PL and will play some 2nd string players in the Europa League, therefore I expect them to be better in PL .</p>

              <p><strong>Juan Mata has completed his £26 million move from Valencia to Chelsea and will be available for Saturday's Premier League match against Norwich at Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>Spain international Mata has signed a five-year contract and becomes Chelsea's fourth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Oriol Romeu, Romelu Lukaku and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.</p>
              <p>"Right from the first moment there have been good feelings all around me," Mata told Chelsea's official website. "Training has been great and the players are a great group to train with.</p>
              <p>"Valencia was a big club anyway but I have left to join a bigger club and it is all about the opportunity to win trophies and I have that here."</p>
              <p>Former Real Madrid youngster Mata scored 34 goals in 179 appearances during his four years at the Mestalla.</p>
              <p>The 23-year-old is viewed as one of the hottest prospects in world football after back-to-back summers in which picked up the 2010 World Cup and the European Under-21 Championship title.</p>
