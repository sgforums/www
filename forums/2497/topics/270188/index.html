            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://images.skysports.com/images/playerpics05_06/Premiership/Chelsea/pizarroclaudio.jpg"><br><br><strong>Jose Mourinho insists Claudio Pizarro will be a great success at Chelsea.</strong><br><br>The 28-year-old former Bayern Munich striker trained with his new team-mates for the first time this week and is in line for a debut in Wednesday's friendly against Feyenoord.<br><br>And Mourinho is convinced the Peruvian will be able to adapt quickly to life in the Premier League.<br><br>"He is what you used to call a typical British striker - intelligent and holds the ball well. He is not the kind of selfish striker who only likes to shoot, is good in the air and scores goals," said the Chelsea boss.<br><br>"And I hope I can give him some of my qualities as a coach. I think I can make him better. He is not a young boy but there is always place for an improvement and my competitive and aggressive qualities can make him even better.<br><br>"He has South American qualities but, at the same time, has played in Europe for eight years. Eight years of German football have made him a player with a European touch and that's important.<br><br>"The fact he had played for a long time for Bayern also means he knows how to play in a big team, how to play under pressure, how to play with other very good players and how to win trophies.<br><br>"I'm convinced he will have success here. I always like players with the mentality he has shown.<br><br>"He wanted to make a change in his life. For sure, he could have stayed in German football but he decided to move and I am very happy to have him."<br><br>Pizarro said he is confident he would be able to command a regular place in the Blues starting line-up.<br><br>"I know there is a lot of competition for a place but a club like Chelsea always has lots of games to play, sometimes twice a week, so the manager will probably adopt a rotation policy which will give me opportunities," Pizarro added.<br><br>"Then it is up to me to make it difficult to be left out of the side. I know there are lots of players here of excellent quality but I aim to play well when I get the chance.<br><br>"My eight years in Germany have given me experience of European football so the transition period is not going to be so complicated."<br><br>Meanwhile, Petr Cech says he will be ready to face Feyenoord.<br><br>The keeper came off at half-time against LA Galaxy after hurting his wrist, but has declared himself fit to face the Dutch side.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Is Jose trying to hard?</span></div>
