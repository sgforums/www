When contacted, StarHub declined comment.<br><br>Last month, the cable pay-TV operator announced that it would increase its basic pay-TV subscription fee by $4 from $20 to $24 (without GST).<br><br>It took effect earlier this month.<br><br>From October, sports fans will have to pay $25 a month, up from the current $15, to get their regular dose of sporting action.<br><br>It caused an uproar among the paying public as they protested against the price hike.<br><br>But StarHub explained that the price hike was a consequence of the escalating costs of the broadcast rights.<br><br>StarHub's winning bid was US$80 million ($120m), believed to be four times more than what ESS paid the FA Premier League three years ago.<br><br>With ESS out of the picture, football fans will be asking if they will get to watch the same pre-game and post-game shows such as Here We Go and Final Score hosted by ESS presenter John Dykes.<br><br>It is believed that StarHub will not be buying the content that ESS produces for its EPL coverage.<br><br>According to the source, StarHub is in talks with another broadcast network company to screen the EPL matches.<br><br>In the past, ESS was able to bring in former Premiership footballers such as Ian Rush, Bryan Robson and John Barnes as guest pundits.<br><br>It is not sure if the new broadcast network company will be doing the same.<br><br>But one thing the subscribers can expect is that the quality of the matches on television will not be compromised.<br><br>That is because StarHub receives the feed from TWI, the sport production arm of IMG Media - the same company which ESS previously worked with.<br><br>TWI's deal with the FA Premier League offers international licensees all 380 matches each season live via satellite.<br><br>It also covers a weekly highlights show, a midweek magazine and a preview programme on Friday nights.<br><br>It is not sure if StarHub's deal with TWI covers the above-mentioned.<br><br><strong>PRICE HIKE</strong><br><br>In response to media queries, Thomas Ee, StarHub's senior vice-president of cable, fixed and Internet Protocol Services, said last month that his company will do its best to make sure that subscribers are not short-changed as a result of the price hike.<br><br>He said: 'We would like to assure our customers that StarHub remains committed to presenting the best and most comprehensive sports coverage, and we will always strive to do so in value-for-money packages.<br><br>'We will be introducing new promotional packages and discounts for our sports customers in the near future.'<br><br>Ken Yong, 32, a Manchester United fan, hopes that StarHub will provide comprehensive coverage of the EPL this season.<br><br>He said: 'I think I'm right to say that football fans in Singapore are used to ESS's coverage of the EPL.<br><br>'We are used to seeing John Dykes' face and his team of guest analysts.<br><br>'I just hope that whatever StarHub comes up with, it will be as good, if not better.'<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/sports/story/0,4136,136710,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/sports/story/0,4136,136710,00.html?</a></span><br></div>
