              <p><strong>Michael Essien is ready to sacrifice his all-action style in order to do another shackling job on Liverpool's Steven Gerrard when Chelsea look to reach the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday night.</strong></p>
              <p>A superb performance by the Blues at Anfield earned them a 3-1 first-leg lead and Essien's man-marking job on Gerrard was among the chief reasons why Chelsea ran out comfortable winners.</p>
              <p>Liverpool must score at least three goals at Stamford Bridge to stand any chance of turning the tie in their favour but the Ghana international is ready to stifle Gerrard once more if coach Guus Hiddink asks him.</p>
              <p>Essien was rested for Chelsea's 4-3 Barclays Premier League win over Bolton on Saturday but he will return to the line-up as Hiddink's side look for a place in the last four. He has spent much of the season on the sidelines following a knee ligament injury sustained on international duty but he returned to score a vital goal as Chelsea earned a crucial 2-2 draw to see off Juventus in the last round.</p>
              <p>"Everybody said I must have been very happy with the goal, but for me, it is all about the team work," said Essien. "We did a good job in Turin and it was a very positive result, so that is what is most important. I don't play for myself, I play for the team.</p>
              <p>"I'd describe myself as a box-to-box midfielder, but I'll always respect the manager's decision, wherever I'm picked to play. "Against Juventus it was a tactical move to put me on the right to try to stop the runs of Pavel Nedved.</p>
              <p>"I always listen to the manager and I just go onto the field for every game and do what he asks me to do. So I don't really mind where I play as long as I'm out there doing a job for the team and the manager."</p>
              <p>The arrival of Hiddink as interim coach has transformed Chelsea's fortunes. The side appeared to be struggling to cope under former boss Luiz Felipe Scolari but the Dutchman has made a massive difference.</p>
              <p>Hiddink insists that he will walk away from Chelsea at the end of the season and return to coaching Russia on a full-time basis but Essien says the team are desperate to send him on his way with a trophy.</p>
              <p>"He knows how to talk to his players and he has his own style which is very different to the others I've played for here," revealed Essien.</p>
              <p>"Hopefully we can win something for him before he leaves. But we'll see what happens, We've got some really big games coming up that aren't going to be easy.</p>
              <p>"We'll just have to try our best and make sure we win those games."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, captain John Terry, suspended for the return leg, has warned his team-mates about becoming complacent against Rafael Benitez's Reds.</p>
              <p>Chelsea were 4-0 up with 20 minutes remaining against Bolton but then conceded three goals in nine amazing minutes to provide them with a timely wake-up call.</p>
              <p>"Let's get something straight," declared Terry. "Liverpool won the Champions League by coming back from three goals down at half-time in the 2005 final, so there must be no complacency.</p>
              <p>"It was a fantastic performance by us at Anfield to score three away goals but it hasn't won us the tie. We have to give another similar performance next Tuesday to do that."</p>

              <p>I think liverpool might just give up on the CL to concentrate on the league.</p>

              <p>No point taking risks and going all out in the CL as it is not even the semi finals or finals.  If they lose Torres, Gerrard or Alonso through injury, then they can jolly well kiss all competitions goodbye.</p>

              <p>Gerrard was nursing an injury I think.  Plus after going 2-0 up against blackburn, there was no need for him to come on anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suspect that once Liverpool go down by one goal, they might just release the pedal and opt for safety.  No point getting an injury trying to overcome the huge deficit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As it is, Chelsea will likely also hold back if they get a goal since they still have the league to play for and they know they have already booked a place in the CL semis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If Liverpool can go 2-0 up by half time, then they might still consider pushing.  Anything less than that, they might as well let it go.  Should see a fast paced first half and then depending on the half time scoreline, both teams will do their math and play accordingly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <h1>Stevie G must break loose: Liverpool's inspiration has to rule over Essien</h1>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez will be praying skipper Steven Gerrard can be fit in time if his side are to have any chance of making an unlikely Champions League comeback at Stamford Bridge</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1169794" rel="1169794|3| nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1169794/Stevie-G-break-loose-Liverpools-inspiration-rule-Essien.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>When it comes to delivering his final address to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool's</strong></span></a><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>players at </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Stamford Bridge</strong></span></a><strong> on Tuesday evening, Rafa Benitez is unlikely to be struggling for inspiration. His team might need to score at least three goals in the second leg of this Champions League quarter-final but he could point to the three Bolton scored in a 10th of the time last weekend. If Gary Megson's lesser beings can do it in nine minutes, why can't Liverpool in 90?</strong></p>
              <p>The Anfield manager could also point to the three goals they needed to score in the second half of that extraordinary 2005 Champions League final against AC Milan in Istanbul, or the fact that John Terry will be missing from the Chelsea side tonight.</p>
              <p>Then there are the four goals Liverpool scored at Blackburn or Benitez might wish to remind his team of their 1-0 victory at Stamford Bridge this season, which ended Chelsea's 86-game unbeaten run in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>Benitez might also argue that not only does the referee appear to be on their side but he would also seem to have it in for Guus Hiddink and some of his players.</p>
              <p>For the purpose of his team talk, Benitez could ignore Luis Medina Cantalejo's fine record and refer instead to his Spanish passport, the red card he once gave Deco and the penalty he awarded to Italy against Hiddink's Australia in the last World Cup.</p>
              <p>Never mind how terrific the referee was when Manchester United played Inter Milan at the San Siro in February, the Liverpool manager could introduce him to his players tonight as their 12th man.</p>
              <p>But Benitez might need to come up with something better than that, even if a 12th man could come in handy given the manner of their defeat by Chelsea last week.</p>
              <p>The key to this evening for the visitors is coming up with answers to the problems Chelsea posed them last week - in particular the number they did on Steven Gerrard, the main supply line to Torres.</p>
              <p>So effective was Michael Essien last week that Liverpool's captain passed to the Spain striker only twice. Benitez last night pointed to the goals Gerrard scored against Aston Villa and Everton when they man-marked him and said: 'It's not the system, it's about doing things properly.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/13/article-0-04671F2F000005DC-26_306x398.jpg" alt="Fernando Torres " width="306" height="398">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Fernando Torres will need to carry on his recent goalscoring form into Tuesday's clash if Liverpool are to have a chance of clinching a semi-final berth</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>But the system Hiddink employed at Anfield last week did work, and not only because Gerrard, looking sprightly in training at Stamford Bridge, was hit by 'The Train'. It was also the way in which Frank Lampard and Michael Ballack dominated midfield; Liverpool's failure to defend at set-pieces and the difficulties they experienced - Martin Skrtel in particular - dealing with Didier Drogba.</strong></p>
              <p>This is a tough one for Benitez, not least because Chelsea did to Liverpool what they themselves had been doing to the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester United and Villa prior to the quarter-final.</p>
              <p>The return of Javier Mascherano could be significant when it comes to the influence Lampard and Ballack, as well as Florent Malouda and Salomon Kalou, can exert. Mascherano can be a destructive, ubiquitous presence and a player who can thrive in such contests when he stays on the right side of the referee.</p>
              <p>But, even if he does prove effective in nullifying the threat of Chelsea's front line, Liverpool still have to score goals and Benitez was not terribly convincing last night. 'If any team can do it, we can,' he said after listening to Pepe Reina describe it as an 'almost impossible task'.</p>
              <p>The pressure essentially off, Benitez did seem relaxed. He spoke of how important it was for Liverpool to score the first goal, and so put some pressure on Chelsea, and he cracked a joke as well as a smile when someone dared mention 'Sir Alex'. 'Which Alex?' he asked.</p>
              <p>Two hours earlier, it had been a calm, confident Hiddink who appeared before the media. The Chelsea manager has been here so many times before. This, after all, is the guy who guided South Korea to the last four of a World Cup and Holland to the same stage four years prior to that; a guy who not only won the European Cup but reached the semi-finals on his return to PSV Eindhoven almost two decades later.</p>
              <p>History is on Hiddink's side, and not just his own. Of the 25 teams who have won away in the first leg of a Champions League tie, 24 have progressed to the next round. But Hiddink has something else - the respect of a Chelsea dressing room who do not seem to mind he is with them for only a few months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/04/13/article-0-045C9FAB000005DC-416_468x486.jpg" alt="Drogba" width="468" height="486"></div>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>After Drogba put Chelsea three up on the night at Anfield Liverpool know whatever way they look at it they have a mountain to climb to stay in the competition.</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last night Hiddink played down the importance of his role. 'I'm the intermediate person who tries to make plans and challenge them to get there,' he said. 'Knowing that I'm leaving, it must not be a negative motivation to do what they'd like to do. Even though I'm not here next year, they have to respond.'</p>
              <p>At Anfield they most certainly did, and now it is down to Benitez to respond to that.</p>

              <p>Ok, I jus cant see Pool mounting a comeback tonight. 3-1 down is really bad and they must attack from the 1st minute; which will leave space for Blues to counter-attack.</p>

              <p>Gerrard was nursing an injury I think.  Plus after going 2-0 up against blackburn, there was no need for him to come on anymore. </p>
              <p>I suspect that once Liverpool go down by one goal, they might just release the pedal and opt for safety.  No point getting an injury trying to overcome the huge deficit. </p>
              <p>As it is, Chelsea will likely also hold back if they get a goal since they still have the league to play for and they know they have already booked a place in the CL semis. </p>
              <p>If Liverpool can go 2-0 up by half time, then they might still consider pushing.  Anything less than that, they might as well let it go.  Should see a fast paced first half and then depending on the half time scoreline, both teams will do their math and play accordingly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Precisely, they were ready to rest him for that match from the start so as to keep him fresh for this... That how important Rafa view this match against Chelsea... But had things gone wrong for them with Blackburn, I believe Gerrard would had come on...</p>
              <p>In my opinion, Gerrard isn't injure at all, he lasted the whole match in the first leg did he not? and he didn't seem to be injured at the end of it too... The reason could be Rafa wanted to give him a rest over the weekend just like Chelsea gave Essien a rest too against Bolton... Only Chelsea didn't claim Essien was injured or a 50 / 50 chance of playing...</p>
              <p>Liverpool need to score 3 goals... Even if Chelsea take a 1 goal lead into half time, it doesn't make it any different... Pool still only need to score 3 to stay alive... I don't believe they will ease off until Chelsea score 2. As by then, Pool will need to score 5 which will be too tall an order... As for the Gerrard's injury news, I guess its just some smoke screen created to put Chelsea off... But I don't think anyone is buying it though...</p>
              <p>This match is still not over given that Chelsea have let in 3 against Bolton it has given Pool some encouragement I guess... But like I said, 2 goals to Chelsea and even 90 mins won't be enough to save them...</p>
              <p>But I hope this match will not die off too early, I hope it will be kept interesting right to the end...</p>

              <p><strong>Rafael Benítez believes that it could be Liverpool’s destiny to pull off an extraordinary Champions League comeback against Chelsea in the week the club commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool must overturn a 3-1 deficit in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final at Stamford Bridge this evening if they are to progress to the last four for the fourth time in five seasons.</p>
              <p>A service in remembrance of the 96 Liverpool fans who lost their lives in Britain’s worst stadium disaster on April 15, 1989 will be held at Anfield tomorrow, with Benítez hoping that his players can pay their own special tribute by overcoming Chelsea, even though the odds are stacked firmly against his team.</p>
              <p>“It could be destiny [that Liverpool go through], but I don’t want to play on this too much,” the Liverpool manager said. “For some players, like [Steven] Gerrard and [Jamie] Carragher, it will be an extra motivation, but for the majority it will be a very important game and then they will be thinking about the day afterwards.”</p>
              <p>Fernando Torres believes that the Liverpool players will be doubly determined to beat Chelsea to honour the families of the Hillsborough victims. “It makes Tuesday all the more important,” the striker said. “We have to try to do it for the families and the 96.”</p>
              <p>Benítez is hopeful that Gerrard can play after the captain missed the 4-0 win at home to Blackburn Rovers on Saturday with the groin strain he sustained in the first leg against Chelsea. Gerrard, is desperate to play, with Benítez indicating that he was prepared to take a “calculated risk” with the midfield player, even though he is concerned about aggravating the injury. “If he’s available, I’d like to play him from the beginning,” Benítez said.</p>
              <p>The Spaniard has taken heart from seeing Bolton Wanderers score three times in eight minutes at Stamford Bridge on Saturday and believes that an early goal could be crucial to his team’s chances of progressing, especially with John Terry, the Chelsea captain, suspended. “An early goal could change the complexion of the tie,” Benítez said. “When you concede three goals in a few minutes you are a little bit nervous. It’s a good example that if we can score, then it can put Chelsea under a little bit of pressure.”</p>
              <p>“It could be fantastic to get through for everyone at the club and the families, but I don’t want to mix both things. We know the odds are against us, but it could be an extra motivation for our players to do well.”</p>

              <p>And goalkeeper Pepe Reina is in confident mood - he has vowed that the Reds will find Chelsea's weak points and exploit them. "If there is anyone who can turn this around, it is Liverpool," the 26-year-old said. "We have hope."</p>
