              <h2><img src="http://i.media.goal.com/g/17906_news.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="131"></h2>
              <h2>Wuhan Guanggu have left the China Super League (CSL) in protest,
              after their key player, Li Weifeng, was slapped with an eight-match ban.</h2>
              <p>The Wuhan-based outfit have sensationally withdrawn from the CSL,
              after the China Football Association (CFA) handed down a 8,000 yuan
              (US$1,200) fine and an eight-match suspension to Li Weifeng.</p>
              <p>Li, the former China captain, who also played for his country in
              August’s Olympic Games in Beijing, was involved with a brawl with
              Beijing Guoan player Lu Jiang in a CSL match played on September 28.</p>
              <p>The match ended in a 1-1 raw.</p>
              <p>According to reports in China and Hong Kong, the Wuhan management
              was incensed by the eight-match ban on Li, as the club had splashed the
              cash to sign him.</p>
              <p>"We made the decision because we must maintain the club's pride and
              be responsible for China's soccer and fans," said a statement released
              by Wuhan, which was reported on China Daily.</p>
              <p>"We hope that by pulling out of the league, people involved in
              soccer will become aware of the problems and help develop the sport."</p>
              <p>Guanggu have been battling relegation this season, remaining rooted
              at the foot of the CSL with two wins, six draws and 10 losses from 18
              games.</p>
              <p>Li’s suspension meant that the ex-Shanghai Shenghua</p>
              <p>With the club withdrawing from the CSL, all Wuhan matches will be
              turned into 3-0 losses.  According to the CFA, a meeting was held with
              the other 15 CSL teams, and all parties to agree to ban Wuhan from the
              league. In addition, the club will be fined 300,000 yuan (US$44,000)</p>
              <p>"We were trying to communicate with the club and hoped it would come
              back to the league," Nan Yong, vice president of the CFA, was quoted as
              saying by China Daily.</p>
              <p>"But all the negotiations failed and we are sorry (for the result)."</p>
              <p>This incident has also sparked a protest in the city of Wuhan, with
              Hong Kong newspapers reporting fans marching in protest at Li’s
              eight-match ban.</p>
              <p><strong>Protest</strong></p>
              <p>A Wuhan official added they will be pursuing legal action against
              the CFA. Wuhan chairman Shen Liefeng is adamant the club will not
              accept the CFA’s decision.</p>
              <p>“It is like pouring oil on flames," Shen told China Daily.</p>
              <p>"We will definitely seek legal action. We aim to show that the CFA's ban on Li Weifeng was incorrect."</p>
              <p>"Meantime, we will consult with lawyers about the possibility of suing the CFA,” he said.</p>
              <p>“The CFA has the right to ban us and we also have the right to
              appeal. We do not accept the fine and will not give one cent to the
              CFA."</p>
              <p>Chinese football has been under severe criticism by the local media
              in recent times, with the professional league suffering from the lack
              of sponsorship, amidst talk of corruption and lack of professionalism.</p>
              <p>In international tournaments, China have also underperformed,
              leading to fans calling for a change in the administration of the CFA.</p>
