              <p>We love wacky football news. So here’s some very wacky football
              news: There are currently 92 South Korean soccer players being indicted
              for <a href="http://machochip.com/2008/02/south-korean-soccer-players-ha.php">dislocating their own shoulders</a>,
              including 15 professionals from the K-League. That wacky enough for
              you? The big question is: Why? What drives a footballer - especially a
              professional footballer who theoretically benefits from staying injury
              free - to forcibly remove their arm from their shoulder socket. Surely
              that would hurt?</p>
              <p>Indeed it does, but apparently it doesn’t hurt as much as doing up
              to 24 months national service in the South Korean military. That’s a
              long time to be in the army when you’d rather be playing football,
              especially if you’ve made it as far as the K-League. Spending two years
              out of action is long enough for your teammates, manager and fans to
              forget about you altogether and move on. Just ask Harry Kewell. So
              dislocated shoulder and medical military exemption it is then. But this
              raises another question: How?</p>
              <p>How do you deliberately dislocate your shoulder? OK kids, before
              reading this next bit you have to put hand on heart and promise not to
              try this at home. Promise?</p>
              <p>According to <a href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,-7279521,00.html">Reuters</a>:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The players, including 15 professional K-League players,
              dislocated their shoulders by methods such as swinging their arms while
              holding heavy weights or having fellow players jump on their shoulders.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Ouch! These guys either really want to stay out of the military or
              they really really love their football. It’s all backfired though, and
              if any of the 92 players are found guilty they face jail, community
              service or possibly the dreaded military service. But all this has
              probably provided Alex Ferguson with a few fresh ideas. If Fergie pulls
              any Man Utd players out of Fabio Capello’s first England squad with a
              mysteriously acquired dislocated shoulder instead of the usual
              “hamstring strain,” then we’ll all know where he got it from.</p>

              I am sure if the Singapore National Service has the same rule where you can skip the army if you dislocated your shoulder, i am sure some Singaporeans will do that as well.
              
              or maybe this rule only applies for footballers?
