              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Chelsea manager Avram Grant has
              risked the wrath of the Football Association by questioning the
              integrity of referee Steve Bennett.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Bennett was in charge of
              Manchester United's last match of the season at Wigan on Sunday where
              goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Ryan Giggs clinched a 10th Premier
              League title for Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
              <p>But the official came under fire for failing to award Wigan a
              penalty and then opting not to send off midfielder Paul Scholes for a
              second foul on Wilson Palacios.</p>
              <p>Although the Chelsea boss continued to congratulate United on
              their title success, he called Bennett's integrity into question and
              said he was happy no English referee would be in charge of next week's
              Champions League final against Ferguson's side.</p>
              <p>"I can say that after the game we won against Manchester United
              to get level on points, we knew that they had to play West Ham at home
              and Wigan away and that it was not in our hands," said Grant.</p>
              <p>"I told you that I believed in the tradition of the fair
              English game. I will not say anything against it. But what happened is
              what I expected.</p>
              <p>"In England there are very good referees, but there are some - a few that you can influence, like you saw.</p>
              <p>"I think in our game against Manchester United at Old Trafford,
              the referee (Mike Dean) influenced the result for sure. We know that.</p>
              <p>"I think the red card for Mikel John Obi in that game should
              not have been a red card, I think that Paul Scholes should have had a
              red card on Sunday and Wigan a penalty also. But it is finished. I
              congratulate Manchester United."</p>
              <p>But when asked if he was pleased an English referee would not
              be in charge of the final in Moscow, Grant replied: "I can say it like
              this, 'Yes'."</p>

              <p>Isn't he a bit slow? Game over so many days liao now then start to complain? Another of his attempted mind games for the CL referee i guess... But i think he may have chew off more then he wanted... Heard the FA will now study Grant's comments before deciding whether to take disciplinary action against him... lol</p>
              <p>How can he compare that to Rooney's... Rooney was clearly brought down infront of the ref. This ball was more to Rio's shoulder than his arm... Steve McMahon said it wasn't, Even Wigan's players wasn't protesting for it... and when not sure, should not give simple as that... Anyway, he got lucky when that referee give his team that penalty at the Bridge or they wouldn't even be playing to the last day....</p>

              <h1>Fergie Accuses Grant Of Gamesmanship</h1>
              <h2>Sir Alex Ferguson insists that Avram Grant's claims that Manchester
              United benefit from favourable refereeing is just a cheap ploy to
              unsettle his side and the match officials ahead of the Champions League
              final in Moscow next week.</h2>
              <p>The Chelsea boss launched a tirade against Wigan referee Steve Bennett
              for blundering a couple of key decisions that could potentially have
              changed the outcome of the championship race, saying this was
              symptomatic of the type of breaks that United have allegedly been
              receiving from match officials all season.<br><br>"I've been expecting it," commented Sir Alex.<br><br>"I don't think it's about last Saturday, I think it's about next Wednesday and maybe even next season.<br><br>"I
              could go on and on about decisions because they're all debatable at the
              end of the day, we feel we didn't get a lot of decisions this season.<br><br>"Maybe
              when we went to Chelsea we should have been champions before it, but
              with the season over we can put it on the backburner and now it's about
              next Wednesday and I think that's why Avram's talking that way."<br><br>The
              two English giants will go head-to-head next Wednesday in the Champions
              League final after tussling to the wire for the Premier League crown,
              which United secured with a final-day win at Wigan.</p>
