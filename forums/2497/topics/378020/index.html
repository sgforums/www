              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Barcelona are increasingly confident of signing Cesc Fabregas next summer - despite the midfielder's insistence that he is 100 per cent committed to </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></p>
              <p>The European champions outgoing president Joan Laporta has reportedly got the approval to complete a deal for the Spain star from every serious candidate for his job.</p>
              <p>Laporta is said to want a deal a place before he leaves so that the Fabregas signing does not become an election issue.</p>

              <p><strong>Former Barca director Sandro Rossell, seen as an enemy of Laporta, has strengthened his campaign to be the next president and is expected to stand on a pledge to re-sign Fabregas, whose transfer to Arsenal as a 16-year-old was opposed by the businessman.</strong></p>
              <p>Catalan newspaper <span style="font-style: italic;">Sport</span>, which has a close relationship with Barcelona insiders, today declares the 22-year-old Emirates star will be the star signing of 2010 and reports that Arsene Wenger has already accepted the fact.</p>
              <p>Laporta was prepared to pay in excess of £20million for the Gunners star in the summer but the Spanish paper claims Wenger felt he could not do a deal so soon after selling Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Toure to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Fabregas put in an inspired performance at the weekend following Barca star Xavi's call for his compatriot to join the Nou Camp club.</p>
              <p>A goal and four assists in the 6-2 defeat of <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/blackburn-rovers.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Blackburn </span></a>included a very public display of badge-kissing, but <span style="font-style: italic;">Sport </span>explains away the act and subsequent comments as being because he wants to leave honourably rather as part of a drawn out transfer saga.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">In a weekend interview in Spain, Fabregas insisted he was not thinking about Barcelona and Real Madrid, but merely about 'lifting trophies with Arsenal'.</p>
              </div>
              <p>If a drought dating to the 2005 FA Cup continues at Arsenal, he may reconsider his position.</p>
              <p>He further excited the local press with comments about Barca head coach Pep Guardiola. Asked who his idol was, Fabregas said: 'My reference has always been Guardiola. As a child I saw all his games.'</p>

              <p><strong>Cesc Fabregas has refused to answer questions about his future amid renewed Spanish press reports that Barcelona intend to sign him at the end of the season.</strong></p>
              <p>Leading sports paper <span style="font-style: italic;">El Mundo Deportivo </span>says the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Arsenal </span></a>captain and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester City </span></a>star Robinho are Barca's top two targets for 2010, building on reports in the Catalan press on Tuesday that the club were increasingly confident of capturing Fabregas.</p>
              <p>The 22-year-old midfielder batted away questions from journalists in Madrid, where he has joined his national team ahead of Saturday's World Cup qualifier in Armenia and next Wednesday's tie in Bosnia.</p>

              <p><strong>After scoring and kissing his badge during Arsenal's 6-2 victory over Blackburn at the weekend, Fabregas insisted his commitment to Arsene Wenger's team should not be questioned.</strong></p>
              <p>And he would not be tricked into saying anything embarrassing at Madrid's Ciudad Deportiva de Las Rozas training ground, no matter how many times or ways the reporters asked.</p>
              <p>'Now I can't even talk about Barca,' he said. 'We are in the middle of the season, I have a contract with Arsenal and I must complete that for my current team.</p>
              <p>'Everything just started and I think only about the best for Arsenal. When the time comes we'll talk about the future.'</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic;">El Mundo Deportivo </span>says an agreement has been reached with Fabregas's agent and a transfer next summer is only subject to a fee being agreed with Arsenal.</p>
              <p>The murmurs in Spain are that Arsene Wenger could not block the path of his star's return to Barcelona, where he trained as a youth, if Arsenal again finish the season without a trophy.</p>
              <p>Barca president Joan Laporta, who cannot stand for re-election in the summer, is apparently keen to tie up the deal before the end of the tenure, so that it does not become an election issue.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">The businessman knows that Sandro Rossell, his former deputy who quit after a disagreement, will claim to be best placed to capture Fabregas in the summer, but Laporta would prefer a successor from within the club.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The re-emergance of Robinho as a target comes at a time when the Brazilian's future at Eastlands has been brought into question.</p>
              <p>City boss Mark Hughes deployed Craig Bellamy on the left against West Ham United on Monday night and sees the Wales international as a key player among his many strikers.</p>
              <p>Barca made enquiries about adding 25-year-old Robinho to Pep Guardiola's squad towards the end of the summer transfer window. A frantic search for a left-sided player that went unresolved.</p>

              All these are empty talk.
              
              Barcelona already has the best midfield combo in the world in Xavi and Iniesta. Fabregas cannot even get into the Spain midfield because those 2 dominate the play so much.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>when laporta came into power fabregas just got poached away right..and i remember reading somewhere that the previous president told laporta that the best player in our youth team has just signed for arsenal or something like that..and fabregas being a homebred catalan, its definitely more then just his footballing ability cause frankly speaking, the barcelona team is already loaded with playmakers..</p></div>

              <p>Actually i think that Barcelona is more interested in showing Real Madrid that they are not the only club in Spain that can spend a lot of money to get good players.</p>
              <p>Whether Barcelona needs those players or not is irrelevant.</p>
