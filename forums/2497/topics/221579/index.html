            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Wenger rues Henry booking </strong></span><br><br>Arsenal must travel to porto for the final group match without their captain after Thierry Henry received an unnecessary caution for dissent last night.<br>The Frenchman had already rued the booking that had followed the annulment of his equalising goal in Moscow, Arsenal's last away match, but its cost continues to bite: last night's second yellow card will result in a one-match ban. Although CSKA Moscow's slip at home to Porto makes Arsenal the favourites to top Group G, the fixture in Portugal is far from insignificant to their hopes of making progress.<br><br>"It's a blow because we wanted Thierry in Porto," said ArsÃ¨ne Wenger of Henry's booking last night. "We will have to do it without him. We want to win so much that I am confident we'll make it. I could see Thierry was frustrated. He was held back by his shirt being pulled on quite a few occasions. "<br>Wenger noted that conspiracists will already have made up their minds about the final match in the group. "If it finishes as a draw, no one is disappointed," he said, with a smile.<br><br></div>
