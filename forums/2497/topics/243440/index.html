Lamps has been linked to Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus and can buy out his contract at the end of the season. None of those are options as far as Lampard is concerned because he is happy to remain at the Bridge.</strong><br><br>In an exclusive interview, Lamps lifted the lid on what has really been going on. Â“I want to stay at Chelsea. I have never wanted to leave the club and I donÂ’t intend to. I have everything I want in life where I am right now. Â“For the past six years my life has been my family and Chelsea football club. Some players can say that and it sounds cliched or fake. Â“I can say it because it is absolutely true. I am very proud I play for Chelsea and of what I have achieved as part of the team. Â“I am very close to my family who play a big part in my life and my fiancee Elen and I are expecting our second child this summer.<br><br>Â“We love living in the Chelsea area and bringing our young family up here. People seem to think I want to leave but why would I? Â“I value my relationship with the supporters very highly and they have become part of my football family.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have the belief that both lampard and terry wants to stay in london.<br><br>they are just angry that sheva and ballack are being paid 130k.<br><br>sounds familiar?<br><br>it happens in your office too.<br><br>knn, why his salary so high?<span class="small"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually they should be happy with what they have got or are about to get, $100 - $120 thousand per week and not compare to sheva and ballack... Those two were brought in in different circumstances... Ballack came as a free player without a transfer fee... Shev... well, he is the owner's pet so they should realise this and not ask for the moon...<br><br>Terry's demands were totally out of order, wanting a 9 yrs contract when he is already 26 coming to 27... and also wanting to be the highest paid player at chelsea during these 9 years... He has to ask himself if he can still play at the top level in 5 yrs time? Most top clubs defenders normally don't last past 31-32 yrs of age... Look at Sol Cambell, he was such a good defender, I would say even better than Terry is today when he was at 26, 27... But he has slow down quite a bit now that he is 33... Maybe the demands at a top club could be too much for him but at a smaller club, he is still doing ok with lesser games and pressure.<br><br>Terry and Lampard should realise that can they still do it outside of England? If they go to a new club, a new country, a new style of football... They won't be love by the fans anymore and they won't have that kind of influence like they currently enjoy at chelsea.<br><br>Most people belief that Lampare could still adapt given time but Terry's style is more suitable to the EPL. So Terry should just forget about asking for too much and accept the 5 yrs offer chelsea has offered him, tho currently chelsea has re-draw their offer due to his demands.</div>

As compared players like Terry, Lampard and Drogba have the right to ask for me considering their much more massive contribution to the team and to the club.<br><br>No reason why somebody contributing more to the club should be paid less than someone who's adding less to the value and achievements of the club.<br><br>Besides, if Terry and Lampard are happy where they are, be it in terms of football or social lifestyle, why the need to change?<br><br>Things might be different if Mourinho left and a new manager came in, but then again, won't it be so for any club?</div>
