              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>REAL MADRID have invited ridicule by claiming Chelsea target Robinho is worth MORE than £48million. The Blues are interested in the Brazilian ace but only rate the forward at £18m. Yet, the Spanish giants now insist Robinho is worth upwards of £50m — a fee that would shatter the world-record sum they paid for Zinedine Zidane.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Brazil international is unsettled at the Bernabeu after being linked with a move to the Premier League. President Ramon Calderon said: “There is nothing new about Robinho. “He is not upset with Real Madrid. He has told us that he is happy to continue with us. “We are going to give him the affection that he deserves because it has been suggested that on occasion he felt he has not had it. “I think that he is worth more than 60m euros, there are few players like him.”</p>
              <p class="article">Calderon also revealed they are waiting to hear back from Manchester United on the future of Cristiano Ronaldo. He added: “It is not a matter for Real Madrid but for Manchester United and the player. "If he wants to go, then we will be alert as long as it’s for a reasonable price.”</p>

              <p><strong>Robinho is worth more than £47.5m - Calderon</strong></p>
              <p><strong><a class="image" title="Ramón Calderón in Oviedo" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Image:Ram%C3%B3n_Calder%C3%B3n.jpg"><img class="thumbimage" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Ram%C3%B3n_Calder%C3%B3n.jpg/290px-Ram%C3%B3n_Calder%C3%B3n.jpg" border="0" alt="Ramón Calderón in Oviedo" width="290" height="218"></a></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon has claimed Brazil international Robinho is worth more than the £47.5million price tag placed on him by the media. There have been reports Chelsea have offered that amount for the 24-year-old forward, although the Premier League club have denied the suggestion.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It has also been mooted Robinho could be included in a deal to try to bring Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo to the Bernabeu. But when quizzed about the player's situation and the supposed big-money offer for his services, Calderon said: 'There is nothing new about Robinho.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'He is not upset with Real Madrid. He has told us that he is happy to continue with us. 'We are going to give him the affection that he deserves because it has been suggested that on occasion he felt he has not had it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I think that he is worth more than 60million [euros], there are few players like him.' Calderon was also asked about how much the Spanish champions would be willing to pay for United ace Ronaldo. It has been claimed that Madrid would be willing to splash out a world record £80million on the 23-year-old, but Calderon continued to insist the matter was out of their hands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'We cannot pay anything because he is a player who is not for sale,' Calderon was quoted as saying by Spanish media. 'It is not a matter for Real Madrid but for Manchester (United) and the player. If he wants to go, then we will be alert as long as it's for a reasonable price.'</p>
