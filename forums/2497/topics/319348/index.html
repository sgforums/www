              <p><strong>Internazionale president Massimo Moratti insists the decision to
                  sack coach Roberto Mancini was not "done on a whim" and that it was
                  "for the benefit of the club".</strong></p>
              <p>Mancini's contract was terminated on Thursday night despite the
                  former Italy striker having recently led the club to a third successive
                  Serie A title under his command.</p>
              <p>Although the 2007/08 campaign ended with another Scudetto it was
                  not without its hiccups as Mancini resigned in the immediate aftermath
                  of the UEFA Champions League exit to Liverpool before being swiftly
                  talked into a rethink.</p>
              <p>And Moratti admitted on Saturday that Mancini's apparent willingness to walk out midway through the season had left its mark.</p>
              <p>He told the <em>Corriere della Sera</em> newspaper: "This created
                  imbalances within the team that forced everyone, managers and players
                  included, to double and triple their energies.</p>
              <p>"It's true that we all rowed in the same direction, but we were forced to row harder."</p>
              <p>Despite the problems which emerged over the final few months of
                  their relationship, Moratti insisted it was not an easy decision to
                  dispense with a coach under whom Inter flourished.</p>
              <p>He added: "It was not a whim.</p>
              <p>"The most simple solution would have been to have continued with the coach with whom we won three consecutive championships.</p>
              <p>"Nobody would have criticised me, everything would have been smooth.</p>
              <p>"I intervened because I thought it was necessary, not against the coach, but in the interests of Inter."</p>
              <p>Moratti is expected to name Jose Mourinho as Mancini's replacement.</p>
              <p>The former Porto and Chelsea boss is likely to take over officially at the start of next week.</p>
