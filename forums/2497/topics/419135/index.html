              <p><span><strong>Arsenal's title credentials do not always bear the closest scrutiny and failing to accept the offer of three gift-wrapped points from relegation-threatened opponents hardly made them look any more convincing at the DW Stadium last night.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Lowly Wigan could scarcely have done more to aid Arsenal’s rise towards the top of the Barclays Premier League than allow them back into the game, after taking a deserved 18th-minute lead, then hand them the initiative by losing their outstanding performer to a senseless sending off 12 minutes from time.</span></p>
              <p><span>Arsenal had roared back with goals from Andrey Arshavin and Nicklas Bendtner and looked sure to climb to within goal difference of the summit when Wigan danger man Charles N’Zogbia marred an eye-catching display of purposeful, pacey running with a straight red card for a head butt on Jack Wilshere.</span></p>
              <p><span>Yet, instead of stepping back and admiring further evidence of an authentic title challenge, Arsene Wenger was left pacing the technical area and remonstrating with the fourth official, as Wigan stunned his side with an 81st-minute equaliser.</span></p>
              <p><span>Ben Watson swung over a deep corner and when Hugo Rodallega headed it back from beyond the far post, Gary Caldwell and Sebastien Squillaci leaped into a goalline duel that sent the ball bobbling over the line. Caldwell took the plaudits, but  television replays suggested the Arsenal centre-back got the final touch. </span></p>

              <p><strong><span>Either way, Wenger refused to con</span><span>demn the careless loss of two points and was just as insistent that his decision to make eight changes from the side that beat Chelsea on Monday could not be blamed.</span></strong>
              </p><p><span>He said: ‘We just didn’t do enough in the second half. There is no rule about how many changes you make and I felt we were at a disadvantage after playing only 48 hours ago. There was not as much recovery time as some other teams had, but the changes did not cause the problem.</span></p>
              <p><span>‘I am not too downhearted. Manchester United dropped points at Birmingham, just as we did here. Let’s see the effect at the end of the season. You could say we should have been in a winning position when they went down to 10 men, but to be fair, conceding from a corner has nothing to do with how many players you have on the pitch.’.</span></p>
              <p><span>After sending on Wilshere as substitute for the injured Abou Diaby, Wenger withdrew him near the end, in the wake of mounting criticism from home fans for his role in N’Zogbia’s dismissal. Wilshere appeared blameless, as N’Zogbia squared up to him and made contact with his forehead, but was still jeered every time he touched the ball.</span></p>
              <p><span>Wenger said: ‘I felt he was becoming controversial and that he looked a bit tired after the Chelsea game. I didn’t want to expose him to any more. As to N’Zogbia’s actions, you will have to ask him why he did that.’</span></p>
              <p><span>Wigan were good value for their lead, given them by Watson from the spot after N’Zogbia cut in from the left and was hauled down by Laurent Koscielny.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>But the initiative turned Arsenal’s way, as Bendtner began to demonstrate why he constantly reminds Wenger that he ought to be playing on a more regular basis. The Arsenal striker finally made his first League start of the season and made the most of it by inspiring a fightback.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>They were level in the 39th minute, as Bendtner ran on to a Marouane Chamakh pass and tested Ali Al Habsi with an angled shot. The Wigan keeper might have thought he had quelled the danger with a sprawling save, but Arshavin had other ideas, as he swivelled and executed a spectacular waist-high volley into the far corner.</span></p>
              <p><span>Bendtner’s claims to a starting place are based mainly on his finishing skills and they came to the fore five minutes later, as Arsenal went ahead. Arshavin threaded the ball through to Bendtner, who still had plenty to do with Caldwell and Antolin Alcaraz on the edge of the area but a smart turn took him between the two flat-footed defenders and an assured finish did the rest..</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>There seemed to be no way back for Wigan, particularly when N’Zogbia, who had tormented Arsenal all night with his lightning acceleration, took exception to an observation from Wilshere off the ball and left the England midfielder poleaxed with an unforgiveable head butt. Fourth official Mike Dean saw the offence and brought it to the attention of referee Lee Probert, who wasted no time producing a red card.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Three minutes later, Wigan were level, as Arsenal failed to deal with Watson’s corner, and Squillaci only succeeded in helping the ball over his own line.</span></p>
              <p><span>There was still time for substitute Sami Nasri to fire a free-kick into the wall and lead penalty claims for handball that were echoed by Wenger. With Arsenal frittering away more points, and having no-one but themselves to blame, it sounded distinctly hollow.</span></p>
