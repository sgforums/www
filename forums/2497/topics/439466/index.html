              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'><strong>Liverpool will consider negotiating their own overseas television rights deal in a move that will send shockwaves around the Barclays Premier League.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The £1.4billion contract, which expires in 2013, is currently shared equally between the 20 top-flight clubs. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>But Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre insists that his club must consider going it alone if they are not to be left in the slipstream of Real Madrid and Barcelona.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ayre, who also admits that a new stadium or a redeveloped Anfield is ‘essential’ for the club to get back on a par with Europe’s elite, said: ‘There are so many things moving in that particular area. What is absolutely certain is that, with the greatest of respect to our colleagues in the Premier League, if you’re a Bolton fan in Bolton, then you subscribe to Sky because you want to watch Bolton. Everyone gets that.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘Likewise, if you’re a Liverpool fan from Liverpool, you subscribe. But if you’re in Kuala Lumpur there isn’t anyone subscribing to Astro or ESPN to watch Bolton. If they are, it’s a small number. The majority are subscribing as they want to watch Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea or Arsenal.</span></p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘So is it right that the international rights are shared equally between all the clubs? Some people will say, “Well, you’ve got to all be in it to make it happen”, but isn’t it really about where the revenue is coming from and about who people want to watch on that channel? We know it is us and others. At some point we definitely feel there has to be some rebalance on that because we are disadvantaging ourselves against other big European clubs.’</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>To emphasise what could be achieved, in 2006 Real Madrid signed a deal for their own domestic television rights worth £1bn over a seven-year period. Liverpool are happy with the current domestic TV contract, which is also shared between the 20 clubs, but Ayre wants the foreign market to be explored.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Kenny Dalglish’s men have an enormous following in the Far East and Ayre said: ‘If Real Madrid, Barcelona or other big European clubs have the opportunity to truly realise their international media value potential, where does that leave Liverpool and Man United?</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'The whole phenomenon of the Premier League could be threatened. If they (Barcelona and Madrid) just get bigger and generate more, then (top) players will start drifting that way. It’s a real debate that has to happen.’ </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>That Ayre is able to speak on such matters shows how far Liverpool have come in the past 12 months. A year ago today, he was in the High Court as former owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett sought to prevent the sale of the club to New England Sports Ventures.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool are in talks with companies over potential deals for naming rights for a new stadium but Ayre again reiterated they will not rush any decision over whether they renovate Anfield or move to a new plot.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>‘It is essential for us to do something,’ Ayre said. ‘We have been in discussions with a small group of people that we have narrowed down that we are targeting for naming rights. We have to weed through the people who realistically could do it but that is an absolute catalyst to building a new stadium. The economics just don’t stack up without it.’</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Liverpool have been blasted for their plot to secure a groundbreaking overseas TV deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Reds have admitted they are considering breaking away from the rest of the Premier League clubs to chase their own lucrative broadcasting deal.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The £1.4billion contract, which expires in 2013, is currently shared equally between the 20 top-flight clubs - but Liverpool are desperate to land their own deal to exploit their popularity around the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>However, that plan - raised managing director Ian Ayre - is likely to be scuppered because of the expected opposition from their rivals in the Premier League.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Wigan chairman Dave Whelan reacted with outrage, telling goal.com: 'I have just read his [Ayre's] comments and I find them diabolical - I just can't believe what he has been saying.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'They are thinking "how can we get more money?" You won't get more money by killing the heart and soul of the Premier League and killing the heart and soul of football in England.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>'We invented the game and we have still got the finest league in the whole world and some of the finest supporters in the whole world and they want to rip the whole thing up.'</span></p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A Chelsea spokesman said: 'Our position is that we are supportive of the Premier League deal and are content with the set-up as it is at present.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Manchester City chief communications officer Vicky Kloss said: 'The subject has never been up for debate either inside the club or externally. We are well aware of the benefits of the collective selling of Premier League television rights.'</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Reds are ready to float the idea at the next meeting of the 20 clubs but they would need the backing of another 13 teams to have any hope of implementing the huge changes.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Ayre insists that his club must consider going it alone if they are not to be left in the slipstream of Real Madrid and Barcelona.</span></p>

              <p>It is understood that Manchester United, who claim to have 333m fans globally and have targeted overseas sponsorship revenue as a route to increase income, will oppose any moves to challenge the status quo under which the Premier League sells television rights overseas on behalf of all 20 elite clubs.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Chelsea said: "We are supportive of the Premier League on this and want to continue with the way they sell [TV rights] collectively."</p>
              <p>United insiders pointed out that their chief executive, David Gill, had repeatedly underlined the support of the club's owners, the Glazer family, for the collective model. Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry earlier this year, Gill said: "The collective selling of the television rights has clearly been a success and it has made things more competitive."</p>
              <p>It is understood that Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur will continue to back the existing arrangement that last season paid each club £17.9m, while Wigan chairman Dave Whelan reacted with outrage.</p>
              <p>Whelan told goal.com: "I have just read his [Ayre's] comments and I find them diabolical - I just can't believe what he has been saying. They are thinking 'how can we get more money?' You won't get more money by killing the heart and soul of the Premier League and killing the heart and soul of football in England.</p>
              <p>"We invented the game and we have still got the finest league in the whole world and some of the finest supporters in the whole world and they want to rip the whole thing up."</p>
              <p>The public stance of other big clubs will come as a disappointment to <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;">Liverpool</span></a>, who were understood to believe that others would support them. Liverpool's managing director, Ian Ayre, said that clubs in other countries, notably Real Madrid and Barcelona in Spain, have a growing financial advantage over English clubs because they secure TV deals individually.</p>
              <p>Without the support of those who stand to benefit most the idea would be dead in the water, because none of the League's smaller clubs would vote for something that would hugely disadvantage them.</p>
              <p>Overseas revenues could outstrip the domestic deal, currently worth £2.1bn over three years, for the first time when the Premier League launches its tender process next year.</p>
              <p>Liverpool would need to persuade 13 of their fellow Premier League clubs of the merit of the plan in order to force through the change since any significant change to the Premier League rulebook requires a two thirds majority.</p>
              <p>Ayre became the first representative of a leading Premier League club since Peter Kenyon at Manchester United in 2003 to challenge the collective sale of overseas TV rights, which brought in £1.4bn over the three years to 2012-13.</p>
              <p>Ayre said: "Is it right that the international rights are shared equally between all the clubs? Some people will say: 'Well you've got to all be in it to make it happen.' But isn't it really about where the revenue is coming from, which is the broadcaster, and isn't it really about who people want to watch on that channel? We know it is us. And others.</p>
              <p>"At some point we feel there has to be some rebalance on that, because what we are actually doing is disadvantaging ourselves against other big European clubs."</p>

              <p>Liverpool envisage a system like that enjoyed by Real Madrid and Barcelona in Spain.</p>
              <p>Yet Whelan fumed: "It is absolutely scandalous. It is the 'American Dream' this. They are thinking 'How can we get more money'?</p>

              <p>Barca and Real rake in around 45 per cent of Spain's TV money. Last season Barca trousered £122million, while the third-highest paid club, Valencia, got £37m.</p>

              <div class="base-gallery-control"><strong>Ayre came in for widespread criticism for comments earlier this week when he suggested England's biggest clubs should receive a greater share of the money from international TV rights.</strong></div>
              <div class="base-gallery-control"><strong></strong> </div>
              <div class="base-article-body">
              <p>The Reds managing director had said: "If you're in Kuala Lumpur there isn't anyone subscribing to Astro or ESPN to watch Bolton; the large majority are subscribing because they want to watch Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea or Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"So is it right that the international rights are shared equally between all the clubs?"</p>
              <p>However, he claims his comments have been misinterpreted as the early stages of a bid by the club to go it alone in terms of negotiating their own deals in future.</p>
              <p>"What I said - and what we were trying to put forward and the debate we have been trying to open up - is not about Liverpool trying to break away and sell their own rights," he said.</p>
              <p>"At the moment the way the rights are sold collectively is great and generates a significant amount of revenue.</p>
              <p>"However, the way those values are distributed is an issue.</p>
              <p>"Domestic rights are half of the total and they take 50 per cent and share it equally and the other 50 per cent is distributed on how many times you feature on TV and where you finish in the league.</p>
              <p>"However, internationally the figure is just divided by 20 and I don't think that is right. The bigger clubs have a bigger appeal overseas and I think that is an issue.</p>
              <p>"I think it is unfortunate it has snowballed into some ridiculous tirade of media suggesting we were trying to run off and damage the league.</p>
              <p>"We are Liverpool Football Club and clearly that is not our game but it is something I would like to see debated.</p>
              <p>"The whole media rights landscape is very important as it represents about 95 per cent of the revenue we get from the league.</p>
              <p>"I think it needs to be addressed because I don't think the balance is right but what it turned into was a torrent of 'Liverpool are going to break away and damage the league' and quite clearly I wasn't suggesting that."</p>
              <p>Ayre also expanded on where the club stand on the thorny issue of on-going plans for the stadium, whether it be a new build in Stanley Park or a revamp of Anfield.</p>
              <p>"We are following two parallel processes," he told LFC TV.</p>
              <p>"On the refurbishment of Anfield we have a design and in order to incorporate that it involves the acquisition of a lot of housing around the Main Stand area.</p>
              <p>"In order to understand whether that is achievable there are a lot of discussions to have and we are working our way through a process.</p>
              <p>"When we know the answer to what our opportunity is to acquiring those properties we can make a decision - until we do there is no decision to make.</p>
              <p>"Parallel to that, economically it doesn't stack up building a new stadium of 60,000-plus seats and writing a cheque for that because you only get incremental revenue from those new 15,000 to 20,000 seats.</p>
              <p>"The only thing which makes that stack up in this economy is having a naming partner.</p>
              <p>"We are talking to a variety of people around the world who have good interest but if you try to force that process you actually devalue it.</p>
              <p>"If people think you are desperate to do a deal they will try to chip the value of that and we are not desperate - it is just important to us."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Nope, everybody understood you perfectly. Nobody said Liverpool is going break away. Its understood that you are trying to force a debate that will eventually lead to you getting more money and the smaller clubs lesser money. So you say you don't want to damage the league but proceeded to outline just that plan in the next sentence. What's so hard to understand? </blockquote>
