The French club lodged a complaint over Ryan Giggs's quickly taken free-kick but it was rejected by Uefa. The European governing body will consider their appeal on Friday.</strong><br><br>Uefa has also charged Lille with the improper behaviour of their players, who appeared to contemplate leaving the pitch in protest at United's goal. A Uefa statement said: "Lille had until midnight [on Monday] to file an appeal after the Control and Disciplinary Body rejected the Ligue 1 side's claim that there had been a technical mistake by the referee in allowing Ryan Giggs's match-winning free-kick to be taken without having blown his whistle.<br><br>"The Control and Disciplinary Body vetoed the protest on the grounds that there was no proof of a technical error, making the solitary strike of last Tuesday's first knockout round first-leg tie in Lens perfectly valid. "Uefa's Appeals Body will consider the Lille appeal on Friday."<br><br>A statement released on Lille's website said: "President Michel Seydoux and the board of Lille have decided to appeal against the decision made on Friday by the European authority. "The true question is to determine how the Man Utd players came to take so quickly the free-kick that led to the goal, as they showed signs of a different intention.<br><br>"Following these principles, Lille have therefore taken the decision to go through with a fight that seems correct to them." Giggs's strike was the only goal of the first leg of the last 16 tie, with the second leg taking place on Wednesday 7 March.<br></div>

There is comfort and security in the stadia where everyone is seated and you have no fences.<br><br>"If this was applied to all the other big leagues some would not face the problems they are facing now."<br><br></div>

A number of European matches have been organised at the Bollaert since 1998. "Our enclosure fits perfectly with the UEFA regulations and there has never been the slightest incident until English supporters provoked one with fake tickets.<br><br>"I am going to immediately send a letter to UEFA president Michel Platini, as well as to Sepp Blatter, to ask him for his explanations and to invite him to Lens. "It is irresponsible on his part to make such remarks." Lille are blaming United for last week's crowd problems, claiming their early distribution of tickets allowed high-quality fakes to be produced.<br><br>Blatter said yesterday: "I cannot understand that those who organise the Champions League accept a stadium like Lens to play such a match.<br>"In Lens, there are fences still, and it should not be permitted to play Champions League matches in such a stadium."<br><br>Meanwhile, UEFA are likely to tomorrow reject an appeal against their decision to allow Ryan Giggs' goal in the 1-0 win for United to stand. Lille claim the quickly-taken free-kick should not have been allowed to stand but UEFA rejected their protest last week, saying it had been entirely within the laws of the game.<br></div>
