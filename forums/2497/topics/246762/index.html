And the Catalan giants believe a renewed assault for the Arsenal striker could finally pay off. The shock news came as American tycoon Stan Kroenke snapped up 9.9 per cent of the club to spark takeover talk.</strong><br><br>Henry, 29, was wanted by Barca and Real Madrid last summer but the Frenchman decided to stick with the Gunners. Now Nou Camp transfer chief Txiki Begiristain is ready to test boss Arsene WengerÂ’s resolve to hold on to his skipper.<br><br>Henry has already told club officials he wants to remain in North London for the rest of his career. Yet Barcelona, who could lose Samuel EtoÂ’o in the summer, plan to pressure Wenger into letting Henry leave after going two successive seasons without a trophy.<br><br>But Arsenal know they would still face a major problem if they sold Henry without bringing in a top-class replacement. KroenkeÂ’s move to buy a 9.9 per cent stake in Arsenal has made a takeover more likely. The US billionaire, who owns MLS team the Colorado Rapids, bought the stake from ITV.<br><br>He paid the broadcaster Â£65m Â— which includes Â£23.1m for ITVÂ’s 50 per cent stake in the clubÂ’s broadband operations. Kroenke said last night: Â“Because of our long-time involvement in major sports, we greatly admire Arsenal Football Club.<br><br>Â“We appreciate the clubÂ’s outstanding legacy, sporting tradition, and exceptional commitment of its supporters.Â” The deal makes Kroenke ArsenalÂ’s fourth-biggest shareholder.<br><br></div>

KSE began a business partnership with the Gunners in February through Major League Soccer club Colorado Rapids. </strong><br><br>Last month, Kroenke's spokesman Jurgen Mainka denied the American billionaire wanted to buy the club. Kroenke has interests in NFL side St Louis Rams and owns the Denver Nuggets (NBA) and Colorado Avalanche (NHL).<br><br>Arsenal are valued at around Â£404m and billionaire Kroenke was widely thought to be interested in buying shares. There is an increasing trend of American businessmen linking up with English clubs.<br><br>This season Liverpool and Aston Villa have been bought by American business tycoons, and Manchester United have been owned by Malcolm Glazer since 2005. Kroenke came 153rd in the prestigious Forbes 400 - a list of the wealthiest Americans. That put him seven places higher than the Glazer family and 89 ahead of Villa owner Randy Lerner.<br><br>Arsenal's major shareholders, including vice chairman David Dein and director Danny Fiszman, are not believed to be interested in selling up. The deal with Colorado is designed to build Arsenal's brand in the United States, while also helping to develop the MLS club.<br><br>The arrangement between the two clubs includes the development of a Centre of Excellence in Colorado, the transfer of coaching ideas and the launch of the Arsenal Cup, a club tournament open to teams from all over the US.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THIERRY AND ARSENAL COULD BE UP FOR SALE</strong><br><br>THIERRY HENRY'S Arsenal future was in doubt again last night as three European giants insisted the Gunners are ready to let him go. Less than a year after Henry signed the contract he expected to tie him to the north London club for the rest of his career, Inter Milan, Barcelona and Real Madrid are all working on the assumption that Arsenal are prepared to sacrifice their skipper this summer. And while Henry has no wish to end his stay at the Emirates Stadium, the final decision may be down to Arsene Wenger if a suitable offer is received.<br><br>Barca, Real and Inter are all circling, under the belief that the Arsenal board is willing to listen to bids in the region of Â£12million for the player, who turns 30 in August. That would give boss Wenger much-needed cash to help fund an overhaul of the squad that is already 23 points adrift of Manchester United - having finished 24 points off Chelsea's pace last term.<br><br>Inter have already made an unofficial approach to test the water and Arsenal's response has not put them off coming back for real in the summer. And sources at both Barcelona - who may be willing to include Samuel Eto'o in a player-plus-cash exchange - and Real are briefing that they have been told Henry is no longer "untransferable" in the eyes of the Arsenal board amid claims that he is at times a "disruptive influence".<br><br>That criticism, if genuine, seems unfair on a player who has always given everything for the Arsenal cause. Yet Henry's injury-plagued campaign has seen his bond with Wenger loosened, even if the captain's public commitment to the Gunners has been unceasing.<br><br></div>
