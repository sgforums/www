            <div class='col-md body'>Blackburn eyeing up Beckham move<br><br>Blackburn are preparing an audacious move for Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham. The former England captain has only been on the fringes of Reals side this season although he played a starring role in their 5-1 thrashing of minnows Ecija in the Copa del Rey on Thursday night. And with Beckham appearing likely to move away from the Spanish capital next summer, Blackburn boss Mark Hughes admits he would be interested in trying to take the 31-year-old to Ewood Park.<br><br>Both men know each other well from their playing days at Manchester United and although Hughes could offer Beckham a route back to the Premiership, he admits there will be stiff opposition. Hughes is quoted in a newspaper as saying: "I think everybody would be interested in David Beckham. I am sure if he came on the open market there would be a few people in the queue for him. He is an exceptional talent and has been for a long time."<br><br>Hughes has a reputation of luring big names to Rovers and would have no fears about trying to attract Beckham to one of the Premierships less fashionable clubs. He added: "There were a few in for Craig Bellamy and we got him." On Saturday, Blackburn entertain Manchester United and Hughes is bracing himself for a side fired up by Sir Alex Fergusons famous hairdryer treatment. Tuesdays shock Carling Cup defeat to lowly Southend is sure to spark a reaction against Blackburn who are going into the game on the back of three successive Premiership defeats.<br><br>He said "Taking Tuesday out of the equation, theyre playing exceptionally well at the moment. Theyre as good as Ive seen for a couple of seasons now. Some of the football theyre playing is of the highest order. But after what happened against Southend, I know he (Ferguson) will now be looking for a reaction. Were next up, and a hard game becomes harder."<br><br>In Hughes favour is that he has yet to lose in three league games to Ferguson since taking charge of Blackburn just over two years ago, notably completing the double last season. That included a 4-3 thriller at Ewood Park in February when David Bentley scored a stunning hat-trick - and with an unhappy Ferguson taking exception to Blackburns tactics. At the time Ferguson accused Rovers of playing a poor brand of football in which "they foul all the time".<br><br>Diplomatically, Hughes replied: "I think he was a little bit upset at being beaten, and thats the only reason. I didnt take too much exception to what he said. I was grateful for the win and happy we had played exceptionally well against a good team."</div>
