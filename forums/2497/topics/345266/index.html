              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>LONDON - Manager Harry Redknapp blasted
                                  his Tottenham Hotspur side after they survived a torrid night
                                  against Burnley to reach the League Cup final despite losing the
                                  semi-final second leg 3-2 on Wednesday.</strong></p>
              <p>The holders, leading 4-1 from the first leg, trailed 3-0 and
                                  were three minutes away from a shambolic exit on away goals when
                                  Roman Pavlyuchenko put them back in front on aggregate and
                                  Jermain Defoe added another.</p>
              <p>Tottenham's 6-4 aggregate victory set up a Wembley final
                                  against Premier League, European and World club champions
                                  Manchester United who they also face this weekend in the fourth
                                  round of the FA Cup.</p>
              <p>Redknapp looked stunned as his struggling Premier League
                                  side capitulated and admitted he thought they were "dead and
                                  buried" with some of his players lacking fight.</p>
              <p>"One or two looked like they had a sulk on because I'm
                                  trying to bring new players in but really they should be
                                  fighting for their lives to stay at a great club like
                                  Tottenham," Redknapp, who won the FA Cup with Portsmouth last
                                  season, told Sky Sports.</p>
              <p>"It was the most uncomfortable night of my football life. I
                                  need to do some stuff at this club to turn it around because we
                                  are a long way short of where we should be."</p>
              <p>Championship Burnley showed more heart and
                                  desire and played better football than their top-flight
                                  opponents as they sensed a first major cup final for 47 years.</p>
              <p>Jay Rodriguez pounced to put them 3-0 ahead in the 87th
                                  minute after Tottenham's reserve keeper Ben Alnwick dropped a
                                  cross at his feet.</p>
              <p><strong>TURNED PROVIDER</strong></p>
              <p>Robbie Blake had given Burnley the lead after 34 minutes
                                  with a cleverly disguised free kick which caught out Alnwick and
                                  Blake turned provider to set up Chris McCann for a tap-in after
                                  72 minutes to put Burnley 2-0 up.</p>
              <p>With away goals only counting after the extra 30 minutes,
                                  Burnley were hanging on grimly until Russian Pavlyuchenko struck
                                  to spoil what was gearing up to be a momentous night for the
                                  once great Lancashire club.</p>
              <p>Pavlyuchenko buried a shot past Brian Jensen after one of
                                  Tottenham's few moves of real quality ended with Benoit
                                  Assou-Ekotto picking out the Russian.</p>
              <p>"It was cruel on the players, it really was," Burnley
                                  manager Owen Coyle, whose side had seen off Fulham, Chelsea and
                                  Arsenal in this year's competition, told Sky Sports.</p>
              <p>"It was a great finish by the lad at the end but everybody
                                  at this club can be very proud of what they've done."</p>
