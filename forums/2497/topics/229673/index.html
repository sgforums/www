Fifa said last night it would refuse to sanction the transfer.<br><br>Mascherano arrived at Upton Park from Corinthians on transfer deadline day in August having already represented the Brazilian club in competitive action since the World Cup finals. Article Five, Paragraph Three of Fifa's regulations stipulates that, while players can be registered for a maximum of three clubs from July 1 until June 30 the following year, they are eligible to play for only two in that time.<br><br>The West Ham manager, Alan Curbishley, who has agreed a fee of Â£5m with Fulham for Luis Boa Morte, is already planning for life without Mascherano despite Fifa indicating last night that the rules would technically prevent the Argentina midfielder from completing a loan move to Anfield. Indeed, it is understood to have outlined the situation to the West Ham owner, Eggert Magnusson, when asked at the end of November.<br><br>"Our understanding, as of today, is the rule is binding," said a Fifa spokesman. "That means that, if a player has already played and registered and been eligible for two clubs from the period of July 1 to June 30, he is not any longer eligible for another club until the next period begins [on July 1]. There is no provision that allows for any kind of waiving of this rule."<br><br>BenÃ­tez will also add the Blackburn Rovers defender Lucas Neill to his ranks this month, with Stephen Warnock possibly moving in the other direction. While both Neill and Mascherano have played in the Uefa Cup this season, Liverpool will most likely submit the Australian as their one additional eligible player for their Champions League campaign under new Uefa rules, leaving the Argentinian as cover for Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso in domestic competition. The 22-year-old has made only seven appearances for West Ham and none since Curbishley took over.<br><br></div>

Benitez refused to comment directly on reports he is on the verge of ending Mascherano's miserable stay at Upton Park by making him his first signing of the new year transfer window.<br><br>But he did indicate he is unconcerned by the rules which dictate a player cannot play for more than two clubs in the year starting July 1 - affecting Mascherano, who has already turned out for Corinthians and West Ham.<br><br>Benitez said: "There are a lot of similar situations with players who have played for three clubs in the same season, and in some cases four, so I think it is not a problem. "We are watching good players and we want to find someone who can add more balance but at this moment we are focusing on the next game, and we are not talking about players."<br><br>Earlier reports indicated Mascherano has already undergone a medical at Anfield and is ready to sign a deal which would represent a big gamble on obtaining the required FIFA clearance.<br><br>Juventus have already cooled their interest in Mascherano, who has made just three starts since arriving in the summer alongside Carlos Tevez, reportedly for this very reason.<br><br>Meanwhile, ahead of his side's FA Cup third-round clash with Arsenal, Benitez has also reiterated his desire to keep midfielder Xabi Alonso and striker Peter Crouch at the club. Alonso had been linked with a move away from Anfield but Benitez said: "It is clear that Xabi will stay with us and also Peter Crouch. We do not want to sell players and I am not thinking about this."<br><br>Benitez intends to make more changes to his line-up but insists he will still name a strong team as his side bid to successfully defend the trophy they won so dramatically in Cardiff last May. Craig Bellamy is set to return to the starting line-up meaning Crouch could once again be left kicking his heels on the bench, but Benitez is convinced his players are happy with his rotation system.<br><br>Benitez added: "If you play for a small club you might play one game a week but when it is a big club such as Liverpool you are in all competitions and it is two games a week. "This would be a big problem and when you explain the situation to the players I think they understand."<br><br></div>
