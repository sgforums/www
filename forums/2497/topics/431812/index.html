              <p><a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Liverpool" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Liverpool</strong></span></a><strong>'s owner, Fenway Sports Group, is anxious to rid the club's wage bill of several expensive transfer errors this summer to maximise Kenny Dalglish's budget for "highest quality" signings.</strong></p>
              <p>FSG has sanctioned a substantial outlay on recruits at Anfield, with an approach having been made for Sunderland's Jordan Henderson and interest in the Aston Villa pair of Stewart Downing and Ashley Young expected to develop after their commitments with England. While FSG is willing to spend heavily on transfer fees it is, however, reluctant to increase an already inflated wage bill and wants several high-earning players to make way for the additions.</p>
              <p>Liverpool had the fourth-highest wage bill in the Premier League in 2010 – £121m – but failed to qualify for the Champions League next season and last. FSG inherited a host of financial burdens from the previous owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, and the former managers Rafael Benítez and Roy Hodgson, and faces the dual problem of needing to improve Dalglish's squad – "We want to get the highest quality of player in that we can," the Scot has said – while starting to comply with Uefa's fair play regulations.</p>
              <p>As John W Henry, the club's principal owner, said recently: "The worst surprise [following FSG's takeover last October] was the lack of depth in the squad. Our biggest concern in taking on this responsibility was this issue and it was a bigger issue than we feared. There was a huge multi-year payroll for a squad that had very little quality depth."</p>
              <p>The free signings Joe Cole and Milan Jovanovic, for example, earn £100,000 and £120,000 a week at Liverpool respectively, although the latter's astonishing salary includes a signing-on fee payable over the first 12 months of his contract. Cole made nine Premier League starts last season and Jovanovic five. Paul Konchesky, Christian Poulsen and Brad Jones, who cost £5m, £4.5m and £2.3m respectively and were also part of a disastrous transfer policy last summer, are surplus to requirements too but are liable to deter potential suitors with their salaries. Philipp Degen, Nabil El Zhar and Emiliano Insúa also remain on the payroll.</p>
              <p>Liverpool must pay a final instalment of €5m (£4.4m) to Roma for Alberto Aquilani by the end of June and must decide whether to accept a major loss on the Italian midfielder or bring him back to Merseyside after a season's loan to Juventus.</p>
              <p>Juventus have offered only £6m for a player who will cost Liverpool a total of £17.6m, with Roma to receive 5% of any fee agreed, although the 26-year-old's agent has insisted a compromise deal is possible. Franco Zavaglia said: "All season Juventus have always given me the necessary guarantees that they want to keep Alberto. The next 24 hours will be decisive. Any eventual economic agreements will follow after Juventus make their decision. If Juventus can't do a deal for Alberto and he has to return to Liverpool, then Milan would certainly be a destination that he would accept."</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>First Question: Who is willing to pay Jovanovic's salary?! Yes, he could take pay cut but at his age, I think he's not making a move anytime soon. Remember Winston Borgarde?</p>
              <p>Second Question: Joe Cole is a shadow of his former self. Again, who is willing to foot his paycheck? Man City perhaps.</p>
              <p>Konchesky, Poulsen and Jones would probably leave on a cheap and so does loanees Degen, El Zhar and Insua.</p>
              <p>I don't see how Aquilani would fit back into Liverpool especially with his squad number taken over by Miereles. Maybe Liverpool should just take whatever is being offered instead of keeping an unhappy player.</p>

              <p>I agreed that the players bought by Roy would be hard to offload as no one wants them.</p>
              <p>The USA owner do not want white elephant on the payroll.</p>
              <p>Ah Ken would have a hard time marketing and selling these players.</p>
              <p>My hope is that he can buy some good players from oversea and not dwell on BPL players.</p>

The Belgian club announced the news on their website and said the transfer hinges on Jovanovic passing a medical on Thursday.</strong></p>
              <p>Jovanovic joined Liverpool on a free transfer from Standard Liège last summer, having impressed the then manager Rafael Benítez, but was unable to establish himself in the Premier League and last started a game for Liverpool in January. Anderlecht have not paid a fee for him.</p>
              <p>The Serbia forward had been a huge success in Belgium with his previous club, boasting an impressive goals-per-game ratio and catching the eye in the Champions League group stages in 2009.</p>
              <p>The Anderlecht general manager, Herman van Holsbeeck, described negotiations with Liverpool as "long but fruitful" and spoke of Jovanovic's "undeniable talent" and "requisite experience" being key qualities.</p>
