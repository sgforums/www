            <div class='col-md body'>Angel exit gives O'Neill room to maneuvour<br><br>Martin O'Neill is looking to strengthen his squad following the departure of Juan Pablo Angel to America.<br><br>The Colombian yesterday brought to an end a six-year spell at Villa when he signed a three-year deal with Major League Soccer side New York Red Bulls subject to obtaining a work permit.<br><br>The 31-year-old cost Villa a club record Â£9.5million when he signed from River Plate in January 2001 but his days looked numbered with the arrival of John Carew and Ashley Young during the January transfer window.<br><br>Now O'Neill is set to step up his search for replacements with Villa no longer in danger of relegation.<br><br>He told the club's website: 'Does it open up a space here? I would think we'd be trying to strengthen anyway, to give us a decent squad.<br><br>'I wouldn't want to be stuck in the same mode as we were in November/December when we just didn't have the numbers, never mind anything else.<br><br>'We could have done with a transfer window in November but it just wasn't to be.'<br><br>Angel enjoyed mixed fortunes at Villa with his best season in 2003-04 when he scored 23 times as the club just missed out on a UEFA Cup spot on goal difference to Newcastle.<br><br>He started this season in the side and scored seven goals before Christmas but has failed to make the substitutes' bench in eight of Villa's last nine games.<br><br>O'Neill continued: 'Other people will be better judges than I am about Juan Pablo being value for money.<br><br>'He had one fantastic season season when he scored over 20 goals.<br><br>'He has been very popular with the fans. Every time he has warmed up the supporters have given him a big cheer and when he's played in the games they have been supportive.<br><br>'I think with John Carew coming in and making a big impact, it probably lessens the blow.<br><br>'He's been very popular and we wish him well. This is a great opportunity for him to carve out a new life - and where better?'<br></div>
