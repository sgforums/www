              <p>No idea... Alex probably moaning because he is not the 1st choice pairing.</p>
              <p>Remember that during the start of the season, Ivanovic was partnering Terry.</p>
              <p>Then it was Luiz partnering Terry.</p>
              <p>In a way it meant Alex was 3rd choice.</p>

              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Sportsmail</span></em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'> can reveal that Didier Drogba, Salomon Kalou, Jose Bosingwa and Paulo Ferreira are available for transfer, news which follows the weekend announcement that transfer requests from Nicolas Anelka and Alex had been accepted.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The France striker and Brazil defender have been banned from using first-team facilities at the club’s training ground, with Anelka set to sign a £6.4million-a-year deal with Shanghai Shenhua in China.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Drogba and Kalou scored in Saturday’s 3-0 win at Newcastle but are out of contract next year and free to sign a pre-contract deal with a foreign club in January.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Ivorian strikers are also destined for the Africa Cup of Nations, which starts on January 21 and could rule them out for up to six weeks of the season.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>A lucrative move to the Middle East is understood to appeal to Drogba, who is 34 in March but will not be short of offers to extend his career.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Arsenal have always shown interest in Kalou and Juventus remain keen on Alex despite his alarming loss of form.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It proves owner Abramovich is preparing to back Villas-Boas, who is so anxious to refresh the squad that Alex and Anelka were told on Friday they could not use the main training centre when the first team are in the building.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>It is the ultimate humiliation for two players who have been a huge part of Chelsea for the past three years.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Chelsea players were stunned when the pair, both popular characters in the dressing room, had their lockers cleared. Both have also been told they are no longer welcome to park in the first-team car park.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>They believe they are being deliberately humiliated after being told to put their cars in the communal parking area next to the academy.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Villas-Boas has also told the pair they are no longer welcome to train with the first-team squad after they put in transfer requests. Instead they have separate training programmes, which are thought to include working with the reserves, academy and on their own.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Chelsea’s win at Newcastle eased them back into the top four but competition for the Champions League places looks set to be intense in the Barclays Premier League.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Chelsea’s first concern is to extend this season’s Champions League campaign by beating Valencia at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday. The key to the longer-term project will be whether Villas-Boas, who insists he has been promised three years to complete his work, is allowed full control over his transfer targets.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>The Portuguese manager reputedly has a good eye for players, dating back to his scouting past, yet Abramovich continues to listen to advice from a disparate selection of independent advisers.</span></p>

              <p><br></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Chelsea are expected to win the race to sign Gary Cahill from Bolton next month with the intention of pairing him with John Terry and releasing Branislav Ivanovic to play at right back.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Some within the club believe it may be the right time to elevate highly-rated defender Nathaniel Chalobah, 17 next week, to the first-team squad.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Josh McEachran and Ryan Bertrand will be allowed out on loan in January if reinforcements can be signed. Villas-Boas would also like to add left-sided Porto utility man Alvaro Pereira to his squad, and Chelsea have opened talks for Universidad de Chile striker Eduardo Vargas, according to reports in Chile.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Vargas, 22, may face work-permit issues and is unlikely to be a top target to fill the boots of Drogba and Anelka.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>Tentative enquiries were made for David Villa in the summer and the striker has slipped out of favour at Barcelona. There is a long-standing interest in Lille’s Eden Hazard. Chelsea were told to come back in 12 months when they made contact last January.</span></p>

              <p>Anelka and Alex have long made it known they want to go and refused to sign a new 1 year only contract so Chelsea are now making it known they can go in order to get some transfer fee back if possible before they walk away for free in Jul. Drogba almost the same situation only they need him for now. Bosingwa almost left only AVB arrival saved him for a while. Kalou, can't remember how much they paid for him but can still get some money back. Only Ferreira, I don't even know why is he still there... He should have beed offloaded long ago... The changing of managers ver the years kind of saved him i think...</p>
              <p>Gary Cahill will be a great buy and to think he will only cost $8m due to his contract running out too... If they do get him, he will be the present and future of Chelsea's defence cos Terry is now super slow. And to think he is only coming to 31... Don't think he can last another 2 yrs in the first team as he was never bless with pace in the first place. So he could lose it much ealier than Rio and Carragher...</p>
              <p>AVB have the unfortunate task of rebuilding the team as too many have come of age at the same time... I am just surprise Malouda's name hasn't been mentioned in that list too... lol.</p>

              <p>Man United also wanted him last time... phew, lucky Chelsea offered more money for him... At least now we got Rafael and Smalling... Jones, Fabio and Valencia also can fill in when needed... lol.</p>
              <p>Bosingwa is rather disappointing... Thought he would have been the equal of A Cole on the right but... didn't live up to earlier expectations... Another one that got away after Obi one... lol.</p>

              <p>AVB is basically kicking out his squad of key players.</p>
              <p>I admired his guts and courage for doing that.</p>
              <p>Unless he have new players in line to replace them, he is going to have a tough time ahead during the 2nd half of the season.</p>

              <p>Chelsea is not going to win anything this season so this would be a good time for the manager to start the clearout and rebuild if he thinks he has the owner's backing to stay for another 3 years.</p>

              <p>Jan transfer window clearout one third of the squad, end of season clearout another third. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
