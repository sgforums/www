            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Liverpool FC could change hands for the second time in a year as their American owners encounter difficulties in refinancing Â£350million of debt incurred in taking over and running the club. Beset by the steeply rising costs of a new stadium and manager Rafa Benitez's demands for new players, Tom Hicks and George Gillett Jr have been attempting to transfer the debt, for which they are personally liable, on to the club itself. City sources believe this is an extremely difficult task to complete before the loan's due date at the end of February.</strong><br><br><img src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/01/12/SameeralAnsari_action_ScottHeavey.jpg"><br><span class="small">Sameer Al Ansari (left) is a Liverpool fan. </span><br><br>It is possible that the Americans will meet the deadline, but if not an Arab investment group, Dubai International Capital, is understood to be close to lodging an offer to buy out the American pair, probably for about Â£500m. Takeover discussions are thought to be due before the end of this month.<br><br>If successful, DIC, led by Liverpool supporter Sameer Al Ansari, would invest heavily in two areas: the new stadium that Liverpool need if they are to compete with Arsenal and Manchester United for matchday revenue, and an improved playing squad. Were they also to acquire a new management team Jose Mourinho, who is known to be interested in managing Liverpool, would be a prime candidate.<br><br>DIC were extremely close to buying Liverpool last February, only to lose out to Hicks and Gillett when the club's chief executive, Rick Parry, switched his support from the Arab camp to the American. The latter paid Â£174.1m for a 100 per cent shareholding, also agreeing to take on the club's then debt of Â£44.8m.<br><br>The purchase, however, was funded solely with borrowed money, Hicks and Gillett's loan from the Royal Bank of Scotland swelling to Â£350m as it was used to fund several high-profile summer transfers, development work and architect's plans for a 60,000-seat stadium in Stanley Park, and to roll up the interest on the debt.<br><br>The RBS loan is due for repayment next month. The Observer understands that attempts to restructure it have so far failed and the Americans have yet to inject new equity into the refinancing. While RBS have asked Hicks and Gillett to each commit Â£20m of their own cash to the deal, City sources believe that at least one of the pair is not prepared to do so. Hicks and Gillett declined to comment last night.<br><br>Meanwhile, work on 'New Anfield' has been held up by the impasse over the acquisition loan, with no chance of funding being put in place for the Â£400m stadium project until the issue is resolved. A meeting in New York last week at which architects HKS and AFL presented competing stadium designs, was described by Parry merely as 'another big step forward to finding the best possible solution. Everyone is reflecting on what they have heard and a clear decision will be taken soon'.<br><br>Sources in the Middle East have confirmed that DIC remain as keenly interested in buying Liverpool as they were one year ago. DIC last night refused to comment on the matter, but they appear best placed to resolve the financial problems affecting the club's competitiveness in the Premier League. A mooted valuation of Â£1billion has been ridiculed, but an enterprise value of around half that figure might prove acceptable, allowing the Americans to exit with a profit of Â£75m each.<br><br><img src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2007/05/30/georgegilletttomhickspapeterbyrne.jpg"><br><span class="small">The 2 Americans to exit with a profit of Â£75m each?</span></div>

The offer from DIC, the investment arm of the Dubai government, could land millionaires George Gillett junior and Tom Hicks with a staggering profit of Â£50m, less than a year after their own takeover and without them having put a single dollar of their own money into the club.</strong><br><br>Such an outcome would enrage Liverpool fans already dismayed by their team's lack of progress towards becoming genuine Premier League contenders since the arrival of Gillett and Hicks. Despite the temptation to cash in, Hicks and Gillett are understood to be planning to cling on to control of the club and go ahead with their intention to take out Â£350m in refinancing loans.<br><br>The worrying downside to that venture would be the crippling effect on the transfer plans of manager Rafael Benitez and the fear that it could be the first step towards a Leeds United-style meltdown. Neither DIC nor the club's bankers, the Royal Bank of Scotland, would allow that to happen and they will hold crisis talks this week to discuss how the Dubai company could rescue Liverpool from crisis, on and off the field.<br><br>Gillett and Hicks are close to finalising a restructuring package with RBS, who loaned them Â£220m to buy Liverpool last February, and American bank Wachovia. The new Â£350m loan would cover the Americans' original borrowing, the money the club raised to buy players last summer and the start-up costs for a new stadium project.<br><br>But City observers believe the new loans would be merely a 'sticking plaster' for the problems at Liverpool and would leave them unable to compete with the likes of Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea because of crippling Â£30m-a-year interest charges.<br><br>There are even fears that any future failure to qualify for the Champions League could leave the club vulnerable to the kind of downward spiral suffered by Leeds. RBS, who have a long relationship with Liverpool, are so concerned about the deal that a senior figure in the bank has been called in to oversee the delicate negotiations.<br><br>But with fans due to mount a huge demonstration against the Americans at Anfield tomorrow, the pressure on them to walk away is increasing by the day. Hicks, however, is playing hardball, refusing to be forced into accepting DIC's current price for the shares and believing that, if the refinancing goes through, he will be in a stronger negotiating position. For their part, DIC will not pay a price which does not make commercial sense under their own plans and are prepared to bide their time.<br><br></div>
