            <div class='col-md body'>Newcastle cautious over Owen injury scare<br><br>Michael Owen's groin problem will be closely monitored by Newcastle as he attempts to avoid another bout of surgery.<br><br>The 27-year-old striker has been included in the squad for Sunday's Premier League clash with West Ham at St James' Park six days after limping off with a tight groin during the 1-0 defeat at Derby.<br><br>That may allay fears that the England frontman needs an operation to repair a hernia for now, with vital Euro 2008 qualifiers against Estonia and Russia coming up next month.<br><br>However, Magpies manager Sam Allardyce admits it is a situation which will have to be carefully managed to ensure Owen does not succumb once again.<br><br>He said: 'When anybody gets anything where there is a slight tightening, then it's the beginning of a warning sign to say you need to make sure you find out what the problem is and then sort the problem out.<br><br>'You would manage that area more cautiously than anything else, and then take a view on a week-by-week basis and see how things are.<br><br>'Hopefully, going into Sunday's game, he is okay. He has recovered from Monday night's match because we brought him off sooner rather than later, and we go from there.<br><br>'Hopefully he gets through Sunday's game with no more discomfort, and if he does, we have to manage that from there on and see how we go.'<br><br>Allardyce has been adamant all week that talk of surgery was premature after the player's early exit at Pride Park.<br><br>A scan on Tuesday showed no lasting damage, but it came as a relief when Owen was able to train today with no problems, although his manager is taking nothing for granted in the longer term.<br><br>He said: 'We will be guided by the scan and that is not showing that Michael needs an operation. He trained today and he is fit for selection on Sunday.<br><br>'But that is not to say that persistent groin trouble will not turn into a hernia, and if he does need an operation, we will decide about it then.'<br><br>There was further good news on the injury front for Allardyce when Owen's strike-partner Mark Viduka was passed fit after suffering a hamstring injury in the 1-0 win over Wigan a fortnight ago.<br><br>The 31-year-old is included in the squad and will battle it out with Owen, Obafemi Martins and Shola Ameobi for a place in the starting line-up.<br><br>Allardyce said: 'It's a good option - Obafemi Martins is a good option as well, and it's a difficult area for me because there is a lot of frustration in Oba at the moment.<br><br>'The difficulty is playing Oba and Michael together, does that disrupt the rest of the team? Maybe, and do I know them well enough yet? No.'<br><br>Meanwhile, Â£5.8million summer signing Joey Barton can finally set his sights on a competitive debut for the Magpies after returning to training from a fractured metatarsal.<br><br>The 24-year-old is back in training and although he still has some way to go before he reaches match fitness, his time is fast approaching.<br><br>Allardyce said: 'He has started a little bit of football work on his own, which is obviously very pleasing for him more than anybody else.<br><br>'It's nice to get a feel of the ball and start kicking it again.<br><br>'No doubt we will have to hold him back and make sure the medical team push him along the right way and not do it too quickly.<br><br>'I think he is going to be okay. We just have to do every session with him and if there is no discomfort in that area, then we will push on a little bit further and a little bit further each day.'<br></div>
