The Arsenal boss has also questioned the BluesÂ’ right to carry on despite heavy financial losses.</strong><br><br>Wenger said: Â“It is not me who is suspicious. This is a problem which has been raised by the president of the Dutch football federation.Â” Wenger is concerned by rumours PSVÂ’s Brazilian defender Alex is secretly owned by the Blues.<br><br>He added: Â“The Chelsea connection is a concern but no one really knows what is at the bottom of things. Â“There seems to be an arrangement but I donÂ’t know what legal relationship exists. Â“ItÂ’s very difficult to control and that is why the ownership of players has to be made clear. Â“We have an agreement with the Belgian club Beveren but the big difference is they donÂ’t play in the Champions League.<br><br>Â“Chelsea and PSV are playing in the same competition.Â” Wenger also voiced his concerns about ChelseaÂ’s ability to carry on absorbing huge losses Â— Â£300million in three years Â— due to the generosity of billionaire owner Roman Abramovich.<br><br>He said: Â“I have said many times all clubs should be balanced by their natural resources. Â“That means you can only spend what youÂ’ve got coming in. Â“With normal mathematics, to lose Â£80m in one year would leave you 80 miles below the surface of the water.<br><br>Â“To survive so deep is normally very difficult. But for Chelsea it is viable because they have the support of a super-sponsor. Â“But is it right for any business, not only in football, to have that kind of artificial income?<br><br>Â“And is it right for a club to be so reliant on one man?Â”<br><br></div>

Mourinho insists he should not be judged on whether he carries off EuropeÂ’s biggest prize with Chelsea Â— because Wenger has never done it for Arsenal.</strong><br><br>But on the eve of the BluesÂ’ last-16 clash at his former club Porto, Mourinho said: Â“Many great managers in the world have never won it Â— a big example is not far from us. Arsene Wenger is a big manager in the world of football. HeÂ’s a top manager and heÂ’s never done it.Â”<br><br>Wenger yesterday questioned ChelseaÂ’s unfair spending power. But Mourinho pointed out how he won the trophy with the unfashionable Portuguese club in 2004. And he added: Â“If you judge my Chelsea career on whether I win the Champions League with them you will have to judge all the other coaches in the competition who have never won it.<br><br>Â“IÂ’ve already done it once so IÂ’m in front of a lot of them. Â“If I have pressure imagine the other managers in the world and what they feel. ItÂ’s important I did it once, I feel no pressure. "I felt more when I was coach at Porto. IÂ’ve nothing else to prove.Â”<br><br>Mourinho won the Champions League and UEFA Cup at Porto while Wenger has lost the three European finals he has contested Â— the Cup WinnersÂ’ Cup at Monaco and the Champions League and UEFA Cup with Arsenal.<br><br>The pair will renew hostilities in Cardiff on Sunday when they contest the Carling Cup Final.</div>

Mourinho boasted ahead of this SundayÂ’s Carling Cup final between Chelsea and Arsenal how he has won EuropeÂ’s biggest prize while the GunnersÂ’ chief has not.</strong><br><br>But Wenger hit back and argued there are managers in the French Second Division equal to the BluesÂ’ boss. Wenger, who has never beaten Mourinho in six matches, said: Â“Plenty of managers have won the Champions League who will not be considered as great managers.<br><br>Â“And there are plenty of people working in France in Divisions Two or Three who I rate very highly, because what they do is sensational. They are fantastic. Â“I enjoy what I do. My obsession is not to be compared. I try to help people who are at Arsenal Football Club.<br><br>Â“The importance of the manager is over the longer distance, the continuity in his career. Can he get good teams together and play in a certain style? Â“What is important is that you look at careers over 10, 15 or 20 years. What kind of quality have you brought in your work and on what consistent level you have done it.<br><br>Â“I have an honest commitment everywhere and, after that, whether people judge IÂ’m great or small or half-great or half-small is down to them. Â“It will not change my life if I donÂ’t win the Champions League. Â“We played a whole season unbeaten yet you did not see me every week jumping on the tables.Â”<br><br>Wenger also had a shock lift for WatfordÂ’s Aidy Boothroyd. The Frenchman said: Â“I feel as well maybe the Watford manager has as much merit as I have. ItÂ’s very difficult to judge.Â”<br></div>
