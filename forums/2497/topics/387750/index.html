              <p>Tom Hicks Jnr has been forced to resign from the board of Liverpool after an amazing email attack on a supporter.</p>
              <p>Stephen Horner wrote to Hicks Jnr to express his concerns over the lack of transfer funds for boss Rafael Benitez. First, Horner was branded an "idiot". Then a second response from Hicks jnr said: "Blow me, ****face. Go to hell. I'm sick of you."</p>
              <p>In a statement on their official website read: "Liverpool Football Club today announce that Thomas Hicks Jr has resigned as a director of both the club and its parent company Kop Holdings.</p>
              <p>"Three new directors have been elected to the boards of both companies. These are Philip Nash, LFC Chief Financial Officer; Ian Ayre, LFC Commercial Director; and Casey Coffman, Executive Vice President of Hicks Holdings."</p>
              <p>Fans' organisation The Spirit of Shankly (SoS) had already called for Hicks jnr to resign.</p>
              <p>An SoS statement had read: "Spirit of Shankly, the Liverpool supporters' union, are calling for the resignation of LFC board member Tom Hicks Jnr after his foul-mouthed response to a union member's polite enquiry about the funding challenge facing Rafael Benitez during this transfer window.</p>
              <p>"Not only did Hicks Jnr label the enquirer an 'idiot', he followed this up with an expletive-ridden tirade.</p>
              <p>"This behaviour comes from a director of a club that has prided itself on its relationship with its fans over the years, a club that has had managers, directors and staff who have recognised the respect that is essential between the club's board, staff and its fans.</p>
              <p>"We call upon Mr. Hicks Jnr to recognise his shortcomings, not only as an individual but, more importantly, as a 'custodian' of the club, and to do what any honourable person would do and resign."</p>
              <p>Hicks Jnr did offer his apologies to the fan over the foul-mouthed tirade. He said: "I apologise for losing my temper and using bad language with you. It was a kneejerk reaction. Tommy."</p>
              <p>Tom Hicks Snr and George Gillett have been the subject of the Liverpool fans ire for most of their time in control of the club since taking over in 2007. The actions of Hicks Jnr are hardly likely to help.</p>
              <p>Added to that, Benitez admitted on Sunday that he could be forced to sell star striker Fernando Torres in the summer should the club fail to make it back into the Champions League. That could be the final straw for many supporters, angry over the way the club has been run and the level of debt Hicks and Gillett have piled onto the books.</p>
              <p>Purslow, Nash and Ayre have played increasingly important roles in the last few months as they work towards putting the club on a healthier financial footing.</p>
              <p>That has already led to the signing of a new shirt sponsorship deal with Standard Chartered Bank worth around £80 million.</p>
              <p>One of Purslow's priorities since taking over from Rick Parry in June last year has been to find new investment in the club as they seek to get the funding in place to build a new stadium.</p>
              <p>Hicks Jr had no real input into decision-making at the club on a daily basis and so his departure will not affect on-going plans.</p>
