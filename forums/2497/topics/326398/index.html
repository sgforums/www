              <p><a href="/news/story?id=559868&amp;sec=england&amp;cc=5739"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/soccernet_es/villa412.jpg" border="0" alt="David Villa: On of three players Spurs are targeting" width="412" height="232"></a></p>
              <p><em>David Villa a triple swoop target ?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur manager Juande Ramos will continue his summer spending spree with a triple swoop for David Villa, Andrei Arshavin and Vedran Corluka, according to reports in the UK press.</strong></p>
              <p>However, if Spurs want to secure all three deals they will have to stump up another £60million, having already spent £40million on five players during the transfer window. <em>The Sun</em> claim that Tottenham are ready to smash the British transfer record with a sensational £32million swoop for Valencia striker Villa and will fund the bid with the sale of want-away striker Dimitar Berbatov to Manchester United for £30million.</p>
              <p>Real Madrid are also interested in signing the Spanish international, who helped <em>La Rojas</em> win Euro 2008, but Villa's agent Jose Luis Tamargo insists his client is keen to head to the Premier League.</p>
              <p>'David likes London and likes how Spurs play under Ramos. If they present an offer, Valencia will seriously study the subject,' Tamargo said. If the deal goes through Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will make the striker the club's top earner with a huge £100,000-a-week deal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44808000/jpg/_44808597_arshavin_203_get.jpg" border="0" alt="Andrei Arshavin" width="203" height="152"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, <em>The Independent</em> claim Zenit St Petersburg playmaker Arshavin is on his way to White Hart Lane after the Russian club lowered their asking price of £21million. Tottenham have offered £15.6m for Arshavin but, having banked around £20m for Robbie Keane could easily increase their offer to an acceptable level.</p>
              <p>Arshavin has told Zenit that he wants to leave and the Russian club's president Alexander Dyukov is due to meet with the player's agent, Dennis Lachter, in Madrid to discuss the Russia international's future.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old forward has rejected an improved contract offer from Zenit and although the £50,000-a-week deal at Tottenham is not the most lucrative on offer Arshavin still wants to move to London.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00378/Vedran_Corluka_378810a.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="312"></p>
              <p>Spurs boss Ramos is also set to boost his defence with the £6.8 million capture of Croatian international Corluka from Manchester City, according to <em>The Times</em>. The continuing fitness concerns about captain Ledley King and the erratic form of Michael Dawson means a defender is a high priority for Tottenham.</p>
              <p>Although Corluka played as a right-back at Eastland's last season Ramos views the versatile defender as a long term central-defensive partner for Jonathan Woodgate.</p>
              <p>Spurs have been very busy rebuilding the side this summer under former Seville coach Ramos: England's David Bentley, Croatian star Luka Modric, PSV keeper Gomes, Barcelona's Giovanni Dos Santos and Crystal Palace starlet John Bostock have already joined the club.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p class="byline"> </p>
              <p class="byline"><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/DeanAshton460.jpg" alt="Dean Ashton" width="460" height="276"></p>
              <p class="byline"> </p>
              <p><strong>West Ham United have turned down an offer of £15m from Tottenham for the striker Dean Ashton. The east London club have insisted that Ashton is not for sale yet Tottenham, who are preparing for life without Dimitar Berbatov, believe that a bid closer to £20m might force their hand. They are considering whether to return with an improved offer or move on to other targets.</strong></p>
              <p>Tottenham have sold Robbie Keane to Liverpool for £20m and with Berbatov itching to complete a transfer to Manchester United, the club need reinforcements. Having moved Jermain Defoe to Portsmouth in January for £9m, their only other striker is Darren Bent.</p>
              <p>Tottenham's fantasy signing is David Villa, the Valencia and Spain striker, who was the Golden Boot winner at the European Championship in June. Valencia are in a parlous financial situation and need to sell players in order to balance their books. They value Villa at €35m (£27.7m).</p>
              <p>He would prefer to remain in Spain and switch to Real Madrid or Barcelona but neither club is expected to move for him. The Premier League, however, holds appeal for him, where Tottenham are his principal suitor. Juande Ramos, Tottenham's Spanish manager, is considered a trump card for them while his Spanish-speaking assistant, Gus Poyet, is also a confirmed admirer of Villa.</p>
              <p>It would be unthinkable for West Ham supporters to see Ashton, the England international, depart for Tottenham, not only because of his talent but because it would sorely stretch Alan Curbishley. He is looking forward to pairing Ashton with Craig Bellamy, although the latter is struggling with a hamstring injury which he picked up at Ipswich Town on Monday night. His other options extend little further than Carlton Cole and the 18-year-old Freddie Sears. West Ham's chief executive Scott Duxbury caught the mood when he claimed: "Hell would have to freeze over for us to sell Dean to a major rival."</p>

              <p>i am not sure whether the news are fabricated or real.</p>
              <p>i dont think tottenham can go after so many striker. Villa, asharvin, ashton. the   problems, these 3 strikers are all different type.</p>
              <p>is ramos really knowing what he buying?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>berbatov 30 million? whuchever club pay that kind of money are indeed fools. i hope that fool is not man utd!.</p>
              <p>Ramos and rafa( R&amp;R) are fools in the transfer market.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>if a proven striker like Villa is indeed available for 32m i dun see why ManU would want to go for Berbatov for 30m? Fergie seems to be getting abit lost getting players that can fit into ManU's system.. or rather probably this system is a brainchild of his ex-assistance hence he wouldn't quite get into the entire running of it.. and is not able to get the type of players suitable for it... but pls prove me wrong!! and make sure you guys will be there in the running come end of the season.. having more teams still in the running will make the finale alot more exicting...   </p></div>
