              <p>Former Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein believes the Gunners are no
              longer certain to qualify for the Champions League as in the past.</p>
              <p>"When I left (in 2007) I said it was only because I could see what was on the horizon," he told <em>Radio Five's Sportsweek</em> programme.</p>
              <p>"I said it was in danger of slipping and I think that's what is happening at the moment and it has to be contained.</p>
              <p>"This season is one of the most delicate in that they are fighting for their Champions League place.</p>
              <p>"The first goal is to get that Champions League place. Five points
              behind Aston Villa is a mini-mountain to climb but there is talent
              there and there is resolve. They can do it."</p>
              <p>When pressed about his own future plans he said: "I'm there for
              every home game, I still see the boys playing and still get a
              tremendous feeling of entertainment because I still feel part of it.</p>
              <p>"I'm an Arsenal fan through and through. I've been offered many
              glamorous opportunities with other clubs but I'm not looking for a
              24/7, 365-days-a year job and Arsenal is my only club."</p>
              <p>Dein believes boss Arsene Wenger would be an almost impossible figure to replace.</p>
              <p>"I call him the miracle worker," said Dein.</p>
              <p>"He does it year-in, year-out and for 12 years we've been in the
              Champions League every year. That's not easy and it's getting harder.</p>
              <p>"He does get stressed but you don't see it. He conceals it
              brilliantly. His external persona is calm, collected, pensive. He's
              such a professional.</p>
              <p>"I think only he can say when he feels he's had enough of putting on a tracksuit and a stopwatch in the morning.</p>
              <p>"The easiest thing to do is to get rid of someone. The clever
              thing is to find someone better. He would certainly be a hard act to
              follow."</p>

              <p>well, you never know.. same as when SAF retires, you will never know what you will get.</p>
              <p>but who knows, perhaps a change of fresh air and propel gunners to greater heights leh.. who can see the future? but at present, they are just happy to be in their comfort zone...</p>
