              <p><em>CROUCH ... all-round talent blossomed</em></p>
              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">I SHOULD probably thank Rafa Benitez for making Peter Crouch the player he is 
              today.</h2>
              <p class="article">We play Liverpool on Sunday and Crouchie's time with the club put him on a 
              different level.</p>
              <p class="article">He'd already had spells at Spurs, Portsmouth and Villa - where he was even 
              sent out on loan to Norwich after failing to get regular games.</p>
              <p class="article">Then I took him to Southampton to replace James Beattie. But moving to Anfield 
              from Southampton was the making of him.</p>
              <p class="article">No disrespect to Southampton and Villa but he stepped up a level there, 
              eventually achieving the sort of form that got him established in the 
              England team.</p>
              <p class="article">Typical of this his first hat-trick for Liverpool against Arsenal - one from a 
              header, one from his right foot and one from his left. It showed what an 
              all-round player he had become.</p>
              <p class="article">At the time a lot of people thought it was a strange signing by Liverpool 
              because he was a bit of an unsung player. But now supporters appreciate his 
              talent.</p>
              <p class="article">I'm sure he and Fernando Torres would have made a great partnership up front. 
              But when Rafa signed Torres, Crouchie decided to move on and join me back at 
              Portsmouth.</p>
              <p class="article">But if you ask him, he would be the first to admit that playing in front of 
              the Kop at Anfield is a massive part of his career.</p>
              <p class="article">I've always liked him, which is why I wanted him at Spurs. He's a fantastic 
              professional.</p>
              <p class="article">Earlier this season I left him out against Burnley but there was no sulking. 
              Instead he was in the dressing-room shaking hands with the team and wishing 
              them all the best.</p>
              <p class="article">Now he's back in the team and playing terrifically well.</p>
              <p class="article">Robbie Keane was at Liverpool as well, of course. It didn't work out so well 
              for him but his record speaks for itself at Spurs and I'm sure both of them 
              will be looking forward to going up to Liverpool on Sunday.</p>
              <p class="article">There is nowhere like Anfield when the Kop is in full voice.</p>
              <p class="article">Â </p>
              <p class="article">Whenever I'm asked where I would buy a season ticket to watch football I 
              always say Anfield - other than White Hart Lane, of course!</p>
              <p class="article">I used to love going to watch Jamie play there because the atmosphere is 
              second to none.</p>
              <p class="article">I still don't think we should write Liverpool off for the fourth Champions' 
              League place.</p>
              <p class="article">Seven teams will be scrapping it out for the top four spots including us, 
              Villa and Manchester City. But Liverpool will be the ones to beat if Torres 
              and Steven Gerrard stay fit.</p>
              <p class="article">And if I had to stake my life on it, I would still make Liverpool favourites 
              for fourth.</p>
              <p class="article">Their performances this season have been suprising. But teams have good and 
              bad runs - everyone was writing Arsenal off a few weeks ago but now they are 
              in the mix again.</p>
              <p class="article">This season's title race is one of the most open I can remember with Chelsea 
              and Manchester United both stuttering a bit.</p>
              <p class="article">But from the fans' point that just makes the Premier League all the more 
              interesting.</p>
