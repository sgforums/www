              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lampard</span></strong></p>
              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>BIG PHIL SCOLARI will put his arm around Frank Lampard and tell him: Chelsea love you more than Mourinho.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">SunSport can reveal the new Blues boss plans face-to-face talks with Lamps as soon as Portugal’s interest in Euro 2008 is over.</p>
              <p class="article">And Scolari will tell Lampard to ignore Inter Milan, who have announced the England midfielder is their No1 target.</p>
              <p class="article">Inter’s interest in Lampard went sky-high once former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho took over at the San Siro.</p>
              <p class="article">But Scolari has had a long talk with Blues and Portugal centre-half Ricardo Carvalho and the coach wants to build a team around Lampard.</p>
              <p class="article">A source in the Portugal camp revealed: “Scolari is a shrewd operator and has done his homework on the players he has inherited at Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">“He knows all about Lampard’s contract situation and his personal circumstances at the end of last season.</p>
              <p class="article">“But he wants him to be his main man in midfield and enjoy the challenge of working with a new coach.</p>
              <p class="article">“Phil knows that Lampard has been crucial to Chelsea’s success under Mourinho and wants him to be part of the new era.”</p>
              <p class="article">Inter president Massimo Moratti admitted yesterday that the England midfielder is their top priority this summer.</p>
              <p class="article">Moratti said: “We like Lampard and he’s our No1 objective. Mourinho likes Lampard a lot. We all know that he’s a great player. I think there has been contact with Chelsea but I don’t know yet.”</p>
              <p class="article">SunSport understands Chelsea have rebuffed Inter’s approach.</p>
              <p class="article">And they will not entertain a bid until they have spoken to Lampard about a new deal, which is unlikely to happen before the beginning of July.</p>
              <p class="article">Lampard’s current contract sees his wages increase to £131,000 per week next season.</p>
              <p class="article">That will make him joint top earner at Stamford Bridge, alongside skipper John Terry.</p>
              <p class="article">Any new deal will have to take that figure as a starting point.</p>
              <p class="article">While Mourinho and Scolari could become involved in a fight for Lampard, the Special One has backed Big Phil’s decision to join Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">Some critics have claimed Scolari has harmed Portugal’s bid for Euro 2008 glory by announcing he is off.</p>
              <p class="article">But Mourinho declared: “Who dares criticise Portugal’s coach?</p>
              <p class="article">“Would any worker presented with a fantastic offer of work say: ‘I don’t want to, I love my job a lot and I am not interested in change even if it triples my pay?’</p>
              <p class="article">“How can a superclub like Chelsea be publicly without a coach for any longer?</p>
              <p class="article">“For me everything was normal and even if voices are raised if Portugal are eliminated, I think Scolari acted naturally.</p>
              <p class="article">“He had a better financial proposal, a huge sporting project and it was impossible for him to postpone or conceal his choice.”</p>
              <p></p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>PORTUGAL star Deco has told Ronaldinho: “Come and join me at Chelsea.”</strong></p>
              <p class="article">Barcelona midfielder Deco, 30, is on the brink of sealing a £12million move to Stamford Bridge once Euro 2008 finishes.</p>
              <p class="article">And he told 28-year-old Barcelona pal Ronnie, who is also on his way out of the Nou Camp, Chelsea would give him the chance to revive his flagging career.</p>
              <p class="article">Deco said: “It would be good for Chelsea to sign Ronaldinho.</p>
              <p class="article">“He would go to a great club and I would love to see him playing in the Champions League for a great team, and showing he is still the best player in the world.”</p>
              <p class="article">Deco admitted Chelsea are interesting in signing him but insisted he has not spoken to new Blues boss Big Phil Scolari about a move to London.</p>
              <p class="article">Brazilian Scolari will quit Portugal and take charge at the Bridge following Euro 2008 — and Deco is believed to be one of his top targets.</p>
              <p class="article">But the Brazilian-born midfielder said: “There is interest from Chelsea, although Scolari has not told me anything.</p>
              <p class="article">“Now we’re talking with Barca. Naturally, there are other possibilities.”</p>
              <p class="article">Deco is adamant there will be no problem in leaving Barcelona, even though president Joan Laporta is facing a vote of no confidence that could delay talks with Chelsea.</p>
              <p class="article">And Deco added: “I don’t see why it would be bad for negotiations because even though I’ve not spoken to Laporta, he’s still the president.”</p>

              <h1>Liverpool wrap up Degen capture</h1>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">Switzerland full-back Philipp Degen has officially completed his move to Liverpool after putting pen to paper on a four-year deal at Anfield.</span></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/08/05/330/PhilippDegen_884570.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></span></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span><span id="intelliTXT"> </span></span></p>
              <p>Degen was available on a Bosman deal after opting against signing a new contract at Borussia Dortmund.</p>
              <p>Liverpool confirmed in May that Degen was on his way to Anfield and the right-back on Thursday signed his four-year contract.</p>
              <p>He was part of Switzerland's Euro 2008 squad and will vie with Alvaro Arbeloa and Steve Finnan for a starting spot next season.</p>
              <p>At the time of the signing, Reds boss Rafa Benitez admitted it was important to pick up free transfers in order to use his money on other areas of the squad.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes you can find these players on the market," said Benitez on the club's official website.</p>
              <p>"When you find a player like him who costs no money it means you can use money for improving other parts of the squad.</p>
              <p>"He is a good signing, a player of potential, who can help us improve in the wide areas."</p>
