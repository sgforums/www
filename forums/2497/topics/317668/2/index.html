              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7"><strong>CRISTIANO RONALDO confirmed he WILL sign a new deal at Manchester United next week.</strong></p>
              <p class="article">The Portugal superstar, 23, finally quashed all the speculation about his future — which has been driven by Real Madrid’s fanzines.</p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo said: “My future will be clear next week. Everyone will be pleased — my club as well as me.</p>
              <p class="article">“I think I will definitely be here next season. Yes, I want to stay.</p>
              <p class="article">“I have played five years for this club and I’d love to stay here.</p>
              <p class="article">“I love the people, the players are fantastic, the atmosphere is unbelievable, the staff are great. That is the reason I want to stay.</p>
              <p class="article">“We won the most important trophies this season. I want to do it again next season but no one knows the future.</p>
              <p class="article">“I want to stay, I feel very happy in the club. I win trophies, the people are friendly, supporters are amazing, everything is fun for me. It’s very good.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ferguson’s assistant Carlos Queiroz was equally categorical about Ronaldo’s future.</p>
              <p class="article">Queiroz said: “Without doubt he will continue with United. He’s very happy with us, he has a contract and there is no fear or worry he will go.”</p>
              <p class="article">Ronaldo admitted it has been an astonishing turnaround since he became Public Enemy No 1 following his World Cup spat with Wayne Rooney two summers ago.</p>
              <p class="article">Back then he had publicly demanded a move to Madrid because he felt boss Alex Ferguson and owner Malcolm Glazer had not protected him after the Rooney row.</p>
              <p class="article">Now the undisputed King of English football admits the situation has turned in his favour.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: “After the last two years I feel the English people have been friendly to me. I enjoy playing in England but no one knows the future.”</p>
              <p class="article">But as far as the immediate future is concerned Ronaldo was adamant — he WILL stay at United. He said: “This is a young team and we have everything to win next year.</p>
              <p class="article">“We want to win the Champions League again and we have a good chance. We have a good team spirit.”</p>
              <p class="article">The 42-goal wizard is now favourite to be crowned European and World Footballer of the Year in December.</p>
              <p class="article">Yet he insisted: “Of course I can get better. The goals are not the most important thing. Maybe I will play well next year but I won’t score as many goals.</p>
              <p class="article">“But I’m going to try to do my best. Every season I’ve improved and I want to improve next year.”</p>

              <p class="article">The Spurs boss is on the verge of striking a deal with the French champions for their experienced stopper.</p>
              <p class="article">Coupet, 35, will be France’s first choice at Euro 2008 and will come in to give England’s Paul Robinson competition.</p>

              <p class="article">It is understood Coupet will not arrive with any assurance of being first choice as Ramos wants to encourage a battle for Spurs’ No 1 shirt between the Frenchman and Robinson.</p>
              <p class="article">Capturing Coupet, who has starred in all of Lyon’s seven consecutive Championnat titles, is a major coup for Ramos.</p>

              <p class="article">The Sevilla full-back has been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham.</p>
              <p class="article">But the Brazil star, 25, has his heart set on a move to the Catalan giants and has issued a come-and-get-me plea to new Barca boss Pep Guardiola.</p>
              <p class="article">Alves said: "As I have said more than once it would be an honour and a pleasure to be able to play for Barca.</p>
              <p class="article">“I am just waiting for concrete news and hope that things can move as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p class="article">"The truth is that it is a bit more complicated than it seemed.</p>
              <p class="article">"It does not depend on me and when that happens things are more difficult.</p>
              <p class="article">"I think that I am ready to join a major club. I have been at Sevilla for five-and-a-half years and a lot of things have happened.</p>
              <p class="article">"I have matured a lot and I have been waiting for this moment for two years now."</p>
              <p class="article">Alves also revealed he is a huge fan of Guardiola and even watched the ex-Barca midfielder when he was growing up.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "He is spectacular. I love football and I always watched Barca against Madrid when I was younger.</p>
              <p class="article">“In Brazil he was considered to be one of the best in his position.</p>
              <p class="article">"He was a great player and I have no doubt that he will be a great coach.”</p>
              <p class="article">Seville president Jose Maria del Nido rejected Chelsea’s £28m bid for Alves last summer and the player himself admits his high valuation may scare some clubs off.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “It is difficult to put a price on my work.</p>
              <p class="article">"It is the president who must do that. Where I go is what I decide.</p>
              <p class="article">“I will say where I go. My future is down to me and nobody else, but the price is down to him.</p>
              <p class="article">"Last year he rejected an offer that was far too much. But I cannot do anything about that if someone wants to pay that."</p>
