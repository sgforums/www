              <p class="article">The Chelsea midfielder roared: “I can state straight away that we will contend for all titles next season. “The new manager will push us to compete for everything. I know we will come back for the new campaign refreshed with a hunger for revenge.”</p>
              <p class="article">Brazilian legend <strong>PELE</strong> insisted: “Luiz is a great coach and can lead any team in the world. I’m sure the job will go well as he gets good results wherever he goes. Any side would want him.”</p>
              <p class="article">Brazil World-Cup winner <strong>RIVALDO</strong> said: “Scolari demands total discipline and he likes to have direct contact with the players. “I don’t think he will change when he is in England — he will be a success.</p>
              <p class="article">“This is very good news for Chelsea and for the English game.” Blues players are excited about the Brazilian’s arrival.</p>
              <p class="article">Keeper <strong>PETR CECH</strong> said: “Scolari has great charisma, great experience and great results. I am looking forward to working with him.”</p>
              <p class="article">Portugal defender <strong>PAULO FERREIRA </strong>added: “He is a good boss and he can do a job. It will be good for the club as a whole.”</p>
              <p class="article">And Brazilian ace <strong>JULIANO BELLETTI </strong>revealed: “He is very intelligent. He will know how to deal with everything.</p>
              <p class="article">“He was responsible for putting me in the national team in the 2002 World Cup. “It will be great for Chelsea to have a Brazilian boss.”</p>

              <h1>Scolari's Blueprint - Kaka tops the bill at £60m along with Ribery and Torres</h1>
              <p><a class="addStoriesLink" rel="1026107_3" href="http://sgforums.com/sport/football/article-1026107/Scolaris-Blueprint--Kaka-tops-60m-Ribery-Torres.html"><span style="color: #0b9cc6;"><img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/06/12/article-0-0196226E00000578-207_468x286.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="286"></span></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Luiz Felipe Scolari believes he can use his Brazilian influence to persuade Kaka to sign for Chelsea in a world record £60million move from AC Milan. Sportsmail can reveal that Chelsea will intensify their pursuit of the World Player of the Year after the forward was made the club's top target during the new manager's talks with chief executive Peter Kenyon last week. </strong></p>
              <p>Fernando Torres, of Liverpool and Spain, is a firm target and Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery, France's dynamic midfielder, has also been flattered by Chelsea's formal approach.</p>
              <div class="clear">
              <p>Milan will be determined to keep Kaka, who signed a five-year contract in March, but Chelsea have received some encouragement from the forward. Milan missed out on a place in the Champions League after finishing fifth in Serie A last season and Kaka, who was a member of Brazil's 2002 World Cup-winning squad, is considering the move.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are prepared to offer Didier Drogba and Andriy Shevchenko in partexchange, but money will be no object this summer. The club are determined to make three 'mind-blowing' signings.</p>
              <p>Scolari approved the approaches during his meeting with Kenyon but the future of others will not be clear until he takes up the manager's post on July 1. Chelsea confirmed that the deal to make Scolari manager was concluded last Friday. He will bring a number of coaching staff with him and the future of assistant manager Steve Clarke is no longer clear after Scolari told Kenyon he will make a decision on his role only after he has met the Scot.</p>
