              <p><strong>Robinho's representatives want Pele to to clarify his position after comments attributed to him suggested the Manchester City striker used drugs.</strong></p>
              <p>The Manchester City frontman has already strenuously denied any link to recreational substances. And now the former Real Madrid star's camp have called on Pele to clarify his position or face the threat of legal action.</p>
              <p>Robinho's representatives told his official website: "A formal retraction from Pele will be requested, if what he said was not misinterpreted by the media that published it. "And if Pele does not come forward, he will have to deal with his very unfortunate comment in court.</p>
              <p>"Robinho is upset and disappointed at Pele, who seems to have forgotten the great idol he was and that it appears Pele must be reading sensationalist medias, to come up with such a wrongful statement."</p>
              <p>The striker's agent, Juan Figer, has confirmed he is keen to hold urgent talks with Pele to clarify the situation. Figer said: "What Pele said doesn't have sense at all. "We are waiting to speak with Pele to make clear what he said because we are sure that there is a misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>"Robinho never used drugs." Pele's reported comments came after the 68-year-old was allegedly recorded without his knowledge at a private event in Brazil, before being broadcast on Brazilian radio and reported elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Robinho moved to Manchester City in a British-record £32.5million move from Real on the final day of the summer transfer window.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Pele was reported to have said: "Maradona was a negative example. He was an excellent player and, unfortunately, look at what happened to him.</p>
              <p>"Most journalists talk about drugs in football, but in truth there are very few cases of this. It isn't fair to talk about drugs in football just because of one or two cases, like with what happened with ... Robinho, who had this problem."</p>

              <p>The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/manchestercity"><span style="color: #005689;">Manchester City</span></a> forward Robinho has demanded a formal apology from Pele after the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/brazil"><span style="color: #005689;">Brazil</span></a> legend reportedly claimed he had taken drugs. The comments have caused a sensation in Brazil, but left Robinho bemused, and his representatives are now demanding Pele retract the remarks.</p>
