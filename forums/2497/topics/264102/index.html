All the speculation that is flying around is difficult to cope with, but it is something we will have to try to find out over the next few days.<br><br>"When Oba comes back, we will sit down and say, 'What exactly is the situation?' and if he has any problems, try to resolve them and hopefully persuade him Newcastle is the place for him next season."<br><br>Allardyce has no such plans to meet with Owen, as he is confident of keeping the England striker.<br><br>"I don't think there is any need to speak to Michael - that was all covered weeks and weeks ago, as far as I was concerned.<br><br>"There has been no speculation regarding Michael since then. Now it has moved on to Oba and when that sort of clause is inserted in a contract, those are the sort of players that bring up more speculation than everybody else."</div>
