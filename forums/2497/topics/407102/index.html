              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> <strong>10) Alessandro Del Piero to Inter</strong><br><br>A couple of years ago <strong>Goal.com</strong> broke the news that Inter had signed Del Piero. Unsurprisingly, the  
              website was flooded with comments from terrified Bianconeri fans who  
              couldn’t believe their club legend of almost two decades had joined the 
               enemy. Those who read the story properly realised that it wasn’t  
              Alessandro moving to Inter, but a 14-year-old unrelated Treviso  
              youngster called Jago Del Piero. As one reader stated: “I almost had a  
              heart attack.” And that is exactly what would happen to some Juve  
              supporters were the real Del Boy to transfer to San Siro.<br><br><strong>9) Giovanni Trapattoni to France</strong><br><br>Without
               doubt the most  controversial moment of 2009 was the ‘Hand of Henry’ - 
              the most infamous  World Cup handball of all time after Diego Maradona’s
               ‘Hand of God’ in  1986. Ireland’s World Cup playoff against France was 
              delicately balanced  as the tie moved into extra time in Paris, with the
               score 1-1 on  aggregate. <br><br>Then, France striker Thierry Henry 
              clearly handled  the ball in the run-up to William Gallas' decisive 
              equaliser on the  night, but it was not seen by the referee or his 
              assistants.<br><br>The  goal stood and the Irish went out, causing a 
              furore after the game. The  FAI later made a request to FIFA that the 
              game be replayed, but FIFA  turned them down. Henry was lambasted, and 
              even unsuccessfully offered a  replay himself after FIFA had made their 
              decision. The FAI asked to be  admitted as the 33rd nation in South 
              Africa. Unsurprisingly this was  turned down too. Ireland coach Giovanni
               Trapattoni was understandably  distraught, now picture him on the 
              French bench in the future…<br><br><strong>8) Pele to Boca Juniors</strong><br><br>Just
               as Francesco Totti is Roma,  and Franz Beckenbauer is Bayern Munich, 
              Diego Armando Maradona is Boca  Juniors. Now picture the look on 
              Dieguito’s face if his eternal nemesis  Pele was appointed as a coach, 
              director or – even worse – a player for  the Buenos Aires giants. The 
              two South American greats have endured a  tumultuous relationship for 
              many years, both fighting over the title of  ‘world’s greatest ever 
              player’. <br><br><br>
              </span></p><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://u.goal.com/37100/37166_hp.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <br><br>Pele has accused Maradona of being a bad  role model to young 
              children, while the Argentine claims that the  Brazilian “debuted with a
               lad” and is part of FIFA’s “devil” politics.  Neapolitan chants of Pele È Meglio 'E Maradona would send the Napoli  legend over the edge.<br><br><strong>7) Diego Maradona to River Plate</strong><br><br>This
                transfer is about as unlikely as Maradona playing for Santos, or  
              coaching Brazil or England. Diego’s love for Boca Juniors is well known,
                as is his socialist support for the working man. With River Plate’s  
              upper-class origins, stomaching any kind of involvement with Los  
              Millionarios would be tougher for Maradona than being told he was  
              becoming Chairman of America’s Federal Reserve.<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><strong><br><br>6) Sol Campbell to Arsenal </strong></span><br><br>Actually, it did happen. But it should have been impossible.<br><br>The
               most controversial transfer in Premier League history saw Campbell move
               across North London to join Arsene Wenger's Arsenal from bitter foes 
              Tottenham Hotspur. Promises from the then England international that he 
              would never make the switch and recriminations at the loss of £20 
              million in Spurs' coffers see emotions run high to this day.<br><br>Hate-filled
               chants followed Campbell even during his time at Portsmouth, with 
              several Spurs fans being arrested for the content of their vile terrace 
              anthems. But, Campbell’s five years at Arsenal were a huge success on 
              the pitch as he won two Premier Leagues and three FA Cups. He moved back
               last season to the Gunners for a short 14-game spell. Now we can say 
              that a future return to White Hart Lane as a Spurs player is impossible.<br><br><strong>5) Byron Moreno to Italian Football Federation</strong><br><br>Italy
               were eliminated from the 2002 World Cup in the last 16 by co-hosts 
              South Korea following former Perugia star Ahn Jung-Hwan’s extra time 
              golden goal.<br><br>However, this all happened after one of the most 
              infamous matches in World Cup history. Trapattoni’s men had a perfectly 
              good golden goal disallowed by Ecuadorian referee Byron Moreno, had 
              Francesco Totti sent-off for diving when replays showed that he had only
               lost his footing, while South Korea were awarded a questionable penalty
               and continually went unpunished for foul play. After the match Italy 
              declared that there had been a conspiracy against them, claims that were
               given strength by the fact that not only had they had four perfectly 
              fair goals disallowed in their two previous matches against Croatia and 
              Mexico, but by the refereeing errors that saw Korea eliminate Spain in 
              the next round.<br><br>Moreno would be the villainous symbol of 2002. 
              Later that year he received a 20 match ban, after he played an extra 13 
              minutes of stoppage time during a match between Deportiva Universita de 
              Quito and Barcelona Sporting Club. During this time Deportiva scored 
              twice to turn a 3-2 deficit into a 4-3 victory. After retuning from his 
              suspension, Moreno was suspended again after controversially sending off
               three players in one match. <br><br>He retired from officiating shortly
               after, and remains an infamous symbol in Italy. But what if Moreno was 
              invited to work for the FIGC?<br><br><strong>4) Xavi and Carles Puyol to Real Madrid </strong><br><br>The
               Catalonians are very proud of their autonomy, and never does this 
              become more vivid than when Barcelona clash with Real Madrid in El 
              Clasico. From the two rival regions of Catalonia and Castile, Barcelona 
              vs Real Madrid can be so political that it is seen by some as a 
              re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.<br><br>Were one of the many 
              homegrown stars such as Xavi, Carles Puyol or Josep Guardiola to leave 
              Barca for Real Madrid, it would be regarded as an epic act of betrayal.<br><br><strong>3) Massimo Moratti to Juventus</strong><br><br>The
               Calciopoli scandal of  2006 is shrouded in great mystery, and it could 
              be many years until the  full truth is revealed in the public domain. 
              Interisti claim that  Juventus got what they deserved, in being stripped
               of two Scudetti and  relegated to Serie B, after years of apparent 
              favouritism from referees  during Luciano Moggi’s tenure. Juventini are 
              unanimous in their belief  that Calciopoli was one big conspiracy, as 
              the Bianconeri were never  found guilty of match-fixing and the justice 
              system used to bring them  down was infested with conflicts of interest.<br><br>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://u.goal.com/19200/19207_hp.jpg" alt=""></div>
              <br>According to tifosi, the  conspiracy was masterminded by Inter 
              president Massimo Moratti, who used  his connections with then Telecom 
              Italia chairman Tronchetti Provera  and then FIGC commissioner Guido 
              Rossi – both major Inter shareholders -  to manipulate evidence and down
               Juventus. If Moratti were to ever leave  Inter and become club 
              president of Juve, there would be war in Turin!<br><br><strong>2) Wayne Bridge To Chelsea</strong><br><br>Bridge
               may have been contracted to Chelsea for six years between 2003 and 
              2009, but the chances of him ever returning to Stamford Bridge are about
               as slim as brainwashed environmentalist ignoramuses – fresh off the 
              coldest winter in 30 years - actually waking up and realising that 
              global warming is not man-made, but a scam to tax the public more. John 
              Terry’s affair with Bridge’s ex-girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel, which 
              rocked English football prior to the World Cup, means the pair can never
               be team-mates again.<br><br><strong>1) Francesco Totti to Lazio</strong><br><br>As
               individual symbols go, there is probably not a player in world football
               who signifies his club more emphatically than Totti does Roma. As a 
              football commentator once said, in reference to an English television 
              channel that was only watched for its softcore movies, “Roma are like 
              Channel 5, without the Totti they are nothing”. Born and bred in the 
              Italian capital and a hardcore fan since the day he was born, Totti is 
              the top scorer and appearance maker in the Giallorossi’s history. He has
               had numerous run-ins with city rivals Lazio, infamously making a 
              thumbs-down gesture last season to mock the Biancocelesti’s relegation 
              worries. Can you imagine ‘Er Pupone’ in a Lazio shirt?<br><br>
