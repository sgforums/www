              </strong></p><p><strong>Liverpool striker Fernando Torres suffered a groin injury in Sunday's Premier League game against Blackpool at Anfield.</strong></p><strong>
              </strong><p></p>
              The Spaniard limped out after just nine minutes of the game against Ian Holloway's men, and was replaced by David Ngog.
              <p>"He has a groin strain, but I don't know how severe it is," said manager Roy Hodgson after the 2-1 loss.</p>
              <p>"They (the medical team) are assessing it at the moment. It happened early in the game which came as a surprise to us.</p>
              <p>"We were not aware of any problems with the groin. I don't know if it
               happened during the course of the game when he stretched for the ball. I
               don't really know."</p>

              torres is really injury prone.
              
              he is of no use to the current liverpool.  they should sell him to man city.

              <p>Like I said all along, They should have taken the crazy money $60m or $80m being mentioned from City before the start of the season and used it to buy 3 or 4 very good and useful players instead... Cos this guy is just a plain waste of time and money as he spends more time on the treatment table than on the pitch... And he also prevent the club from getting in a fit and proper no.1 striker... Right now, to accommodate him, the team have to keep an average striker who is willing to sit on the bench and play a bit part when he gets injured. But the quality of this kind of strikers we must say can't be too good otherwise they wouldn't be prepared to be sitting around in spite of the poor quality on the Pool bench right?</p>
              <p>I didn't see the part but I think yesterday, no one even tackled him and he got injured all by himself right?</p>
              <p>This guy makes Micheal Owen looks like a super fit player... lol. He just haven't reach Woodgate's level yet... And the worse part in all this, after this season's performance... I don't think anyone will even mention $80m for him again... Pool's lost by not cashing in on him earlier.</p>

              <p>i differ a bit.</p>
              <p>given how MUFC "suffered" when they sold ronaldo and did not get a capable/similiar transfer to fill his slot. It may have given Pool's board a similar nightmare, of how much money would be invested back into the club when they sell Torres..</p>
              <p>rem, Torres wasn't fit when he went to WC and that snowballed till now, if i am not wrong.</p>
              <p>For me, his mind seems to be gone, and I do hope that he muster enough to bring Pool back to at least top 4 if possible before he even thinks of jumping ship.</p>

              <p><br>That's why it's call a matter of opinion... In my opinion, the board should have cash in on him for the good of the club. Or the manager should have let him go and released useful funds for squad strengthening purpose. Keeping an injury prone player, no matter how good he is, is going to always be a problem more so especially if he is your principle striker.</p>
              <p>Torres was not only unfit before the WC, he was unfit for most of last season... In fact, of his 3 seasons there, this one being the 4th, only his first season was problem free... The 2nd one he started getting injure. The last one (3rd) more often and also more seriously... And now, into the 4th... It now seems like he may just get injure easily even just running on his own without anyone tackling him... </p>
              <p>Like I said, just my opinion but in this type of cases, better play safe and cash in while there is still value as Torres is now into his 4th year on his contract. Otherwise the only loser will be the club who lose out big on a good deal...</p>
              <p>How Torres go on from here is anyone's guess... Can turn out to be good or just plain bad. But looking at his condition... The chances of him not getting injured for the rest of the season kind looks very slim... Cos like I said, just running even on his own he can get injured. And this isn't the first time too, I remember in the final for Spain he also injured himself in the same way towards the end of their match... Lucky his team wasn't made to pay for it as it happened almost at the end of the match. I guess he may have some weak muscular conditions. And players like these could be finish by the time they reach 30 or just before 30.</p>
              <p>So, there is no telling whether it's for the good or bad selling him. But one thing for sure is, the money in the bank won't be a bad thing.</p>
