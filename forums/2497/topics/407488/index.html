              <h1>England's World Cup flops pay the price as Fabio Capello wields axe for Hungary friendly</h1>
              <div id="digg-button" class="float-r hidden">
              
              </div>
              <p>Fabio Capello has 
              signalled the end of an era for a generation of England players by axing
               almost half the World Cup squad who performed so abysmally in South 
              Africa.</p>
              <p>Arsenal youngsters Jack Wilshere and Kieran Gibbs, 
              along with Aston Villa's Ashley Young and Manchester City's Adam 
              Johnson, have been brought into the squad for this week's friendly 
              against Hungary, along with Fulham's Bobby Zamora.</p>
              <p>In all, 13
               players originally selected for the World Cup have been excluded and 
              although the likes of Rio Ferdinand and Jermain Defoe are missing 
              through injury, Robert Green has been punished for his calamitous 
              performance against the USA and Matthew Upson for his equally abject 
              display against Germany.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/08/07/article-0-0AA570D3000005DC-836_468x405.jpg" alt="In: Jack Wilshere has been called up to the England squad to face Hungary " width="468" height="405">

              </div>
              <p>David James has been dropped and Jamie Carragher, Michael Carrick and
              Ledley King also do not feature.</p>
              <p>World Cup wingers Aaron Lennon and Shaun Wright-Phillips have also 
              been ejected, while Theo Walcott, surprisingly dropped for the World 
              Cup, is back.</p>
              <p>Darren Bent returns while Zamora, who would have featured in South 
              Africa had it not been for an achilles operation, is likely to be given 
              his England debut on Wednesday night and replace Emile Heskey, who has 
              retired from international football.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Out: World Cup flop Robert Green has been dropped by Capello </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Peter Crouch, who was barely used in South Africa, is also out, with 
              Capello having seemingly given up on the Spurs striker.</p>
              <p>Steven Warnock, who was a last-minute addition for South Africa, is 
              replaced by Gibbs. Phil Jagielka, Gary Cahill, Wes Brown and Carlton 
              Cole, all called up previously but untainted by the South Africa 
              debacle, are recalled and Michael Dawson, who replaced the injured 
              Ferdinand in the World Cup, is retained.</p>
              <p>Capello has not informed the players he has dropped, even though for 
              the likes of Green and Wright-Phillips it is likely to spell the end of 
              their international careers. However, he is likely to make calls next 
              week to thank dropped players for their service.</p>
              <p>'I just arrived back at work three days ago and I have had to choose
              the players for the squad,' he said. 'After this I will ring these 
              players and thank them for what they did for us.'</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Young Gun: Gibbs has won his first call-up to the full England squad </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Capello has used his first squad since the dreadful South African 
              performances to attempt to draw a line under the past and look forward.</p>
              <p>Gibbs and Wilshere are the most eye-catching selections and both are 
              expected to play key roles as England bid to qualify for Euro 2012.</p>
              <p>Gibbs, 20, celebrated his elevation to the squad with a wonderful 
              strike for Arsenal in their 6-5 pre-season friendly win against Legia 
              Warsaw, a game in which Wilshere also played.</p>
              <p>Capello said: 'I know these two players, we have always been 
              following them and they played very well in the Emirates Cup for 
              Arsenal.'</p>

              <p>Despite the friendly coming just three days before the start of the 
              Premier League season, Capello has called up the majority of his star 
              names, including Wayne Rooney and John Terry, because he wants to begin 
              to rebuild team spirit before the qualifiers against Bulgaria and 
              Switzerland in early September.</p>
              <p>Capello said: 'This game arrives too early. Some players are good at 
              this moment, some are not because they only started to train 10 days 
              ago. It will be an interesting game, but the date isn't good. But I 
              think you need to bring together the group again, including the senior 
              players, because the first qualification game is on September 1.'</p>
              <p>Capello will use the squad sessions this week to canvass the senior 
              players on their thoughts as to what went wrong in South Africa, where 
              England only managed to win one game and recorded their heaviest World 
              Cup defeat in losing 4-1 to Germany.</p>
              <p>It was just such an exchange of views that those same England players
              requested following the awful 0-0 draw with Algeria, a meeting John 
              Terry then publicly advocated.</p>
              <p>But following the adverse reaction to Terry's call, the planned team 
              meeting became a muted affair, with no real input from players. Now it 
              seems Capello wants his players to speak up in a bid to rebuild the 
              team.</p>

              <p>as u can see, no matter how those usual/senior players play badly..</p>
              <p>they will still been selected for their country..</p>
              <p>every competitive England games, those high-profile players are sure to be in the 1st-11..</p>
              <p>unlike other countries tat will drop its under-performing players, be it senior/junior..</p>

              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">Blackburn goalkeeper <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7810">Paul Robinson</a> has announced his retirement from international football after having 
              been handed a place in <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=53">Fabio Capello</a>'s
               England squad for Wednesday's friendly against Hungary.</div>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><br></div>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto">
              <p>Robinson, 30, made his international debut in 2003 and became 
              first-choice during the 2006 World Cup, but he was widely blamed for 
              England's defeat against Croatia in qualification for Euro 2008 and he 
              was later dropped by then England boss Steve McClaren.</p>
              <p>Capello 
              called Robinson into his squad last year for the 2010 World Cup 
              qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Andorra, but he was unable to force 
              his way into the side and was left out of the squad for South Africa in 
              favour of <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7610">David 
              James</a>, <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/5112">Robert
               Green</a> and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/30462">Joe
               Hart</a>.</p>
              <p>On Saturday night, Capello handed Robinson a recall for
               next week's friendly match, but the former Leeds and Tottenham 'keeper 
              has taken the opportunity to announce that he has no interest in being a
               squad player for his country.</p>
              <p>In a statement, he said: "I have 
              taken the decision to retire from international football with immediate 
              effect. Only now have I been able to make this decision because 
              previously I have not been in contention or selected for the squad.</p>
              <p>"As
               a professional who wants to play every time I have the chance, I don't 
              see myself as a number three or four keeper and find that role very 
              frustrating. I haven't had the opportunity of anything other than this 
              in recent years.</p>
              <p>"Therefore, I feel it's in the best interests of 
              myself and my club, Blackburn Rovers, to concentrate solely on my club 
              football. I wish the England team every success."</p>
              <p>Blackburn boss 
              Sam Allardyce said in May that there was no logical explanation for 
              Robinson's omission from the World Cup squad.</p>
              <p>"I am staggered, 
              totally," Allardyce said. "It is completely the wrong decision. If you 
              look at Paul's form for Rovers, there has not been a better goalkeeper 
              who has been so consistent.</p>
              <p>"It clearly can't be anything else 
              other than Fabio has something else against him, because he has always 
              said the people in form would get selected.</p>
              <p>"There is nobody 
              better than Paul Robinson at the moment, so there must be something 
              before that that has happened to put him [Capello] off him as a person 
              and not as a goalkeeper. He has made the biggest mistake of his 
              selection process, has Fabio. As much as I respect him for what he has 
              done that is one big, big mistake."</p>
              <p>The FA has said Capello will 
              not call up a replacement for Robinson, leaving Hart and Ben Foster 
              battling for the chance to face Hungary.</p>

              <p>i guess this issue will definity resurface again, haha..</p>
              <p>as every ENG gaffer is very timid to change its game play, maybe due to huge pressure from their media, i guess..</p>
