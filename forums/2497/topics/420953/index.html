              <p>The Reds last night offered £4.5million for Adam but it was swiftly knocked back by the Seasiders.</p>
              <p>They rate the Scottish midfielder at double that, having earlier snubbed efforts from Birmingham and Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>Blackpool boss Ian Holloway, who claimed Villa's bid of £3.5m was an insult, said: "Charlie has signed a contract and someone can come in but it's not his choice and it's not theirs."</p>
              <p>Kop caretaker Kenny Dalglish has earmarked Adam as one of the men to spark his Anfield revival.</p>
              <p>Ajax's Luis Suarez is the other target, at £18m. But boss Frank De Boer will do business only if he has time to get a replacement.</p>

              <p><strong>Charlie Adam is ready to ask for a transfer after ­Blackpool turned down a £4.5million bid for him last night from Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>The seething ­Scottish midfielder is unhappy boss Ian Holloway and chairman Karl Oyston rejected the offer which topped bids from Aston Villa and Birmingham.</p>
              <p>Adam was told by Holloway Liverpool were one of the sides he would be sold to – and yet the massive bid was snubbed.</p>
              <p>The Blackpool captain, 25, is shocked and spoke to friends and family about his future last night. He will ask to leave even though it will cost him money.</p>
              <p></p>
              <div class="news_mpu_article"></div>
              <p>A source close to Adam said: “Charlie is not bothered about cash. He just wants this move. How could anyone stop him?”</p>
              <p>He was stopped from moving to Villa when Holloway blasted manager Gerard ­Houllier for the approach.</p>
              <p>But Holloway said that Adam could go to a top-four club or Liverpool who were an ­“exception” to that rule.</p>
              <p>Blackpool want Kenny Dalglish’s outfit to raise their bid to £8m. But as the player has only 18 months left on his contract, it is unlikely ­Liverpool will agree with the Seasiders’ valuation.</p>

              <p><strong>Blackpool manager Ian Holloway rounded on Liverpool tonight after describing their bid for Charlie Adam, believed to be around £4million, as "disgraceful". </strong></p>
              <p>Holloway confirmed manager Kenny Dalglish was keen to take the midfielder, who scored from the penalty spot in the 2-1 defeat by Sunderland, to Anfield.</p>
              <p>The Blackpool boss said there had been also been bids for the Scot from Aston Villa and Birmingham but both had been rejected.</p>
              <p>Holloway said: "I was thinking Liverpool and Charlie. I thought fantastic what a great club for him to go to and them when I heard the bid I thought it was disgraceful.</p>
              <p>"I don't think it was Kenny that put that offer in. Mr (Damien) Comolli (Liverpool's director of football strategy) should look at what is going on and get realistic.</p>
              <p>"What they offered is about the price Charlie would have been worth when Kenny was last playing.</p>
              <p>"Is it a destabilising tactic from the three clubs, Birmingham, Aston Villa and now Liverpool? I don't know.</p>
              <p>"Maybe I am the only one who can see what his value might be. It is all right admiring something. I like my neighbour's car but if I don't pay the right amount of money for it I ain't going to get it.</p>
              <p>"They had better start by putting a figure one in front of the complete rubbish they have been offering so far."</p>

              <p><strong>Adam scored from the penalty spot with five minutes remaining after David Vaughan had been nudged by Titus Bramble. </strong></p>
              <p>But it was too little too late following the departure of goalkeeper Richard Kingson and Stephen Crainey through injury in the second half.</p>

              <p><strong>Charlie Adam looks set to leave Blackpool after the Seasiders skipper submitted a transfer request on Monday.</strong></p>
              <p>Ian Holloway dismissed a £4.5million bid from Liverpool last week as 'disgraceful', but admitted that Adam's head had been turned by interest from Anfield.</p>
              <p>Holloway is holding out for a much larger offer and also admitted he may not consider selling until the end of the season at the earliest, but Adam is understood not not want Liverpool priced out of a move and forced into chasing another target.</p>
              <p>Holloway said: 'Has his head been turned? Yes. It can be turned. He understands Liverpool is huge. With Kenny Dalglish in charge, the club is so stable.</p>
              <p>'They have got new owners and they are going to get back to what they were and Charlie deserves to play for them one day.</p>
              <p>'But that day, for me, isn't right for this football club at this moment in time. Maybe in the summer because it's a much better time to do business.'</p>
              <p>Adam turned in another eye-catching display against Sunderland on Saturday despite the ongoing turmoil over his future. The Scotland midfielder scored a penalty in the home defeat.</p>
