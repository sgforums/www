              Platini: Tottenham have not been unfairly punished
              The 56-year-old insists the north London knew the danger they faced when they finished fourth with Chelsea in Champions League final, but did suggest that the rules may be altered.
              
              Boss Harry Redknapp slammed the ruling as â€œunfairâ€� after his side missed out on qualifying for the competition due to the Blues success against Bayern Munich last Saturday, despite Spurs finishing fourth in the Premier League. 
              
              The 65-year-old added that the governing body should allow five clubs from one country to compete in the tournament in the circumstances, but Uefa changed the ruling in 2005 when Liverpool also won the Champions League but finished fifth.
               
              
              
              Premier League
              
               
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              
              Adebayor wants to stay at Spurs
              
               
              
              
              "No, they [Tottenham] have not been punished. They know the rules; they should have been third and not fourth,â€� insisted Platini at a Fifa congress in Budapest.
               
              "Perhaps it could be for discussion in the future about the participation of more than four but for the moment it is not possible because the regulations are for four.
               
              â€œIt is the matter of the executive committee, a matter for discussion.â€�
               
              However, Platini did concede that Uefa would be prepared to review the regulation, although no changes to the competition are permitted for at least another three years.
               
              â€œWe can always change the rules. We can always discuss the rules, but not during the competition,â€� he added.
               
              "We have decided not to change the rules or regulations of the competition for three years.
               
              "Everything can be discussed, the rules, yellow cards, but not during the competition. Perhaps in the next executive committee we can speak about it. I can put that, but they may say no."
              =======
              
              i dont know why redknapp is complaining.  the rule was there all along.
              
              spurs have themselves to blame.  they had a healthy lead at 3rd place and lost all towards the end.  arsenal could have been the one in pain if spurs kept their concentration.
