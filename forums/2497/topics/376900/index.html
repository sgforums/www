              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Tottenham</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Harry Redknapp</span></abbr> can't believe racist chants are again being heard at English stadiums.</p>
              <p>Redknapp experienced intimidation from fans when he moved to Southampton from rivals <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Portsmouth</span></abbr> - and he has been disgusted by recent incidents and allegations.</p>
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">West Ham</span></abbr> striker Carlton Cole claimed Millwall fans made monkey chants at him,
              while this week Blackpool's Jason Euell accused a fan of racial abuse.</p>
              <p>"That is disgusting, there's no place for that in the game," Redknapp said. "When I was a player at <abbr><span class="glossary-term">West Ham</span></abbr> we had that every week with Clyde Best because he was a black player. It was disgusting.</p>
              <p>"He was a fantastic fella and a great player and he was the
              first real black player to really, apart from maybe Albert Johanneson,
              to make it. But it's all over, surely we can't have that sort of
              behaviour.</p>
              <p>"Anyone who does it should be put to prison - not banned from
              football. Stick them where they belong in the nut-house somewhere. It's
              wrong."</p>
              <p>Redknapp has a zero-tolerance attitude towards racism and also
              feels strongly about chants aimed at the family or personal life of
              players.</p>
              <p>"There is other stuff that goes on as well that is sick," he
              said. "I hear things, I listen to the radio people talking about chants
              and singing songs to people at different clubs that just turns me over,
              I can't believe.</p>
              <p>"You've got to be some kind of nutter to do that. That's not
              banter, that's sick. Sick. They're sickos who've got to be locked up
              somewhere. Put them away and don't let them come to football anyway."</p>
              <p>Redknapp has seen the emergence of black players in the top
              flight over the last 30 years, meaning racial abuse should be a thing
              of the past.</p>
              <p>"It just can't happen any more because without the black
              players you wouldn't have teams - because they're full of fantastic
              black players, everywhere all through the leagues," he said.</p>
              <p>"I mean, how can supporters give grief to black players on the
              other teams when they've got them in their team. It can't happen."</p>
