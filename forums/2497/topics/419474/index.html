              <p>Baines
               famously missed out on a place in England's squad for last summer's 
              World Cup finals after becoming homesick during the pre-tournament 
              training camp in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>That always made a move to the 
              Bundesliga unlikely, and Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has now 
              confirmed that the player had no intention of moving to Germany.</p>
              <p>"We cannot force him (Baines) to join us. He would rather live in Liverpool than Munich, and that's that," Rummenigge said.</p>
              <p>Rummenigge
               insists his side will be a force to be reckoned with in 2011 following 
              the signing of Luiz Gustavo from Hoffenheim and the return to fitness of
               <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/11137/Arjen-Robben">Arjen Robben</a>.
               Bayern struggled to fifth place at the end of the first half of the 
              season and they currently trail league leaders Borussia Dortmund by 14 
              points.</p>
              <p>Although the chances of them successfully defending their 
              league title this season appear slim, Rummenigge says there is still all
               to play for and that Bayern will start to show their true form during 
              the coming year.</p>
              <p>"We are going to be attacking in all three 
              competitions,'' he proclaimed. "With Robben and Gustavo, we are stronger
               than we were in the first half of the season. We want to knock Inter 
              (Milan) out of the Champions League, win the DFB-Pokal and then we will 
              have to see about the league.</p>
              <p>"I am convinced that we will gain far more points than we did in the first half of the season.''</p>
              <p>Gustavo
               linked up with his new team-mates on Monday at their winter training 
              camp in Qatar. The Brazilian has joined for a reported fee of Â¬15 
              million from Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim, although some eyebrows have 
              been raised about the arrival of the 23-year-old, who has yet to be 
              capped by his national team.</p>
              <p>However, Rummenigge is convinced that Gustavo will strengthen his side</p>
              <p>"We only sign players who guarantee us improvement,'' he told <em>Bild</em>.
               "Gustavo can help us out immediately either at left full-back or at 
              centre-back. He can also play in the centre of the midfield. The lad has
               character and he was the player (coach) Louis van Gaal really wanted.</p>
              <p>"Seriously, we are not going to sign any more players in January."</p>
              <p>As part of the deal, Bayern full-back <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/118444/David-Alaba">David Alaba</a> has joined Hoffenheim on loan until the end of the season.</p>
