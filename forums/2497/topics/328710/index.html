              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/08/27/article-0-05606F200000044D-953_306x423.jpg" alt="Andriy Shevchenko" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p><em>Kenyon insist</em> <em>Sheva was value for money.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>After 18 months of bitter in-fighting, Chelsea's Cobham training base was a picture of harmony yesterday. Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari exuded bonhomie while chief executive Peter Kenyon declared Deco to be the 'buy of the season' and promised more Latin brilliance would soon be on its way to Stamford Bridge in the shape of £26million striker Robinho.</strong></p>
              <p>Kenyon was unveiling the club's Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which catalogues the good causes supported at home and abroad to the tune of £4.39m during the 2006-07 season.</p>
              <p>The mood was so upbeat Chelsea even tried to insist the £30m spent on Andriy Shevchenko - not to mention his six-figure weekly wage - had been a sound investment.</p>
              <p>Their reasoning is that Shevchenko was nearly 30 when he arrived and they had accounted for a steep drop in his transfer value; that the team enjoyed two successful years with him in the squad; (FA &amp; Carling Cup) and that he has only gone on loan to AC Milan, so may yet command a transfer fee.</p>
              <p>'Yes, I do, I do,' said Kenyon, when asked if he thought Shevchenko had been good value for money (no sniggering at the back, please).</p>
              <p>'You have to look at these things pragmatically, sometimes these things don't work as well as you want. Remember, we got Deco for £8m and that looks to be the buy of the season. You have to counter these things and we're happy with where we are.'</p>
              <p>Kenyon was cagey about Chelsea's pursuit of AC Milan's Kaka but Robinho, 24, is expected to sign a five-year deal after a £26m fee was agreed with Real Madrid.</p>
              <p>The Brazilian must complete the transfer before 5pm tomorrow if he is to be available against Spurs on Sunday. He meets the work permit criteria but the Spanish FA have been slow with their international clearance, which frustrated Newcastle when they signed Jonas Gutierrez from Real Mallorca.</p>
              <p>Kenyon said: 'I'm confident we'll get it done and Robinho is committed to wanting to come. Scolari is confident about the player's ability and mentality, that he will fit in and make an impact.</p>
