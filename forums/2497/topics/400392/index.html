              <div><em>Carlo
               Ancelotti, Chelsea Manager  (Getty

              <div><br></div>
              </div>
              <span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Coming off the back of the club’s first ever double-winning 
              season, it is hard to suggest that the Chelsea 
              squad currently at Carlo 
              Ancelotti’s disposal needs too much of a face-lift.<br><br>He has 
              quality in the majority of positions in his first XI and, with reports 
              suggesting Real 
              Madrid manager-elect Jose Mourinho will not move 
              to sign Frank 
              Lampard again this summer, it is looking as though the 
              Italian won't have to worry about persuading his main stars to remain at
               Stamford 
              Bridge during the close season.<br><br>However, there are a 
              couple of reasons to suggest that Ancelotti will be more active in this 
              transfer window than he was in January — when he famously pledged to run
               around the club’s training ground naked if he signed anyone (he 
              didn’t). As critics have long been quick to point out, the team’s 
              average age is not getting any younger, and the former AC Milan coach 
              will undoubtedly look to buy in some long-term successors to the likes 
              of Didier Drogba
               and Lampard sooner rather than late
              <div id="article_content" class="KonaBody"><br></div>
              <div class="KonaBody">As
               Joe Cole,
               Deco, Juliano Belletti and even Michael Ballack (all 
              important contributors at times throughout the Premier League 
              campaign) could all leave the club this summer, Ancelotti will also need
               to find a replacement or two for next year's title defense. <br><br>The
               Italian has already promised to blend "four or five" academy graduates 
              into his first team squad, which will cover gaps in some areas. But with
               Roman Abramovich seemingly willing to finance certain signings in this 
              window despite his continuing aim of self-sufficiency, it seems probable
               that Ancelotti will look to spend most of the minimum £22 million (the 
              club's total spend last summer) that will almost certainly be made 
              available to him over the next few months.<br><br><strong>Goalkeepers</strong><br><br>The
               club are fully stocked in this position, with No.1 Petr Cech coming off 
              the back of a solid season (jointly leading the Premier League in 
              clean sheets along with Liverpool's Jose Reina), and
               with two fine understudies in Henrique Hilario and Ross Turnbull. <br><br>Hilario
               might even be sold if a surprising offer comes in during or after the 
              World Cup (he is in Portugal’s squad) — especially as young Croatian 
              Matej Delac will finally arrive at the club to start his quest to be 
              Cech’s long-term successor.<br><strong><br>Defence</strong><br><br>This 
              is another area where Ancelotti is going to be in no hurry to make 
              additions — simply because he doesn’t need to. Ashley Cole and Yury 
              Zhirkov proved themselves this season to be two fine left-back options 
              in Ancelotti’s system, while Branislav Ivanovic and the (hopefully) 
              fit-again Jose Bosingwa — who will seem like a new signing after missing
               almost the entire campaign last season — offer the same luxury on the 
              opposite flank. <br><br>Central defense might be a weakness, with only 
              three solid first-team options (John Terry, Alex and Ricardo
               Carvalho) to call upon, at least two of them having valid injury 
              concerns. Ivanovic can obviously come across to play his preferred 
              position in the centre if needs be, but Ancelotti might look to add a 
              young stopper to his ranks (at the right price), although academy 
              graduates Jeffrey Bruma and Sam Hutchinson undoubtedly have the ability 
              to be versatile back-ups, something they showed on occasion last season.<br><br>If
               he does choose to add a center-back, he may well head to Italy for his 
              shopping. Azzurri World Cup squad member <strong>Leonardo Bonucci</strong> might be of interest to Ancelotti, especially as he combined with 
              Andrea Ranocchia at unfashionable Bari on loan last season to keep the 
              best defensive record in Serie A (until the later got
               injured). Napoli’s <strong>Fabiano Santacroce</strong> might be another
               target, but Ancelotti is unlikely to demand the club part with the 
              £10m-plus that might be needed to land either of the those targets, 
              especially as they are destined primarily to warm the bench in major 
              games for a few seasons.<br><br><strong>Midfield</strong><br><br>This is
               the first area that obviously need strengthening. Like Bosingwa, the 
              return of Michael
               Essien next season will feel like having a new signing, but
               even with him to call upon Ancelotti will surely look to add another 
              defensive midfielder to the squad — especially as two players he adapted
               to the role last season, Ballack and Belletti, could be leaving in the 
              summer, while another, Mikel, proved not ideally suited to the position 
              last season. <br><br>Roma’s <strong>Daniele De Rossi</strong> might be 
              Ancelotti’s ideal signing, but again the price tag and reported interest
               of Real Madrid
               will probably scupper any chance of a deal. <strong>Yaya Toure</strong> of Barcelona
               might be a more achievable, and affordable, option (similarly <strong>Moussa
               Sissoko</strong> of Toulouse), while Bayern’s <strong>Bastian Schweinsteiger</strong> has hinted he might leave the club in the next few months, in which case
               Chelsea 
              would be foolish not to sound out a deal. <br><br>Wigan Athletic’s <strong>Mohamed
               Diame</strong> could be an eminently attainable option if Ancelotti 
              prefers to stay in the division, especially as Everton’s <strong>Jack 
              Rodwell</strong> has committed his long-term future to the club — but if
               no target is landed Nemanja Matic is another player ready to step up to
               regular first-team action.<br><br>Ancelotti might also have designs on 
              reintroducing the diamond again next season, a formation that could 
              certainly work more effectively with the addition of a natural 
              ‘trequartista’ to play at the tip. Both <strong>Luka Modric</strong> and
               <strong>Yossi
               Benayoun</strong> have been linked, but Palermo’s <strong>Javier
               Pastore</strong> might be a surprise target for the Blues — the 
              emerging Argentine has been likened to Kaka who, as no-one will need 
              reminding, flourished under Ancelotti at Milan — and showed in his first
               season in European football that he has the necessary skills to be a 
              great success. <br><br>With Palermo missing out on Champions League 
              football, the 20-year-old could be an attractive option for the club at 
              around £15m (nearly double what Palermo paid for his services last 
              summer), and if he has a decent World Cup surely Abramovich will have no
               problem signing off on the deal.<br><br>If Ancelotti hasn’t got any 
              designs on returning to the diamond, another solid central midfielder 
              will still be somewhere high on his wish list. Napoli’s <strong>Marek Hamsik</strong> has all the qualities Ancelotti might look for — physical enough to 
              cope with the Premier
               League, and with the raw talent to grow into Lampard’s 
              long-term successor. The club looked hard at the young Slovakian before 
              January; now might be the time to make a bid for the £18m-rated creative
               midfielder.<br><br><strong>Attack<br></strong><br>With both Anelka and 
              Drogba getting on in age, Chelsea clearly need to add a
               quality striker to the mix, which has seen them linked with players of 
              the quality of <strong>Alexandre Pato</strong>, <strong>Sergio Aguero</strong>,
               <strong>Fernando
               Torres</strong> and <strong>Luis Suarez</strong> in recent 
              weeks or months. A deal for one of those stars is not impossible (with 
              the first two being most probable) but the expense might be somewhat 
              prohibitive, especially as Abramovich can point to the likes of Salomon 
              Kalou, Daniel Sturridge and even Fabio Borini as players who can have 
              greater roles next season. <strong><br><br>Gonzalo Higuain</strong> should be considered if Real Madrid finally lose any
               remaining rationality they have and look to offload him. <br><br>But 
              let's face it — goals were hardly a problem for Chelsea last year, and with
               time to sit on the bench while Drogba and Anelka play out their final 
              few years, 17-year-old star-in the making <strong>Romelu Lukaku</strong> could pique Ancelotti's interest. The Anderlecht man has been compared 
              to Drogba for obvious physical reasons, and might be bought — with a 
              loan-back arrangement — for around £10m. <br><br>Out wide, in an ideal 
              world Ancelotti would love to add a right-winger of the quality of <strong>Angel
               di Maria</strong>. If a striker is not signed then the Benfica man 
              might become a viable target, although it seems unlikely the club will 
              be able to avoid the ‘bidding wars’ they have pledged to stay away from 
              if they want to sign him.  <br><br>If Valencia finally realize 
              their financial situation really is as bad as everyone else seems to 
              think it is, then <strong>Pablo Hernandez</strong>, <strong>David Silva</strong> or even <strong>Juan Mata</strong> might become options; but with 
              Miroslav Stoch returning from a very successful loan spell with Dutch 
              champions FC Twente, Ancelotti might simply give the young Slovak a 
              chance to play a back-up role to Anelka out wide — especially as it 
              would also give young wunderkind Gael Kakuta a chance to see more action
               out wide.<br><br><br>IN (3): Marek Hamsik (Napoli),

              <p>Wow, as for me, I won't dare to gamble the defense line
              with youngsters. Because if anything goes wrong, that's it.
              Strikers still okay, if cannot score, at least the game is not yet
              lost, but if cannot defend, sure lose. Just my thoughts lah. Maybe
              for matches like League Cup's, still can play youngsters but if
              it's EPL or even the FA Cup, no.</p>

              <p>of course it will be best if the youngsters can set up the shoe when accounted for, but what if they can't perform and the game is lose.</p>
              <p>i'm not saying that we should not be promoting the youngsters, but fans will need to accept that maybe for those years, the team might not win anything. and seriously it might go both ways, they might just good enough to consider the top side but not good enough to challenge for the title.</p>
