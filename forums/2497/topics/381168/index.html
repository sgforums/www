              <h3>WITH stands steeped in history and a stadium that has all the trappings of 
              success, Manchester United is made for superstars.</h3>
              <p>Old Trafford, the Theatre of Dreams. No one leaves until their time is up.</p>
              <p>Even Sir Alex Ferguson, with two Champions League trophies and 11 Premier 
              League titles, has never been seduced.</p>
              <p>He has been sounded out by some of the biggest clubs in Europe over the past 
              two decades and yet there has never been a wobble.</p>
              <p>Wayne Rooney, take note.</p>
              <p>"I've had offers from clubs to go abroad, but I've never been tempted by 
              them," admitted the United chief.</p>
              <p>"I am not going on record to say who they are, but you'd be surprised by the 
              names.</p>
              <p>"It flies over your head and you get on with life. You don't leave Manchester 
              United."</p>
              <p>He claims he has never dared to dream and yet one of his players is doing just 
              that, swayed by the mesmerising skills of Lionel Messi.</p>
              <p>Rooney had never given it a second's thought until he travelled to Barcelona 
              to shoot a commercial, fixated by the flashes of genius in the club's 
              forward line.</p>
              <p>The Manchester United striker has imagined what it would be like to play 
              alongside Messi, Thierry Henry and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p>
              <p>They would be the world's most feared attacking force, with Xavi Hernandez, 
              Andres Iniesta and Seydou Keita providing irresistible support from midfield.</p>
              <p>Those are the day-dreaming moments, fantasy football in a foreign land.</p>
              <div class="inline-image-left-280"><img title="ROONEY: Head turned by Barca?" src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00064/roo_run_280x420_64772a.jpg" alt="ROONEY: Head turned by Barca?">
              <div class="caption">ROONEY: Head turned by Barca?</div>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It has always been an alien concept, a fanciful thought for a player who could 
              achieve all his ambitions at Old Trafford.</p>
              <p>Then there's the reality check, with a new-born son to consider after his wife 
              Coleen gave birth to their first child last week.</p>
              <p>He is settled in Prestbury, a 20-minute drive from United's training ground 
              and happy with his lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Of course there have been moments of frustration, with United failing to spend 
              big in the summer to replace Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
              <p>They baulked at the £50m (41m euros) Real Madrid paid Lyon for Karim Benzema 
              and then stuttered over the asking price for Valencia playmaker David Silva.</p>
              <p>Word at United is that Silva, full of craft going forward, is too slow for the 
              Premier League and United are not willing to pay top dollar.</p>
              <p>Spending big is a thing of the past under the Glazers, with Ferguson bringing 
              through another generation of homegrown players from their Carrington 
              training academy.</p>
              <p>That will take time, yet Rooney demands to play on the greatest stage of all.</p>
              <p>Only this week he appeared to commit his future to United, telling supporters 
              that he wanted to spend the rest of his career at the club.</p>
              <p>His agent Paul Stretford has been told United will offer Rooney a new deal the 
              moment his ban from acting as his representative ends in January.</p>
              <p>That contract will be worth £150,000 a week and yet the Glazers, heaving under 
              the pressure of £800m worth of debt, could be tempted to cash in.</p>
              <p>A good World Cup and Rooney's value will go through the roof, far exceeding 
              the £20m (£25.6 million) they paid when they signed him from Everton in 2004.</p>
              <p>He is already worth a fortune, up there with Cristiano Ronaldo's 
              record-breaking £80m move to Real Madrid in the summer.</p>
              <p>A large slice of that, just shy of £60m, was immediately hived off by the 
              Glazers to pay their annual interest payments.</p>
              <p>They are even making redundancies at the training ground in January - 
              something denied by the club last week - adding to the uncertainty at the 
              club.</p>
              <p>With the exception of Rooney, there is no longer a touch of stardust in the 
              United side.</p>
              <p>The striker is carrying the team, playing the best football of his career for 
              a team still adusting to life without the World Player of the Year.</p>
              <p>Ferguson's team still miss Ronaldo's rampaging technique, the outrageous goals 
              and his tricks and flicks.</p>
              <p>Now it is over to Rooney, brought in from isolation on the left to spearhead 
              United's strikeforce this season.</p>
              <p>He has responded, scoring nine goals already and is easily the club's most 
              important player.</p>
              <p>Rooney is carrying them and yet he wants a sense of the future, something to 
              whet his appetite before he commits to United for the rest of his career.</p>
