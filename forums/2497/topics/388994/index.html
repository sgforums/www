              <p>WITH Fifa demanding $40 million, not $100 million, for the football
              World Cup broadcast rights, Singaporeans do not see the need to pay an
              arm and a leg in subscription fees to watch the matches.<br> <br> Earlier, most fans in Singapore were expecting to pay up to $100 to
              telcos SingTel and StarHub, who are jointly bidding for the rights, to
              watch the one-month tournament, starting on June 11.<br> <br> Football lovers have also applauded the Football Association of
              Singapore's (FAS) decision to talk to Fifa and iron out a deal for the
              telcos.<br> <br> Said Roland Seow, a 54-year-old property agent who is prepared to fork
              out a maximum of $50: 'It is a reasonable one-time fee for one month.<br> <br> 'At the end of the day, I feel that we should not be held to ransom by
              Fifa. If the telcos cannot win the rights, then I'm prepared not to
              watch the World Cup.<br> <br> 'The FAS is doing good because it is the football authority in Singapore and it should interfere if it has the influence.'</p>

              <p>To me, this whole issue is just crazy... Someone wants to benefit from this big time... Maybe more than just one party so the big con job to get us to belief...</p>
              <p>Now I am even sceptical of the sum Singtel reported to have bid for the EPL cos Malaysia's Astro bid only came up to $800 Ringgit which works out to around S$332,800.  Sg with a smaller population base, Singtel bid $400m ? $350m ?</p>
              <p>I feel if the price is more than $50, I may not want to subscript out of principle. And those thinking of trying your luck with Indon and RTM channels can forget it, Our guys here will do their duty and block the signal like they did back in 2006. You can be sure of that...</p>
