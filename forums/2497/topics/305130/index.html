            <div class='col-md body'><strong>PRETTY blonde Aimee Walton told last night of her Â“wildÂ” sex romp with Ashley Cole Â— then admitted: Â“It was a big mistake, I feel so sorry for Cheryl.Â” </strong><br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00424/snn3005a280_424865a.jpg"><br><br>Aimee, 22, revealed the Chelsea and England defender cheated on pop star wife Cheryl after a night out drinking with pals.<br><br>In revelations that shatter ColeÂ’s image as a happily married man who rarely drinks, mum-of-one Aimee told how he:<br><br>CHATTED up girls as he downed vodka cocktails;<br><br>SLAPPED her bottom so hard his platinum wedding ring left a mark;<br><br>VOMITED in a girlÂ’s car Â— then said she should feel Â“privilegedÂ”;<br><br>MADE absurd claims that Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Â“didnÂ’t mindÂ” him cheating as long as he kept it secret, and<br><br>INTERRUPTED their sex session to be sick again.<br><br>Aimee said: Â“HeÂ’s wild Â— really rude in bed. He knew exactly what he was doing and was pretty good, despite not being very big.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00424/snn3094ch180_424869a.jpg"><br><br>'Rude' ... Chelsea's Ashley Cole<br><br>Â“But it was a big mistake and I regret it. I feel so sorry for Cheryl. IÂ’d drunk too much and went along with what he wanted. Now I feel really guilty. She should know what heÂ’s really like.Â”<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Drinking</span><br>The sex session took place at a posh flat belonging to one of ColeÂ’s pals in the Princess Park Manor complex in Friern Barnet, North London.<br><br>It is the same complex where Cole met and lived with Cheryl, 24, before their fairytale marriage in the summer of 2006.<br><br>ColeÂ’s fall from grace Â— which is likely to sicken wife Cheryl and infuriate his Chelsea boss Avram Grant Â— came a few hours after the Blues beat Sunderland 2-0 on December 8.<br><br>He went out drinking with pals, who were planning to watch boxer Ricky HattonÂ’s world title fight on TV later that night.<br><br>Aimee and a friend were drinking at the CC club in Piccadilly, central London, when a pal of ColeÂ’s asked them if they wanted to join the star in the VIP lounge.<br><br>Cashing in ... pair promote Lotto<br><br>Chelsea fan Aimee said: Â“Ashley was already drunk and couldnÂ’t keep his eyes off me, but he wouldnÂ’t come and chat.<br><br>Â“He was wearing jeans, a grey T-shirt and he kept putting on a baseball cap.<br><br>Â“I was wearing a short black dress with white stars on.<br><br>Â“I knew who he was but have never been that impressed with footballers Â— we were just enjoying the free drinks. But at the end of the night one of AshleyÂ’s mates just came up to me and said, Â‘Ashley wants you to go home with himÂ’.<br><br>Â“He said heÂ’d get a car but my friend was driving so we offered to give him a ride.Â” Swaying Cole was eager to say yes.<br><br>Aimee, from Morden, South London, went on: Â“As we were walking out of the club I asked Ashley about Cheryl but he clammed up.<br><br>Â“I remember thinking I was going home with a married man and that his wife was one of the most famous singers in the country.<br><br>Â“I asked him if he would get in trouble with Cheryl and he just said, absurdly, Â‘She knows what I do. I just canÂ’t get found outÂ’.<br><br>Â“I was really shocked by that Â— it showed he couldnÂ’t care less about breaking his marriage vows.<br><br>Â“He just kept saying to me, Â‘Please donÂ’t tell anyone, IÂ’ll get in so much troubleÂ’. Then he started apologising for what he was about to do.<br><br>Â“He slapped my backside so hard his wedding ring left an imprint. He tried to hold my hand but I could feel the ring and felt so bad I pushed it away.Â”<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disturbed</span><br>Cole then joined Aimee in the back seat of her palÂ’s Vauxhall Astra while his friend CJ sat in the passenger seat. Two of ColeÂ’s other friends got a separate cab back to the flat.<br><br>Aimee Â— who has a 19-month-old son Â— said: Â“During the ride he was slurring his words and was a right mess. Then he just threw up everywhere.<br><br>Â“My friend was going mad but he just smiled and said to me, Â‘She should be privileged Ashley Cole was sick in her car.Â’ His T-shirt was covered in sick and he took it off. I remember being really disturbed by how violently ill he was.Â”<br><br>Once at the flat, ColeÂ’s pals Johnny, CJ and a third man continued drinking downstairs, waiting for the early morning Hatton fight Â— while the England star led Aimee to a bedroom.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Away game ... club where Cole pulled Aimee</span><br>She said: Â“When you walk into the flat thereÂ’s a staircase straight ahead of you and a toilet on the right.<br><br>Â“Ashley said he needed a drink and we went to the toilet to get some tissue to wipe sick off his arm.<br><br>Â“He then tried to find the kitchen but wandered into what looked like an entertainment room.<br><br>Â“He then got a glass of water from the kitchen and asked me to take him up to bed.<br><br>Â“There was a tiny landing at the top of the stairs with a bedroom on the right and another on the left Â— he took me into the one on the right. He begged me to tuck him into bed.<br><br>Â“I was a bit drunk and knew he was married and felt bad because I knew what was going to happen.<br><br>Â“I went to the toilet and when I returned he was sitting in his boxer shorts on the bed.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jumped</span><br>Â“For a footballer, I didnÂ’t think he was in great shape. His legs werenÂ’t that big and he wasnÂ’t completely toned up top.<br><br>Â“He asked me to lie down next to him and before long his hands were all over me.<br><br>Â“We started having sex but it wasnÂ’t long before he said he felt sick again.<br><br>Â“Then he just rolled over and vomited on the floor, all over the cream carpet. It was disgusting.Â”<br><br>But Cole was not going to let that stop him scoring. Aimee said: Â“He had some mouthwash, then jumped back into bed.<br><br>Â“We started having sex again but his mates piled into the room.<br><br>Â“After they left we finally managed to get going again and tried several positions.<br><br>Â“Eventually he finished and collapsed on to my chest. He was panting and clearly had a good time.Â”<br><br>Aimee got up at 7.30am while Cole was asleep, and got a lift home with her pal.<br><br>ColeÂ’s booze-fuelled romp with Aimee is the first time he has been caught cheating on Cheryl, who has enjoyed a string of top ten hits since Girls Aloud first burst on to the music scene back in 2002.<br><br>The footballer and his bride were paid a staggering Â£1.5million by OK! magazine for the rights to cover their glamorous wedding.<br><br>Cole and Cheryl were labelled the new Posh and Becks because of their huge marketing power. The couple posed in cringeworthy white outfits to promote the National Lottery, while Cole was paid an estimated Â£500,000 advance for his autobiography.<br><br>Cheryl has frequently spoken publicly of her love for her husband.<br><br>Last October she said: Â“We are really, really happy. We spend every minute together.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apologise</span><br>Â“HeÂ’s not into showbiz parties or flashy restaurants, he just likes staying home with me. HeÂ’s just an amazing, genuine man. I really want a baby and so does Ashley.Â”<br><br>The England left back, who was training with Chelsea this week, has since contacted Aimee to apologise for his behaviour.<br><br>But last night Aimee said: Â“He wanted to go on the pull and he chose me. I just hope Cheryl can see him now for the man he is Â— a cheat and a liar.Â”<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">CHERYL'S pal has revealed that the Girls Aloud star is 'devastated' by news of Ashley's fling. The friend, who has spoken to Cheryl, told Heatworld: "She thought she was going to spend the rest of her life with him and have his babies. But now she's deciding what to do. She's absolutely devastated." </span></div>

In a searingly frank world-exclusive interview, the stunning Girls Aloud star spoke for the first time of her pain and anguish at the scandal surrrounding the England ace. "When I married Ashley I made my vows and promised we'd be together for better or worse," she said. "This has to be the worst it gets."</strong><br><br>And we can reveal Cheryl is CONVINCED her husband never had sex with 22-year-old Aimee Walton, BELIEVES his story and is still DETERMINED they can make their marriage work. Although Ashley's shame only hit the headlines on Friday, Cheryl, 24, admitted she has known about Chelsea defender Ashley's boozy night with Aimee for six heart-breaking weeks. He confessed to his wife just hours later and since then the couple, married just 18 months, have battled to save their relationship.<br><br><strong>Ruin </strong><br>Speaking from a secret location yesterday, with 27-year-old Ashley at her side and wedding ring still on her finger, she said: "I'm astonished that girl says she felt sorry for me. "If she felt so sorry why did she run to the papers to try and ruin my marriage? "I hope she's happy with her first designer handbag that she can buy with her dirty money. "I've been through an emotional roller coaster but I'm determined to be strong. Ashley's a wonderful husband and we ARE in love. I won't let this woman destroy our marriage."<br><br>Eyes welling up with emotion, brave Cheryl revealed how Ashley broke down in tears when he returned home after his night with Aimee. He'd gone out drinking in London with friends on December 8 then they all planned to watch boxer Ricky Hatton's world title fight on TV. Ashley was downing vodka cocktails in the CC club. Cheryl recalled: "When Ashley returned in a state he told me these girls had been invited into the VIP area and then he got really, really drunk. That was totally out of character for him."<br><br>The pals invited the girls back to watch the boxing with them at a flat in Princess Park Manor, Friern Barnet, north LondonÂ—the same complex where Ashley and Cheryl used to live. On the journey he was violently sick. And when they arrived he was so drunk he had to go straight to bed. Hairdresser Aimee claimed she then had sex with AshleyÂ—even though she admitted he was "swaying", "slurring his words" and "threw up everywhere" .<br><br>The single mum from Morden, south London, added that later she had sex with him before and after he "vomited on the floor, all over the cream carpet". But staunchly loyal wife Cheryl insisted yesterday: "That's utter rubbish, I know that for a FACT. I know Ashley intimately. When he's under the influence he ISN'T capable.<br><br>"When I heard what this girl had said I realised she'd made part of the story up. And, to be honest, that has helped me get through this. "Obviously I felt sick to the stomach. What woman and wife wouldn't? And to be honest I felt humiliated and crushed that this girl was saying these things and people were believing it. "Things were made worse when my family and friends started calling and offering support. I had to tell them that Ashley had told me about a drunken night and I'd kept it a secret for nearly two months. "I'd only told my mum. I adore the girls from the band but I hadn't even told them. It was something that Ashley and I had to get through together. "We've spent so much time together, talked and sorted things out. So I was devastated when this girl came up with all this and tried to make out it was something it wasn't."<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/2701_cole_02.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/2701_cole_04.jpg"><br><span class="small">SCENE OF SHAME: Flats where Cole spent night with Aimee</span><br><br>Then courageous Cheryl relived that heartbreaking moment when the Â£90,000-a-week star returned to their Â£3.5 million home in Oxshott, Surrey, and collapsed in sobs. She said: "He told me, Â‘Something happened last night but I was so drunk I don't know what,' "I was furious, furious that he didn't know what had gone on and that he'd put himself in that situation. "All he could remember is his friends leaving him upstairs with this girl and him being so ill that he was sick and she was putting a bucket under his head, looking after him.<br><br>"His mates had said the girl was going into the kitchen and getting cloths to clean up because he was totally out of it. They were downstairs watching the fight and thought he'd be fine." Incredibly, beautiful Cheryl kept her composure as she recalled her fury and added: "I saw the sick over Ashley's clothes, he was covered in it. I was fuming with his friends for not looking after him themselves.<br><br>"OK, Ashley was stupid to put himself in such a vulnerable and ridiculous position. But his friends should have protected him. I've seen with my own eyes the way women flirt and try it on with footballers. "I was so angry, so frustrated that Ashley couldn't remember what on earth had gone on apart from him being sick."<br><br>That night feisty Cheryl made her disgraced husband sleep in a spare room. She said: "It was the worst night of my life. I was angry and I didn't know the full story of what happened. "I've always said that if anything happened with another woman I would leaveÂ—and I knew I'd have to face up to that reality if he really had cheated. "But the next day I calmed down a bit and then took a few more days to let what he'd said sink in. Ashley is not a big drinker, I knew that and I was shocked about the state he was in. It's so not like him. I never really thought it could be the end because we ARE married and I realised there's no point saying your vows then walking out on a whim."<br><br>But Cheryl admitted that for the first week she struggled to cope with what Ashley had told her. She said: "I just couldn't believe that he couldn't remember anything. I asked, and asked, and asked but still he said he couldn't recall a thing that had gone on. He kept telling me he couldn't but I couldn't believe that. "As Ashley rarely drinks and is usually so careful, I asked if he thought somebody had put something into one of his drinks. But he said he didn't know. It was like banging my head against a brick wall. I didn't want to eat or sleep, I just felt drained and hurt and scared."<br><br>But also in Cheryl's mind were the memories of her insisting to the media a year ago: "If anybody cheated on me they'd be dead. I've been cheated on in the past. I gave the blokes a few right and left hooks." She told us: "I had to appreciate, and I DID appreciate, Ashley coming to me first and telling me about it. "But it's fair to say we constantly rowed over the next few days. "My mum Joan was there and I confided in her. She realised something serious was going on, she had never seen us rowing before. "I knew that Ashley and I were going to be spending Christmas apart because he was playing football in London and I was in Newcastle. "It was a horrible Christmas, it was so raw. But I had time to myself to think and I realised that the New Year was coming up and we could start afresh. I didn't want to carry the same argument into the New Year. I was 100 per cent over it.<br><br>"Obviously part of me was still angry and I won't take any s**t. Slowly things moved on and we got back to normal.<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/2701_cole_06.jpg"><br><span class="small">FIRST STEP TO SCANDAL: Club where Cole met girl </span><br><br>"We love each other, I adore Ashley and we spent time talking about things. "But then last week Ashley's agent got a call saying a girl was about to go to the papers saying she had a boozy night with Ashley. She didn't say she'd slept with him at that stage. "I instantly thought it was just some daft girl saying something for money, I didn't put two and two together. "Then at midnight on Thursday I got a call from my PR saying the girl HAD sold her story. And on Friday morning the penny dropped that it was the same girl from that night before Christmas.<br><br>"It made it worse when people claimed I'd kicked Ashley out. That just wasn't true. "I'm still hurt and angry but we've been working things through since December and we're now hoping to move forward and rebuild our relationship. And I'm back at work with the band on Monday. I thought the whole matter was already dealt with and now this woman makes these claims. But I feel sorry for her that she had to go after a married man for her own financial gain.<br><br>"I know it must be hard being a single mum but that's no excuse to exploit Ashley and potentially ruin our marriage. "I feel like I'm living in a nightmare and I don't know if people will allow me or Ashley to forget it. I hope they do. My friends have been brilliant. The girls from my band have all been so supportive.<br><br>"I don't want anybody to be angry with Ashley or to judge himÂ—that's my job as his wife." Cheryl and Ashley have neither asked for nor received any payment for their account.<br><br></div>

              <h1 class="art-headline">Ashley Cole faces more cheating claims</h1>
              <h2 class="art-standfirst">EXCLUSIVE: COLE CHEATED WITH ME TOO</h2>
              <p class="art-standfirst"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Love rat Ashley Cole cheated on his pop star wife Cheryl with a second woman, the Sunday Mirror can reveal. Glamour model Brooke Healy claims disgraced Cole had sex with her after a Christmas party just five months after his wedding. And she was then paid £6,000 in cash to keep quiet about it to protect Cole's reputation.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Meanwhile, we can reveal that a second glamour girl was paid £10,000 not to speak about her relationship with the millionaire defender after signing a bizarre contract with his lawyers. The astonishing revelations came as Cole and Girls Aloud star Cheryl were locked in crisis talks yesterday at the home of Cole's lawyer in London.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">He has begged her for forgiveness claiming he was TOO DRUNK to have full sex with hairdresser Aimee Walton, 22, who told this week of a boozy night of passion with him. But pals say Cheryl had told him: "If you do anything like this again, it's all over." The £90,000-a-week Chelsea player missed his team's FA Cup clash at Wigan yesterday as he battled to save his marriage.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Brooke, 23, claims she spent the night with Cole in December 2006, just months after he had tied the knot with Cheryl in a glitzy £500,000 magazine deal wedding. She says they met at the trendy Funky Buddha night club in London's Mayfair during Chelsea's Christmas night out. Within minutes of arriving at the swanky club, newlywed Cole made a pass, she says.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"He said, 'Are you Brooke? I've heard about you'. He kept asking me if I was a good girl. "He said he was 'kidnapping' me and said to me, 'You're mine tonight'." And one of Cole's first questions was whether she would tell anyone what happened if they slept together.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Brooke, a former air hostess, claimed: "We were just chatting and he was making it blatantly obvious he was interested. Everyone could see what was going on. "He said to me, 'I'm taking you home tonight'." Afraid to be seen leaving the club with Brooke, Cole asked her to write down her number and he said he would call her when he got outside. Minutes later, he did call and arranged to meet her at a nearby casino, she says.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">At about 3.30am Cole and Brooke headed back to a house in Surrey owned by one of Cole's pals and they ended up in a spare room. She claimed: "He grabbed my head and neck and pulled me towards him. He took my bra off. It was so hot and I was telling him not to pull my hair because I had extensions in. "He was laughing and saying, 'I'm used to it with Cheryl'." And she went on: "After we'd had sex we both fell asleep and he put his arm around me which I hate."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">In the morning, Cole was "standoffish". Brooke said: "He was a bit cold in the morning. I've had one-a-night stands before and I usually don't care, but with him I felt a bit hurt." She says he offered her £300 for a cab home to where she was staying, on the other side of London.. "I told him I didn't need £300. I felt like he was paying me.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"Ashley told me not to tell anyone about what had happened. He told me he'd phone me, but I was pretty certain he never would." Brooke - who's also had flings with Liverpool winger Jermaine Pennant and Spurs striker Darren Bent - was right... Cole never phoned her. Instead, pals intervened. Three weeks later, Brooke was on another night out at the Embassy Club when she was confronted by a bit-part actor with whom Cole is friends.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Brooke says the actor summoned her to a private room at the club. Brooke said: "He asked if I would go downstairs with him to the office, but when I got down there a security guard took my bag off me and told me to sit down.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"At this point I was crying my eyes out, I was terrified because I knew what it was about, I knew it was about Ashley. "Ashley's friend was saying to me, 'You've got to stop this, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble if you keep doing this.' "He said he knew that I was considering selling my story about Ashley, but he insisted Ashley didn't know that he was there to speak to me.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"Then he produced a bit of paper which had the statement saying I promised not to sell my story. "He told me to sign it and at the time I was so scared I thought I was doing the right thing by signing it. "Then he made me promise that I would go upstairs to the club and continue to enjoy my night as if nothing had happened.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"At the time I felt a bit relieved that the whole ordeal was over, but at the same time I was still frightened." Brooke says the paper she signed said: "I Brooke Healy did not sleep with Ashley Cole and I will not go to any papers to lie and say that I did."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">She went on: "The man kept saying to me. 'What is it you want? Do you want to get your boobs done?' She says the actor offered her £7,000 in cash, but she could only fit £300 in her purse that night so she arranged to meet him on New Year's Day to collect the rest.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">"We arranged to meet at a pub in Muswell Hill (North London)," says Brooke. But the actor later phoned to say he would not be coming to the bar and would instead be sending his nephew to meet her.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">At the bar, the nephew arrived carrying a brown envelope. "I didn't count it there and then but it had £6,300 in it," she says."He took me to the back of the pub and said to me, 'Remember what we told you'. After that I went home and counted the money."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">And she admits: "I mainly squandered it on nights out and partying, but I used some of it to put a deposit on a house and to buy a black pug dog." Brooke never heard from either Cole or the actor again. At the time she had asked for a copy of the "statement" she signed - but none was ever sent.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Brooke says: "I didn't feel right about the situation, but what could I do? "The majority of London's West End scene knows about Ashley and they know what he gets up to and that he's not faithful to Cheryl. "I feel bad for her because she married somebody who isn't faithful."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"> </p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;"><strong>I didn't rate his tackle..</strong></p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">They call him Cashley Cole - the man who earns more in a year than most people do in a lifetime.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">But the Chelsea and England defender doesn't have the greatest tackle, according to Brooke.</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">She told the Sunday Mirror: "He was distinctly average down below. And he has such little hands. His body wasn't that toned either. I couldn't believe it."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Aimee revealed on Friday: "For a footballer, I didn't think he was in great shape. We started having sex, but it wasn't long before he said he felt sick and rolled over and vomited on the floor."</p>
              <p class="art-p" style="text-align: left;">Coralie told the Sunday Mirror that Cole's prowess had left something to be desired.</p>

              <p>She said she went to bed with Cole because she's had too much of a drink? Who is she trying to kid? She remembers way too much to be incapable of making what should have been the right decision. She's a friggin liar. I'd bet she went to bed willingly with Cole and is now selling this story to gain attention. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <p>I do feel bad for Cheryl... but I guess she should be more or less ready for it because this is the way rich men, especially English footballers, behave.</p>

              <p class="first-para bold padding-bottom-7">DISTRAUGHT Cheryl Cole has left love rat husband Ashley for a “break” in their marriage, it was revealed last night.</p>
              <p class="article">The Girls Aloud singer has fled to a secret location to consider their future. But her agent insisted the pair had not split up. The agent said: “They are definitely still together. There is obviously lots of stuff going on at the moment and Cheryl has gone away for a break to clear her head for a few days.”</p>
              <p class="article">The move emerged after a fragile-looking Cheryl was photographed leaving her pop group’s video shoot in London, during which she broke down in tears. The Chelsea ace’s affair may also shatter Cheryl’s plans to start a family with him. In her last interview before The Sun’s bombshell revelations about Cole’s fling, she said they soon hoped to “work on” having a baby.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article"><em>Ironically, she also said she “couldn’t work through an affair. Trust is so important to me”. </em>Cheryl, 24, sobbed as her band shot the video for new single Can’t Speak French. She was comforted by bandmates Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh.</p>
              <p class="article">The Sun told last week how Cole, 27, two-timed her with hairdresser Aimee Walton, 22. When Aimee feared she was pregnant, a representative of the England defender offered her cash for an abortion.</p>
              <p class="article"> </p>
              <p class="article">A source at Girls Aloud’s record company Polydor said: “Cheryl knew nothing about Ashley’s affair. She was in bits at the filming.”</p>
              <p class="article">Two other girls have claimed they were paid off after sex with Cole, who was back with team-mates yesterday at Chelsea’s training ground in Cobham, Surrey. And the source said: “Cheryl is just bracing herself for more tales of his cheating.”</p>
