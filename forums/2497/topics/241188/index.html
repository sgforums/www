            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Tom Hicks said he was thrilled by Liverpool's UEFA Champions League success over Barcelona.<br><br>Hicks, along with new co-owner George Gillett, were at Anfield to witness Liverpool's stunning aggregate defeat of the European champions.<br><br>It was the duo's first time they had seen Liverpool live and Hicks (pictured) could not hide his excitement after the win.<br><br>"What a great game to start with," he said. "With the modern wonders of satellite television, I've been able to watch every game in the States.<br><br>"We took in the game in Barcelona from a ski resort in Canada, and we watched the match with Manchester United from our baseball team's spring training camp in Phoenix.<br><br>"So it's good to be at a game in person. Tonight's very special. George and I are thrilled to be here with our sons. There couldn't be a better match."<br><br>But Hicks also promised an even better future for the Anfield faithful with a move to a new ground at Stanley Park a key to their future plans.<br><br>"Everyone involved with Liverpool wants to be the very best," added Hicks.<br><br>"The new stadium is going to be very critical to that and we are going to be doing a lot of work on that while we're here. That is the next step and that will help us to be competitive with anybody."</span></div>

Barcelona's Dutch boss saw his side surrender their European crown last night on away goals, having won the second leg of their last 16 tie at Anfield 1-0 thanks to a late Eidur Gudjohnsen goal.</strong><br><br>Rijkaard said: "Liverpool produced a great performance. I do not see it as being progressive, they are very direct while being mentally strong and motivated. "Other teams will not like playing them. With luck they can beat anyone in the competition."<br><br>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez was just proud of his team for their resilience under intense second-half pressure. He said: "I am really proud of my players, they produced almost a perfect performance. But the fans too played their part."<br><br>Rijkaard accepted the loss of Barcelona's European crown with good grace, saying: "We won this leg, but maybe we were lucky considering the amount of chances they created in the first half. "We tried everything possible and I am proud of the spirit and effort my players put in. They worked hard and tried everything, but Liverpool are a difficult team to play against.<br><br>"They are strong, direct and are mentally tough. That is the way it goes, sometimes it is like that in football however hard you try. "I can only congratulate Liverpool, they are a vigorous side and for the neutral it must have been a game full of good attacking football.<br><br>"From Liverpool it was a great performance. There style is very difficult to play against. We tried everything, although we were not at our best. "We fought to the very last seconds, but Liverpool were highly motivated and they defended in such a way to stop us getting close to their goal.<br><br>"Anfield is such a difficult place to play in."<br><br></div>
