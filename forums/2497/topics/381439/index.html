              <p class="article">The Liverpool striker, 21, was branded a conman after an outrageous dive earned the Kop outfit a penalty in Monday's 2-2 draw with Birmingham. But his agent Bruno Satin said: "He wouldn't try and con the ref.</p>
              <p class="article">"He's a lad with very good education, correct and polite. He doesn't look for these things. He's never had a problem of this type before in his career.</p>
              <p class="article">"Maybe he fell down because he was worried about being injured. At times players make very hard challenges in England. "They allow a lot of things to defenders in the Premier League. At times it's really on the limit.</p>
              <p class="article">"Sometimes there are challenges that can assassinate you. A defender could get five matches for throwing his shirt and the player who broke the leg of Eduardo only had a three-game suspension.</p>
              <p class="article">"Did the defender put the safety of the player in danger? You have to look at things in a more reasonable proportion."</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">BLACKBURN chairman John Williams last night called for the use of video technology to stamp out the cheats once and for all.</h2>
              <p class="article">Liverpool's David Ngog left the football world shaking its head after his outrageous dive to win a penalty against Birmingham on Monday.</p>
              <p class="article">Brum midfielder Lee Carsley, who referee Peter Walton said felled the striker, branded the Frenchman an 'embarrassment' and a 'cheat'. And on Saturday, Spurs keeper Heurelho Gomes accused former team-mate Darren Bent of diving to win a spot-kick for Sunderland - which Gomes saved.</p>
              <p class="article">Rovers supremo Williams believes bringing in a video referee and using retrospective footage is the best way to solve the problem. He reckons it would quickly clear up any wrong decisions like Walton's at Anfield - and also name and shame the divers to the crowd right there and then.</p>
              <p class="article">Williams said: "I've always been a big advocate of using technology more in the game and it could help eradicate diving. "Referees have a lot on their plate and it's not easy to see everything from the best possible angle. "But the referee will give what he's seen although he can't always be sure, so a video ref could help him.</p>
              <p class="article">"You look at Monday night, Peter Walton must have felt it looked like a penalty from his angle. "That was a classic case of the ref giving what he has seen - or what he thinks he's seen. "It was an honest call that he made but he got it wrong.</p>
              <p class="article">"If he wasn't absolutely sure, he'd ask the video ref to take a look. It would take a matter of seconds and the interruption to the game would be minimal.</p>
              <p class="article">"Within seconds, everyone on the pitch and in the crowd would know whether the player had dived or if it was a genuine penalty."</p>
              <p class="article">In the Europa League this season, UEFA have introduced two extra assistant referees who stand on the goal-line to help with decisions in the area. The introduction of video referees watching on a television screen could well be the next step - and Williams feels a lot of officials would welcome it.</p>
              <p class="article">He added: "There's a feeling it could undermine the authority of the referee but I don't see that at all, it would help them. "I expect a lot would say they were in favour of it because they would see it as an aid. I guarantee Peter Walton feels rotten about the penalty because everyone is talking about it.</p>
              <p class="article">"He'd probably be pleased if there was something to stop him being in this situation again. "All I'd say on the morality of it is that whatever punishment is given to divers has to be consistent for the 380 games of a Premier League season."</p>
              <p class="article">Refs' boss Keith Hackett admitted Walton got it hopelessly wrong when he awarded Liverpool a penalty. Hackett said: "Peter will be upset when he views the DVD. "Nobody in the game supports the act of simulation but players do go down and that puts pressure on refs."</p>
              <p class="article">Hackett was encouraged by Kop boss Rafa Benitez admitting it should not have been a penalty. And he praised Birmingham chief Alex McLeish for not directing his anger at Walton. Hackett added: "Both managers were very clear in their views and said it wasn't a penalty.</p>
              <p class="article">"Managers are working very hard to cut this out and I know they abhor this type of behaviour. "Ultimately, it's down to players not to commit acts of simulation. "It is difficult and sometimes the speed and quality of the player and the way they juggle the ball catches referees out."</p>

              <p>I sure like this part of the agent's statement:</p>
              <p><em>'Maybe he fell down because he was worried about being
                                      injured'.</em></p>
              <p>Fwah..... intentionally hurling yourself to the ground so that you won't get injured? I would think that after you've hurdled over an obstacle, you should be aiming to land on your feet if you don't want to get injured.</p>
