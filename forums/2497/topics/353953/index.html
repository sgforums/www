              <p>A blazing row between Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and Wayne Rooney continues to linger, it is claimed.</p>
              <p>Rooney, who scored twice in yesterday's 4-0 friendly victory over
              Slovakia, taking his international tally to 21 goals, was involved in a
              training ground row with the Manchester United Old Trafford manager
              just days after their shock 4-1 defeat by Liverpool, says the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>.</p>
              <p>The defeat blew the Premier League title race wide open and a furious
              Ferguson reacted by dropping Rooney to the bench for last week's 2-0
              defeat at Fulham. When the England striker was brought on at half-time
              he appeared to be out of control.</p>
              <p>Rooney was booked twice and lashed out at a corner flag as he
              left the pitch after being sent off by referee Phil Dowd. Mark
              Lawrenson, the former Liverpool player who is now a BBC television
              pundit, said yesterday: "Everybody knows that he had a massive row with
              Fergie after the Liverpool game and was then left out. It's an ongoing
              problem."</p>

              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson has rubbished pundit Mark Lawrenson’s claims of a bust-up with Wayne Rooney after the Liverpool defeat. </strong></p>
              <p>Following the recent 4-1 loss to Liverpool, Rooney was left on
              the bench for the Fulham game, leading Lawrenson to suggest the player
              had had an argument with his manager.</p>
              <p>He said: “Everybody knows he had a massive row with Fergie after the Liverpool game and was then left out.”</p>
              <p>However, Ferguson insists there is no truth in the accusation and believes Lawrenson was simply looking to raise his profile.</p>
              <p>"I was made aware of it,” he said. “Absolute nonsense.</p>
              <p>“I don't know where that came from, but the revealing part of it is 'everybody knows', but I didn't know and I was in there.</p>
              <p>“These people self-promote, but who the hell's bothered about it?</p>
              <p>“Nobody followed it up, which tells you everything because, if there was any truth, you'd have found out."</p>
