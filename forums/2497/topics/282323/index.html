"But I took him off to try and change the game and sometimes it comes off, sometimes it doesn't - this time it did.<br><br>"At the end everybody is happy because we won but it's not what you want, because I feel more for the people coming on than Jermain, because he had his chance today.<br><br>"He was sharp and he will be important in the future as Dimitar Berbatov will be and Darren Bent as well - though Darren was kept on the bench and will not be happy.<br><br>"But Robbie Keane is always very good as a substitute as well, he's proved that in the last couple of years that he can change games and he did it again."</div>
