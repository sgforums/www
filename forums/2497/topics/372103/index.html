              <p>Manchester's locals feel <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr>'s spending spree has unsettled <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> manager <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Rafael Cabrera, owner of Manchester's most loved Spanish restaurant El
              Rincon, witnesses it daily. Fans, staff and players from both clubs eat
              at his tables regularly.</p>
              <p>Cabrera, a Stockport County player in the Sixties and Seventies, told the <em>Daily Mail</em>: "It has definitely changed and <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> has recognised that by what he has said. I think most people expected
              him to rise above the things that City have said and done.</p>
              <p>"But he didn't and that surprised people. I think it sums up
              the new atmosphere. He had his say and now the fans have followed.
              They're on the attack now, too."</p>
              <p>Former City wing half Fred Eyre - dining with Cabrera on
              Thursday, said: "Yes, that sums up why everybody is getting so worked
              up about the new season.</p>
              <p>"For the first time in ages, the two clubs will be competitive
              and I'm not sure United fans really know how to take that. They've been
              used to patting City fans on their heads, allowing them the odd triumph
              on derby day or whatever.</p>
              <p>"United fans have always known that City would never really
              threaten them in the long run and now it could be a little different.</p>
              <p>"City loved it when Fergie reacted to the posters the way that he did. We all thought he would ignore it."</p>

              <p>"That is where all the interest lies," he admitted.</p>
              <p>"<abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> have taken us off the back pages. I am quite happy about that because sometimes you get fed up reading about yourself.</p>
              <p>"They have spent a lot of money and we are all thinking where is it going to go? What is going to happen?</p>
              <p>"But the only real thing that matters are results."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester United</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Sir Alex Ferguson</span></abbr> has dismissed claims <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Manchester City</span></abbr> are using his public rants against them as motivation for the players.</p>
              <p>Ferguson has learned his comments have formed part of City manager
              Mark Hughes' motivating tools ahead of what promises to be an
              escalation in the rivalry between the two clubs.</p>
              <p>The Red Devils are still irritated at what they see as a cheap stunt.</p>
              <p>But Ferguson has elected not to fuel the fire any further.</p>
              <p>"I was angry about the poster they put up but that is all I am
              saying about it," he said. "Sparky could have used a few of my comments
              I suppose. He was here long enough.</p>
              <p>"To be honest I don't know what purpose it serves but I am sure it helped Mark in some way."</p>
