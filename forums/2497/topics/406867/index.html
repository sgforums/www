              <h3>JOSE MOURINHO'S Inter Milan old boy Wesley Sneijder is convinced 'The Special One' is destined to manage Manchester United and England. </h3>
              <p>The Dutch pass master believes that Real Madrid is just a stopping off stage before the Portuguese boss ends up at Old Trafford as Sir Alex Ferguson's natural replacement. </p>
              <p>And he reckons if the Football Association has any sense should ask him to take on the England job too alongside the Red Devils role! </p>
              <p>Sneijder came to know Mourinho well in their time together at the Champions League winners and revealed: "English football excites him more than any other football in Europe and I don't think it's a question of if he returns to the Premier League but when. </p>
              <p>"I think it's written for him to take over Manchester United in a few years. One great manager will retire and another one will take over. </p>
              <p>"But if he was offered the England job alongside the Manchester United one in a few years I am sure he would take it. He likes the daily interaction with players too much to take on an international job alone. </p>
              <p>"Jose and I became good friends at Inter and, from conversations we had, I know he thinks he could really do something with the England players. </p>
              <p>"When he takes the United job, the English FA must offer him the national post as well, and from conversations we have had I think he would take it, in fact I know he would."</p>
              <h4><strong>Perfect</strong></h4>
              <p>Sneijder knows the FA's top brass would be concerned about the England job being seen as a part-time affair but insists he is the man for the role. </p>
              <p>He said: "We are talking about the best coach in the world, and it has been done before successfully. </p>
              <p>"His other job would be in the Premier League, so he would be working with and watching the relevant England players every week, it would be perfect for him. </p>
              <p>"With Jose, success always follows him, but it's not always because he has the best players, it's because he make you believe you are the best players. </p>
              <p>"The confidence and belief he gives you is amazing, and when he is at a club it is his players and staff against the rest of the world. </p>
              <p>"With the quality of players England have, a coach like Jose would surely make them favourites. </p>
              <p>"If the English FA prepare for this, I am sure that Jose could be England coach by 2014 in Brazil."</p>

              <p>i actually always felt that although he wants to managed United, Man City will be more of a challenge for him. To be honest, i only see Mancini taking them that far, probably a top 4 with a small title challenge but not to become champions. And Mourinho is perfect for taking a good side to the next step which is to become champions, so bringing Man City to Domestic and European success will be the job that ultimately brings him the most satisfaction.</p>
              <p>For example, being at Man Utd, regardless or what he wins or doesn't win, he will always be in the shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson, and perhaps people will never see him as who he really is. And knowing how he craves the limelight, constantly being under the shadow of someone else's won't really be too appealing, but going to Man City and bring them glory will make him a legend there.</p>
