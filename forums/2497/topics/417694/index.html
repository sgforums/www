              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Carlo Ancelotti said there comes a moment when you either have to 'die or improve' and for </strong></span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580; font-size: small;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><span style="font-size: small;"><strong> here on Sunday it arrived in the 15th minute. That was when Roman Pavlyuchenko punished them for a moment's loss of concentration with one brilliant touch and a super finish. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Chelsea's season could have gone one of two ways then. Ancelotti had spoken of 'destiny' when looking ahead to this absorbing game and the two that follow, at home to </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580; font-size: small;">Manchester United</span></a><span style="font-size: small;"> and at </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><span style="color: #003580; font-size: small;">Arsenal</span></a><span style="font-size: small;">, and defeat here might have sent his side down a certain path. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">But, after the club's worst run in the Barclays Premier League in more than 10 years, a run in which they had taken five points from six games, they finally responded in the manner we have come to expect from the English champions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">This was much better from Chelsea and in the end they were left to reflect on an opportunity squandered to win the match.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Didier Drogba had the chance in second-half stoppage time after Heurelho Gomes flattened Ramires and left Mike Dean with no option but to point to the penalty spot. Gomes took half a step to the right and so invited Drogba to opt for the other side, only to then dive in that direction and save. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Ancelotti nevertheless chose to focus on the positives. His side, he suggested, would leave White Hart Lane with much of their confidence restored. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">'I think the bad spell is behind us,' said Chelsea'</span><span style="font-size: small;">s manager, having already heard John Terry declare that the real Chelsea had returned. The good news for them was that Frank Lampard had returned, too. In fact, it was only with regard to Drogba that Ancelotti still appeared to have a problem. It was a bold move to start him on the bench, and one that seemed to anger the Ivorian striker even if his form has been poor. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">When Ancelotti asked him to start warming up at the end of the first half, he threw something of a tantrum. If he did not seem terribly happy with his manager, he did not appear too enamoured with Chelsea's travelling supporters either. Some fans had turned on him when he urged them to get behind the team during the 1-1 draw against Everton and he followed his slightly fortuitous 70th-minute equaliser by strutting past them here with a bit of eyeballing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Who knows how he might have reacted had he then scored the winner? Not that Chelsea deserved to take all three points, not when a Tottenham side who continue to impress under Harry Redknapp proved themselves worthy contenders in this most intriguing of title races. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">This was a fierce, full throttle contest; a breathless, relentless battle between two attacking teams who demanded the best of their more defensive opponents. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">While Terry probably edged it for the man-of-the-match award with an inspirational performance, Michael Dawson ran him close with a display that was all the more impressive for the fact that it was his first start since September. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;">The rest of Tottenham's back four were superb also, while Wilson Palacios had one of his better games for Spurs alongside the marvellous Luka Modric . They put Michael Essien and John Mikel Obi under pressure before Ancelotti sent on Drogba for Mikel and switched to a 4-4-2 formation that matched the home team's. </span></p>
              <p><span>Attacking on the flanks through Aaron Lennon and Gareth Bale was an approach that worked well for Redknapp's side and they were good value for the advantage they established.</span></p>
              <p><span>It was created by a terrific ball from Jermain Defoe to Pavlyuchenko, aided by the fact that Branislav Ivanovic had been lured out wide and completed when the Russia striker used one touch to take the ball away from Terry before unleashing a left-foot shot that Petr Cech perhaps should have saved. </span></p>
              <p><span>Chelsea were enjoying plenty of the ball but lacked penetration without Drogba and Lampard. They had to wait until the 70th minute for the breakthrough after Drogba had been introduced. </span></p>

              <p><span><strong>He took advantage of Dean's failure to spot his use of an arm to control Cech's long ball and a major blunder by Gomes, who got both hands to the shot Drogba unleashed after seeing off the challenge of Dawson, yet allowed the ball to spin off his gloves, over his head and bounce across the line. What was Ancelotti saying about the lucky break not coming from 'heaven'? </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>The problems would continue for Gomes, the penalty he then conceded adding to his embarrassment. But he made amends in some style, producing the save that reminded Redknapp why he now regards him as one of the finest goalkeepers in the league. </span></p>
              <p><span>Should Lampard have taken it? Because of a lack of match practice, Ancelotti said no. But it would have been quite a story had Lampard marked his return with a goal that would have ended a run that now stands at one win in seven.</span></p>

              <p>I wonder who would be more disappointed or happier with the result in the end?</p>
              <p>Spurs for playing so well in the first half and not winning or Chelsea who got a lucky goal to equalized then out of nowhere in injury time got a deserved penalty but didn't take their chances...</p>
              <p>I guess if without the given penalty, Lotti would be the happier manager to take one point away but with a penalty to win it wiith like 100 seconds left on injury time, it can be rather disappointing... As for Harry, well they did play very well but his players seemed to be tired by the 65 mins after all the running in the first half... Same case, the penalty probably made him the happier manager given his side was seconds from losing this match despite playing well...</p>

              <p>i suspect wilkins was the real 'coach' doing all the training methods for the team's set pieces, strategy, tactics.</p>
              <p>ancelotti probably just selected the squad and sat back, relax, watch them score, and pick up an EPL trophy at the end.</p>
              <p>now without wilkins ancelotti realizes he does not know jack shit about team training and strategy. chelsea has not kept a clean sheet for like 2 months? and yet ancelotti still sticks to the same defense.</p>
              <p>ivanovic is a terrible CB and ferreria, bosingwa = shit. he dont dare use bruma as CB because 'young' yet he uses the young yet horrid ramires every fucking game.</p>
              <p>keep them back for extra shooting practice? wtf. its not shooting that is the problem its their passing, playmaking and inability to open up defences.</p>
