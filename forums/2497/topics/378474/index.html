              <p><strong>Substitute Martin Palermo's close-range finish deep into injury time earned Argentina a thrilling last-gasp win over Peru in Buenos Aires just minutes after Diego Maradona's men looked to have suffered yet another World Cup qualifying setback.</strong></p>
              <p>Palermo, whom Maradona has recalled to the national team after a 10-year absence, tapped home at the far post in driving rain to send his coach diving across the sodden turf on his stomach in celebration.</p>
              <p>Hernan Rengifo had headed an equaliser for Peru in the 90th minute to cancel out debutant Gonzalo Higuain's opener early in the second half.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">The win moved Argentina up to fourth place in the South American qualifying table, a point ahead of Uruguay, whom they play on Wednesday, and two clear of Ecuador.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Maradona sprung a surprise with his team selection, leaving big-name strikers Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero on the bench and instead handing Higuain his first cap.</p>
              <p>Argentina went into the match having lost their last three qualifiers to Paraguay, Brazil and Ecuador, but if ever there was a chance to restore some confidence in the side this was it - a home match against the team bottom of the group.</p>
              <p>And they did everything but score in a first half they dominated from start to finish.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>Di Maria's cross from the left was then spilled by Butron but Peru survived and went into the break all square as their goal continued to live a charmed life.</strong></p>
              <p>Maradona turned to imposing striker Martin Palermo rather than Tevez or Aguero at half-time, but his side almost found themselves behind scarcely a minute into the second period.</p>
              <p>Nolberto Solano's corner picked out Juan Vargas who crashed a first-time left-foot volley off the top of the crossbar from well outside the area.</p>
              <p>It was Argentina, though, who took the lead in the 48th minute, Aimar stabbing a pass through into the right of the area, which Higuain ran on to and slotted into the far corner.</p>
              <p>Peru had a penalty shout waved away in the 58th minute when Solano's shot appeared to be blocked by the arm of Emiliano Insua.</p>
              <p>And Argentina looked to grow more nervous as the second half wore on, their chances drying up as torrential rain started to pour down.</p>
              <p>The home side seemed prepared to hold out for the final whistle and were made to pay for not going for the jugular when they conceded in the final minute.</p>
              <p>Moments after keeper Sergio Romero had made a superb point-blank save, Rengifo nodded home a cross from the left from barely two yards bring Peru level.</p>
              <p>But just as Argentina's World Cup dreams looked to be slipping away, Palermo came up trumps for his under-fire boss.</p>
              <p>With no fewer than eight Argentinian players in a packed Peru penalty area, the Boca Juniors striker found himself in the right place at the right time to convert the easiest of chances after a low ball across the box came all the way through to him.</p>
              <p>There was more drama to come as Rainer Torres tried his luck straight from the kick-off, but his effort struck the bar and Argentina and Maradona claimed a vital win.</p>
