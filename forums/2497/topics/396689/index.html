              <p><strong>Barcelona are plotting a raid on </strong><strong>Arsenal </strong><strong>this 
              summer but their top target is Gael Clichy rather than Cesc Fabregas. </strong></p>
              <p>Clichy impressed Nou Camp boss Pep Guardiola with two excellent performances 
              against Barca in the Champions League quarter-final.</p>
              <p>Guardiola has identified the need for a left back as a greater priority than 
              a central midfielder like Fabregas, although the issue is clouded by the club's 
              presidential elections in the summer.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Gael force: Barcelona could make a bid for Clichy in the 
              summer</p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Meetings were held between representatives of the two clubs when they clashed 
              in the Champions League and Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood claimed the 
              Catalans had made assurances that they would not make a bid for Fabregas this 
              summer. </strong></p>
              <p>Barcelona distanced themselves from Hill-Wood's comments yesterday, when 
              technical secretary Txiki Begiristain revealed: 'We never said we will not try 
              to sign Cesc Fabregas. We will see what happens.'</p>
              <p>Instead, Barca insisted they had only given Arsenal assurances that if they 
              do decide they want to buy their captain they will come directly to the club and 
              not try to unsettle him via agents.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS">It seems inevitable that, at some point, Barcelona will target Fabregas and 
              the lure of the Nou Camp will prove too strong for a player who grew up 
              supporting the club with Guardiola as his idol.</div>
              <p>But, as Hill-Wood also clumsily confessed, it is difficult to see how the 
              Arsenal skipper would get into a midfield nicely balanced with Xavi, Andres 
              Iniesta and Sergio Busquets at the moment.</p>
              <p>Fabregas, 22, appears to have been earmarked as the natural successor to Xavi 
              but the performances of the 30-year-old in recent months suggest he has plenty 
              of years ahead at the top level before he thinks of stepping aside.</p>
              <p>Barcelona's leading presidential candidate Sandro Rosell has promised to 
              bring Fabregas back to the city of his birth, but precisely when that will be 
              remains to be seen.</p>
              <p>Guardiola would prefer to focus the summer recruitment campaign on a 
              high-calibre replacement for Thierry Henry, who looks set to leave, probably for 
              the USA, and bolster his squad in other areas, including left back.</p>
              <p>The Barca boss sees Clichy as a left-sided version of Dani Alves, a full back 
              capable of attacking fluently but with the engine to carry out his defensive 
              duties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/15/article-0-09273338000005DC-854_306x382.jpg" alt="Terror at the top.jpg" width="306" height="382"></div>
              <div class="floatRHS"><br></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>For Clichy, 24, it could provide the boost which propels him into the France 
              team, where he has struggled to get past Manchester United's Patrice Evra and 
              Barca's Eric Abidal.</strong></p>
              <p>He has two years left on his Arsenal contract but Clichy has not been at his 
              most consistent this season. His place may even have come under pressure from 
              Kieran Gibbs had the England Under 21 defender not broken his foot in November.</p>
              <p>Gibbs is close to a return but manager Arsene Wenger confirmed Thomas 
              Vermaelen, who injured a calf muscle at Tottenham on Wednesday, is expected to 
              miss the rest of the season.</p>
              <p>'It looks like three weeks and that means the season is over for him,' said 
              Wenger, who also revealed Denilson is doubtful for Sunday's game at Wigan.</p>
              <p>Robin van Persie, who looked in superb form when he came on at White Hart 
              Lane on Wednesday after five months out injured, reported no problems on his 
              return. 'He came back very well,' said Wenger. 'It was a massive gamble as he 
              had not played but we'll see how he is and hopefully he will get a few games 
              now.'</p>

              <p>Gael Clichy is one of the most loyal arsenal players.. I doubt he would leave arsenal unless Wenger wants him to leave or Barca makes a ridiculous bid. I reckon he will still be at arsenal next season, same for Sagna.</p>
              <p>If Arsenal keeps selling their players, then they would never win anything forever again.</p>

              the Catalan giants' first team.</strong><br><br><em>The Sun</em> reports that the duo are angry at Hill-Wood's 
              attempt to quash speculation surrounding Fabregas' future to an end by stating: 
              "If you want my opinion, I'm not sure he would even get in their team. Do they

              himself asserted on Friday that there was no way that Fabregas would be

              of the Premier 
              League and is a weak competition dominated by Barca and Real
