              <p>Robinho has one or two flashes of brilliance, but in terms of real contribution to the game it was none at all. At least now they have another player in Gareth Barry for set pieces and less reliance on him.</p>

              <p>Not the best match I've watched in some senses even though there can be a lot of talking points.</p>
              <p>Manchester City's play was all about grit and very little in terms of tactics. Players are always dribbling on their own, otherwise it's a long ball to Adebayor. In terms of passing you can see the Man City players don't have understanding with each other. Not yet anyway and it remains to be seen.</p>
              <p>The first goal was comical but not undeserved. In replays you can see Adebayor constantly always standing infront of Given like an extra keeper or something. I think he blocked Given more than anything. Just an example of the poor understanding among team mates.</p>
              <p>Howard Webb in my opinion really isn't what I consider a good referee, but to say he is biased is a bit of a long call. He did give the penalty did he not? So was Frank Lampard guilty of kelong? Was he in on the scheme to make Chelsea lose?</p>
              <p>That was a decent penalty effort by Lampard actually. In most other situations it would have been a goal so it was really a good penalty save by Shay Given. In fact, Shay Given pulled off quite a few good saves like he always does, even while at Newcastle. So give credit where it is due, instead of saying every defeat is a kelong. You cannot fault the Man City players individually for effort either. 6-0? 8-0? Not on this night at least. Then again, some people just love being extreme and absurb.</p>
              <p>For the equalising goal it was definitely a handball, referee really should have seen it too. I don't know where the linesman man was but the referee was in a position to see it. Even considering it all happened so fast, and that we have the benefit of replays, it was his job to see things like that. Like I've said, I don't think highly of Howard Webb.</p>
              <p>For the third goal of the match, referee got it right but he was lucky. At first glance it seemed like an undeserved free kick, but Carvalho did kick out a little Tevez but only a little. At least it took for me a few replays before I saw it. So for Howard Webb or even the linesman to have seen it? I am rather doubtful.</p>
              <p>The free kick itself was not badly taken, what surprised me was that it went through a gap where originally Essien was standing before the free kick was taken. I'm not saying it was a mistake that he moved away, but it is one of the things you would rue in terms of determining the outcome of the match.</p>
              <p>It's a pity we didn't we get to see Joe Cole play, I think his running at the defence would have caused problems against any defence of any team.</p>
              <p>Personally, I'd be hard-pressed to say it was a deserved or undeserved win, but referee definitely didn't have a good match (not that I'm surprised). It's just one of those nights.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are good enough a team to shrugg it off and come back as strong as ever if not stronger from this. It remains to be seen what this will do for Man City.</p>

              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chelsea</span></strong></span></a><strong> manager Carlo Ancelotti broke his own code of not criticising referees as the pressure of the title race showed for the first time since he arrived at Stamford Bridge.</strong></p>
              <p>Ancelotti blamed referee Howard Webb for two ‘important mistakes’ as Chelsea slumped to their third defeat of the season at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchester City </span></span></a>and saw their lead at the top of the Premier League cut to two points by <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchester United</span></span></a> who were convincing winners at <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/west-ham-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">West Ham</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>His reaction was completely at odds with what he had said after suffering his first defeat at Wigan earlier in the season, when they lost 3-1. On that occasion, he refused to condemn Phil Dowd for sending off keeper Petr Cech, declaring: ‘I don’t like to speak about the decisions of the referee.’</p>
              <p>Ancelotti was less reticent after seeing Chelsea’s lead from an Emmanuel Adebayor own goal cancelled out first by Adebayor’s equaliser, which cannoned into his path off the elbow of Micah Richards, and then a Carlos Tevez free-kick which was awarded for a challenge by Ricardo Carvalho on the striker.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti said: ‘We were disappointed because the referee made two important mistakes. I think Richards did handle the ball before the first goal and, in the second situation, I think it was clear that Ricardo Carvalho took the ball cleanly.</p>
              <p>‘I’m surprised because I consider Webb a fantastic referee with experience. I was surprised with his two mistakes.’</p>
              <p>Ancelotti, however, believes there is no need to panic, despite Sir Alex Ferguson’s men now breathing down their necks following their 4-0 victory at Upton Park. ‘We lost the game but deserved to draw,’ said Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>‘City played very well and made it difficult for our midfield to play, but we had an opportunity at the end to come back and draw.</p>
              <p>‘We don’t need to have a big reaction. The team is in a good place and we played well. ‘We can stay relaxed because we are top of the league by two points. We don’t have any reason to be worried.’</p>
              <p>Chelsea had six players booked including their entire back four, but Ancelotti said: ‘We didn’t lose our discipline. ‘We had to attack at the end and sometimes got caught out at the back in one-on-one and, in those situations, you can get yellow cards.’</p>
              <p>It was a miserable return to Eastlands for England and Chelsea skipper John Terry, who was sent off in the stadium last season. He turned down a move to City in the summer and was jeered at every opportunity by the home fans.</p>
              <p>He was booked for a foul on Tevez and limped off towards the end with a knee injury, leaving the stadium on crutches.</p>
              <p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><strong>Ancelotti said: ‘There is no problem. John Terry took a knock on the knee. He should be okay this week.’</strong></p>
              <p>Despite his comments about the referee, Ancelotti found it within himself to praise Manchester City, saying he regards them as future title challengers.</p>
              <p>They moved above <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Liverpool </span></span></a>to sixth in the Premier League, with a game in hand.</p>
              <p>He added: ‘They will do better in the future because they have very good players.</p>
              <p>'I don’t know if they can win the league this season though, I’m not a magician.’</p>

              <p><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span><strong>had a number of grievances on Saturday but they lost their discipline and consequently the points.</strong></p>
              <p>Firstly, handball is the only offence that must be deliberate and when Micah Richards saw Shaun Wright-Phillips' shot flying towards him his intention appeared to be to get out of the way, so <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;">City</span></a>'s first goal was legitimate.</p>
              <p>The second bone of contention was the award of the free-kick from which Carlos Tevez scored the winner.</p>
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti, the Chelsea manager, said that Ricardo Carvalho had played the ball. The way I saw the incident I agree that initially Carvalho did play the ball while under pressure from Tevez, who may have been guilty of jumping into the Chelsea defender.</p>
              <p>But in a second movement, Carvalho appeared to kick out and when two offences occur simultaneously the referee must punish the more serious offence, which was Carvalho's. So, sorry Chelsea, but Howard Webb was right.</p>
              <p>John Terry also felt aggrieved when he was manhandled in the area and he may have had a point, but there are at least half a dozen of these incidents in every Premier League match.</p>
              <p>Chelsea certainly appeared to lose their heads with the official a number of times and failed to appreciate that they had gained as a result of the only clear error which our No 1 referee made.</p>
              <p>Webb awarded Chelsea a corner after Ashley Cole had played the ball last and they scored from it. But City, rather than lose their cool with the officials, concentrated on playing football. Chelsea did not and ended the game with six yellow cards and an FA fine to follow.</p>
              <p>Considering the attitude of so many players towards Webb, they were fortunate to end the game with 11 men.</p>

              <h2>BAD WAY TO LOSE</h2>
              <p>It was a poor week for Carlo Ancelotti's <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea </span></a>side with two defeats. They are out of the Carling Cup and their lead at the top of the Premier League is down to two points.</p>
              <p>There were also signs at<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-city.html"><span style="color: #003580;"> Manchester City </span></a>of their old petulance returning. I wrote last week of their quality and power. This was their other, less appealing side.</p>
