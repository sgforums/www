              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="font-size: 1.05em; line-height: 1.05em;">PHIL SCOLARI will today discover how much Chelsea are willing to back him. The Blues boss is due to meet club officials to discuss a replacement for Joe Cole, with Jermaine Pennant and David Bentley on his radar. </h2>
              <p class="article">Midfielder Cole suffered knee ligament damage last week and will miss the rest of the season. Scolari had been told funds to bring in new players this month would only be available in the case of a situation such as Cole’s. </p>
              <p class="article">However, whether the manager is allowed to buy a player depends on the amount of faith the Chelsea board have in him. </p>
              <p class="article">After poor form and bad results, the hierarchy are reserving judgment. That means a loan deal until the end of the season is more likely, with Liverpool’s Pennant and Spurs ace Bentley his targets. </p>
              <p class="article">Chelsea will also welcome Didier Drogba back into the fold this week. The striker, left out of Scolari’s last two squads, is set to return against Ipswich in the FA Cup.</p>

              <p>ya man.. i've to agree with you on this, he is not good enough to attract so much attention, but probably due to the fact that his contract is ending soon, they might just wanna play him on the cheap then resale him to some small club at a profit..</p>

              <p>i think pennant started getting recognition from his birmingham days - where he was recorded to be the best crosser of the ball in the EPL (basis number of successful crosses). that's when liverpool paid money to buy him but unfortunately he was too inconsistent.</p>
              <p>also if i remember correctly, i think pennant scored a hatrick on his debut for arsenal many years ago. he was once the most expensive teenager in england leh... haha</p>

              <p>actually liverpool can use this chance to offer pennant for cole hor? since he injured and cant help much and scolari is so desperate. so means, pennant + $$$ = J.cole. not bad huh? for both parties. scolari get his man and $, liverpool can improve on it's squad.</p>
              <p>since scolari don really choose cole this days, and he has not much $$ to spend, so this might be an ideal solution for him.</p>

              <p>for some reason we just can't seems to agree on just about anything..</p>
              <p>he is IMHO slightly above avg. if his contract had another 4years left, i'll bet no one is even willing to have a look at him.. but the fact that his is expiring soon and the rest of the better wingers being valued at 15m min.is probably the reason why ppl are looking at him..</p>
