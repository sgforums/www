            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">ENGLAND ace Micah Richards has been caught Â‘roasting' a young girl fan in a sick sex video passed to the News of the World.</span><br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/2312_animals_01.jpg"><br><br>The Manchester City star and a Premier League pal filmed themselves on a mobile phone during the depraved hotel toilet romp in the latest scandal to rock English soccer. Richards is today exposed as a vile animal captured on video "roasting" a teenage fan in a toilet with a pal. </strong><br><br>The star player and his Premier League friend, grinning broadly with debauched pleasure, have sex with the girl at the same time while filming themselves on a mobile phone. The sickening video of Manchester City defender Richards was handed to the News of the World in the week that soccer's reputation hit rock bottom after allegations of rape and roasting at rival club Man United's Christmas party. The film of Richards' roastingÂ—a sick act which involves one man having sex with a woman from behind while she gives a second oral sexÂ—was passed on to friends' mobiles by the swaggering pair.<br><br><img src="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/images/homepage/2312_animals_02.jpg"><br><br>In the clip, the 19-year-old player, one of England's brightest young stars, smiles directly at the camera over the girl's back. Dressed in a white T-shirt, jeans and a leather jacket, he shakes his head around as his pal films him with his trousers down behind the girl. Richards is wearing distinctive jewellery including a silver ring, earrings and necklace. Then the other smiling soccer player, who is naked from the waist up, moves the phone lens onto his own private parts in the most sickening footage Â—and also films the girl giving him oral sex, reflected in a large mirror in what appears to be a hotel's disabled toilet.<br><br>The girlÂ—a brunette naked from the waist downÂ—moans with pleasure as the players shout: "Does that feel good?" Wearing just a black wool jumper and expensive black earrings, she doesn't stop pleasuring the menÂ—even when a mobile phone rings. Both players then burst into laughter and one of them says: "Who's ringing you at this time?" Towards the end of the 87 seconds of footage one of the men mumbles something to the other, causing him to shout "F*** that!" Then as the sleazy session ends, one of the players says something that forces the girl to yell an indignant "Hey!"<br><br>Sources who have seen the video reveal the man with RichardsÂ—who played for his team against Aston Villa yesterdayÂ—is another Premier League player. The footage is believed to have been shot in Manchester city centre in the last five weeks, near the time England embarrassingly failed to qualify for the European Championships with their defeat to Croatia at Wembley.<br><br>One pal told us: "Micah and his mate have been boasting about what they got up to with the girl, they think it is hilarious. You can tell they are both loving it. "Most of my friends have now got it on their phones. But you can't help thinking they are treating the girl like a piece of meat. "Even when one of their phones rings they don't stop, they just have a laugh and carry on. They don't really care to be honest, it's just another girl."<br><br>Another pal said RichardsÂ— said to be seeking an improved Â£14 million contract at CityÂ—is regularly seen in Manchester bars with his roasting accomplice. He said: "They are so tight it is unbelievable, they do everything together. They have got a lot of money and they know it. "They dress in flash jewellery and rap star clothes. To be honest they wind a lot of people up but the girls seem to love it."<br><br>Richards might care more when he realises how the scandal will put his budding England career at risk under new coach Fabio CapelloÂ—a renowned disciplinarian who demands the best behaviour from his players. Italian Capello has warned that he will subject all England players to a month of intense scrutiny before deciding whether they are deserving of a place in his first squad.<br><br>He said: "A place in the national squad has to be deserved, and it will be based on behaviour, play on the field and attitude." Richards was the youngest defender ever to be called up for England and is now a team regular alongside captain John Terry. His behaviour will be particularly heartbreaking for his proud dad Lincoln who came to Britain from the West Indies 40 years ago as a seven-year-old. Despite bringing Micah up in the tough Chapeltown area of Leeds, he was sure his son would make a success of his life.<br><br>Earlier this year Lincoln said: "There are two roads you can go down, bad or good. I was never concerned about Micah, it was not in his nature." The player even sees himself as a role model, saying: "To anyone from my area, I always give the advice that if you really want something, just concentrate on it and try to fulfil your dreams." But our sordid footage reveals the Aston Martin-driving Micah has been drawn into the depraved lifestyle that is tarnishing our national gameÂ—and which erupted onto front pages all last week.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh... another English player caught in such shameful acts... No pity for the girl either as she basically 'asked' for it, and even liked it. Sometimes we can't completely blame the players because it takes two hands to clap. If the girls do not cherish themselves, who would do so? To be honest, Richards and his friend, are merely taking a girl who throws herself at them. Their attitude is bad, but they are not completely at fault. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
