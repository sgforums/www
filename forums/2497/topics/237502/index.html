            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>PSV aim to end Arsenal dominance</strong></span><br><br>PSV Eindhoven, who made it through the group stage despite losing both their last two UEFA Champions League fixtures, will be attempting to end Arsenal FC's dominance over them when the two clubs meet in the last 16.<br><br>Â• Having never met in UEFA competition prior to September 2002, the sides are fast becoming familiar foes. This is their third pairing in five seasons although the first in knockout format. Arsenal, bidding to go one step further than 2006 when they lost in the final to FC Barcelona, have not tasted defeat in any of the four matches between the teams, winning twice and recording two draws.<br><br>Â• The first confrontation came in the 2002/03 UEFA Champions League first group stage, Arsenal winning 4-0 away with a pair of goals from Thierry Henry adding to earlier strikes from Gilberto - at 20.07 seconds, the fastest-ever goal in the competition - and Fredrik Ljungberg. The game at Highbury ended 0-0. Then in the 2004/05 group stage, Arsenal prevailed 1-0 in London through an Alex own goal before earning a 1-1 draw in Eindhoven with Henry again finding the PSV Stadium to his liking by cancelling out AndrÃ© Ooijer's early goal.<br><br>Â• This season PSV had all three results in their Group C home fixtures, drawing 0-0 with Liverpool FC, defeating Galatasaray SK 2-0 and losing 3-1 to FC Girondins de Bordeaux on Matchday 6 with their place in the last 16 already secure.<br><br>Â• PSV's home form against English clubs has been patchy with four wins in eleven matches and none in the last five. Ronald Koeman's team, having qualified from the group stage for the third successive year, will be endeavouring to improve on last season's disappointment at this stage when they lost both legs to Olympique Lyonnais, 1-0 at home and 4-0 away. The previous campaign, the first time PSV had progressed to the knockout phase, they defeated AS Monaco FC home and away and went all the way to the semi-finals before losing to AC Milan on away goals.<br><br>Â• Arsenal lost their first UEFA club game in the Netherlands, going down 2-1 at AFC Ajax in the first leg of the 1971/72 European Champion Clubs' Cup semi-final. But the Gunners have emerged unbeaten from their four subsequent visits to Dutch clubs, splitting those two games against PSV with a 0-0 draw at Ajax. They visited Ajax again in last season's group stage, winning 2-1.<br><br>Â• PSV coach Ronald Koeman has happy memories of north London as he was part of the Barcelona team which lifted the European Cup with victory against UC Sampdoria at Wembley in May 1992 thanks to his trademark free-kick in extra time. As Ajax coach he guided his team to two draws against Arsenal in the 2002/03 second group stage.<br><br>Â• Arsenal won Group G with eleven points and recorded all three results away from home, winning 2-1 at Hamburger SV before a 1-0 defeat at PFC CSKA Moskva, their first away reverse in eight matches in the competition proper. A goalless draw at FC Porto on Matchday 6 took Arsenal through with their seven goals in the six group games scored by seven different players. At this stage 12 months ago, ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's team went to Real Madrid CF and returned with a 1-0 first-leg win courtesy of Henry's superb solo strike.<br><br>Â• The second leg will be staged at the Arsenal Stadium on Wednesday 7 March.<br></div>

He could partner Henrik Larsson, whose last appearance in this competition was for Barcelona in the 2006 final.<br><br>The one minor hiccup to United's preparations is that the pitch at Lens' Stade Bollaert has been declared unfit to train on. It means both United and Lille, who did not concede a goal in two meetings with Sir Alex Ferguson's men last season, will instead train at the Lens training ground at La Gayette.<br><br></div>

Eboue has an ankle knock and Hoyte has a hamstring problem, meaning Johan Djourou should start at full-back.<br><br>Midfielder Alexander Hleb returns from a virus, but Theo Walcott is left out. PSV Eindhoven striker Jefferson Farfan is a major doubt with a foot injury but right-back Jan Kromkamp should be fit despite missing training on Monday.<br><br>The injuries to Eboue and Hoyte could mean that William Gallas will start in the Arsenal defence in only his second game back from his lengthy lay-off. Wenger said: "We have Eboue out and Hoyte is out with a hamstring problem, but he should be back for [the Carling Cup Final on] Sunday.<br><br>"Gallas has responded well to the weekend game [against Blackburn] and he is in the squad. It will be Johan Djourou or Gallas at right back." Hleb missed Saturday's 0-0 draw with Blackburn with the flu but should start in midfield in place of Walcott who was substituted in the second half of that match.<br><br>Wenger added: "Theo Walcott and Abou Diaby have been left behind with Sunday in mind." For PSV, Farfan's injury will give starts to Brazil's Diego Tardelli and Ivory Coast's Aruna Kone up front.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Lille face the wrath of UEFA after their players threatened to walk off after conceding a goal and crowd trouble marred their Champions League first knockout round match with Manchester United on Tuesday.<br><br>Click here<br>United won 1-0 and joined Real Madrid, who beat Bayern Munich 3-2 and PSV Eindhoven, 1-0 winners over Arsenal, in securing slender first leg leads while AC Milan went home from Glasgow as favourites to advance after a 0-0 draw at Celtic.<br><br>New UEFA president Michel Platini on Monday had asked all 16 clubs to set an example in UEFA's premier competition after European soccer's recent hooligan problems, which included the death of a policeman at a match in Italy.<br><br>However, his words seemed to be ignored by the French club who were beaten 1-0 by a controversial Ryan Giggs freekick.<br><br>Riot police sprayed tear gas on United fans to dampen crowd trouble in the first half and, after Giggs scored what proved to be the winner for United with a quickly-taken freekick after 83 minutes, Lille's players looked set to walk off in protest.<br><br>The game soon resumed but United captain Gary Neville was then hit by missiles as he took a throw-in at the Felix-Bollaert stadium in Lens where Lille had requested to play.<br><br>United manager Alex Ferguson thought Lille's players were going to walk off the field and told reporters afterwards he thought they should be punished by UEFA for their actions.<br><br>'I have never seen anything like it before. They totally intimidated the referee. We should not see things like that in football,' he added.<br><br>UEFA spokesman Rob Faulkner said: 'Having seen what went on on the security side and in the match itself, it would be standard procedure for the referee to report the incidents and for the Control and Disciplinary Committee to take the appropriate action.<br><br>'The whole issue of Lille playing in that stadium will also need to be addressed. We cannot say now what action the Disciplinary Committee will take, but if they find against Lille, it could well be severe.'<br><br>Feyenoord have already been expelled from this season's UEFA Cup after crowd trouble against Blackburn Rovers and Nancy and many clubs have in the past been ordered to play matches behind closed doors or at neutral venues after crowd trouble.<br><br>Three of the four games went off without major incident, but trouble started early at the 42,000 capacity Felix-Bollaert Stadium where Lille faced United because their own ground does not meet UEFA specifications for European ties.<br><br>United officials had expressed concern over security issues before the match and they proved to be well-founded.<br><br>After 15 minutes a United fan climbed a fence in what appeared to be an attempt to get on to the pitch and approached his team's goalkeeper Edwin Van Der Sar.<br><br>Stewards took the supporter back to the stands triggering an angry reaction from other United fans who were distressed at being pushed against the 10-foot high security fences.<br><br>Riot police intervened with truncheons and sprayed tear gas as several supporters tried to climb over the fences.<br><br>The game was not stopped and calm returned after a few minutes when fans, including a child and an elderly woman, were lifted over the barriers to safety.<br><br>Before the match United expressed concern about the basic facilities at the ground and were surprised Lille were allowed to move the game to the stadium in northern France rather than a larger modern venue like the Stade de France.<br><br>As the incidents are certain to be included in the report submitted by Dutch referee Eric Braamhaar the issue will be reviewed by UEFA who are likely to take a tough stand if they find Lille officials guilty of any charges.<br><br>Real beat Bayern at the Bernabeu where Raul scored twice to extend his record tally in the competition to 56 goals.<br><br>Ruud Van Nistelrooy added Real's third but Bayern gave themselves a chance of salvaging something from the second leg with goals from Lucio and Mark van Bommel.<br><br>A spectacular 25-metre strike from Ecuadorean midfielder Edison Mendez gave PSV a 1-0 win over Arsenal who failed to turn their first half superiority to their advantage.<br><br>A dominant Milan could only draw 0-0 with Celtic in Glasgow where Paolo Maldini became the fifth player, and first Italian, to make 100 Champions League appearances.<br><br>Champions Barcelona are in action against Liverpool at the Nou Camp on Wednesday when AS Roma host Lyon, Porto welcome Chelsea and Inter Milan are at home to Valencia in the remaining first knockout round, first leg ties.<br><br>lol another Thailand "walk-out"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.teamtalk.com//Images/100357.jpg"><br><br><strong>BECKHAM STARS AS REAL DEFEAT BAYERN</strong><br><br>Real Madrid put their recent troubles aside to gain the upper hand in their Champions League last-16 tie against Bayern Munich. Raul netted a brace while Ruud van Nistelrooy also got on the scoresheet as Madrid, who have been jeered off the pitch by their fans following some dismal home performances recently, claimed a narrow 3-2 first leg win at the Bernabeu.<br><br>Bayern, for whom the Champions League is their last realistic chance of silverware this season, netted two valuable goals through Lucio and Mark van Bommel, though, to leave everything up for grabs in the second leg.<br><br>Neither side came into the match Madrid coach Fabio Capello, who Spanish media had claimed handed in his resignation on Monday - something dismissed by the club's board - opted for a more attacking line-up than usual.<br><br>He started with two strikers in Van Nistelrooy and Gonzalo Higuain, brought the evergreen Roberto Carlos in at left-back and dropped holding midfielder Emerson to the bench.<br><br>Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld, who has lost two of his three games since replacing Felix Magath in the hotseat, named Owen Hargreaves in his first XI.<br><br>Madrid knew they needed to get the Bernabeu crowd onside quickly, and they did just that when Raul opened the scoring after only 10 minutes. Van Nistelrooy picked up a pass from David Beckham before threading a superb ball through to Raul, who bundled his way past Oliver Kahn and slotted into an empty net.<br><br>Madrid were not ahead for long though, as Bayern equalised with their first real chance of the game in the 23rd minute. A deep free-kick to the far post from Willy Sagnol found the unmarked Lucio and he had the fairly easy task of heading home past Iker Casillas.<br><br>That could have dented Madrid's confidence, but instead of going into their shells, the home side promptly went back down the other end and re-took the lead a few minutes later. Beckham flung in a corner and Ivan Helguera rose above everyone else to send a looping header back across goal which Raul got the slightest of touches on to nod home from point-blank range.<br><br>The impressive Beckham, who was sent off against Betis at the weekend, was leading the Madrid charge and he was again involved as the Spanish side made it 3-1 in the 34th minute through Van Nistelrooy.<br><br>The former England captain drilled in a free-kick which found its way through to Van Nistelrooy at the far post and the unmarked Dutchman made no mistake from about four yards out.<br><br>Bayern, who are already out of the German Cup and are a massive 12 points behind leaders Schalke in the Bundesliga, tried to stage an immediate reply but Roy Makaay's volley was straight at Casillas as Madrid finished the first half two goals clear.<br><br>The interval did not seem to break Madrid's stride either, Firstly Higuain shot straight at Kahn after latching onto a brilliantly-weighted Beckham through-ball, before Beckham himself brought a flying one-handed save out of the Bayern goalkeeper with a curling 25-yard free-kick.<br><br></div>

The Gunners had the better of the first half, with Tomas Rosicky forcing PSV keeper Gomes into a fine save. But PSV improved after the break and Mendez beat Jens Lehmann with a fierce low effort from 25 yards on the hour.<br><br>Despite plenty of possession, Arsenal could not fashion an equaliser and must come from behind in the second leg. It had started promisingly enough for Arsene Wenger's side, who kept PSV on the back foot in the first-half with their one-touch passing game.<br><br>Gomes pulled off a magnificent save from Rosicky after the Czech midfielder had exchanged a one-two with Thierry Henry and both Rosicky and Henry went close with 20-yard efforts.<br><br>As Arsenal pressed, PSV were relying heavily on the pace of Arouna Kone to ease the pressure but the striker was too often ploughing a lone furrow. But after a half-time talking-to from Koeman,and no doubt encouraged by some sloppy Arsenal play, PSV began to commit more numbers to attack.<br><br>Kone had already made a mess of a volley when Mendez put the hosts ahead with a deadly low strike into the corner. The PSV fans could barely believe their luck and after a quiet first-half, the Philips Stadion came to life.<br><br>Arsenal looked panic-stricken, with pass after pass going astray. The sense of bewilderment was summed up when Philippe Senderos was booked for a pointless handball.<br><br>With his side in control, Koeman took the opportunity to create Champions League history by sending on Xiang Sun - the first Chinese player to appear in the competition. And with Sun bolstering PSV's defence, Arsenal found chances hard to come by despite enjoying plenty of possession.<br><br>Henry sensed an opportunity when he was fouled 30 yards out but he was left shaking his head when substitute Julio Baptista stole in take the free-kick and put it straight at the keeper.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>PSV: Gomes, Kromkamp, Alex, Da Costa (Sun 65), Salcido, Culina, Simons, Cocu, Mendez, Kone, Tardelli (Vayrynen 75).<br>Subs Not Used: Moens, Addo, Feher.<br><br>Goals: Mendez 61.<br><br>Arsenal: Lehmann, Gallas, Toure, Senderos, Clichy, Hleb (Julio Baptista 75), Silva, Fabregas, Rosicky, Henry, Adebayor.<br>Subs Not Used: Almunia, Ljungberg, Denilson, Flamini, Djourou, Aliadiere.<br><br>Booked: Senderos.<br><br>Att: 35,000.<br><br>Ref: Tom Ovrebo (Norway).<br></div>
