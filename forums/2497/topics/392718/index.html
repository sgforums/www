              <h1>Hamstring injury rules Michael Owen out for the season  - Barclays Premier League</h1>
              
              <p>Manchester United striker Michael Owen has been ruled out for the season after tests revealed the extent of the hamstring injury he picked up in last Sunday's Carling Cup final victory over Aston Villa.</p>
              <p>The news is a big blow for Owen, who has been plagued by hamstring injuries throughout his career, and ends any slim hopes he had of making a late charge into Fabio Capello's England World Cup squad.</p>
              <p>United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was quick to point the finger of blame at the Wembley turf, which was heavily criticised by both sets of players after the Carling Cup final, though Ferguson also admitted their was an element of bad luck involved in the injury.</p>
              <p>Ferguson claimed on Monday that he expected Owen to be out "for a few weeks" but the news is much worse for the striker, who has scored nine goals in 27 appearances this season.</p>
              <p>With Owen out, United are left with young duo Mame Biram Diouf and Federico Macheda as back-up strikers, but if either Wayne Rooney or Dimitar Berbatov were to get injured, it would leave Ferguson with a lack of experience in reserve.</p>

              <p>Seriously, Fergie should go out and buy a decent striker in the next transfer window.</p>
              <p>Owen is injured half the time, Berba is inconsistent, and Diouf and Macheda are inexperienced.</p>
              <p>An injured Owen is already bad news.... Owen thus far has often been a pretty useful Plan B should Rooney and Berba be ineffective.</p>

              <p>well, at least he scores lots of goals at liverpool, n when he is with england. i bet u cant even score 1/4 of what he did even if u play with ur kakis lol.</p>
              <p>obviously, to get the best out of ur striker, u have to play to his style. think la, why the hell will the manager play high balls into the penalty area when owen is in the team -.- he got pace then make use of his pace la.</p>
              <p>back then, he's not a sharp finisher ah... trying to be funny? anyway he can head the ball -.-</p>
              <p>he got pace, movement off the ball, positioning, finishing back then. where got useless -.-</p>

              <p>pace was his asset all along, and whether he can shoot doesnt really matters back then, he is depoly as a out and out striker or fox in the box kinda striker hence he is supposed to only take care of finishing the ball off once he had the ball in the 12 yard box... he wasnt a sharp finisher??? you gotta be kidding me buddy, i meant he is the most profilic striker back then wasnt he?? i think if i'm not wrong, he out score Fowler and Ian Rush in the statics didnt he?&gt;??</p>

              <p>Owen is probably one of the best finisher from the box. He may not be good at dribbling, but that was never his strong point throughout his career. Technically in front of the goal, he is right up there as statistics proved. His plus points is getting into positions and striking of the ball to get goals no matter how easy it may seems tapping in or pushing in, what matters is getting the ball in the net. And he has proved that throughout his career.</p>
              <p>At Real or Newcastle his goal ratio to minutes played is still better than some others who plays more games. Even at United currently, despite the little time he has played, he still manage to score 9 goals this season. To be fair, thats a lot for a back-up striker who took a 50% pay cut and and could also be on a pay as you play deal...</p>
              <p>Personally, I feel his time at United so far is great... There is no two ways about it, United got him as a 3rd striker and if you compare him to some others who are on a lot higher salary than him and hardly get you goals... Like Joe Cole, Robbie Keane, Aquilani, Santa Cruz... You will realized that Owen has been a good buy or should we say a good recruit as he didn't cost any money unlike the rest mentioned above... He has played a little more games than Santa Cruz, scored 3 times more (and I don't mean 3 goals more) than him, and how much did Santa Cruz cost, $18m or there about?</p>
              <p>Owen is current England's only playing top scorer left on 40 goals... The rest like Bobby Charlton have retired long ago... Anyone who thinks Owen is finish, will look really silly cos the guy just turn 30 in Dec, Players like Saha is almost 1 and a half years older than him and look at him go... A good rest in the summer will be good for him. Finally, the inclusion of Owen probably help United won the Carling Cup. That in itself I think is enough said.</p>

              <p>well.. again i might be wrong but in Real he hardly had a proper
              game when when he did get some games he scored quite a few goals
              didnt he?? other then him being injured pretty often he is kinda
              good in his scoring ratio,</p>
              <p>Inzaghi?? he too is a pretty good striker wasnt he?? or maybe
              you likes to tell us how you define a good and bad striker??</p>

              <p>just a while back you are claiming that Owen is not a good scorer and so on and get some serious knock on your ass with other posts from fellow forumers claiming your mistake now you start anyone about Inzaghi, ok now since you wanna change subject then fine i'll change with you, but befroe that can you just kindly aknowledge that Owen is a good goal scorer??hahahah1...</p>
              <p>ok now to your Inzaghi, he is no good again?? you mean to say he cant score too?? i think either your requirement is outta the world or your TV needs repair.. yes, he might have played with some of the best team in Itay and of course that helps to a certian extend but was it his fault to be wanted by them?? you meant to say that some lousy striker would be wanted by some of the top club in the world? his goal telly i cant remember but i kinda remember he is scoring pretty regualarly when he is with Juvs and now Milan right?? might not be a complete footballer but sure is a good striker and sure is one who knows where the net is..</p>
              <p>Batistuta?? you cant compare players like that.. i mean then after i nail you down with Inzaghi would you come up with players like Andy Cole? Ian Rush? Lineker? Shearer? Maradona? Pele? Romario? and so on????</p>
              <p>get your point out 1st.. who would you want to talk about in this thread??? dun hop just say it out and stick to it like a man</p>

              <p>now that so many of the guys agreed that Owen is indeed a good goal scorer would you still wanna claim otherwise?? if not then be a man and agreed with us..</p>
              <p>ok now to your beloved Inzaghi, whats the problem with him being with the top teams?? you mean to say a good scorer must be from a lousy team?? if his goal scoring is not what makes these clubs want him as their striker then i seriously dunno what you say??his goal scoring record if anyone would be kind enough to dig out i guess would be pretty impressive, might not be the best all time striker but sure would be enough to shut your butter lips from claim otherwise...</p>
              <p>now over to Batistuta and Shevchenko.. who else havent come out? bring them on together dun later got smack with your latest claim that Inzaghi is not a good scorer then you start bring the whole family out.. wanna go for Andy Cole? Lineker&gt;? Shearer? Ian Rush? Ian Wright? Fowler? T. Henry? Romario? Pele? Maradona??</p>

              <p>i think you are confused.</p>
              <p>english players arent known for their technical abilities.</p>
              <p>they are more common in the spanish and italian league.</p>
              <p>owen is a proven striker.</p>
              <p>i guess that is why most english players dont do well in the spanish and italian league.  and that is also why most spanish and italian players dont do well in the english league.</p>
              <p>french and dutch players are more suited for the BPL.</p>
