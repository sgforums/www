              <p>owen dont have any technical skills??you didnt even define why owen dont have the so-call technical skills u had mention</p>
              <p>you only said 'Owen couldn't fit into Real becoz they don't play the
                                      run-and-charge style like Liverpool'</p>
              <p>then let me ask you how the hell he can score so many goals even if he doesnt have much starting play.</p>
              <p>as i had said earlier, a striker job is to score goals. and u think scoring goals is damn easy?? of course they need to have the skills and pace to do it.</p>
              <p>arrr i dont want to argue with you anymore, talking to you is like talking to a wall. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>I think you're lagging behind in terms of knowledge of football, the current football news and happenings.</p>
              <p>To say that Owen and Inzaghi are not good strikers is like saying Pele is a good goalkeeper. Ok, maybe i exaggerate but i do believe you see my point.</p>
              <p>Owen did not flop badly at Madrid. It's because of Raul's influence in the Real Madrid board that the coach has no choice but to play him no matter how badly he played and the fact that Real Madrid changed no less than 3 managers that season: Vanderlei Luxemburgo, Jose Antonio Camacho and Mariano Garcia Remon.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you more about the history: in 04-05 season, Raul played 43
              matches and scored 13 goals. Owen played 43 as well but scored 16. Ronaldo, the brazilian one, won the Pichichi that season with 21 goals. Oh, and in case you're wondering, Pichichi is the throphy given to the top goalscorer for each league season.</p>
              <p>Inzaghi's goalscoring exploit is for all to see. Despite many injuries setback and ageing factor, he is still going strong.</p>

However, Henry concluded his <span class="mw-redirect">debut season</span> as the club's top scorer with 19 goals in addition to nine league assists, second behind Lionel Messi's ten.

              <p>I think you're lagging behind in terms of knowledge of football,
              the current football news and happenings.</p>
              <p>To say that Owen and Inzaghi are not good strikers is like
              saying Pele is a good goalkeeper. Ok, maybe i exaggerate but i do
              believe you see my point.</p>
              <p>Owen did not flop badly at Madrid. It's because of Raul's
              influence in the Real Madrid board that the coach has no choice but
              to play him no matter how badly he played and the fact that Real
              Madrid changed no less than 3 managers that season: Vanderlei
              Luxemburgo, Jose Antonio Camacho and Mariano Garcia Remon.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you more about the history: in 04-05 season, Raul
              played 43 matches and scored 13 goals. Owen played 43 as well but
              scored 16. Ronaldo, the brazilian one, won the Pichichi that season
              with 21 goals. Oh, and in case you're wondering, Pichichi is the
              throphy given to the top goalscorer for each league season.</p>
              <p>Inzaghi's goalscoring exploit is for all to see. Despite many
              injuries setback and ageing factor, he is still going strong.</p>
