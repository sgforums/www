            <div class='col-md body'>Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate has praised Stewart Downing for his performance against Bolton.<br><br>The winger set up three and scored one as Boro thrashed Bolton 5-1 at The Riverside Stadium.<br><br>Southgate is expecting more of the same from Downing in the future after his showing against The Trotters.<br><br>"He had a fantastic afternoon and I'm delighted for him, I think that will do him the world of good," Southgate told Sky Sports. "I think sometimes he doesn't realise what a good player he is.<br><br>"The goal that he scored was terrific but some of the crosses he put in were superb as well so it was a special day for him.<br><br>"It was a good performance and I know we'll get more of those from him."<br><br>Southgate was delighted with the overall performance from all of his side, which saw Boro claim their third successive Premiership victory.<br><br>"I'm really pleased, three wins on the bounce and to play the way we are at the moment is really enjoyable to watch," Southgate said.<br><br>"There's a belief and togetherness about the team and to be able to play that way against a side that's as tough as Bolton are is really pleasing.<br><br>"We knew Bolton would be a tough challenge, they had their strongest side out, they're a very experienced team and normally they are very difficult to break down but today they've not had the best of days but that's great credit to us because we've forced the pace."<br><br>Southgate confirmed talks over a new deal with Mark Viduka will begin soon, but has urged more performances like the one against Bolton, which saw him net twice.<br><br>He added: "We'll start negotiations, but he's started his on the field. The way he's playing is superb and he doesn't have to do much more talking than that really."</div>
