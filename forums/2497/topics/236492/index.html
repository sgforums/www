            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42519000/gif/_42519617_qpr_203.gif"><br><br><strong>Chinese under-23 international Zheng Tao was knocked unconscious during a brawl in a match against Queens Park Rangers at the English club's training ground on Wednesday, media reports said. The club said on Thursday it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident, which caused Premier League referee Dermot Gallacher to abandon the friendly with QPR winning 2-1 in the second half. </strong><br><br>'The club abhor violence of any sort and do not condone the actions taken by anyone involved,' said a QPR statement. Xian Chanba defender Zheng was unconscious for five minutes after the fighting, which was sparked when Gao Lin hit a player from the English second division club. Web portal Sina said Zheng had broken his jaw and lost a tooth in the clash. 'I've never seen anything like it in my life,' a witness told the Ealing Gazette newspaper. <span style="color: red;">'There were punches, kung-fu kicks and all sorts. It was absolute mayhem.' </span><br><br>The Chinese Olympic team for next year's Beijing Games are in England for a two-week stay at Chelsea's training complex in Cobham. Shanghai Shenhua striker Gao, who could be sent home, said he had been provoked. 'I failed to control myself in the match,' he said in an apology. 'When facing the provocation I failed to obey the three rules of submitting to the referee, respecting opponents, and not striking back, which caused the incident ... I sincerely apologise to the fans.'<br><br>China's assistant coach Jia Xiuquan also apologised. 'In the future we will put more effort in to strengthening the management of the players and will definitely avoid similar things happening again,' he said. Chinese players are often accused of lacking the physicality to compete with sides from outside Asia and there were scuffles in the first tour match against a Chelsea reserve side on Monday.<br><br>'I never expected to see this kind of thing. We came here to train, not to fight. I am very disappointed, very,' head coach Ratomir Dujkovic told Titan Sports newspaper.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Watch the QPR Vs China fighting match here... </strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDkUr4p3ctY" rel="nofollow">Longer version</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spHjQ69EfYs" rel="nofollow">Short version</a><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>QPR vs China: The One Unexplained Question</strong></span><br><br>With all the uproar over what occurred at the training ground game between QPR and Team China, it's still not clear how and why QPR were playing Team China in the first place. How did China settle on QPR? Did Chelsea request or offer to QPR the opportunity to play China. Additionally, it's not at all clear why QPR did not publicize this game/scrimmage and if anything appeared to leave the impression that QPR were not playing China.<br><br>What is known is that in early January, Chelsea and China announced that the Team China would be coming over to England to train at Chelsea. This was viewed as part of Chelsea's "outreach" to China as part of their effort to become one of the World's Premier teams.<br><br>News reports stated that QPR would be playing Team at China at Loftus Road. In response, QPR issued an official statement, January 23 under the title "CORRECTION<br><br>The Club has had it brought to its attention that Ceefax and Teletext are reporting a game between QPR and China on February 8.We would like to confirm that no such fixture is taking place at Loftus Road and we have already asked both parties to remove the story." QPR Official Statement<br>Strangely the club made no mention of the fact that they would be playing a scrimmage/game against China at their training ground. The only place this was reported in a couple of lines at the end of stories re the China visit. (And highlighted several times in QPR Report!)<br><br>QPR in recent months having publicly announced their new special relationship with Chelsea,which among other things, has seen two top Chelsea quality youth/Reserves (Smith &amp; Mancienne) join the club on lengthy loans. Meanwhile Youth Player, Dean Parrett discussed a transfer to Chelsea before settling on Spurs. So it might not be unreasonable for some to wonder why QPR played the Chinese team - just two days before their crucial relegation at Southend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>China send seven home after brawl </strong><br><br>Seven members of China's Olympic team have been sent home following a mass brawl that occurred during their friendly with QPR on Wednesday. The game at Rangers' training ground was halted after a fight during which China's Zheng Tao was knocked out and suffered two cracks in his jaw.<br><br>QPR chairman Gianni Paladini has hinted that he could sack some of the players involved in the fight. "When we find out what went wrong, I will come down very strong," he said. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police told BBC Radio Five Live: "No arrests have been made, but inquiries are continuing into the incident."<br><br>The Football Association has confirmed it is also investigating the brawl, which is said to have included up to 30 people. Paladini added: "We will conduct our own internal investigation into this matter. We will go to work 24 hours a day to find out what happened. "If people cannot control themselves they should not be there, in that position, because sooner or later something like that is going to happen again. "Therefore, it depends how much provocation was in it, and when we find out what went wrong, myself and [manager] John Gregory will act.<br><br>"I am sick about the whole thing, completely fed up. I hope we can find something out by Saturday." Meanwhile, China coach Ratomir Dujkovic admitted he missed the origins of the incident, but added: "Whether the local guys (QPR) or our guys began it is not important. It is unacceptable."<br><br>However, team manager Li Xiaoguang insists he will take full responsibility for the incident. "I would like to make an official apology," he said. "Whatever the reasons for the incident, as the team manager, I will take the responsibility. "We have noticed some of the young players can not control themselves well. But, although the participants in this incident were the players, I will take all the blame.<br><br>"The unexpected incident happened in any case and I will be conducting a serious inquiry into it. We have learnt a lesson from this incident." Premiership official Dermot Gallagher was refereeing the match but was forced to bring an early end to proceedings after the fight broke out.<br><br>An FA spokesman said: "We are investigating and we will be seeking information from Dermot Gallagher." The unusual circumstances of the game - it was not an official match and took place at QPR's training ground - means it could be difficult for the FA to act. The China squad are in England for two weeks, based at Chelsea's training complex at Cobham, Surrey, as they prepare for next year's Olympic Games in Beijing.<br><br>They are scheduled to play Brentford on 16 February.<br></div>
