              <p>eduardo's performance yest was bad, but not as worse as ngog's.</p>
              <p>i thought arsenal started the game well, quite balance in the beginning, things start to change when chelsea got their first goal.</p>
              <p>that own goal was abit sway lar.</p>
              <p>overall, chelsea deserve to leave arsenal's home as winner.</p>
              <p>but it will also be interesting to see how wenger gonna get things going again.</p>

              <p>The team with the strongest and most consistent defence in EPL wins the title. This season that team is pointing to Chelsea.</p>
              <p>In fact, their defence has improved much more than last season and is as good, if not better than Man Utd.</p>
              <p>Arsenal cannot complain for losing the game. Without V Persie they look clueless as to how to really penetrate Chelsea defence.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's big improvement over last season is attributable to mostly to the much improved Fabregas and V Persie; over dependence on these two very similar to Pool's Gerrard and Torres.</p>
              <p>Eduardo really is CMI now.</p>

              </div>
              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsene-wenger"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsène Wenger</strong></span></a><strong> said that the "funny" thing about Didier Drogba was that "he doesn't do a lot" after the </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/chelsea"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> striker had taken centre stage in another victory over </strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;"><strong>Arsenal</strong></span></a><strong>. The Arsenal manager, who was left to bemoan perceived refereeing injustice, felt that Chelsea's 3-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium was unfair on his team. Yet he was forced to admit that Drogba, Arsenal's nemesis in recent seasons, did have the golden touch at present.</strong></p>
              <p>Drogba scored Chelsea's first and third goals in a result that improved his club's hopes of winning the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Premier League</span></a> title, with the second coming via a Thomas Vermaelen own-goal. Drogba has now scored 10 times in 11 games against Arsenal.</p>
              <p>"He's a good player," said Wenger of the Ivory Coast striker, who now has 14 goals in all competitions this season. "It's funny because he doesn't do a lot but he is efficient in what he does. You would be surprised by the number of balls that he touched today. Drogba is in a period where he kicks the ball and it goes in.</p>
              <p>"You can't tell me that for the first goal, the ball went where he intended it to go. At the moment he just goes for it and it goes in. The first was the goal of a striker in complete confidence."</p>
              <p>"Maybe I'm just lucky," said Drogba, with a smile. "I like to play against Arsenal because they used to be the team that people supported in France [where he grew up] and so I supported them as well. But since I've come to Chelsea, I've done a job for my team."</p>
              <p>Wenger complained bitterly about the referee Andre Marriner's decision to disallow a second-half goal from Andrey Arshavin, which would have cut Chelsea's lead to 2-1. Marriner penalised Eduardo da Silva for a raised boot on the Chelsea goalkeeper, Petr Cech, moments before Arshavin found the net.</p>
              <p>"I personally believe that that wasn't a serious decision," said Wenger. "How can he see Eduardo kicking the ball out of Cech's hands when there was a Chelsea player in front of him? That was a massive mistake by the referee. I just think that we made mistakes and the referee got the turning point of the game wrong: 2-1 is different to 2-0 at the start of the second half. The referees this year ... our game with Man United, the Chelsea game ... they have been decided by the referee." Wenger went on to state the case for the use of video-replay technology. "The referees don't want video but it's difficult to understand why not," he said. "Why doesn't he ask? Because he's too scared to be intimidated, to be under pressure to use the video."</p>
              <p>Wenger complained that "absolutely everything went for Chelsea". He added: "The score is a very unfair reflection of the game but it is the score. The first shot on goal they scored and with their second cross they scored."</p>
              <p>Wenger is convinced that Arsenal, who trail Chelsea by 11 points, albeit with a game in hand, are not out of the running. "Our challenge has taken a big blow and the damage done at Sunderland in last weekend's defeat was deeper, confidence-wise, than it should have been. Chelsea are in a very strong position but they can, for me, still drop points. I'm convinced of that. The problem we will face now is that people will not believe in us. We have to make sure that that doesn't diminish our belief."</p>

              <p>a good read -&gt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/dec/01/arsenal-arsene-wenger-didier-drogba.</p>
              <p>some key pts -&gt;</p>
              <p>It might be worth taking aim at his team's record against the other
              members of the usual top four since they last grasped the title in 2004.In that period Arsenal have completed 32 matches against Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague">Premier League</a>, winning just eight of them, drawing 11 and losing the other 13.</p>
              <p>No Arsenal fan could have mustered an affectionate smile for the
              idiosyncrasy of a centre-half pairing in which neither William Gallas
              and Thomas Vermaelen, the men asked to marshal Drogba, are above six
              feet.</p>
              <p>hmm, do U think Wenger is also walking on thin ice?</p>
