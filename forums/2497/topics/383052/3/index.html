              <p><br><br>Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti dismissed Arsenal's complaints over Andrey Arshavin's disallowed goal after Chelsea eased to a 3-0 victory over their London rivals on Sunday.<br><br>As
              so often is the case, Arsenal failed to capitalise on their early
              dominance and Chelsea struck twice in a matter of minutes before
              half-time.<br><br>Arsene Wenger pinpointed Arsenal's disallowed goal
              soon after the interval as the turning point of the game, claiming
              Eduardo had not touched Petr Cech in the build-up and that the goal
              should have stood.<br><br>However, Wenger's Chelsea counterpart took
              the opposite view, and understandably preferred to reflect on his own
              side's winning performance and prospects for the season.<br><br>"They [Arsenal] are upset because they lost and I think it was a foul on Petr Cech," said Ancelotti, as quoted by the <em>Press Association</em>.</p>
              <p>"We started the season believing we could win it [the league]. Our
              objective is to stay in all the competitions until the end of the
              season. Then after that, if we can win things, we will try to do it.</p>
              <p>"When I signed a contract with Chelsea, I believed we could win something."</p>
              <p>The former Milan coach also chose to celebrate Didier Drogba's potency and dedication to the cause.</p>
              <p>"Drogba scored two goals and for me he did a good job," added Ancelotti.</p>
              <p>"In the second half he returned sometimes in defence in our half
              together with his other team-mates. His work maintained balance in our
              team."</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> boss <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsene Wenger</span></abbr> was furious with ref Andre Marriner after their 3-0 home demolition by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>.</p>
              <p>Wenger hit out at the referee for ruling out Andrey Arshavin's goal shortly after half-time for an apparent foul by Eduardo on <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> stopper Petr Cech.</p>
              <p>The Blues were 2-0 up at the time following <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Didier Drogba</span></abbr>'s
              opener and a Thomas Vermaelen own goal. Wenger said Marriner had told
              him he gave the foul because Eduardo kicked the ball out of Cech's
              hands as both players went for a cross.</p>
              <p>When the ball came loose from the clash it fell to Arshavin,
              who put the ball in the net only for Marriner to blow up for the foul.</p>
              <p>Wenger believes his side could have gained a vital foothold back into the match if the Russian's goal had been allowed to stand.</p>
              <p>"The turning point was the referee's decision (to disallow the
              goal)," Wenger said. "Personally I believe it was not a serious
              decision, that was very unfair. How can he see Eduardo kicking Cech
              when it was a <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr> player who stops him from controlling the ball?</p>
              <p>"It would have been a very important goal in this kind of game and that
              was a big mistake by the referee. When you start the second half of the
              game 2-0 down instead of 2-1 down, it's psychologically completely
              different for the security of <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Chelsea</span></abbr>."</p>
              <p>The Frenchman believes the goal would have been allowed had video technology been in use.</p>
              <p>"You can see on the replay that Eduardo doesn't even intervene. He said
              to me it was dangerous play, that Eduardo had kicked the ball out of
              Cech's hands. He is not even in there, Eduardo.</p>
              <p>"It's important that in big games referees do not make big
              mistakes and influence the result and today it was a mistake from the
              referee. Apart from that he was fair and tried to be fair but he made a
              massive mistake at a very important point in the game.</p>
              <p>"I personally think the referees do not want video. It's
              difficult to understand why. Why doesn't he ask for video today when.
              Why? Nobody knows because they are scared to be intimidated and they
              are worried about being under pressure when they are looking at video."</p>

              <p>Arsenal overall performance was pathetic... They started the match well and I feel had Van Persie was playing, they would have got a goal or two in the first half. But Eduardo was really poor... He was like an invisible man... lost lots of the ball that was passed to him...</p>
              <p>This match clearly shown Arsenal's nice football got blown out of the water by a physically big and stronger team. Arshavin was sent flying in the middle of the pitch and the most memorable and yet funny moment for me was their left-back. I think it was Traore or someone... Tried to bang into Drogba and instead went flying himself... I have never seen a defender going in to challenge a striker by trying to use his shoulder to bang into the striker and went flying himself... Practically flying, hands, feets all in the air and head going down under... I couldn't help laughing when I saw that part... lol.</p>
