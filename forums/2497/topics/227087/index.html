            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/zocoss/lamp2.jpg"><br><br>CHELSEA ace Frank Lampard has been accused of cheating on his fiancÃ©e with a Spanish chauffeuse.<br><br>The England midfielder bedded blonde driver Montse Lucas before a Champions League tie in Barcelona. Montse, 34, turned up at his hotel to collect tickets for the October 31 match against the Spanish champs. But she told how she got her tickets and a lot more as Frank seduced her in his luxury suite at the Juan Carlos hotel in the Catalan capital.<br><br>She first met Frank when she was assigned to pick up a group of executives from Barcelona Airport at 10.30pm on October 21. She dropped them at the hotel and waited while they freshened up. Â“I could tell the men were up for a lively evening, so I suggested we went to a busier part of the club. Frank had maybe three beers while I was there and was certainly quite merry. At one point a Madonna track came on. He turned to me and said, Â‘You donÂ’t know who I am, do you?Â”<br><br>Â“He told me he was a famous football player and I laughed and replied, Â‘Yes, and IÂ’m MadonnaÂ’.<br><br>Â“I glanced across and saw that Steve looked tired and bored. Â“I asked him why he didnÂ’t just go to bed and he said he was FrankÂ’s manager and that he had to look after him all the time. I realised then that Frank probably was a footballer, but it didnÂ’t faze me because I donÂ’t impress easily.Â”<br><br>At 2.15am, the trio walked back to LampardÂ’s hotel. Exhausted Lampard went to bed and Montse left them to get some sleep with a promise of two match tickets and agent SteveÂ’s number. As Montse had worked the late shift the previous evening, another driver looked after Lamps in the morning.<br><br>Montse said: Â“It was a fun night but I had prepared myself not to see Frank again. I was sad, but he lived in London and I lived in Barcelona. Â“My only hope was theyÂ’d promised to get tickets for me and my nine-year-old nephew. I texted the agent asking about them. I got a text back to say they would try to organise something and, if possible, would leave them at the King Juan Carlos Hotel where the team was based.<br><br>Â“I arrived and there were no tickets. I decided to go to FrankÂ’s room. But when she arrived at his room, she discovered the ace had more than giving her tickets on his mind. She added: Â“The door was open so I went in and found Frank in his Chelsea tracksuit. Frank opened the champagne and brought a large glass for each of us. I was sitting on a sofa. He sat at the end of it.Â” They chatted for a while, then Montse thanked him for the tickets and said she was going to leave.<br><br>She said: Â“He insisted I stay. He moved closer and asked if I was dating. I told him I had split from my boyfriend of two years in February. Â“There was an electric buzz of anticipation in the room. I wasnÂ’t sure if weÂ’d make love as it was so close to such an important game. He poured even more champagne.<br><br>Â“He asked me to stay, grabbed my hand and kissed me. Then he lifted me up so that I was straddling him. Â“He looked at me and said, Â‘I want to be with you. The first time I saw you I wanted to be with youÂ’. Â“So I let him take my top off to reveal the black bra underneath. He is a professional athlete who trains every day, so he has a great body. Every time he kissed me, I closed my eyes and my head was spinning.<br><br>I think it took him longer to finish because of the drink.Â”<br><br>Sighing with pleasure at the memory, Montse continued: Â“I lay in his arms and he asked if I had enjoyed it as much as him. But then five minutes later he was ready for more. Â“Afterwards I wished him good luck for the game the next day but said I wanted Barca to win. He found that funny. I left him sleeping.Â” Montse gave away the tickets and watched the game on telly. Lamps scored and was booked in the 2-2 draw.<br><br>Montse said: Â“IÂ’ve tried to contact Frank but only had his agentÂ’s number. Frank has Elen and Luna and it was so obvious that they are the people who really matter to him.Â”<br><br>Frank Lampard was unavailable to comment last night.<br></div>
