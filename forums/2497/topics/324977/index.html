              <p> </p>
              <p>Champions of England and Europe, acclaimed as the most relentless
              attacking force on the continent, Manchester United looked set for a
              decade of dominance. It is not 2008, however, but 1999. The subsequent
              nine years were scarcely unsuccessful - five Premier League titles were
              secured before they conquered the continent again, so it hardly
              represented a decline of Leeds United proportions - but the lofty
              predictions were not realised. Sir Alex Ferguson took to accepting that
              a third European Cup should have been won long before it was in Moscow
              in May.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="photoDesc">Sir Alex Ferguson needs to avoid the mistakes of '99 ahead of the new season</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>So 1999 did not precipitate a collapse; United retained their domestic
              title for a further two seasons. But in hindsight, it might be regarded
              as an opportunity missed. Of the four signings made that summer, two
              were regrettable - Mark Bosnich and Massimo Taibi - and two merely
              satisfactory, Quinton Fortune and Mikael Silvestre. Thus far this
              summer United are yet to sign anyone, and acrimony surrounds their
              principal target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are parallels, too, in the composition of the squad. Nine years
              ago, only Peter Schmeichel and, to a lesser extent, Teddy Sheringham,
              did not appear to have a long-term future. Now Edwin van der Sar is the
              veteran goalkeeper and, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs
              excepted, it is another youthful squad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the similarities with 1999 may prove a cause for concern at Old
              Trafford. The best position from which to buy is one of strength and
              they have never been stronger. Nine years ago, the arrivals were
              underwhelming; now they risk starting the season with a worse team on
              the pitch and in the dugout.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>United stood still in 1999. Now, through little fault of their own,
              they could go backwards. Carlos Queiroz, the consigliere who has
              branched out to become the boss of his own family, is gone to Portugal;
              Cristiano Ronaldo, the sharpshooter responsible for pulling the trigger
              on inferior opponents, is starting to look like a gun for hire to the
              bigger bidders from the Bernabeu.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While Sir Alex Ferguson's defiance last week earned headlines, Ronaldo
              has never been for sale. That has not deterred Real. When Giggs, a
              survivor of the generation of '99, urged his younger team-mates not to
              wait nine years for a further taste of continental supremacy, he forgot
              to specify that he meant in Manchester, not Madrid. But the consequence
              of the Ronaldo saga is that uncertainty has replaced optimism as the
              prevailing emotion.</p>
              <p>Yet there should be sympathy for Ferguson. Neither
              situation is of his creation. In both cases, he has provided reasons
              for the architects of United's success to stay. Both, however, are
              proof that visible progress can be counter-productive, with envious
              glances directed at the assistant manager and star turn alike.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ferguson may get his wish and keep Ronaldo, but the effect has been
              destabilising nonetheless. The Portuguese has endangered his
              relationship with the United support; the unstoppable momentum that
              propelled him onto the scoresheet with remarkable regularity seems
              gone. With a sense his motives may be selfish, team-mates may prove
              less willing to sacrifice themselves for Ronaldo's benefit; Wayne
              Rooney, for instance, occupied a deeper or a wider role to allow the
              nominal winger to operate as a centre-forward. And the longer
              uncertainty surrounds his future, the less time United have to recruit
              a replacement if he does depart. It will not be easy: 42 goal wingers
              are few and far between.</p>

              <p class="photoDesc">Man United's pursuit of Berbatov has caused anger in London</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>In attack, Ferguson's target is well chosen. Dimitar Berbatov would
              become a high-calibre signing, and is the type of player who can add
              another dimension to the forward line. In addition, he would strengthen
              a department short of personnel, though not quality. The holy trinity -
              Carlos Tevez, Rooney and Ronaldo - could yet become a fantastic four,
              but the worst-case scenario is that they will be reduced to a double
              act. Two rancorous situations are unlikely to both be resolved in the
              champions' favour. Tottenham's complaints, whether justified or not,
              about United's conduct in the Berbatov affair add to a summer of
              discontent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what should have been Ferguson's easiest summer has become has
              hardest. A position at the top has brought attention from snipers, not
              converts to the cause. Issues go beyond personnel. The unofficial title
              of the world's biggest club may be at stake. It would be a dent to
              United's pride and a boost to some already rather sizeable egos at the
              Bernabeu if Ronaldo could be lured away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He has served as a distraction from all other players. That may not
              beneficial; attention elsewhere may have provided a focus on the United
              squad. In 1999, there was not the recognition that, fine footballers as
              both remained, Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke had both just enjoyed the
              best season of their careers. The question can be asked if the same now
              applies to, say, Wes Brown; given Ferguson's earlier interest in Jose
              Bosingwa, a right-back may have been on the agenda before he pronounced
              he intended to make a solitary signing. Likewise, the admiration of
              Miguel Veloso - perhaps fuelled by Queiroz - may have faded. That is
              not to suggest dispensing with a successful and exhilarating team;
              merely that Old Trafford should be a more enticing destination, and the
              Manchester rain less of an obstacle, when it houses the European
              champions.</p>
              <p>On the two previous occasions that was the case, it
              did not provide a springboard for greater achievements. Given Chelsea's
              heavy expenditure, the modern-day United could do much worse than
              emulate the team of 1999 by winning a hat-trick of Premier League
              title. The other issue, however, is whether they could do so much more,
              and the fear the events of this summer could ultimately hinder them.</p>
