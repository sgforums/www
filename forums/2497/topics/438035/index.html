              <h1>Blues calm despite low crowd</h1>
              <p>Chelsea are refusing to panic after Stamford Bridge witnessed its lowest crowd for a Champions League game since the Rosenborg boycott of 2007.</p>

              <p><strong>Just under 34,000 spectators turned up for Tuesday night's Group E opener against Bayer Leverkusen, manager Andre Villas-Boas' first European match in charge.</strong></p>
              <p>The attendance was still 10,000 more than for the group game against Rosenborg four years ago, a fixture that represented a nadir in club-supporter relations over ticket prices.</p>
              <p>But Tuesday's figure did follow a 33% rise in Champions League ticket prices, which has upset some fans and has sparked a campaign on Twitter for a boycott of next month's home match against Genk.</p>
              <p>Chelsea Supporters' Group vice-chairman Michelle Shaw wrote on her organisation's website on Sunday: "Not only am I boycotting Genk, I am also boycotting Leverkusen and Valencia.</p>
              <p>"My choice, I know, but I made the decision as soon as the ticket prices were announced.</p>
              <p>"Why? Because I don't want to wake up one May and find I can't afford my season ticket any more.</p>
              <p>"The only way to send a message to the club is by a low attendance at the Genk game."</p>
              <p>Chelsea slashed their Champions League prices almost in half after fans baulked at paying £48 per ticket for the Rosenborg game.</p>
              <p>But they went back up to £40 this season, with tickets for other competitions also increasing for the second straight year following a four-year season-ticket price freeze.</p>
              <p>It is understood Chelsea are remaining calm about last night's attendance figure, part of the reason for which was the short window between the group-stage draw being made and the fixture, with clubs always preferring to play their opening game away to give them longer to sell tickets for their first home match.</p>
              <p>It remains to be seen how the Blues will respond to a significant boycott of the October 19 Genk game as they attempt to balance the demands of UEFA's new Financial Fair Play regulations with maintaining an expensively-assembled squad and keeping supporters happy - all the time playing in a 42,000-capacity stadium dwarfed in terms of matchday income by Manchester United's 76,000-seater Old Trafford and Arsenal's 60,000 Emirates Stadium.</p>
