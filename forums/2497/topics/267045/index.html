            <div class='col-md body'>William Gallas has questioned Arsenal's transfer policy this summer and wants to discuss plans for the season with boss Arsene Wenger.<br><br>The departure of Thierry Henry has been offset by the arrival of Eduardo Da Silva but Gallas has revealed that some players at the Emirates Stadium are unsure of what the future holds for the club.<br><br>Arsenal's rivals in the Premier League's 'big four' have significantly strengthened their squad for the new season and Tottenham have also been active in the market, while Wenger has added Lukasz Fabianski and Eduardo.<br><br>The 29-year-old said on his own website: 'What is sure is that several players are questioning the club's future.<br><br>'Around us, all the teams are recruiting but what is planned to compensate for the departure of Titi Henry?<br><br>'I am not at Arsenal to play for third place. It is necessary to recruit players of reputation because the young players have many qualities but the season is very, very long.<br><br>'The young players are thirsty for victories but Arsenal must obtain results, win titles in this period. If not, we will have to change policy and do the same as the other teams: recruit with more means.'<br><br>As well as compensating for the loss of Henry, Wenger is looking to keep midfielder Cesc Fabregas at the club despite interest from new Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster.<br><br>'I believe he is one of the few players in his position that can carry a team on his back, and when I say teams, I mean quality teams,' said Schuster.<br><br>It is these types of issues Gallas wants to discuss ahead of the new season.<br><br>He added: 'I will have a discussion with Arsene Wenger and certain board members in order to find out what the objectives are for the club this season and what they wish to set up to build an even more competitive team.'<br><br>France international Gallas was vague about his own future at the club, adding: 'Today I am an Arsenal player but I do not know what can occur tomorrow.'<br><br>Meanwhile, Gunners defender Matthew Connolly has joined Coca-Cola Championship side Colchester on loan for the 2007/08 season.<br><br>------------------------<br><br>knn, i cannot stand him.<br><br>why leave chelsea for arsenal if he is not there to challenge for third place?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
