              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson feels his Manchester United players need only take a look at what has happened to Barcelona in La Liga to see how quickly their fortunes could be transformed this season.</strong></p>
              <p>United head to Newcastle in a seemingly impregnable position at the Premier League summit. But it is only a matter of weeks since Barcelona were in a similar position. Now the gap to Real Madrid is down to four and Barca are suddenly wobbling.</p>
              <p>"Barcelona have been playing Saturday-Wednesday-Saturday since January," said Ferguson. "They did have an 11-point lead, now it is four and for the first time this season they lost a game after being in front.</p>
              <p>"It is a warning, and there are plenty of them, that if you take your foot off the pedal you can get a kick in the teeth."</p>
              <p>Ferguson said United have to remain focused and, while he detects no sign among his younger players that a 'job done' feeling exists in the United dressing room, he is pretty sure his more experienced campaigners would stamp it out if it did emerge.</p>
              <p>"They would have one attempt at being complacent and it would be the last," said Ferguson of his youth brigade. "We have plenty of bodies in the dressing room who would come down on them."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img id="articleImage" src="http://images.football365.com/09/03/240/Sir-Alex-Ferguson-Carling-Cup_1941001.jpg" border="0" alt="Ferguson - taking nothing for granted."></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>"I would be happy if we only won the Premier League from this point," he said. "It is a major trophy. "I would love to see us winning the Champions League again. That is my big desire. "But at this moment the Premier League has to be the best opportunity.</strong></p>
              <p>"If we keep our heads straight and focused we have a big chance." Not that Ferguson is willing to meekly surrender United's European crown to Jose Mourinho next week.</p>
              <p>"We have done the hard bit in a way by going there and proving our worth," he said. "Now all we need to do is win our home game and we are through to the quarter final."</p>

              <p>I think Pool has done it during the 1977 and 1978 years... Although in the old format, not the present more difficult Champions League format...</p>
              <p>During those days, only the champions of each European country qualified... So out of the 32 clubs that were in it, I think only very few stand a chance of winning it...</p>
              <p>Pool only played 7 matches on their way to winning the Cup... <span style="color: #000000;">Dynamo Dresden</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Benfica</span><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Borussia Monchengladbach</span><span style="color: #000000;"> &amp; </span><span style="color: #000000;">Club Brugge in the final.

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The new format seems impossible, too many games and the quality of the opponents are just too good... If we can take away Pool, Chelsea and Arsenal, Juve and Barcelona as well as they are all not champions of their league last season... It would be a great deal easier wouldn't you agree?</span></p>

              <p><br>I think they were allowed... But they didn't make it through the first qualification stage... After that year, the rule was made that if this year, Arsenal end out of the top 4 but win the CL... The 4th place club will have to play in the Uefa cup... That year England had 5 clubs in CL if I remember correctly but only 4 went through as usual...</p>

Champions League qualification 2005-06" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C._Champions_League_qualification_2005-06">controversy when Liverpool won the competition in 2004–05</a> but finished outside the top four in the <a class="mw-redirect" title="FA Premier League" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Premier_League">FA Premier League</a>. <a title="The Football Association" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association">The Football Association</a> ruled that <a title="Everton F.C." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.">Everton</a>,
              who finished fourth in the Premier League, should get the final English
              place in the 2005–06 European Cup. UEFA came to an agreement that both <a title="Merseyside derby" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby">Merseyside rivals</a> would be allowed to enter the competition with Liverpool starting from
              the first qualifying round and Everton starting from the third
              qualifying round. UEFA's current rule is that if the European Cup
              winners fail to finish in one of its national league's qualifying
              positions, it will take the place of the lowest placed team in its
              league. The superseded team will go to the <a title="UEFA Cup" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Cup">UEFA Cup</a>.</p>
