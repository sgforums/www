              <p><strong>The Premier League's 20 clubs collectively made a loss of £361m last year, after spending all of their record £2.3bn income. Of the clubs which were in the Premier League in 2010â€‘11, the year of most clubs' latest published accounts, eight made a profit, of £97.4m in total.</strong></p>
              <p>Of the other clubs, 11 made losses, totalling £458m. <span style="color: #000000;">Manchester City</span><span style="color: #000000;">, in the third year since </span><span style="color: #000000;">Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi's ruling family bought the club</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and began to pour in money to acquire a team capable of winning the Premier League, lost £197m, the greatest financial loss in the history of football.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span style="color: #000000;"> lost the next highest amount, £68m, bankrolled by their owner, the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, who loaned £94m to the club during 2010â€‘11. </span><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool</span><span style="color: #000000;">, documenting the first eight months of ownership by John Henry's Fenway Sports Group, lost £49m.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Birmingham City</span><span style="color: #000000;">, now in the Championship, have failed to file their accounts for 2010â€‘11, which were statutorily due on 31 December. The club's parent company, Birmingham International Holdings, registered on the Hong Kong stock exchange, has not yet published its own accounts, and Carson Yeung, who led the takeover of the club in 2009, </span><span style="color: #000000;">is awaiting trial on money-laundering charges</span><span style="color: #000000;">, which he denies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The clubs' combined turnover of £2.3bn is partly the result of the first year of the Premier League's 2010â€‘13 TV deals, in which a record £1.5bn was earned from overseas broadcasters. The financial figures portray a league of fierce sporting competition which relentlessly forces up players' wages.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In total, £1.5bn was spent on wages by the 20 clubs in 2010-11 (including Birmingham's £38m wage bill in 2009â€‘10). That accounted for 69% of the clubs' total income, slightly up from the 68% of income the clubs spent in 2009â€‘10 on wages.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The largest profit was recorded by Newcastle United, in their first season back in the Premier League since relegation in 2009. The accounts were published before last summer's transfer </span><span style="color: #000000;">business</span><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> swollen by the £35m sale to Liverpool of the striker Andy Carroll, which netted £33m profit. Manchester United, despite paying £50m in interest on the debts loaded on to the club by United's owners, the Glazer family, won the championship having spent less on wages, at £153m, than Chelsea and City, and still made a profit of £12m.</p>
              <p>Liverpool, by contrast, made an operating loss of £90m. Had they not recorded a profit of £43m for the sale of players, including £50m from Chelsea for Fernando Torres (the money spent on buying players, such as Carroll, is accounted for more gradually), Liverpool would have stated a much greater overall loss than the £49m final figure.</p>
              <p>Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the league which this season celebrated 20 years since it was formed by a breakaway of the old Football League First Division clubs, has rejected introducing a break-even rule similar to "financial fair play". Such rules, designed to make clubs break even rather than rack up losses, whether bankrolled by an owner or not, have been agreed by Uefa for its competitions and, more recently, by the Football League.</p>
              <p>In the Premier League, clubs playing in Uefa's Champions League or Europa League must comply with financial fair play over this year and next. Even the two which are lavishly backed, Chelsea and City, have stated they want to move towards breaking even.</p>
              <p>Lower down, most clubs make losses in the effort to stay up. The Wigan Athletic owner, Dave Whelan, who wrote off £48m in loans to the club last August, said that financial fair play "can only be a good thing … for football in general to ensure that debt is maintained at reasonable and sustainable levels".</p>

              <p><span><strong>Manchester City need to shift high earners such as Emmanuel Adebayor and Carlos Tevez from their £174million wage bill to fall in line with UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Deloitte's annual review of football finance shows that the Barclays Premier League champions spent more on wages than they earned during 2010-11 - the last season before rules force clubs playing in Europe to break even. </span> </p>
              <p><span>As wages in the top flight went up by a record £201m to almost £160billion, City's wages were 14 per cent more than their revenue.</span></p>
              <p><span>Roberto Mancini's side were one of 11 clubs - including Chelsea (84 per cent) and Liverpool (73 per cent)- who spent more than 70 per cent of revenue on wages, which Deloitte consider to be too high.</span></p>
              <p><span>Manchester United had the lowest at 46 per cent, while the average for the League rose to a record high of 70 per cent.</span></p>
              <p><span>Alan Switzer, director in Deloitte's sports business group, said: 'If the wages to revenue ratio is 70 per cent or higher it's very difficult to make an operating profit.</span></p>
              <p><span>'It is too high as a League and the clubs need to be edging back to the low sixties. Chelsea and Manchester City are the clubs which have recorded the biggest losses so they are the two which have the most to do and to be fair to them they have been pretty public about needing to take action.'</span></p>
