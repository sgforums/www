              This is truly a classic and brings back the old memories. Italia90 is the first world cup i watched since i started following football during primary school days. I supported Argentina then due to Diego Maradona's star status and my school mates' influence and i have supported them till today. Have to admit they rode their luck all the way to the final where their opponents West Germany were awarded a dubious late penalty to win the world cup, my first taste of cruelty in football.
              
              The italians were one team that impressed me besides the Germans, for their organized play and tight defence. Walter Zenga broke Peter Shilton's record of number of minutes without conceding a goal during a world cup finals campaign. Roger Milla and cameroon also left an impression with them becoming the first african team to make it to the quarter final of a world cup.
              
              What this world cup lacks is the goals, and imho USA 94 was the best ever world cup in terms of entertainment and goals galore.

              <p>i'm not being swayed by the limelight and fame of Van Basten but by the fact that i seen both him and later Simone played, both during his later part of Ajax days and Milan while also seeing Simone playing for both Milan and PSG, agreed that Simone is pretty good but the fact still reminds that be was being sidelined due to the fact that he happened to be in Milan when some of the very best striker ply their trade in Milan at that point of time too</p>
              <p>however, like i said, everyone has got his own opinion on the best player and we can discuss till cow come home without any form of conclusion, anyway lets agree to disagree on personal opinion</p>
