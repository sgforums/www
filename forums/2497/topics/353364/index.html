              <div class="content">
              <p>Manchester United's star fullback Patrice Evra says French fans need to follow the example of Premiership supporters.</p>
              <p>"I was disappointed to see the fans shouting 'ola' when the Argentinians were doing their tricks," he told France sports daily <em>L'Equipe</em>.</p>
              <p>"(Manchester United team-mate and Argentina striker Carlos) Tevez, when
              he came back from international duty, told me he felt as if he was
              playing in Buenos Aires.</p>
              <p>"There were (Diego) Maradona and Argentina flags in the stands.
              I still haven't seen a (Thierry) Henry flag or a (Franck) Ribery one at
              the Stade de France.</p>
              <p>"The supporters need to be behind us. If they want us to get to the World Cup they will need to do something different."</p>
              <p>Evra added: "We don't have the sporting culture of Brazilian, Argentinian, Italian or English fans.</p>
              <p>"When I arrived in England, I had the impression that I was
              doing a new job. Because of the impact of the stadiums and the
              supporters...there it's a religion.</p>
              <p>"We don't lose on purpose, nobody does that, we all go out there to win.</p>
              <p>"In three years at United I have just lost two games on the trot
              for the first time, I understand that we have to win the next game. But
              even when we've lost, they've still applauded us, not booed."</p>
              <p>Evra admits the players have been affected by the jeers and has
              urged the fans to get behind every single member of the France camp
              ahead of the crucial double header against Group Seven rivals
              Lithuania.</p>
              <p>"It certainly affects us," he continued. "We talk about it between ourselves.</p>
              <p>"I'm at a great club. When you have 76,000 people behind you, it
              gives you a massive boost, but if you hear boos from the fifth minute,
              you can't feel the same thing.</p>
              <p>"There could be some lasting bitterness following our
              catastrophic European Championships, but you have to move on. There's a
              World Cup in Africa that's coming up."</p>
