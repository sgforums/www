            <div class='col-md body'>Young agrees to join Villa for Â£9.65 million<br><br>Ashley Young is poised to complete his Â£9.65million move from Watford after Martin O'Neill confirmed the player had 'verbally agreed' to join the midlands club.<br><br>Young is set to undergo a medical at Bodymoore Heath on Sunday before formerly putting pen to paper on the deal which will confirm him as Villa's record signing.<br><br>O'Neill had an initial bid of nearly Â£7million rejected by the Hornets but looks to have finally made his first major capture of the January transfer window.<br><br>O'Neill said: 'I'm hopeful about Ashley although nothing is certain yet but he has verbally agreed to join us and he wants to come here.<br><br>'He is a very talented player and I am confident he will prove worth the money we are spending on him. I will be delighted if and when things are tied up.<br><br>'We need someone with the ability to put the ball in the net. We need a goal-scorer to convert some of the chances we are creating.'<br><br>Watford manager Aidy Boothroyd, whose side lost 2-0 at Villa Park today, said: 'The deal with the club Ashley is going to isn't quite done but we are more or less there.<br><br>'I believe it is going to be concluded tomorrow. I believe he is having a medical tomorrow.<br><br>'He has done remarkably well handling all the attention he has been receiving and I believe he will kick on again at the club he is going to. He is a real asset.<br><br>'I don't want to name the club by name who look like they are going to sign him but I think you know who it is.'<br><br>Young was left out of the Watford side to play at Villa Park on Saturday - another strong indication that Villa are the side he will be signing for.<br><br>O'Neill was delighted to see Villa clinch their first victory in 12 Premiership games thanks to two goals in the last three minutes against bottom-place Watford.<br><br>Striker Milan Baros spurned a host of chances before Villa wrapped up the points thanks to an own goal and Gabriel Agbonlahor's sixth strike of the campaign.<br><br>O'Neill said: 'It was a great relief to win and there is a lot of euphoria in the dressing room. We deserved it and we always felt capable of getting a goal even thought we left it late.<br><br>'As the pressure built up I didn't want us to lose our discipline and concede ourselves and we managed to stay patient.'<br><br>Baros was booed by a section of the Villa fans as he left the pitch when substituted near the end and O'Neill said: 'I would not approve of anyone getting that treatment at home. I felt sympathy for Milan but that sort of thing can happen.'<br><br>Boothroyd said: 'I thought we were going to hold on. It wasn't a good game and perhaps that was a reflection of the run of results both sides have been having.<br><br>'It was always going to take a scrappy goal to basically clinch it, namely an own goal, and then when you are chasing an equaliser there is always the chance of being caught on the counter-attack and that's what happened.<br><br>'I didn't believe in luck until this season, but when we do what Villa did, the ball goes straight into the keepers hands, but that's life.'</div>
