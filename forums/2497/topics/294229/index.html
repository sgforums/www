You cant possibly just let him shoulder all of the blame. It was obvious he was barely half fit when he played for a sparkless England team in the World Cup. Conceding a penalty(Which was not supposed to be given) that led to England's exit in Euro 08? Questionable indeed, when everyone knows that the team has to play credibly well for all matches to qualify.  Big picture is, it is evident that the whole team which just cant seem to play well together, and have to share this collective blame.<br><br>I think that whenever he plays, people expects him to conjure miracles after miracles and even if he puts up a credible performance but still fail to do that miracle that England needs, people all start slaming him. Expecting a 22 year old like him to carry a whole national team on his back, blaming him when the team fails is really a little too much.</div>
