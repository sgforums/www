              <p>Although a war of words between Argentina and Germany has ignited a fuse between the two sides before tomorrow's World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town, they have joined forces to torment England following their ragged display in a humiliating 4-1 defeat last weekend.</p>
              <p>Demichelis's turn came after a training session in Pretoria last night when he was quizzed about his poor recent form. The Bayern Munich centre-half made a major error in the group encounter with South Korea, presenting the Koreans with a goal which briefly put Argentina on the back foot.</p>
              <p>Demichelis was also severely criticised for his performance against Internazionale in the Champions League final and the spotlight will be on him when he tries to subdue a German strike-force which contains his Bayern team-mate Miroslav Klose.</p>
              <p>Yet, according to Demichelis, all this is relative. For an example of a real pitiful defensive display, he cites Terry's game against Germany in Bloemfontein last Sunday.</p>
              <p>"Seeing the way Terry played against Germany, if I was Terry I wouldn't be able to go back to my country," said Demichelis.</p>
              <p>"I'm strong but I'm not a masochist so I don't read every criticism about me. I know that when the team is playing well there are always people who look for a weakness, for example me, but I know I can overcome this bad moment."</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1291310" rel="1291310|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/worldcup2010/article-1291310/WORLD-CUP-2010-Diego-Maradona-mocks-rivals-Germany.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>Diego Maradona has already served a FIFA ban for insulting the media in the last year and his Basil Fawlty-style response to a scathing attack from Bastian Schweinsteiger is unlikely to receive the approval of the UN.</strong></p>
              <p>But it does guarantee drama as well as what promises to be a fascinating match when the two teams meet in Saturday's World Cup quarter-final at Cape Town's Green Point Stadium.</p>
              <p>The rift dates back to the World Cup quarter-final they contested in Berlin four years ago, when yet another successful penalty shoot-out for the Germans was followed by an astonishing brawl.</p>
              <p>The Argentines claimed the Germans had mocked them for failing to hold their nerve. Leandro Cufre was sent off for a karate kick on Per Mertesacker while Torsten Frings was banned for the semi-final the Germans lost to Italy for throwing a punch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/02/article-1291310-0A480D2C000005DC-670_468x286.jpg" alt="War of words: Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger said Argentina were disrespectful" width="468" height="286"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>War of words: Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger said Argentina were 'disrespectful'</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>On Wednesday Schweinsteiger kicked things off by branding the Argentines 'disrespectful' and accusing them of forever trying to influence the referee.</strong></p>
              <p>Philipp Lahm, the Germany captain, added fuel to the fire on Thursday by saying the South Americans are 'impulsive and temperamental'.</p>
              <p>Maradona issued his response to Joachim Low's side in a television interview, addressing the Bayern Munich midfielder in a German accent by saying: 'What's the matter with you, Schweinsteiger, are you nervous?'</p>
              <p>He did then deliver a more serious message. 'We don't have time to think about Schweinsteiger,' he said.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption">'The players are thinking about going on the pitch and getting revenge. I'm not worried about what they say about the penalties. We are coming out to attack them and play in their faces. This is what has them nervous.'</p>
              </div>
              <p>Lahm dismissed such talk. 'We are tense but not nervous,' he said. 'We'll see how they deal with defeat.</p>
              <p>'They're impulsive, temperamental and don't know how to lose.' Oliver Bierhoff, Germany's general manager, said he had always found the Argentines 'friendly, warm-hearted people'. But then declared they are 'different on the pitch'.</p>
              <p>'They become aggressive and provocative,' he added. 'Emotions run high after a game. We should put what happened four years ago behind us.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/02/article-1291310-0A459E3A000005DC-294_306x423.jpg" alt="Big test: Germany captain Philipp Lahm knows Argentina will be tough" width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Big test: Germany captain Philipp Lahm knows Argentina will be tough</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Lahm even took another veiled swipe at England, crushed by the Germans in the last 16. 'Now we are up against our own big five,' he said. 'We have to show we can finally beat a big team - someone like Argentina, Brazil or Spain. Definitely, these are bigger than England.'</strong></p>
              <p>Argentina are in danger of becoming increasingly unpopular, however. Not least because of Maradona's public spat with Pele.</p>
              <p>Earlier in the tournament Maradona said the Brazilian legend should be 'in a museum' and on Thursday Pele hit back.</p>
              <p>'I just think Maradona's not a good coach. He had a bizarre lifestyle which cannot go down well with his team.'</p>
              <p>He was more complimentary towards Germany. 'This young German team is a pleasure to watch,' he said.</p>
              <p>'Something has changed in German football. It was already beginning to happen at Euro 2008 (where they lost 1-0 to Spain in the final) and the youngsters Ozil and Muller are like Wolfgang Overath and Pierre Littbarski . They can dribble, deliver pinpoint passes and produce a surprise at any moment. But they are too inexperienced to win the title.'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/02/article-1291310-0A45D989000005DC-502_468x301.jpg" alt="Missing man: Lionel Messi skipped training due to a fever" width="468" height="301">

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Maradona eventually talked tactics, insisting he would not return to the 4-4-2 formation that had proved successful in beating the Germans in a friendly.</strong></p>
              <p>'It would be a sin to change back with the players that we have. We're going to attack,' he said.</p>
              <p>Lionel Messi missed training on Thursday with a fever but Argentina hope he will recover to play on Saturday.</p>
