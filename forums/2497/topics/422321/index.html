              <p>Manchester City defender <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/23601/Kolo-Tour%C3%A9">Kolo Toure</a> has become the first player to stoke the flames ahead of this 
              Saturday's derby by suggesting that Manchester United's first defeat of 
              the season against Wolves could be the sign of a slump to come.</p>

              <p><strong><a href="http://blogs.soccernet.com/manchesterunited/archives/2011/02/wolves_in_sheeps_clothing.php"></a></strong></p>
              <p>United
               were beaten 2-1 at Molineux on Saturday, a result that ended their 
              hopes of going through the entire Premier League season unbeaten, while 
              City's 3-0 victory over West Brom saw Toure and co move to within five 
              points of their Manchester rivals.</p>
              <p>City go to Old Trafford this 
              weekend looking to further close the gap at the top and also avenge last
               season's agonising 4-3 defeat, courtesy of Michael Owen's "fergie-time" 
              winner.</p>
              <p>And Toure, who was part of the Arsenal side that went 
              through the 2003-04 campaign without tasting defeat, believes that 
              United now face a stern examination of their credentials after recalling
               how the Gunners struggled when their run eventually ended.</p>
              <p>"When
               you're on a good run like that and you lose, everything becomes 
              harder," Toure said. "It shakes your confidence. Maybe that can happen 
              to them. It was difficult to lose that game.</p>
              <p>"The circumstances 
              were hard because they got a penalty, which we didn't think was a 
              penalty. For us, it was really difficult to lose to United. I think it's
               a great chance for me to get my revenge.</p>
              <p>"I have spent most of my
               career in England battling United, first at Arsenal, now at City. They 
              are always at the top. Now we have new players, we are capable of 
              fighting against them and that has been shown with our results against 
              them over the last 18 months.''</p>
              <p>And <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/72490/Carlos-T%C3%A9vez">Carlos Tevez</a>,
               who on Monday reiterated his love for City, has insisted that he is 
              unworried by the prospect of being heavily booed on his third return to 
              Old Trafford since leaving United for their cross-city rivals in 2009.</p>
              <p>"I don't care about people booing me at Old Trafford," Tevez told <em>ZOO magazine</em>.
               "It doesn't worry me and I'm not worried about going there. The booing 
              happened a lot last year, but I understand. As a supporter, you defend 
              your club and I am on the opposing team now.</p>
              <p>"Manchester United 
              fans can never say I didn't give my all during the time I was there. 
              Maybe many supporters still don't understand the reason I left. I am a 
              professional footballer and being booed when I am on the field is a 
              price I have to pay sometimes. But it won't affect me at all.</p>
              <p>"Derby
               games are always beautiful. I enjoyed them in Argentina and Brazil but,
               in England, they are extra-special. Playing against Manchester United 
              is a big incentive but it's not just because of personal issues for me. 
              It's about the importance of three points. We want to go to Old Trafford
               and win</p>
