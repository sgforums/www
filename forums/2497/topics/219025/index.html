            <div class='col-md body'>The Los Angeles Galaxy have confirmed they are interested in signing David Beckham if the former England captain fails to renew his Real Madrid deal.<br><br>Out of contract in Spain at the end of the season, the 31-year-old midfielder is believed to be considering a move.<br><br>Beckham, who played against the Galaxy for Real in a pre-season game in 2005, has already said that he would like to end his career in the US. "I've one year left at Real, and maybe two more after that, but things can change in football and the American league does interest me," said Beckham.<br><br>"I want to be part of a country that is passionate about sport. And I've got my academy in LA, which is important to me because that is my life after the game."<br><br>As well as the Galaxy, Celtic, Spurs and Israeli club Maccabi Netanya have been reported as possible destinations for the high-profile star.<br><br>Speaking to BBC Sport, Lalas, the Galaxy's president and general manager, made it clear that Beckham would suit his team, "For many people the Los Angeles Galaxy are looked upon as the jewel of MLS," he said.<br><br>"We play in the best stadium, we have had incredible success over the history of the league and "All of this leads to this race to become the first 'MLS super club', if you will.<br><br>When asked for a firmer statement of intent regarding a possible bid for Beckham, Lalas was careful not to say anything that could be regarded as 'tapping up'.<br><br>"A move for Beckham is not something we need to discuss at this point because he's under contract with Real," he said. "But if that changes, and there's an opportunity, of course we'd be interested."<br><br>The former US international did, however, admit that the Galaxy's owner, sports conglomerate Anschutz Entertainment Group, has a close relationship with Beckham.<br><br>His academy shares a home with the Galaxy just outside LA at the 27,000-seat Home Depot Center in Carson, California.<br><br><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42282000/jpg/_42282350_beckham_mtv203.jpg"><br>Brand Beckham attempts to break America at the 2003 MTV Awards</div>
