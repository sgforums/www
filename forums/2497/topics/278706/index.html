England's 3-0 win against Israel lifted the mood in the camp ahead of Wednesday's crucial game against Russia at Wembley, but a bad result in that game could still lead to failure to qualify for Euro 2008 next June.<br><br>Though the FA insist they have no plans to replace McClaren, they have been under pressure to consider a change of coach. Yesterday's win puts them in a far better position in Group E, but they still need a victory against Guus Hiddink's Russia.<br><br>Many of the current England squad are understood to have little respect for McClaren and are said to be dismayed at what they see as his tactical naivety as an international coach and cursory approach to scouting opponents. McClaren could not be faulted yesterday, though, and England brushed aside Israel with goals from Shaun Wright-Phillips, Michael Owen and Micah Richards at a noisy Wembley.<br><br>Scolari, 58, recently announced that he would end his five-year term as Portugal coach after the European Championships, and is considering his future after next summer. As in 2006, he is reluctant to break his contract with the Portuguese federation. Asked about the possibility of Scolari becoming England manager this week, his adviser Acaz Fellegger told The Observer: 'Felipe has a contract with Portugal until the end of Euro 2008 and after that he can go anywhere.'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiddink still has an eye on managing in England<br><br>Gus Hiddink has every intention of guiding Russia to the European Championships next summer, but has not ruled out one day coaching in England.<br><br>The Dutchman, 60, was a leading candidate to take over from Sven-Goran Eriksson after the 2006 World Cup and has a strong pedigree both at international and club level.<br><br>The man who took both Holland and then South Korea to the semi-finals of the World Cup before leading Australia into to the last 16 in Germany last summer has also found himself continually named as the front-runner to take charge at Chelsea should Jose Mourinho ever leave Stamford Bridge.<br><br>For he time being, though, Hiddink remains fully committed to the job in hand of steering Russia towards Euro 2008, possibly at the expense of England, whom they play at Wembley on Wednesday night.<br><br>'I am a 60-year-old coach and I do not know what the future will bring,' Hiddink told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. 'But as long as I have got the energy or receive the energy from the young lads, I am willing to work with young lads, and not anywhere in the world.<br><br>'But England is always very challenging - however, I am very happy in this transition time in Russia.'<br><br>Hiddink, who admits he is a 'fan of the English game' added: 'They want me to stay regardless of the results coming up because they feel we are on the edge of starting something new.<br><br>'But I have not made up my mind to stay or whether to go, or have six months sabbatical. I do not know yet - let's first have the forthcoming weeks in the qualification.'<br><br>Russia moved up into second place in the Group E table with a 3-0 victory over Macedonia in Moscow, despite having their goalkeeper Vladimir Gabulov sent off. He will now miss the game at Wembley through suspension.<br><br>Hiddink's men are a point ahead of England, but two behind leaders Croatia, with all three teams having played eight games.<br><br>The Dutchman knows there are sure to be plenty of twists and turns ahead as the race to reach Austria and Switzerland next summer gathers pace.<br><br>'We have a tough group, and I think that the three teams are now competing for this [qualification],' he said. 'Everyone has to play everyone, so it is very complicated.<br><br>'Of course, I would like to be there with Russia, and wish that England will be there because they are always good at a tournament. But realistically, you have to consider Croatia are a very experienced side now for many years. They do not spoil many points.'<br><br>Despite England's injury problems, they were able to comfortably beat Israel 3-0 at Wembley yesterday.<br><br>Hiddink believes Steve McClaren's squad has plenty of strength in depth.<br><br>'Always as a fan you like to have all the best players for the spectators,' he said. 'The key players are very important, but the substitutes are not really substitutes because they are big names in English football as well.<br><br>'They are super-motivated to do even better, so for me there is not a disadvantage from England.'<br><br>Hiddink added: 'I was impressed with England in the friendly against Germany, even though the result went against them.<br><br>'England created a lot of chances and were unlucky in not finishing it off, then Germany got two lucky, lucky goals.<br><br>'Yesterday I saw some flashes from England and they were dominating the game - Israel do have potential if you let them play.'<br><br>Hiddink maintains he will not send Russia out at Wembley on Wednesday night intent of frustrating England and playing for the draw.<br><br>He said: 'I always like to start a game to win, and at the end we will see where we are. My team, they must always go for a win. At the end, we will see.'<br><br>Hiddink, though, accepts: 'It is a time of transition in Russian football. Both the infrastructure has to be improved a lot and we are starting to get the young people educated.<br><br>'Also, the first team has to be renovated as well. Before the Soviet Union collapsed, you could pick one or two players out of every country and you have a very good team.<br><br>'Now Russia also has to build its own team, and they do need some experience.'<br><br></div>
