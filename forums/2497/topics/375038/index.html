              <p><strong>Rafa Benitez has given his backing to Liverpool defender Glen Johnson after his performances for England came under scrutiny this week.</strong></p>
              <p>Despite England recording back-to-back victories against Slovenia and Croatia, with the latter securing their place at the World Cup next summer, Johnson was criticised by some for a few momentary defensive lapses.</p>
              <p>Both goals England conceded in the 2-1 win over Slovenia and in the 5-1 hammering of Croatia came down their right-hand side with the 25-year-old failing to stop the crosses from wide positions.</p>
              <p>Despite Benitez acknowledging his £18million man has room for improvement, the Spaniard believes his attacking strengths cancel out his defensive weaknesses.</p>
              <p>"I think Glen has been really good from the first day with us and with England," he told <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"You can see that offensive mentality, his deliveries, his crosses were really good so I was surprised with the criticism about his performance the other day.</p>
              <p>"But he is a good player. He can get better but he knows, he is keen to learn and (Fabio) Capello was supporting him the other day so we will support him.</p>
              <p>"He is so good attacking that sometimes it is more difficult for the defenders of the other team to stop him than for him to worry about defence.</p>
              <p>"He is a decent defender, clearly he can improve, he is very good attacking so if you talk about balance he has a very good balance."</p>

              <p>i may be wrong but Glen Johnson is playing in 2 different setups in both club and country. I am sure he is more comfortable with liverpool's playing style , whereas in the national level, he may not have worked in sync with the centre-backs to cover him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice that carragher sometimes have to cover the defensive right back position when Johnson goes on a attacking run </p>

              <p>I think Rafa should shut his mouth up.</p>
              <p>It is the England coach that should justify his team selection.</p>
              <p>It is none of the business of Ah Ben.</p>
              <p>He better focus of saving his job in Liverpool.</p>
