            <div class='col-md body'>CHELSEA v WEST HAM UNITED: TEAM NEWS<br><br>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho feels proud to have rescued Magnus Hedman from premature retirement and refused to rule out handing the former Celtic stopper a new deal at the end of the season.<br><br>Unveiled on Friday, as the Blues prepare to face West Ham United, Hedman has signed a contract until the end of the season as cover for injured Petr Cech, Hilario and Carlo Cudicini.<br><br>Mourinho said: Â“I am very happy with our choice - with all respect to the other Â‘keepers we had at the club for a period of trial.<br><br>Â“I am happy because we brought him back to football. I think he is too young and too good to be out of football so soon and I feel very happy because I have some responsibility for bringing him back to the game.<br><br>Â“His contract is to the end of the season but nobody can say he will not have an extension of his contract and stay at Chelsea.<br><br>Â“I am very confident again and so is the team. In the next couple of weeks, he will be ready to challenge the other two goalkeepers.<br><br>Â“We have many matches in December and January and we couldnÂ’t have faced them with only two goalkeepers. It was too dangerous.Â”<br><br>WEEKEND FIXTURES: HEAD-TO-HEAD<br><br>West Ham boss Alan Pardew believes keeping ChelseaÂ’s superstars happy is MourinhoÂ’s greatest attribute as he plots to upset the form book against the Barclays Premiership champions.<br><br>Pardew has had his own selection issues with the arrival of Argentina duo Javier Mascherano and Carlos Tevez, but he believes maintaining motivation at Stamford Bridge is a far harder task.<br><br>Â“His team carry lots of superstars and are always highly motivated,Â” Pardew said.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s difficult to say heÂ’s underrated - Jose will certainly say that, IÂ’m sure - but you canÂ’t manage a team like Chelsea and have all those superstars unless you are a great manager.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s very difficult to manage players with large egos, fantastic ability and huge salaries. And he motivates them and gets them into a team structure that wins most games.<br><br>Â“When you are at those top clubs thatÂ’s your role.Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chelsea 1-0 West Ham: Geremi punishes Hammers<br>PA<br><br>Geremi found the top corner with a delicious free-kick as Barclays Premiership champions Chelsea defeated London rivals West Ham 1-0 at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>Jose Mourinho's men knew even a big win would probably not take them to the top of the league this weekend, but they maintained the pressure on leaders Manchester United with their victory.<br><br>The winner came midway through the opening half as Geremi curled home from 25 yards following a foul on Didier Drogba by Danny Gabbidon, and Mourinho's men closed out another comfortable and efficient win.<br><br>Carlos Tevez had been handed a rare start - West Ham have still not scored with him on the pitch since his arrival before the August transfer window closed - but he struggled against an in-form Ashley Cole.<br><br>The tone was set in the opening minute when he fouled the England full-back, and Cole was on top from then on.<br><br>Tevez, who can play as a centre forward, was on the right flank and Yossi Benayoun, who skippered Israel in midweek, was not in the matchday squad.<br><br>The visitors did have their share of the possession in the opening stages, Benayoun's replacement Lee Bowyer wasting a cross from a good position.<br><br>But Chelsea remained a threat despite failing to find their top gear. John Terry was off target twice early on from corners on each flank, although the first effort would have been ruled out for a push.<br><br>Blues boss Mourinho, who had embraced his counterpart Alan Pardew before kick-off, had outlined in his programme notes that the home fans needed to get behind former Hammer Frank Lampard.<br><br>The England midfielder, jeered throughout by away supporters, was in the thick of the action as Chelsea seized control of the game.<br><br>He earned a free-kick in the 16th minute when he was tripped by Bowyer, who then deflected Lampard's set-piece wide.<br><br>Lampard forced goalkeeper Robert Green to save with a volley and then was booked for a sending Jonathan Spector flying.<br><br>The hosts were ahead in the 22nd minute after in-form striker Drogba was hauled down by Gabbidon, earning the Hammers centre-back a booking.<br><br>Geremi's 25-yard free-kick curled around the wall and into Green's top corner, with the full-back dashing over to the dug-out where he shook Mourinho's hand.<br><br>Encouraged by the opener, Andriy Shevchenko wasted a good opportunity when he made ground down the right, as did Robben soon after.<br><br>Robben also fired wide towards the end of the first half but, despite Chelsea being on top, the Hammers were still a threat.<br><br>Cole had to throw himself at a Nigel Reo-Coker effort to block when the midfielder was on the end of a deep cross, while Matthew Etherington volleyed just wide.<br><br>Referee Mike Dean had to address a simmering feud between Reo-Coker and Drogba to keep the derby atmosphere on the boil.<br><br>Mourinho took off Ricardo Carvalho, who appeared to pick up a knock in the opening half, for Khalid Boulahrouz at the break.<br><br>Lampard lashed over the crossbar six minutes after the restart when Shevchenko had threaded the ball through Gabbidon's legs to find his team-mate on the edge of the area.<br><br>As the champions started to assert pressure, Paul Konchesky was forced to hack away in his own six-yard box as Drogba looked to finish from close range, with the home fans calling for a penalty for handball.<br><br>Just before the hour mark it was Spector who was forced to block, this time Michael Essien connecting with a fierce volley.<br><br>Getting close to Chelsea's goal was proving difficult for the visitors, Bobby Zamora firing over from long distance with a wild volley, their best offering after the break.<br><br>Reo-Coker was booked for a foul as Chelsea broke, while Joe Cole was brought on with 22 minutes remaining for Shevchenko.<br><br>Hayden Mullins was booked for fouling Essien with 20 minutes remaining as the needle expected in a London derby was maintained. Tevez also received a yellow card for a foul on the same player.<br><br>Essien hit the post with a powerful drive as the hosts looked likely to add a second, and Drogba had an effort chalked off for offside.<br><br>Mikel John Obi, back in the matchday squad, was given a run-out but struggled to make an impact.<br><br><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/DJ/20061118/geremiscores_jm.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Arsenal 1-1 Newcastle: Magpies hold on<br>PA<br><br>Thierry Henry once again proved Arsenal's talisman as he grabbed their equaliser in a 1-1 home draw with Newcastle.<br><br>The Gunners skipper had been left on the bench, with manager Arsene Wenger concerned about burn-out following his midweek international duty with France.<br><br>But the brilliant Frenchman was introduced as a second-half substitute when his team were trailing 1-0 - and promptly smashed in a free-kick to level on 70 minutes.<br><br>Arsenal pressed, but were denied by some resolute defending and an inspired display by Newcastle keeper Shay Given, fit again following an injury lay-off.<br><br>The point, hard-fought as it was, meant Arsenal lost ground on Barclays Premiership pacesetters Manchester United and Chelsea, although with a match in hand they are still not out of the title race.<br><br>For Newcastle, results elsewhere mean they are at least out of the relegation zone - although still deep in trouble at the wrong end of the table.<br><br>Wenger had again stressed the need for his side to take the lead and so force Newcastle to make a game of it, rather than sit back as many visitors had done at the Emirates Stadium.<br><br>Those directives were not transferred onto the field, however, as after a positive start and decent chances for Emmanuel Adebayor and Cesc Fabregas, the Magpies stole the lead on the half-hour.<br><br>Arsenal were left light at the back following a free-kick, and were caught on the break, a flick-on from Obafemi Martins putting Kieron Dyer into space on the edge of the area.<br><br>Emmanuel Eboue was tracking him - but the England midfielder took control of the ball, turned and coolly dispatched a low strike into the bottom right corner.<br><br>Arsenal were clearly incensed by again falling behind at home, despite dominating for large spells of the match.<br><br>The danger was now, of course, Newcastle would sit back on their lead, getting plenty of men behind the ball.<br><br>With the visitors indeed sitting deep, Robin van Persie tried his luck from 25 yards, but his well-struck shot was straight at Given.<br><br>Arsenal remained patient, knocking the ball around waiting for an opening as half-time approached.<br><br>Adebayor sent a looping header over from Fabregas' chip into area, before van Persie curled an angled shot-on-the-turn just wide of the far post after darting in down the right.<br><br>Scott Parker escaped with what looked like a clear handball after Hleb's shot ricocheted up from Duff.<br><br>Dutchman Van Persie had to go for treatment on his ankle following a heavy block on the edge of the area.<br><br>It was no surprise when he did not reappear at the start of the second half, replaced by Henry.<br><br>Arsenal created an opening inside the first few moments. The ball broke to Adebayor and his snap-shot from close range was drilled straight at Given, who made a smart reaction save.<br><br>There was a determination about the Gunners, who produced several slick passing moves, if without the final telling ball.<br><br>Nevertheless, there were still moments of concern at the other end. On 55 minutes Dyer again found space at the edge of the area and sent a curling effort from the Newcastle left just wide of the far post.<br><br>Henry was slipped into the left side of the area and his angled shot was deflected away acrobatically by Given.<br><br>The home side continued to dominate as the hour mark approached. Fabregas was next to be found in space in the danger zone - and his snap-shot was superbly beaten clear one-handed by Given.<br><br>It was all Arsenal now, the hosts forcing a succession of corners.<br><br>With 20 minutes left, Steven Taylor was cautioned when he bundled over Henry, who was looking to get away on an angled ball down the left.<br><br>The Arsenal captain dusted himself down and took the free-kick himself, whipping it up over the wall - and in off the underside of the crossbar for his seventh goal of the season.<br><br>Defender Craig Moore almost put through his own net and Henry had an effort deflected onto the post before Given pulled off another fine flying save from the Arsenal skipper.<br><br>Four minutes of stoppage time were shown and the Gunners continued to press - but crucially once again failed to find a winner.<br><br><img src="http://soccernet-att.espn.go.com/design05/DJ/20061118/fabfrust_tmarsh.jpg"></div>
