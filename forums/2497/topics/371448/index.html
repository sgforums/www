              <p>Andrea Pirlo believes his decision to snub Chelsea proves that AC Milan are a team with ambition and he has vowed to make critics eat their words.</p>
              <p>Several former players and pundits have suggested Milan needed to shake things up and rely less on stalwarts such as Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf and Gennaro Gattuso after a disappointing couple of seasons.</p>
              <p>However, the Italy midfielder does not agree.</p>
              <p>"If I thought Milan's aim was a good place in the standings I'd be at Chelsea now," Pirlo told Saturday's <em>La Gazzetta dello Sport</em>. "I want to win. That's not just words. I'm convinced this is possible.</p>
              <p>"You'll see what the historic group can do. We'll make everyone rethink and eat lots of criticism."</p>
              <p>Chelsea boss <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=96"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Carlo Ancelotti</span></a> tried to sign Pirlo, the cornerstone of his Milan side that won the Champions League in 2003 and 2007.</p>
              <p>However, owner Silvio Berlusconi said this week that Chelsea's offer had been rejected and the 30-year-old would stay at Milan for the rest of his career.</p>
              <p>New coach <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=102"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leonardo</span></a>'s insistence on keeping Pirlo, Milan's main creative force after the sale of Brazil playmaker Kaka to Real Madrid, was fundamental, he added.</p>
              <p>"Ancelotti didn't take it so well," Pirlo said. "I spoke to him and he understood. I told him <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=102"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Leonardo</span></a> had dug his heels in and this is a source of pride for me."</p>
              <p>Pirlo was also confident his side would deal with the loss of Kaka and retired captain Paolo Maldini.</p>
              <p>"Obviously the absence of Kaka and Maldini will be felt, but each one of us will give a bit more," he said.</p>
              <p>"Their goodbyes closed a chapter, now it's time to write another and I'm happy to be here to try."</p>
              <p>Milan have boosted their squad by signing Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who completed his move from Real Madrid on Friday.</p>
