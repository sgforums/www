              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span><strong>The moment I woke up in New York on Wednesday and discovered Gary Neville had retired, I hit Twitter with the first words that came to mind: ‘Farewell to the most annoying player in the history of world football.’</strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Within seconds I was bombarded with abuse from Manchester United fans all over the world and congratulations from fans of every other team. And there, in the proverbial nutshell, is the dichotomy that is Gary Neville.</span></p>
              <p><span>Loved by his own, despised by everyone else. And he wouldn’t have it any other way.</span></p>
              <p><span>My own hatred of the rat-faced weasel ran so deep that the mere sight of him would make me come out in blazing boils of fury. </span></p>
              <p><span>As his former colleague, Jaap Stam, so memorably observed in those ill-fated memoirs a few years ago, Gary and brother Phil were ‘a pair of busy little ****s’. And the Dutchman didn’t mean they were always occupied.</span></p>
              <p><span>From the moment Neville walked out on the pitch, puffing out his small chest like a stunted peacock, he’d irritate me. He was like the worst kind of office block shop steward. </span></p>
              <p><span>An officious little numpty with delusions of grandeur, a haughty overestimation of his own talents and a relentless ability to wind everybody up at all times with his sheer presence.</span></p>
              <p><span>Every brawl Arsenal ever had with United involved Neville. But he always played the role of ‘hooligan spotter’ — the spotty kid who set up the fight, then scurried away to let the bigger boys scrap it out. </span></p>
              <p><span>Who can forget him exchanging verbals with Patrick Vieira in the tunnel (over Neville’s appalling treatment of Jose Antonio Reyes), then begging Roy Keane to help him out? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He was there, too, when ‘Pizzagate’ erupted and during both the Ruud van Nistelrooy/Martin Keown on-pitch battles — sneering, spitting and shouting like a particularly virulent puff adder.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Arsenal had it easy, though. Neville was even more annoying against Liverpool, where he seemed to pride himself on being the Most Hated Man in Anfield History. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Every time the old rivals played each other, he’d pop up in the papers goading and taunting the Scousers in an admittedly rather admirable, yet reckless, disregard for his own life. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Kop would scream abuse at him for 90 minutes, and he’d return the favour with bells on. And he’d be even worse in the home legs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Witness the day when he sprinted from the halfway line at Old Trafford to celebrate a 90th-minute winner from Rio Ferdinand right in front of the small Liverpool contingent?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He was fined for ‘improper conduct’ but protested afterwards, asking if it was preferable for players to become ‘emotionless robots’.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And then there were the goal celebrations. Every time United ever scored, Neville would charge like a demented rhinoceros to his successful colleague and jump on his back, arms punching the air — thus ensuring his own ugly mug would be splattered all over the papers the next day. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">This diabolical show-stealing display would be ruined only if his equally camera-hungry mate, David Beckham, got there first. Sometimes you could actually see them fighting each other to get on their striker’s back.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As a player, Neville was like a Jack Russell with worms, constantly nipping at people’s ankles, foaming at the mouth and raging at anyone trying to discipline him. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">
              </span></p><p> </p>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>His behaviour towards referees was shockingly bad, regularly hurling foulmouthed abuse at the man in black. Often because the official had just had the gall to send off his beloved Keano for butting some opponent.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">So my gut reaction, as communicated to the world of Twitter, was absolutely accurate. I genuinely do believe that Gary Neville was the most annoying player in the history of world football.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">But the truth, the awful, sickening truth, is that Neville is also one of the greatest players in the history of world football. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Not technically. I don’t agree with Arsene Wenger that Neville was even the best Premier League right-back ever. As Keown said last week, Lee Dixon could do everything he could but was a better positional full-back. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">No, I mean in regard to the virtues that are so sorely missing in the modern-day game — loyalty, passion, dedication, hard work and commitment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Neville played 602 games for United in 20 years. He never played for anyone else. He never even thought about it. And he played 85 times for England. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/02/05/article-1354059-04E3A4E70000044D-495_306x423.jpg" alt="Ferocious: Wayne Rooney and Neville get close in England training" width="306" height="423"></span>

              </div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>He was renowned for the ferocity and intensity of his training. For him, there was never ‘practice.’ If a colleague came under fire, he was always there to defend him. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And off the pitch, he was a good ambassador in terms of personal behaviour. Not for him the vagaries of the drunken, drug-fuelled, womanising night-clubbing scene. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">If I’m honest, I wish we’d had more players like Gary Neville at Arsenal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Men of steel with the team badge metaphorically tattooed on their hearts. Men who would fight to the last drop of their blood. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Men who never contemplated defeat until it actually happened. And men who understand what it takes to win and to keep winning.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Gary Neville won eight Premier Leagues, three FA Cups, two League Cups and one Champions League. All while being a serial pain in the backside.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The greatest accolade I can pay him today, as an Arsenal fan, is that I will miss him like I’d miss a large rusty nail stuck in my forehead.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">And I know when he reads this, he will smile to himself and — rightly — think: ‘Job done.’</span></p>

              <h1>The loyal hero who truly loved his club, Gary Neville was a beacon of hope in dark days. By
                  Oliver Holt</h1>
              <p>English football was going to hell. Everybody said so. Demented and 
                  crazed, bloated with money, puffed up with self-regard, dancing all the 
                  way down to the darkness.</p>
              <p>In the madness of the last days of the 
                  January transfer window, heroes turned their backs on supporters as 
                  dismissively as a banker brushing away a beggar.</p>
              <p>Fernando Torres and Darren Bent waltzed away from bewildered fans in Liverpool and Sunderland with barely a backward glance.</p>
              <p>In what is supposed to be an age of austerity, Premier League clubs splurged more than £130million on players in a single day.</p>
              <p>Agents rubbed their hands with glee, players ordered Baby Bentleys 
                  all round and the rest of the world shielded its eyes from a grotesque 
                  show of consumption.</p>
              <p>And then, on Wednesday evening, Gary Neville announced his retirement from the game.</p>
              <p>One
                   man cannot redeem an entire sport, but Neville’s news was at least a 
                  reminder that, amid the fecklessness, there is still a noble side to our
                   beautiful game.</p>
              <p>Because, in the 19 years he played for Manchester United, Neville stood for all that is good about the game in this country.</p>
              <p>He stood for loyalty. Loyalty to his team and his team-mates. He only ever played for United. He only ever
                  <em>wanted</em> to play for United.</p>
              <p>He did not have an agent. He never sought offers from other clubs to try to get more money out of his club.</p>
              <p>Wayne
                   Rooney threatened to leave United earlier this season and it worked. He
                   got a new contract and more money. The price he paid was that United 
                  fans will never love him now like they love Neville. They will never 
                  think quite the same of him again.</p>
              <p>When Neville kissed the club badge on his shirt, he meant it. He loved the club.</p>
              <p>And it was not the kind of love that only lasted until a better offer came along.</p>
              <p>He
                   played 602 times for United. He never threatened to move. He never 
                  asked to leave. He felt grateful for the privileged life he led.</p>
              <p>He
                   also treated his team-mates like brothers. When Rio Ferdinand was 
                  accused of missing a drugs test, Neville believed the charge was unjust.
                   Even though he knew he would be vilified, he threatened to lead the 
                  England team out on strike in support of his friend, an action that 
                  earned him the nickname Red Nev.</p>
              <p>Neville stood for dedication, too. He was totally committed to the game, the first on the training pitch and the last off it.</p>
              <p>Although not the most gifted player, he worked so hard that he became the best full-back of his generation.</p>
              <p>He
                   stood for selflessness. When he made errors in recent matches against 
                  Stoke and West Brom, he realised his time was up. Rather than hanging on
                   for an emotional last hurrah at Old Trafford in front of the fans who 
                  adored him, he quit straight away.</p>
              <p>He also stood for respect for 
                  the public. He was not a brawler or a biter or a roaster or a party 
                  animal. He was never pictured staggering out of a club at 6am.</p>
              <p>Even
                   when he was a victim of one of Ferdinand’s World Cup Wind-Ups in 2006, 
                  even though he did not know he was on film, he refused to give an 
                  autograph to a policeman in return for being excused a speeding fine. 
                  “You can’t buy me,” he told the spoof copper.</p>
              <p>He stood for 
                  excellence. He won the Champions League in 1999. He won eight league 
                  titles. He earned 85 caps for England and played in two World Cups.</p>
              <p>Neville
                   stood for things that people wrongly say have been lost to the game. He
                   was proof that there are still plenty of footballers we can point to as
                   worthy of our children’s hero worship.</p>
              <p>He was proof that, amid 
                  all the stuff and nonsense, there are still plenty of players out there 
                  who are true to the traditions of the game.</p>
              <p>There are still players for whom some things are more important than money.</p>
              <p>It is also worth mentioning Gary’s brother, Phil – who is also the epitome of selflessness and quiet professionalism.</p>
              <p>Phil Neville is the captain of Everton, but last week was the subject of a bid from Tottenham.</p>
              <p>It
                   was an attractive offer - a better wage than the one he is on at 
                  Everton, and it would have allowed Phil, 34, one last shot at the glory 
                  of Champions League football.</p>
              <p>If he had stamped his feet, as plenty of others would have, Spurs' bid might have succeeded.</p>
              <p>But
                   Phil has too much respect for Everton’s fans and manager, David Moyes. 
                  When Tottenham’s bid was rejected on transfer deadline day, Phil 
                  accepted the situation without fuss.</p>
              <p>What makes the Neville 
                  brothers so important is that in this football age of unchecked 
                  celebrity and rampant narcissism, they stand for the team ahead of the 
                  individual.</p>
              <p>They embody the essence of team sport, the idea of combining talent and effort.</p>
              <p>So when Gary Neville decided a couple of weeks ago he was going to quit, his original plan was to avoid doing it this week.</p>
              <p>He was concerned that his announcement would detract from the build-up to England’s match against Denmark next Wednesday night.</p>
              <p>Well, he was wrong. His announcement could not have been better timed.</p>
              <p>When we were tempted to despair for English football, it reminded us that all is not yet lost.</p>
