              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has revealed Arsenal could make a new signing this week.</strong></p>
              <p>The Gunners are experiencing an early-season injury crisis and ahead of
              Wednesday’s Champions League qualifier against Twente, Wenger has been
              hit hardest in midfield.</p>
              <p>“It’s the most problematic start to a season numbers wise,” said Wenger.</p>
              <p>“It’s a lot of responsibility for the young player because money is
              an issue. It is the biggest game of the season because if you lose a
              Premier League game you can still get back. Lose a Champions League
              qualifier and it’s a big deal for us."</p>
              <p>Wenger maintains that he needs to sign at least one more new player,
              with reports claiming Udinese midfielder Gokhan Inler is a target.</p>
              <p>“If you consider all that, you can see our squad is so short. I have
              said many times we are short of one player and I hope I will be capable
              of doing something this week or before the transfer deadline.”</p>

              <p>imagine, how to buy all proven players wif a budget of not more then 30m every years?</p>
              <p>if compare to JM, he had to spend almost 100m to win the 1st EPL (but no CL as well). &amp; still cant hold on the title next year!!</p>
              <p>look as B. spend 50 over m last year! ended only no 4 in EPL.</p>
              <p>Are those manager consider 'GOOD'???</p>

              <p>I don't really think arsenal has that $$, mainly due to new stadium? and it's not AW style to just buy any star players.</p>

              <p>Just look at Real Madrid a few season ago. They won nothing even though they had a start studded team with the likes of beckham and roberto carlos. But last season they won with young players like gago and marcelo.</p>

              <p>its true for both case. the new stadium + world wide credit crunch are starting to bite into footballing world.</p>
              <p>the total transfer market value this yr is lower than last year in EPL.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aw use to buy star player before the arrival of billionaire into EPL change his style of mangement. he realise he just cannot out bid anyone if man utd, chelsea, liverpool are interested.</p>
