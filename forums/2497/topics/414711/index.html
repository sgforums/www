              </div>
              <p>Wayne Rooney has been ruled out of Wednesday's mouthwatering Manchester derby - despite United insisting he had fully recovered from his ankle injury.</p>
              <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has taken the unusual step of sending his star 
              striker to America for a week's 'conditioning', which will take Rooney 
              out of the spotlight following his threat to quit the club last month.</p>
              <p>The
               25-year-old came in for vehement criticism from fans before performing a
               U-turn to sign a new five-year deal worth £200,000-a-week at Old 
              Trafford.</p>
              <p>Rooney will undergo fitness training at Nike Town, in Portland - travelling tomorrow  and returning on Saturday week.</p>
              <p>That
               would rule him out of the games against Wolverhampton Wanderers this 
              weekend and seemingly the clash at Aston Villa on November 13 - as well 
              as Wednesday's trip to Eastlands.</p>
              <p>Assistant manager Mike Phelan said: 'It's a week's intensive conditioning under supervision from our medical
              team and sports science department.</p>
              <p>'Wayne, the medical team, and the manager feel that will be best.</p>
              <p>'We
               have the facilities. We just thought it might be in the interests of 
              him and the club to have a change of scenery for a little while.</p>

              </div>
              <p>'He has had a lot of attention lately and we want to give him the 
              best opportunity that he possibly can to be in good shape when he 
              returns.</p>
              <p>'He needs the conditioning. We all agree with that. He can go there 
              without the attention he would get around here.</p>

              </div>
              <p>'If that goes according to plan, he will be available when he returns.'</p>
              <p>Aside from Rooney, for once the weekly medical bulletin was led by information on the manager.</p>
              <p>Ferguson
               normally gives the weekly press briefing, but Phelan said the Scot had 
              been struck down by the same virus which prevented four members of his 
              squad travelling to Turkey for the Champions League win over Bursaspor.</p>
              <p>The virus will also keep Darron Gibson out of Saturday's Barclays Premier League encounter with Wolverhampton.</p>
              <p>'The
               manager has been ill since coming back from Turkey,' said Phelan. 'He 
              came down with a virus yesterday. He felt a little bit like that on the 
              flight coming back.</p>
              <p>'Yesterday he felt worse, so we have kept him away from the club for a little while.<br>"It is related to the virus that has been going around.</p>
              <p>'It is one of those things that gets hold of you and is hard to shake off but he will be at the game tomorrow.'</p>
              <p>Phelan
               confirmed that Ryan Giggs is edging towards full fitness after his 
              recent hamstring problems, although it seems more likely the veteran 
              Welshman will make his comeback against City at Eastlands than being 
              rushed back for this weekend's fixture, particularly as Darren Fletcher 
              is set to shake off an ankle problem.</p>
              <p>'Darren Fletcher is showing 
              positive signs that he could recover,' said Phelan. 'We will have a look
               at him again this morning and hopefully he will be available.</p>

              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/11/05/article-1326888-0B5C068B000005DC-338_468x412.jpg" alt="Comeback trail: Giggs (left) is nearing a return from an ankle injury" width="468" height="412">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Comeback trail: Giggs (left) is nearing a return from an ankle injury</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'Ryan has been back in training and has started his preparation for 
              the matches. Whether he will be available for tomorrow we are not quite 
              sure yet.'</p>
              <p>There are other virus sufferers who will need to be assessed, although in-form winger Nani will not be considered.</p>
              <p>The
               Portugal international limped out of Tuesday's win with a groin injury 
              amid fears he could be sidelined for some considerable time.</p>
              <p>However,
               he reported an easing of the discomfort yesterday and now he is 
              undergoing treatment it is hoped will have him ready to face City.</p>
              <p>'There
               is a possibility he could play against Manchester City,' said Phelan. 
              'Having reported in yesterday with the injury from Tuesday night, he 
              felt a lot better than we expected, so we are going to progress him as 
              quickly as we can with a view to next week.'<span><span style="color: #003399;"></span></span></p>
