              <p><br>hard to say lah...nowadays player indeed seems to be bigger than the club. They treat contract like a shit piece of paper...so Liverpool really have no choice but to sell him. There is no point keeping an unhappy player. Last time Mascherano refused to play because he wanted to move to Barcelona!</p>

              <p>newcastle is right to sell carrol at that price.</p>
              <p>liverpool are desperate to please the pool fans + dalglish stupidity in transfer market.</p>
              <p>why carrol is not worth that much.</p>

              <p>Dude, players like Kuyt work extra hard but he just cant produce the good. N'Gog chased after every loose ball but we all know he sucked big time.

              <p>hopefully that doesnt happen.</p>
              <p>dalglish was setting up a team that istrying to play the simple short passing game.</p>
              <p>i doubt the arrival of one player will change the style. but all is unknown now. gotta wait and look at the game when carroll starts playing. hopefully debuting against chelsea.</p>
              <p>i would prefer kuyt who fights for every ball playing every game than torres who really couldnt be bothered running after a ball during the hodgson era. if i were hodgson i wouldve dropped torres to the reserves for this kind of attitude. he has to be more professional even if he is disillusioned at the club. look at charlie adam. perfect example.</p>

              <p>It is easy to mock Ah Ken at the moment.</p>
              <p>But, he is the second brave manager who came forward to revive Liverpool.</p>
              <p>Ah Roy, being the 1st guy, failed.</p>
              <p>So, unless you have the courage to do what Ah Ken did, it is not befitting to make fun of him.</p>
              <p>As for Carrol, it is over-priced and he is injured at the moment.</p>
              <p>If you are newcastle boss, you will sell if some one offered to buy your player above valuation.</p>
              <p>As for Suarez, he have plenty of chance to show what he make of since Carrol is out of action for one month.</p>
              <p>For Torres, if he want to chase for glory, he should leave and we wish him luck.</p>

              <p>I felt Pool or ah Ken as he is known to some, should have just let this season go and plan for next season instead... Seriously, even with these 2 new strikers, I don't think people are expecting much difference for this season... at best a Europa spot? Which would be more of a distraction for them than anything going for the title or a top 4 spot next season...</p>
              <p>The problem why I think those 2 are over priced is because they are... Simply put, the other clubs extorted Pool because they felt they was desperate... Pool should have just play it cool and get whatever they can for Torres now and save the money up for Jun... Cos there are a lot more options in the summer and a lot more time too like 3 months to just 3 days to make the deals...</p>
              <p>Another important thing to consider is... Kenny is still not the full time manager yet. So for all we know, should he leave in May, the next manager is going to get 2 very expensive players he didn't sign or may not want to fit into his style of play...</p>
              <p>Why I said they are too costly is... Cos neither of them have really done anything to warrant the priced Pool paid for them... Most of Carroll's Newcastle goal came when he was playing for them in the championship league. And Suarez, we know in a much less difficult Dutch league...</p>
              <p>I think had the Pool management or ah Ken been smarter, they would have waited and this 2 would most likely cost them lesser. Remember Arsenal wanted to sign <span lang="EN-GB">Marouane Chamakh </span>from Bordeaux last Jan too and offered $3, $4 million only but when Bordeaux priced him about $10m, Arsenal just play it cool and waited... and they got him for free... Pool should have done this too cos Suarez time at Ajax was coming to an end anyway with the problems he had if not now then in Jun...</p>
              <p>And Carroll, I would say he is not bad a player... But he is definitely not a Torres level type of player at this moment and whether he does become one or not, it's quite a big if... But I doubt he would be as big as Torres though he will still do good I think... I feel if Mike Ashley was ready to risk the Newcastle fans anger, he must strongly believe it's a good deal for him and his club...</p>
              <p>As for ah Ken... It's a waste if he didn't stay after this season cos the players he signed will have a new manager who didn't signed them or may not want them... and the almost $60m fee could have come in handy for the next manager to make better used of...</p>

              <h1>Liverpool striker Andy Carroll: I must prove I'm worth £35 million</h1>
              <h2>Liverpool's record signing Andy Carroll is not worried by his £35 million transfer fee and is confident he can fulfil his potential at Anfield.</h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/02/03/article-0-0D073C21000005DC-98_634x393.jpg" alt="In charge: Dalglish (centre) presents new signings Andy Carroll and Luis Suarez to the media " width="634" height="393"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <div class="firstPar">
              <p><strong>The 22 year-old has inherited Fernando Torres' No 9 shirt after his move from Newcastle on Monday but does not want to be compared to the Spain international, who left for Chelsea in a £50m deal the same day. </strong></p>
              </div>
              <div class="secondPar">
              <p>"It was a lot of money but I need to do what I have to do to prove the money was worth it," he said.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="thirdPar">
              <p>"I am here to score goals and create chances for the team and that is what I can do. "I have scored goals at Newcastle and that is what I want to bring here - we'll just have to wait and see (whether the transfer fee was worth it).</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>"Obviously Torres was a great player but I need to concentrate on my own game and play the football I know I can."</p>
              <div class="body">
              <p>Despite claim and counter-claim about the means of his departure from St James' Park, Carroll is just focusing on a fresh start at his new club.</p>
              <p>"It means a lot to me but I am a<span style="color: #000000;"><strong> Liverpool</strong></span> player now and that is what I have to concentrate on."</p>
              <p>Carroll was introduced at a press conference in Anfield's trophy room alongside fellow new signing Luis Suarez, who briefly held the club transfer record after his £22.8m switch from Ajax.</p>
              <p>Unlike his team-mate, the Uruguay international has been able to make an immediate impact, coming on as a substitute and scoring the second goal in front of the Kop in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Stoke.</p>
              <p>Despite losing Torres, manager Kenny Dalglish said he was delighted to have brought in two quality signings with the money they received for the Spain international. And he had no qualms about the fee paid for Carroll, who arrived at Anfield carrying a thigh injury.</p>
              <p>"I'd like to reassure Andy we are more upbeat about Andy coming than I think yourselves (the media) are, because every question seems to have negativity in it," Dalglish said.</p>
              <p>"We have no reason to be negative about Andy signing for Liverpool. It is a great signing for us, as Luis's is.</p>
              <p>"We will look forward to getting him fit, up and ready for work and he'll play when he's good and ready."</p>

              <p><br>There is really nothing to see what's going to happen for the rest of this season already... Even when they play together and do well, what are they chasing? A Europa spot? Does that really matter? Cos like I said, it's more of a distraction for them than anything if they get it for next season when they are going for the bigger prize don't you agree? </p>
              <p>Like I said earlier, I don't think they are poor players, just overpriced at this point in time whichever way we want to look at it...</p>
              <p>Pool let themselves get extorted because they let clubs felt they were desperate... This season, next season is not going to change this fact. Like I said, Pool should have just play it cool... And Gunner's Chamakh example from Bordeaux is a good and smart business deal.</p>
              <p>And yeah, it' really average if we are comparing to Torres... Cos despite Torres being "disinterested" he is still Pool's current top scorer with 9 goals this season, Top scorer too for last season, the season before and the season before that too... His body language may suggest it just like Berbatov but his goals don't seem to point to that direction though...</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, I was one of those few who suggested Pool should cash in on an ageing Gerrrard and Torres who was vauled between $60 to $80m right after Ronaldo left for $80m and used the funds to get younger players in... It's just that if yo buy younger players at overpriced, and you defeat the purpose...</p>
