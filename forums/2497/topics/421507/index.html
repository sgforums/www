              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">TOTTENHAM have tabled a new improved £25million bid for Newcastle striker Andy Carroll.</h2>
              <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy made the offer for the England star, 22, directly to Toon chief Mike Ashley yesterday.</p>
              <p>The package of a £22m fee with another £3m to follow would shatter Tottenham's current transfer record which is the £16.5m they paid to Charlton for Darren Bent in 2007.</p>
              <p>Newcastle have tried to stonewall all interest in Carroll, who has scored 11 goals this season.</p>
              <p>But Spurs are refusing to take 'no' for an answer even though Ashley has made it clear he does not want to sell the player, who is currently out with a thigh injury which has seen him miss Toon's last five games.</p>
              <p>Ironically, Carroll picked up the problem in the 2-0 defeat at White Hart Lane last month and has been in Sweden looking for a cure to speed up his recovery.</p>
              <p>Spurs boss Harry Redknapp is a big admirer of Carroll but would like to ship out some of his international forwards before the deal is done.</p>
              <p>He is willing to sell Robbie Keane, who is interesting West Ham, and Russian hitman Roman Pavlyuchenko to make room for Carroll.</p>
              <p>Redknapp also remains keen on Everton skipper Phil Neville and will keep plugging away in the hope of getting his man for around £1m.</p>

              <p><span><strong>Academy graduate Carroll has been a major hit this season after playing a key role in last season's Championship triumph, and his development since he was handed the famous No 9 shirt during the summer has been quicker than had been anticipated. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>Former manager Chris Hughton, who presided over much of that rapid improvement, insisted the player still had much to learn, and Pardew has been hugely impressed with him since he arrived on Tyneside despite the fact that he has had him at his disposal for only three games so far because of injury. </span></p>
              <p><span>Pardew has been keen to stress that retaining his biggest names was his first priority this month, and he has been repeatedly assured that Carroll would not be sold. </span></p>
              <p><span>However, owner Mike Ashley and managing director Derek Llambias have tried to bring a financial realism to the club during their time at the helm and there is little doubt that an offer of £35m for a home-grown talent represents a major windfall. </span></p>
              <p><span>Newcastle have cancelled their press conference on Monday afternoon ahead of Wednesday's game against Fulham.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Newcastle United striker </strong><span style="color: #225fb2;"><strong>Andy Carroll</strong></span><strong> could become the seventh most expensive player in the history of football after it was confirmed the club have accepted a reported £35 million bid from Liverpool.</strong></p>
              <p>Liverpool failed with an offer of £30 million for Carroll earlier on Monday but it is believed they have increased their offer to £35 million - a figure quoted by Newcastle for the striker. However, reports suggest the secondary offer has been rejected as well.</p>
              <p>If a deal can be reached before the window closes at 2300 GMT, then it would elevate Carroll into an elite group of footballers.</p>
              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/22774/Cristiano-Ronaldo"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cristiano Ronaldo</span></span></a> cost Real Madrid £80 million when joining from Manchester United in 2009, while only <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/11001/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</span></span></a> (£60.7 million), Kaka (£56 million), Zinedine Zidane (£45.6 million), Luis Figo (£37 million) and <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/11018/Hern%C3%A1n-Crespo"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hernan Crespo</span></span></a> (£35.5 million) have cost more than Carroll's reported price.</p>
              <p>Liverpool have made the huge offer for Carroll because <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/24257/Fernando-Torres"><span style="color: #225fb2;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fernando Torres</span></span></a> is closing in on a £45 million to Chelsea and could leave Anfield on transfer deadline day.</p>

The Uruguay international will complete his move to Anfield on Monday.</p>
              <p>Carroll has scored 11 goals in 19 games in the Premier League this season.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, out-of-favour striker Xisco has sealed a move from Newcastle to Deportivo La Coruna.</p>

              <p><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/91478/andrew-carroll?cc=5739">Andy Carroll</a> has become the most expensive English player in the history of football
               after joining Liverpool from Newcastle in a £35 million deal.</p>

              </div>
              </div>
              <p><strong><a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/873592/transfer-deadline-day-live"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Carroll,
               22, was targeted by Liverpool as a replacement for Fernando Torres, who
               will join Chelsea in a deal worth up to £50 million.</p>
              <p>Liverpool 
              failed with an offer for the Newcastle striker earlier on Monday but 
              persisted with their interest and convinced the Magpies to sell their 
              No. 9, who had drawn favourable comparisons with his predecessor Alan 
              Shearer.</p>
              <p>A Liverpool statement read: "Andy Carroll has tonight 
              completed his transfer from Newcastle United to Liverpool FC and signed a
               five-and-a-half-year deal that will keep him at Anfield until 2016.</p>
              <p>"The
               club agreed a record transfer fee with Newcastle earlier in the day for
               the transfer of the England international striker. The deal was subject
               to the completion of a medical, which the player has now passed. Andy 
              Carroll will wear the No. 9 shirt for Liverpool."</p>
              <p>While Carroll 
              has been in impressive form this season, scoring 11 goals in the Premier
               League and winning his first international cap, the size of the 
              transfer fee has raised eyebrows, exceeding as it does the £30.3 million
               Manchester United paid Leeds for <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7825/Rio-Ferdinand">Rio Ferdinand</a> in 2002.</p>
              <p>Following
               Torres' exit, Carroll will play alongside Luis Suarez, who completed 
              his £22.7 million move from Ajax to Liverpool earlier on Monday night.</p>
              <p>Torres' move to Chelsea also means that Carroll's transfer is the eighth most lucrative of all time.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, on a day when they signed <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/46525/Stephen-Ireland">Stephen Ireland</a> on loan from Aston Villa and attempted to bing Wigan winger <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/44626/Charles-N%27Zogbia">Charles N'Zogbia</a> back to the club, Newcastle also loaned striker Xisco to Deportivo La Coruna.</p>
              <p>Xisco
               said on the Depor website: "I'm returning to my home. Deportivo have 
              given me everything and I've come here focused on helping the team reach
               their objectives."</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Andy Carroll joined </span><span style="color: #000000;">Liverpool </span><span style="color: #000000;">in a sensational £35millon deal, and then claimed </span><span style="color: #000000;">Newcastle </span></strong><span><strong>had 'pushed him out of the door'. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>St James' Park owner Mike Ashley is preparing himself for a backlash from fans after the striker gave up the club's famous No 9 shirt to replace Fernando Torres at Anfield - and was not replaced on Tyneside. </span></p>
              <p><span>After earlier rejecting two offers for Carroll, Newcastle said Carroll the 21-year-old had handed in a transfer request to seal the switch. </span></p>
              <p><span>But the editor of the ToonTalk fanzine, Steve Wraith, claimed Carroll had contacted him before flying to Merseyside and said the England striker had been left with no option but to leave.</span></p>
              <p><span>Wraith claimed Carroll texted: 'I'm gutted to be leaving my home town club, i was told to go. I didn't want to leave that's why I signed a 5 year deal. I was pushed out of the door.' </span></p>
              <p><span>Newcastle failed in a last-gasp £12m bid to re-sign winger Charles N'Zogbia from Wigan, but did bring in midfielder Stephen Ireland on loan from Aston Villa for the rest of the season. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="artSplitter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/31/article-0-0CFE7240000005DC-822_634x350.jpg" alt="Andy Carroll" width="634" height="350">

              </div>
              <p><span><strong>The deal for Carroll would seem to be excellent business for the club - never before has such a fee, or anything like it, been paid for a player with only 41 Premier League games to his name. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span>But Newcastle legend Alan Shearer said: 'I think they (fans) will be angry. They don't want to see their top player go. The fans are not really interested in the financial side of things. </span></p>
              <p><span>'But from the club's point of view, you've got to say that £35m is just an incredible amount of money. It's only a good deal if they go out and spend £35m- 40m on replacing him.'</span></p>

              <p>give him a chance. give kenny a chance. no1 has given kenny a chance here. i dun understand why utd fans come here and keep putting down kenny. give him time. give carroll time. liverpool wouldnt be forced to pay such a high price if torres had stayed.</p>
              <p>if torres had been professional enough to request for a transfer at the start of the window and not at the end with only 2 days left this wouldnt have happened.</p>
              <p>yes i think carroll is prolly worth 20m but thats not the point. the point is newcastle will reject a 20m bid. u guys come in here and discuss but who do u think can really replace torres? no one. but since he wanted to leave liverpool had to try to find a replacement and andy carroll is that person now. pls dun judge him b4 he plays a single game.</p>

              <p>£35 million for this guy? Heck I'd rather pay £35 million for someone who is young and has experiences plying for other leagues though. An £35 million should be spent on someone who is more of a hitman like Edinson Cavani from Napoli though.</p>

              <p>I think this Dalglish a little crazy liao paying so much for <span style="color: #000000;">Andy Carroll...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Not surprise Mike Ashley forced him out of Newcastle in such a hurry having received so much for a half decent striker... Pack and deliver to Anfield or else where to get this kind of payday... lol.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Maybe Dalglish is re-living his dream and thinks he is re-signing</span> Alan Shearer all over again like 19 yrs ago... Breaking the transfer record along the way too... And some people thought Darren Bent was expensive... With this Carroll deal, Villa's Bent deal is looking like a real bargain cos the sum can only pay for one of Carroll's leg... £18m compare to £35m... </p>
              <p>And don't tell me Carroll is way better than Darren Bent...</p>
              <p>One thing is for sure though, at least Pool got one more English player for their quota...</p>

              <p>yes he does.</p>
              <p>but why keep someone who doesnt even want to be part of the team?</p>
              <p>and he has been useless up till recently this season. look at his stats this season the no. of runs he made. why keep him when theres plenty who are more than willing to fill his place and work much harder than him.</p>
