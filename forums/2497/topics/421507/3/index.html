              <p>with the players they have, liverpool will get beaten when they travel to Fulham, Blackburn or even Sunderland, not to mention the top 4 sides. so it is better to have a point than zero point when they travel away isn't it.</p>

              <p>in away games, kenny can employ 4-5-1 with Caroll as the

              Looks like Ngog and Babel days at Anfield is numbered, as is many

              <p>Torres
               has promised not to celebrate if he scores against former club 
              Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Sunday out of respect for their fans, 
              but he also removed himself from his status as Anfield hero by claiming 
              he "never kissed the badge" while at the Reds.</p>
              <p>While many 
              Liverpool fans are unhappy with their former idol's £50million move away
               from Anfield, Torres bluntly stated he was simply a professional 
              footballer with his own ambitions and that the only club in his heart is
               Atletico, who he left for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>"I never kissed the 
              Liverpool badge,'' he said. "Never. No. Kissed the badge? No. I never 
              did. I never did when I was at Atletico Madrid, and I love Atletico, my 
              former club. I see some players doing that when they join a club but the
               romance in football has gone. It's a different thing now. People are 
              coming and leaving. When you are joining a club you want to do the best 
              for yourself and that club and that's all.</p>
              <p>"Some people like to 
              kiss the badge. They can do it. I only want to score goals and do my job
               and achieve all the targets the team has. When I was born in Madrid I 
              was not a Liverpool fan or a Chelsea fan. I was only an Atletico Madrid 
              fan. I still am. Maybe it's the only badge I will kiss if I have to kiss
               one.''</p>
              <p>Many have speculated as to the sort of reception Torres 
              will receive from his former supporters, but he is sure that on the 
              field at least, he will be given a friendly welcome, citing captain <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/player/_/id/7935/Steven-Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> as one who has wished him the best with his new club.</p>
              <p>He
               added: "He was one of the first ones who called me and said if I left, 
              if I stayed, he would help me and support me. Maybe because he was in 
              that situation first. He's been a very good friend and team-mate from 
              the first to the last day. He only wanted the best for me and said he'd 
              agree with whatever decision I made.''</p>
              <p>He added: "I think 
              'traitor' makes no sense. I played three very good seasons there, left 
              massive money there, lots of goals, good performances. I'm very happy 
              with everything I did there. Maybe it's too soon to ask for a good 
              reception. I'm not expecting that. But it would be a surprise for me if I
               get a very bad reception.''</p>
