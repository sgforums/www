The ex-Blues boss, 44, called Elsa Sousa his Â“PrincessÂ”, showered her with gifts and told her she was his one true love. The 34-year-old even shared a flat with Â“The Special OneÂ”. Players at top Portuguese side FC Porto thought she was coach JoseÂ’s wife Â— until the real Mrs Mourinho turned up. </strong><br><br>Mourinho lived up to his nickname The Special One as he and his mistress made love for hours Â— to the music of rock star Sting. The romps took place during a two-year affair with Elsa. A pal of 34-year-old Elsa said: Â“They did very saucy things together. Mourinho is a very sexual man. He particularly likes making love to Sting.Â”<br><br>The former Chelsea boss, whose shock exit last month stunned fans, called Elsa his Â“PrincessÂ” and showered her with gifts Â— and even let her decide which club he should work for.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00371/snn1201yu384_371190a.jpg"><br><span class="small">Â“PrincessÂ”, Elsa was thought to be Jose's wife</span><br><br>But his wife Matilde, whom he married in 1989, had no idea he was leading a double life. Mourinho, 44, met blonde Elsa while coaching small-town team Leiria in his native Portugal. He took her with him to FC Porto, his first big job Â— where the pair lived for eight months in a flat arranged by the club. Mourinho even introduced her as his wife to players and agents. He went to coach in Leiria, 90 miles north of Lisbon, in 2001. Matilde stayed in their home town of Setabul with their daughter, also called Matilde and now 11, and son Jose Junior, seven.<br><br>But within months Mourinho had launched a full-blown affair with Elsa. He asked her to dinner in 2001 after popping into the small fashion store she owned. He told her she was Â“the most beautiful girl he had ever metÂ”, and that he had moved to the town and did not know many people. Within weeks, she was telling people Mourinho was Â“the oneÂ”. He sent Elsa love letters and was frequently seen kissing her in public, dining her, and schmoozing her with Â“baby-talkÂ”. He even whisked her away for a steamy holiday in Monaco.<br><br>When The Sun put the relationship to Elsa in Leiria, she said: Â“Yes, yes, itÂ’s all true.Â” She then met us again with Luzia Palmas, a former Benfica lawyer and colleague of Mourinho for four years. Luzia said: Â“He treated Elsa badly by promising her they would be together properly. Â“Mourinho conducted the relationship in front of everyoneÂ’s noses. In Leiria and in Porto, football colleagues all thought Elsa was his wife. He lived with her.Â”<br><br></div>

Â“He spent the evening holding hands and kissing Elsa. Â“When I later asked Elsa about it she told me that she was in love with him and had fallen head over heels at first sight. Â“She looked up from the cash register and into the eyes of the most beautiful man she had ever seen. She had been seeing him for months in secret but they had decided to come out as a couple. Elsa said he reminded her of James Bond Â— the Pierce Brosnan one. Elsa also told us all how he was a fantastic lover. Â“She told me they spent hours making love all night and he was so smooth and gentle.<br><br>Â“Elsa said he loved making love to soft rock music like Bryan Adams and Sting.Â” Elsa started attending matches with Mourinho, as his wife. Under MourinhoÂ’s direction the unfashionable mid-table team achieved their highest-ever league position, finishing in fifth place. As a result the colourful coach caught the eye of footie bigwigs throughout the country. In January 2002 he moved to Porto having rejected Benfica Â— and Elsa went with him. Mourinho introduced her to all the football agents and players as his partner. She attended many games and used to sit with Carolina Salgado, then the long-term partner of Porto president Pinto da Costa.<br><br>At first she stayed with Mourinho in the five-star Hotel Tivoli Â— but football agents for the club allegedly wanted the pair to live somewhere more private and found them a home. Many people, including Porto fans, saw the couple openly kissing and holding hands. One fan said yesterday: Â“In April 2002 I was meeting a friend in the D. Manuel restaurant and I was surprised to see Jose Mourinho at the table next to ours with a lady I thought was his wife. Mourinho was a very well-known man in Portugal. I couldnÂ’t take my eyes off their table.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00371/SNN1204A_371186a.jpg"><br><span class="small">Jose's Love nest ... Porto's Tivoli hotel</span><br><br>Â“He kissed the girl on the lips intimately and started stroking her arm romantically. Â“They were talking to each other in baby talk, which I found hilarious because Mourinho does not seem the type to be like that. Â“She called him Â‘ZezinhoÂ’, a way of saying Â‘My little boy MourinhoÂ’. He laughed and called her Â‘My PrincessÂ’.<br><br>Â“Another couple with them called her Elsa Sousa. Â“A few days later I learned that the woman I had seen with Mourinho was his mistress he brought from Leiria when he came to Porto and was not his true wife. Â“I saw Mourinho and Elsa driving several times around Porto in a black Mercedes.Â” Another fan said: Â“In February 2002, a few days before a Porto game, I went to dinner with my son at the restaurant in the Hotel Tivoli.<br><br>Â“A couple were on their own at the table next to us. The man was kissing the girl on the lips while stroking her hair. She responded by making some little moans. They left the restaurant arm in arm. Â“It wouldnÂ’t be anything out of the ordinary if it hadnÂ’t been that the man was the coach of FC Porto, Jose Mourinho. Â“A waiter told me they were living at the Hotel Tivoli together. Â“The waiter said the woman wasnÂ’t MourinhoÂ’s true wife but a friend called Elsa.Â”<br><br>A third Porto fan told how he saw the couple kissing in the black Merc in April 2002. He said: Â“I believed Mourinho was a reserved person. I went to say hello and knocked on the window. Mourinho didnÂ’t look at me but he said hello and told the girl to do the same. Â“He was laughing while he was doing this. He said in a baby voice, Â“Little Elsa, say goodnight to that man, my little PrincessÂ’.<br><br>Â“I found out that this lady wasnÂ’t his wife. It became common knowledge that the true wife was in Setabul and Elsa had a clothes store in Leiria where they met.Â” After they moved into a flat together in Porto, Elsa lived with Mourinho for eight months. But in late 2002, his wife Matilde Â— also known as Tami Â— dropped the bombshell that she was moving to Porto, as the children were suffering from being away from their father.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00371/jose_180x250_371331a.jpg"><br><span class="small">Unaware wife: Jose and Matilde</span><br><br>Mourinho was forced to move Elsa out and be a family man again. But before Matilde arrived he took Elsa to Monaco Â— where he showered her with gifts and they made love all day. He begged her to continue their relationship Â— offering to buy her a house so they could continue their affair in secret. But her pal said: Â“Elsa announced she couldnÂ’t cope with being the other woman. She told us, Â‘I want a whole man, not a half. I canÂ’t live like thatÂ’.Â”<br><br>Mourinho carried on seeing Elsa into 2003 Â— even after his wife and family moved to Porto. The pal said: Â“Elsa then moved back to Leiria. She was devastated. Â“Everyone in town knew Elsa as MourinhoÂ’s mistress.Â” Elsa told pals she last spent the night with Mourinho at the end of 2003. He joined Chelsea in 2004. After moving back to Leiria she fell on hard times and now works as a shop-assistant in a clothes store. But Elsa plans to cash in on the relationship and has written a bombshell book which she is touting to publishers.<br><br>Details of MourinhoÂ’s affair with Elsa are also the subject of a Portuguese court inquiry Â— after they were left out of another book by Carolina Salgado, with whom she used to sit at Porto games. The pages referring to Mourinho are available to journalists Â— and confirm he and Elsa were lovers. Dealing with his move to Porto, it says he had a pre-contract deal with the club Â— but also had an agreement with Benfica. It goes on: Â“Having to choose one of the great rivals, he put the decision in the hands of Elsa, asking her where she would like to live. Â“Being a fan of Porto, she chose to live there, and resolved the problem.<br></div>

The ex-Chelsea boss, 44, was set for a confrontation with stunned Matilde and later left the family home in Setabul, near Lisbon, Portugal. </strong><br><br>A source close to the footie coach yesterday said: Â“Matilde never knew about the affair and so Jose will have a lot of explaining to do. Â“ItÂ’s hard for anyone to admit theyÂ’ve not been the perfect family man Â– and a two-year affair is a hell of a lot worse than a one-night stand.Â”<br><br>The self-styled Special One went into hiding after our story yesterday. We revealed how he had led a double life, living with Elsa Sousa behind childhood sweetheart MatildeÂ’s back.<br><br>Portuguese Mourinho Â– whose shock sacking from Premiership club Chelsea last month left fans reeling Â– called gorgeous Elsa, 34, his princess, and one true love. They began the affair in 2001 and he showered the shop girl with gifts, even letting her choose his career path by deciding which teams he would coach.<br><br>Incredibly, the love-cheat lived with blonde Elsa for eight months in a flat arranged by his old club FC Porto, after bringing her with him when he transferred from his first coaching job in the town of Leiria, 90 miles away.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00371/SNN1309B_180_371754a.jpg"><br><span class="small">Affair ... sexy shop girl Elsa</span><br><br>He also introduced Elsa as his Â“wifeÂ” to players and agents at FC Porto Â– who were left gobsmacked when his real missus Matilde eventually turned up. Porto fans revealed how they saw Mourinho and his lover kissing and holding hands in public. Yet until yesterday MourinhoÂ’s wife, whom he married in 1989, had no idea that she spent years sharing her husband and father of children Matilde, 11, and Jose Jr, seven, with another woman.<br><br>The Blues boss is set to face further torment later this year, when Elsa plans to publish her dynamite book of her life with him. Elsa has already told friends how he enjoyed having sex while listening to StingÂ’s music Â– while she thought he looked just like James Bond star Pierce Brosnan.<br><br>Blues owner Roman Abramovich axed Mourinho after a poor start to the season, even though he had won two Premier League titles in three years Â– as well as the hearts of most die-hard Chelsea fans.<br><br><img src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00371/SNN1309AA_280_371755a.jpg"><br><span class="small">Family man ...

We told last week how the ex-Chelsea manager lived with shop girl Elsa Sousa behind his wifeÂ’s back. Details of the affair form part of a legal investigation in MourinhoÂ’s native Portugal after they were left out of a tell-all book. </strong><br><br>Now it has emerged that damaging claims of two other relationships with women were dropped from the book by Carolina Salgado. She is the former girlfriend of Pinto da Costa, president of FC Porto, a Portuguese club Mourinho, 44, coached. Meanwhile blonde Elsa, 34, has told how Mourinho, called The Special One, fed her chocolate-chip cookies as they romped Â– while playing Bryan AdamsÂ’ hit Everything I Do, I Do It For You.<br><br>She also claimed the dad of two promised to leave his wife Matilde for her. Elsa said: Â“I loved Jose very much. The chemistry between us was electrifying. He was very gentle, sweet and attentive.Â”<br><br>Until The Sun broke the news, Matilde had no idea she shared her husband with another woman.<br></div>
