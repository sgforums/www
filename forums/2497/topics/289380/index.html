His relationship with Comolli was strained and he felt the club were putting potential future profit ahead of short-term requirements.<br><br>"When Frank Arnesen was director of football we spoke together about the players to bring to the club," he said.<br><br>"But I did not have the same relationship with the next man. I think the club wanted to invest in younger players because they wanted to make money on them in the future. The decisions were not being made for football reasons. I knew that in the summer and realised my position was becoming very difficult."</div>
