              <h1>Crisis? What crisis? Arsenal boss Wenger dismisses financial fears as he sets up two deals</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger has dismissed talk of an Arsenal crisis as he prepares to make two new signings in the next three weeks. But a group of shareholders, worried by the departures of managing director Keith Edelman and key midfield player Mathieu Flamini, will this month write to the board demanding answers to a series of pointed questions about the club's future.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger wants to bring in a midfielder and a centre-half by the end of the month and Valencia's Carlos Marchena is among his targets. He said: 'At the moment, the vibes coming out of the club are as though it might implode, but it's not like that at all. We're very stable and in a financially very good situation. 'I will be a busy man this summer. I know what I want and I'm very confident. We should sort out the deals in the next two or three weeks.'</p>
              <p>Despite the loss of Flamini to AC Milan and the claim from Alexander Hleb's agent that the Belarus midfielder wants to leave the club too, Wenger has challenged his players to stay and fight for next season's title. 'I have the feeling that we are not far away and I hope it is shared by the players,' said Wenger.</p>
              <p>'The real test we face is whether we are strong enough to say: “Ok, we missed out this year. We came very close and if we are winners we will come back and do it.” That's what I expect from my team. I think the core of the team is ready to fight.'</p>
              <p>Hleb, who is wanted by Inter Milan and Barcelona, appears determined to leave despite Wenger's bullish comments about fighting to hold on to him. He must hand in his notice to Arsenal by Monday, May 26, if he wants to terminate his contract under the new Webster Ruling, which allows players to buy out the remainder of their deals. He risks being banned from football if he fails to act within 15 days of the end of the season.</p>
              <p>Hleb's commitment may be in doubt but Wenger has an ally in striker Robin van Persie, who believes his manager's policy of balancing the books in his transfer dealings and playing attractive football will eventually have its reward.</p>
              <p>But the Arsenal board will this month receive a letter from a loose affiliation of small shareholders who believe the club need a change of direction after three seasons without a trophy if they are to compete effectively with their rivals in England and Europe.</p>
              <p>The season-ticket holders, all of whom once owned significant stakes in Arsenal, believe only a serious problem could have triggered Edelman's surprise exit at the end of last month, barely a year after vice-chairman David Dein was forced out by his fellow directors.</p>
              <p>Arsenal last night denied allegations from another source that Edelman's departure was directly linked to the loss of £15million-rated Flamini on a free transfer, pointing out that Ken Friar, not Edelman, took on Dein's role of overseeing transfers and contract negotiations.</p>
              <p>But the concerned shareholders suspect that a problem in Arsenal's cash flow, perhaps relating to the property developments associated with the Emirates Stadium, is restricting the club's ability to compete with their rivals in transfer fees and wages, causing players like Flamini and Hleb to look elsewhere.</p>
              <p>They will write to the board this month asking them to explain in full the reasons for Edelman's exit and to respond to specific queries about the club's finances. Arsenal's stance is that Flamini's wage demands were too large to be accommodated within their wage structure and that their most recent financial results show they have a wage bill of the same magnitude as Manchester United and the resources to make big-money signings if Wenger so chooses.  </p>

              <h2>WENGER KEEN TO MAKE QUICK SIGNINGS</h2>
              <div id="printsaveline"><img src="http://clientimages.teamtalk.com/08/05/240/Arsene_Wenger_smiles_Arsenal_v_Everton_844820.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180"></div>

              <div id="articlebody"><span id="intelliTXT">
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger is very confident of bringing his top summer transfer targets to the Emirates Stadium and hopes the Arsenal fans will be "reassured" the future is bright. The Gunners head into Sunday's final game of what has been a rollercoaster season at Sunderland with little other than pride to play for after their title bid faded.</strong></p>
              <p>Wenger insists his team deserve a great deal of credit for running their rivals closer than they have since last winning the title in 2004. The Arsenal manager, though, does not intend to rest on his laurels and will step up the search for fresh talent as soon as the campaign is over.</p>
              <p>With out-of-contract midfielder Mathieu Flamini having already opted to sign for AC Milan and Alexander Hleb reported to be ready to buy out his contract and join Inter, Wenger looks set for a busy two months.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have been linked with Portsmouth's Croatian winger Niko Kranjcar and Lyon's Hatem Ben Arfa, both valued around £12million, as well as Cameroon midfielder Jean Makoun - currently at Lille - while Valencia forward David Villa has talked of his admiration for the Gunners.</p>
              <p>Wenger already has his main targets in mind and hopes to complete the deals by the end of the month. "I know what I want and I am very confident," he said. "I hope to turn that around in the next two or three weeks. They (fans) should be re-assured by what they see."</p>
              <p>Wenger's main signing last summer was Croatia forward Eduardo da Silva, who later suffered an horrific broken leg at Birmingham, and the Frenchman indicated he may look closer to home this time around. "It would be better to buy someone who has played in England because they are less risky, but it costs more money if they are from the Premier League," Wenger said.</p>
              <p>"Maybe I will try to do both." Wenger, however, maintains his squad does not need major surgery and the foundations are in place to mount another sustained title challenge come kick-off in August.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't look like we have no team and we have to build a team," he said. "We were unbeaten at home and that is only the second time in the history of the club. "We have done that with young players who will be better next season."</p>
              <p>While the character of his young side was pushed to the limit this season, Wenger feels the experiences they endured will stand them all in good stead for the challenges ahead.</p>
              <p>"Like every big disappointment you have in life you go through a period where you have to swallow and digest it and think 'Where do I go from here? Do I feel sorry for myself or do I fight and do something different?'</p>
              <p>"After a while the players come together and there is a good togetherness in the squad. "I feel they have created something special and not to take advantage of that would be criminal for me."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>ARSENAL are weighing up a shock cut-price £1million deal for Manchester City's defensive skipper Richard Dunne.</strong></p>
              <p>The Republic of Ireland international will be available for that knockdown figure under a FIFA regulation that allows him to buy out the remaining year of his contract.</p>
