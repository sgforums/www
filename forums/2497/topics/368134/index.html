              <p class="story_panel_text"><strong><span id="intelliTXT">Habib
              Beye has expressed his disappointment with the predicament at Newcastle
              and admitted he has no choice but to leave the club this summer.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/07/330/Habib-Beye_2334040.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p class="story_panel_text"><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>Beye had originally declared
              himself willing to stay at St James' Park but, with no new owner or
              manager, the defender feels he has little choice other than to move on.</p>
              <p>The 31-year-old has established himself as a firm fans
              favourite in his two seasons on Tyneside but now looks set to follow
              Michael Owen out of the door, with Sunderland and Stoke both monitoring
              his situation.</p>
              <p>"When I joined from Marseille two years ago, I was so excited
              to be joining such a big club, it was a dream move," Beye told The Sun.</p>
              <p>"I'd like nothing more than to stay and help the team get back
              to where it belongs but there is no chance of us being promoted the way
              things are going.</p>
              <p>"Training has been good and no one is slacking or taking it easy. But there is a sense that everything is just drifting.</p>
              <p>"This cannot go on it really can't. I feel for the good of my career I have to get away because it is dragging me down."</p>
              <p>Beye believes the Magpies should be looking to reappoint Alan
              Shearer as manager but adds that not even the Magpies hero knows what
              is going on.</p>
              <p>"I'm really upset by what has or rather has not been going on this summer," he confessed.</p>
              <p>"It was hard enough dealing with the disappointment of being relegated but things just seem to be going from bad to worse.</p>
              <p>"I've spoken to Alan Shearer and I know how much he wanted to
              get Newcastle back to the Premier League. He is a top man and someone
              the players believe in.</p>
              <p>"He had told us about what he expected when we returned to
              pre-season training and I left for my holiday fully expecting him to be
              in charge when I got back.</p>
              <p>"But it hasn't happened and he doesn't seem to know what's going on much more than anyone else."</p>
