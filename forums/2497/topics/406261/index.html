              <h3>ROY HODGSON believes he has done all he can to keep Fernando Torres at Liverpool. </h3>
              <p>And the new Anfield manager's shock confession will open the door for Chelsea to launch an official bid for Spain's £60million-rated World Cup winner. </p>
              <p>"Unfortunately, I cannot do much more," admitted Hodgson. "His beef is with the club and not me." </p>
              <p>The 26-year-old striker believes he has been let down by broken promises regarding investment in new players, a factor that was key in him signing a new deal last year.</p>
              <p>Hodgson added: "Fernando's situation has nothing to do with me, he made that perfectly clear over the phone during the World Cup and when I met him face-to-face. </p>
              <p>"He knows what I would like to do with the club. He knows how much I value him. </p>
              <p>"But his issues are with what has gone on in the past rather than the future. If he has problems with the club for things in the past, it is difficult for me to dismiss that." </p>
              <p>Hodgson had been celebrating a double success after signing England star Joe Cole and convincing Kop skipper Steven Gerrard to stay at Anfield. </p>
              <p>But his admission after Saturday night's 1-0 friendly defeat against Kaiserslautern in Germany is seen as the biggest indicator yet that Torres is still considering leaving Liverpool.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Anfield managing director Christian Purslow has had several talks with Torres, including a meeting in Majorca last week. Liverpool insist they are close to securing new financial backing.</strong> </p>
              <p>The club's American co-owner Tom Hicks is understood to have been in London last week for a series of meetings with potential investors. </p>
              <p>Torres demanded new signings in March and stressed: "What is important is the club makes a big effort and brings great players that are above the quality of the squad.</p>
              <p>"We need four or five of the highest level to compete. Without strengthening, what's the point of fighting again next season just to be in the top four." </p>
              <p>To compound Hodgson's problems, 26-year -old Argentinian midfielder Javier Mascherano will return to Liverpool this week and demand a transfer to Inter Milan. </p>
              <p>Chelsea are favourites to land Torres, but it will take a bid of around £60m to bring Liverpool to the negotiating table. </p>
              <p>"People forget he is a Liverpool player," added Hodgson. "One year ago he signed a four-year contract. I hope he will commit himself by honouring his contract."</p>

              <p>Bellamy is still a good player when he is on the field.</p>
              <p>He is one of the few players who goes 120% when he is playing.</p>
              <p>It depends on Ah Roy whether he can handle a difficult player who dun get along with the rest of the squad.</p>
              <p>I guess all managers love player like Kuyt, which never complain and play in any position that the manager want.</p>

              <p>Nobody is bigger than the club so should sell him if he wants to go. Not advisable to keep someone whose heart is no longer there...same case as Mascherano (he is world class!!), but hope Roy sell him and get the cash to buy other players.</p>

              <p>I think he himself want to leave cos he is not the highest paid at Pool anyway. So if there is a chance to get more money and at the same time better chance of winning things... Then why not?</p>
              <p>But he should stay cos Roy's Pool looks like they are heading in the right direction... But from the way Roy has come out and spoke about it... I think their meeting and conversation didn't go too well...</p>

              <span id="divAdnetKeyword"><strong>Former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish believes striker Fernando Torres will commit his future to the club, despite reports that the Spanish World Cup winner is disillusioned with life at Anfield.</strong><br><br>The 26-year-old has been constantly linked with a summer move away from the Reds, yet Dalglish feels that following the arrival of Roy Hodgson the stellar striker will opt to stay.<br><br>Cole's transfer from Chelsea, coupled with captain Steven Gerrard's commitment to the club, have also given Torres reason to remain on Merseyside.<br><br>"When [Fernando] Torres sees that and talks with Roy [Hodgson] I'm sure he'll give us [Liverpool] good news," Dalglish told <em>Radio 5 live's Sportsweek. </em><br><br>Hodgson told the <em>News of the World</em> on Sunday that he believed he had done all he could to keep Torres at Liverpool next season, saying: "Unfortunately, I cannot do much more. His beef is with the club and not me." <br><br>Torres has been plagued with injuries of late, and is currently out with an adductor problem, although the club believe he will be fit for the Premier League curtain-raiser against Arsenal on August 15.<br><br>Current Premier League champions Chelsea have been rumoured to be interested in taking the former Atletico Madrid star to Stamford Bridge this summer, but Dalglish doesn't feel Torres will be tempted by a move to the Blues.<br><br>"I hope Torres stays. Only Fernando knows what he is going to do. Unfortunately for him he is injured, but he is a fantastic player and is very happy around the club and the city," he added.<br><br>"The fact that Stevie [Gerrard] is staying will be a great help and players like Joe Cole, Milan Jovanovic, Jonjo Shelvey and Danny Wilson means there is buying for present and the future."<br><br>Meanwhile, Dalglish shared his thoughts on his own future and discussed a possible return to football management at some stage.<br><br>The 59-year-old has been out of management since ending a short stint with Celtic in 2000 and admitted he was keen on the Liverpool post following Rafael Benitez's departure to Inter Milan earlier in the summer.<br><br>However, he stepped aside when it became apparent he was not in the club hierarchy's thoughts for the dug-out job in June.<br><br>"Whether I would be a manager somewhere else remains to be seen. I don't know," he added. <br><br>"Sometimes you miss the buzz of competing at the top level, but you don't miss it when you lose a game because it can be very lonely." <br><br>"When Rafa [Rafael Benitez] went I offered to help in any way I could. There was a list made up [managing director] Christian Purslow and I spoke to a few people.
              <p>"After the initial conversations I stepped aside and the board made the decision who would be the next manager.</p>
              <p>"I said I would help in any way I possibly could for Liverpool and I would have been prepared to be the manager if they wanted that. But they didn't want that to happen which is their prerogative and that is no problem for me.</p>
              <p>"I was very happy at the club last year working with the academy and being an ambassador and it was enjoyable."</p>
              <p>Dalgish believes the future of the club is bright, despite failure to qualify for the Champions League this season.</p>
              "Signing Joe Cole and Steven Gerrard coming out with a statement saying he is staying gives everyone a lift, and it wasn't a bad week for the club," he surmised. <br><br>"Roy [Hodgson] is going to stamp his own authority on the club. It is difficult at the moment because the players are coming back in dribs and drabs after the World Cup and when you don't have everyone coming back together it is difficult."<em><br></em></span></div>

              <p>gerrard stays coz he is old and sees no point moving and end up hated by liverpool fans.</p>
              <p>joe cole is good but not that good.  he is not good enough to lift liverpool from their current slump.</p>

              <p>I think Kenny is still not happy Roy was given the job and not him...</p>
              <p>I think he is trying to put more pressure on Roy and should Torres leave, then the fans can blame it on Roy for being useless and not being able to persuade him to stay...</p>
              <p>Maybe that's the reason why Roy came out to say if Torres leave, it has nothing to do with him but something that happen in the past and there isn't anything he could do... He mentioned that Torres has a "beef" with the club whatever that means... lol.</p>
              <p>Looks like there is a bit of politics taking place behind the scene...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Ah Roy cannot create magic with a team of sub standard players.</p>
              <p>He have to be very wise to snap up players discarded by other clubs to form his team.</p>
              <p>So, I dun expect much from Ah Roy on the coming season.</p>

              <p>Pay Rise - Will get if he stays</p>
              <p>League Title - Still in with a fair chance</p>
              <p>League Cup - Good Chance</p>
              <p>FA Cup - Also possible, why not?</p>
              <p>Champion League Cup - Pool are the only other English side to have won it besides United in recent yrs.</p>
              <p>Europa Cup - Very Good chance if they want it is the first place</p>
              <p>Champion League Next Season - As you say, Not sure</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recommendation: Should Stay and give the club a chance on their new journey if he really luv Pool &amp; their fans so much as he claims otherwise he will be proved as just another phony and a hypocrite...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a strong feeling they will do better than when Rafa was around. So should give Roy a chance...</p>
