              <h1>Uzbekistan tear hapless Singapore apart</h1>
              <h2>Uzbekistan trounced Singapore 7-3 at the National Stadium and maintained their lead in Group Four on nine points.</h2>
              <p>Midfielder Timur Kapadze fired the Uzbeks ahead on 10 minutes at the
              National Stadium. Despite conceding the first goal, the plucky Lions
              took the game to their more illustrious opponents.  </p>
              <p>Aleksandar Duric equalised for Singapore just six minutes later.</p>
              <p>Sloppy defending however, allowed Uzbekistan to restore their lead through Victor Karpenko in the 21st minute.</p>
              <p>The visitors held on to their slender advantage for only ten
              minutes, when Singapore’s Serbian-born midfielder Mustafic Fahrudin
              levelled the scores.  </p>
              <p>The Singapore defence though, had a nightmarish evening coping with
              Uzbekistan’s Server Djeparov. The attacking midfielder pulled the
              strings for in the centre of the park, and got on the scoresheet with
              his 34th minute strike.  </p>
              <p>Vitaliy Denisov put Uzbekistan further ahead with his goal on 42
              minutes, and Djeparov clinched his brace just two minutes later. </p>
              <p>After the break, Uzbekistan came out firing on all cylinders and
              Aziz Ibragimov scored their sixth goal of the evening in the 62nd
              minute. A defensive lapse allowed Singapore winger John Wilkinson to
              pull a goal back for the Lions in the 73rd minute.</p>
              <p>Dynamo Kiev striker Maksim Shatskikh sealed an emphatic victory for Uzbekistan two minutes from time.  </p>
              <p>With the win, Uzbekistan currently lead Group Four on nine points with a superior goal advantage.</p>

              <p>just got back from the stadium. kallang roar was definitely missing despite a decent crowd.</p>
              <p>for the goals scored, it's worth the ticket price.</p>
              <p>the uzbeks were too good. i think singapore were not bad in the first 20mins, but downhill there after. were also a tad lucky having presented both times with sitters after the ball hit the woodwork. how often does that happen in a game?ã€€</p>
              <p>the uzbeks individual skills as well as their passing game were a joy to watch. i think lionel lewis had a terrible game. some of the goals were due to his poor positioning.</p>
              <p>i left when the score was 3-6, because the uzbeks were literally walking and playing down the time.</p>
              <p>well, the solution is simple. singapore just need another 3 FST to fill the 1st 11 and they will be ok.</p>

              <p><br>Most of the FTs we have are fat and slow. LOL look at daniel bennet and precious. These two are the most laughable. I bet mani and even lim tong hai or aide iskandar can do better than them in their younger years.</p>
              <p>As for midfield, even though mustaffic play well but hes still slow...shi jiayi and wilkinson did pretty well though.</p>
              <p>A. Duric did what is expected from him. khairul amri surprises with some good control although i dont think he is close to scoring in any occasion.</p>
              <p>noor rahman did well, save for the mistake resulting in 3rd goal. Sharil ishak played okay. lionel lewis has a below average game. haha 7-3 not bad la...at least not 7-0.</p>

              <p>TRUE.  why not support singapore? singapore give u a comfy place to stay, good food to eat, and a education. is it so hard to support them? and for derby, do u think they are not happy that they can be in the epl, what about other teams that cant even get in the epl? do they think like, lets just stay in the lousy league, or do they lets try to get ourself to the epl? please use ur fucking brain think. ty.</p>

              <p>if not for them, would it be a rout? instead of a thrashing?</p>

              <p>First you said losing 7-0 or 8-0 is like being the joke of the town and now you say losing 7-3 is not shameful WTF ? Have a backbone please! Let's be realistic here how many of you out there thought Singapore would lose this big? It's the same as Manchester City getting unexpectedly thrashed if you ask me.Main thing is we do not abandon the Lions just because they fucked up last night or try to out do themselves  outside ASEAN</p>

              <p>China also lost to UZB 3-0 at malaysia.</p>
              <p>Even the saudis (a team that has always qualify for the world cup since debuting in 1994) also lost 3-0 to UZB at UZB.</p>
              <p>Singapore losing by at least 2 goals is kinda expected. But WHY WHY WHY didnt i bet on this match??? damn</p>
