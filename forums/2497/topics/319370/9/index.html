              <p>Actually i think daniel bennet and precious are like the buomsong and titus bramble of singapore.</p>
              <p>They are pretty good players who can attack better than say subramani or aide iskandar but when you look at the defence, they are often caught sleeping. They do not check out  for the running man too.</p>

              <p>not really shameful.</p>
              <p>After all, malaysia lost to UZB 5-0 in the last asian cup where
              malaysia was the host.</p>
              <p>China also lost to UZB 3-0 at malaysia.</p>
              <p>Even the saudis (a team that has always qualify for the world
              cup since debuting in 1994) also lost 3-0 to UZB at UZB.</p>
              <p>Singapore losing by at least 2 goals is kinda expected. But WHY
              WHY WHY didnt i bet on this match??? damn</p>

              7-3 is something to remember in a long time(especially when played
              at the National Stadium) but we hope that the result would move

              <p>I am very disappointed with the Singapore coach, i really dont understand how come he never see the point of changing the under-perform players even before half-time.</p>
              <p>Whenever i see Daniel Bennet and Lionel lewis, i almost faint. Daniel definitely has to bear some responsibility by allowing the wingers of UZB to terrorsise him, and that lionel, now i know how come no english clubs in the lower division dun even want him.</p>
              <p>The Coach should have the guts to change the so-called first choice, and allow the subs to prove to them that they can do better. If we stay this way, Singapore will just only be staying in the same place instead of progressing.</p>
              <p>That's a very sad day for Singapore Football, they ask for support and we gave them, now they return us with such performance. I seriously dont expect them to win, but at the very least i want to see some fighting spirit in the players, sad to say, not all gave their best.</p>

              <p>The coach didnt have many pool of players to choose from.I believe Singapore state of soccer can  only  be saved by FTs so FAS better scout for talented kids from as far as Paraguay or The Ivory Coast to Kazakhstan....Kelantan oso can lah cuz it is in a desperate state now.</p>
