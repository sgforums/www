              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-size: 2.8em;">Kaka rejects world record bid from Man City</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Manchester City's £100 million swoop for Serie A star Kaka has been
              dealt a swift blow after the Brazilian playmaker claimed he wanted "to
              grow old at Milan".</p>
              <p>A City delegation led by chief executive Garry Cook flew to the San
              Siro on Tuesday to table the world record breaking offer along with
              weekly wages of £250,000 but the AC Milan favourite has blown any deal
              out of the water.</p>
              <p>''I am extremely happy here. I want to grow old
              at Milan,'' he said. ''My aim is to become, at some point in the
              future, the captain of this team. I know there is a pecking order, with
              (Paolo) Maldini at the front and then (Massimo) Ambrosini, but after
              that...</p>
              <p>''I will be here until [the club] don't want me here. As
              long as my aims are the same as the club's aims, I would like to remain
              here.''</p>
              <p>Kaka first heard of City's reported offer on Wednesday
              morning before training but admitted it was not the first time he had
              faced this situation. Both Real Madrid and Chelsea are understood to
              have previously tried to secure his services.</p>
              <p>''I arrived this
              morning and I saw some news on the newspaper but I went on to do my
              job,'' he said. ''I reiterate what I have always said, they (City) can
              make the offer they want to make but it will depend on Milan. What
              happens will be decided by Milan.</p>
              <p>''It's not the first time this
              has happened, I have already said 'no' to other offers and this is not
              probably something which will see me leave Milan. If, one day, the club
              wishes to sell me then it is a different issue altogether. But I feel
              very well here, it's not the money that will see me leave Milan.''</p>
              <p>Kaka
              is under contract with the Rossoneri through the 2012-13 campaign but
              the 26-year-old wants to remain at the Serie A club even longer.</p>

              <div class="content">
              <p>AC Milan ace Kaka hasn't shut down talks over a money-spinning move to Manchester City.</p>
              <p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> says Kaka wishes to meet the man behind the £100million cash bid to take him to Manchester City before deciding on his future.</p>
              <p>As AC Milan accepted City's offer, sources at City insist he will sit
              down with Sheik Mansour and give the Abu Dhabi billionaire and his
              employees at Eastlands the chance to persuade Kaka to move to the
              Premier League.</p>
              <p>It may even involve a reception at the Sheik's £8billion Royal Palace.</p>
              <p>Though the Brazilian superstar was quick to express his desire
              to remain at the San Siro yesterday, insisting he would like 'to grow
              old in Milan', his club are keen on the transfer and on Wednesday night
              they were waiting for Kaka's father and chief adviser, Bosco, to return
              from a holiday in Brazil for talks.</p>
              <p>When Adriano Galliani, Milan's chief executive, meets Kaka Snr
              he will tell him the Serie A club have accepted City's offer for his
              son and that they are happy for the transfer to proceed.</p>

              <p>As AC Milan accepted City's offer, sources at City insist he will sit down with Sheik Mansour and give the Abu Dhabi billionaire and his employees at Eastlands the chance to persuade Kaka to move to the Premier League.</p>
              <p>It may even involve a reception at the Sheik's £8billion Royal Palace.</p>
              <p>Though the Brazilian superstar was quick to express his desire to remain at the San Siro yesterday, insisting he would like 'to grow old in Milan', his club are keen on the transfer and on Wednesday night they were waiting for Kaka's father and chief adviser, Bosco, to return from a holiday in Brazil for talks.</p>
              <p>City remain confident that the astonishing deal will go ahead and suggest Kaka may be in their team for the home league game against Newcastle on January 28.</p>
              <p>The club have already been in regular contact with Kaka's father, having recognised from the outset that he has been very influential at every stage of his son's career. Meanwhile, City's current superstar Robinho has been in regular phone contact with his compatriot and has told manager Mark Hughes that Kaka is ready to come to Manchester. </p>
              <p>City have been told that Kaka's sceptical comments on Wednesday were made in order to buy the player time. </p>
              <p>Having been sold on the idea by Sheik Mansour and his chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, Hughes has indicated he would play Kaka in a central role alongside Stephen Ireland, with Robinho on the left and Shaun Wright- Phillips on the right. </p>
              <p>Hughes also believes Blackburn striker Roque Santa Cruz and West Ham's Craig Bellamy will be at the club in time for the Newcastle game and may even arrive before Saturday's crucial clash with Wigan - this despite West Ham's rejection of an improved £10m offer for Bellamy because they value him at £15m.</p>
              <p>When Adriano Galliani, Milan's chief executive, meets Kaka Snr he will tell him the Serie A club have accepted City's offer for his son and that they are happy for the transfer to proceed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/15/article-1116585-030F4D47000005DC-480_468x459.jpg" alt="Sheikh Mansour" width="468" height="459"></p>
              <p><em>Sheikh Mansour is set to meet with AC Milan superstar Kaka.</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong>Already there has been talk in Italy of the demands Kaka would make of his suitors. He wants to meet Sheik Mansour to satisfy himself that his potential new employer is committed to making City the biggest football club in the world, while also insisting on an escape clause if they fail to secure Champions League football within two years.</strong></p>
              <p>City will be encouraged by the 26-year-old's stance but they may still need to be at their persuasive best to secure the services of the 2007 World Player of the Year.</p>
              <p>In an interview with the website owned by Milan owner and Italy prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, Kaka said: 'I want to grow old at Milan. My aim is to become at some point the captain of this team.'</p>
              <p>Kaka's spokesman, Diogo Kotscho, failed to offer City much encouragement in an interview with an Italian newspaper. 'Kaka wouldn't do anything based on money,' he said. 'He would never do something like Robinho, who, just to earn more, contented himself with a solution that was not a winning one.'</p>
              <p>But in an interview he then gave to Sky, Kotscho was more positive, saying: 'We now have to wait for negotiations between the two clubs. If that happens, it is not about money.</p>
              <p>'If Manchester City are to become one of the top teams in the world they have to have a project to be the best. At this time we can negotiate to join them.</p>
              <p>'If they have a good project, and can get other players, to become one of the top teams in the world - like AC Milan are - then we can negotiate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/01/14/article-0-030E8C9F000005DC-739_233x311.jpg" alt="Kaka" width="233" height="311"></p>
              <p><em>Kaka, really not for the money?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>'Kaka wants a professional challenge, he wants to play in the UEFA Champions League and he wants to become the best player in the world again.</strong></p>
              <p>'The Premier League is one of the best and he wants to play there. I don't know if it will be at this time or not. It is not impossible, but it will be difficult to reach a deal with AC Milan.'</p>
              <p>The deal was condemned by some leading figures in football. Sir Bobby Robson has labelled City's offer as 'ludicrous' and warned that it could 'cripple football'.</p>
              <p>'I am absolutely shocked by this, it is an unbelievable figure,' said Robson. 'It is absolutely ludicrous because nobody is worth that amount of money, no matter what he does.</p>
              <p>'I think bids like this will cripple football because it will carry on pushing the price of players up all over the world and there is not enough money in the game to cope with that.'</p>
              <p>The sentiment was echoed by former City manager Joe Royle, who questioned the morality of the potential deal. 'It's an incredible amount of money and you have to question the morality of it when the world is in a cash crisis,' he said.</p>

              week</strong></span></em>.</p>
              <p><em>Arabianbusiness.com</em>, who broke the story of the
              Manchester City takeover by Abu Dhabi United group in the summer, claim
              to have been told by a senior source that the deal is off.</p>
              <p>Hughes dismissed those reports from the UAE, telling a press conference: "I've
              seen these reports but you have to bear in mind that the people who are being
              given a platform to speak do not represent the owner (Sheikh Mansour) or
              (chairman) Khaldoon (Al Mubarak).</p>
              <p>"In my opinion they should not be given a platform to say what they have
              because in this instance it is completely untrue because negotiations are still
              taking place."</p>
              <p>He added: "It would be naive to think I have not been involved in discussions
              over this transfer. I have had meetings about it and have had an input.</p>
              <p>"It is impossible to say whether it will go through or not but we will let
              everyone know when there is something to say."</p>
              <p>A
              City delegation, including chief exc Garry Cook, were in Italy on
              Monday to discuss a move for the player. But Kaka himself said on
              Wednesday that he wanted to stay with Milan and "grow old" at the San
              Siro.</p>

              <p class="article">The Italian giants admitted on their official TV outlet the Milan Channel they had received the bid in a dramatic bulletin. And they even invited fans to express their views over whether the club should sell Kaka, confessing Milan’s board would take a couple of days to make a decision.</p>

              <p class="article">It all means the Brazilian playmaker’s sensational signing is practically in the bag. Milan Channel director Mauro Suma, regarded as the man who speaks for the club’s powerful vice-president Adriano Galliani, made the announcement yesterday evening.</p>
              <p class="article">Crucially, no Milan officials would comment — an admission they are ready to sell Kaka in the most astonishing deal in football history. But the club did offer fans the chance to take part in a ‘Deal Or No Deal’-style vote to decide whether Milan should let him go! </p>
              <p class="article">City officials are due to fly to Italy on Monday for meetings with Kaka and his father Bosco Leite. And last night City boss Mark Hughes insisted the Brazilian is worth every penny. </p>
              <p class="article">Hughes said: “Make no mistake, this is no scattergun approach to world stars of football. “We’ve made a measured, calculated and, of course, football decision that works for us. “That’s why we’re interested in a player of his quality because he’s the type we need to drive the club forward. </p>
              <p class="article">“I have no idea whether he will end up here. It is dependent on too many factors. But it has moved forward at a pace this week.” Sources close to the deeply-religious Kaka insist he will not be motivated purely by money and will take other factors into consideration. </p>
              <p class="article">He will want to see how a move to Manchester will fit into his lifestyle and also find something that will challenge him. Sparky hopes he will be excited by the vision of helping City become one of the world’s top clubs.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: “Everybody knows we’re at the beginning of a long journey and if people want to join us they’ll have a fantastic time in the coming years.</p>
              <p class="article">“That’s what we try to sell them if we get chance to speak to players. “It is not something that will happen overnight and we have to let people understand what we are trying to do and understand where this club will go in the next few years. </p>
              <p class="article">“Once they understand that and recognise the people driving it forward they will become excited by what we can offer.”</p>
