              <h1>Kaka Signs For Manchester City - Arabian Reports</h1>
              <p>Kaka has been linked with the richest club in the world for several
              months now, but the speculation of a possible move really began to heat
              up earlier this week.<br><br>'Arabian Business' now claim that a deal
              has been sealed, which will see Manchester City pay Milan around €112
              million, while Kaka will earn €380,000 per week.<br><br>This will smash
              Zinedine Zidane's transfer fee record from 2001 when he moved to Real
              Madrid from Juventus for €76m. Kaka also becomes the highest paid
              player in football history.<br><br>Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour
              is said to have told friends at 1500 CET that Kaka has signed for
              Manchester City, although there has been no official confirmation from
              the club, or from Milan for that matter.<br><br>Mansour took over the
              reigns at Eastlands in September, but he funded the €37m signing of
              Kaka's Brazilian compatriot Robinho on August 31 summer deadline day.<br><br>The
              Press Association claims that sources within Manchester City have
              denied that a deal has been done, although no official statement has
              been made.</p>

              <p><br>Somehow, althought i hope he flops, i don't think he'll flop at city judging by the way he tears premiership defences aparts. Guess we'll have to look at how he gells with the rest of the city team and i don't think they'll be too happy with his salary either</p>

              <h1>Milan players expect Kaka to stay</h1>

              <p><strong><span id="intelliTXT">AC Milan star Kaka has not
              played his last game for the club, according to his Rossoneri
              team-mates Clarence Seedorf and David Beckham.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>According to coach Carlo Ancelotti, Kaka still has a long-term future with the club.</p>
              <p>"Kaka has played lots of decisive games for Milan and I think he will figure in a lot more," he said.</p>
              <p>Kaka's team-mates also feel he will be sticking around, at least until the summer.</p>
              <p>"I would be surprised if he left," said Seedorf.</p>
              <p>"I don't think he has made up his mind yet, but it would surprise me if he left us in January."</p>
              <p>Beckham has only just joined the Serie A club and admits he
              would like to get to know Kaka a bit better over the next two months
              before he returns to the Los Angeles Galaxy.</p>
              <p>"He's a great lad and it's great to play in the team with him," he said.</p>
              <p>"He is one of the best players in the world and it is obvious that the best players are always the focus of speculation.</p>
              <p>"But he loves Italy and he loves Milan.</p>
              <p>I don't think he will leave."</p>
              <p>Milan have reportedly agreed to let Kaka hear what City have to offer, but Beckham still expects Kaka to follow his heart.</p>
              <p>Given the reception the Brazilian had on Saturday night, with
              65,000 voices calling on him to stay and pleading with the club not to
              sell him, Beckham is not too worried about City's advances.</p>
              <p>"I don't think anybody in the dressing room is thinking about how much money they can earn," said the England international.</p>
              <p>"It's about playing with the best team with the best players in the world and winning trophies and it's not always about money.</p>
              <p>"Riccardo doesn't need my advice.</p>
              <p>He will decide what he wants to do, but he loves Milan."</p>

              <p>As a Milan fan,&gt;100 million can buy 5-7 top players. The squad is in need of a overhaul.So why not? Pato and Gorcuff can play in Kaka's role as well.</p>
              <p>No one is indispensible.</p>

              <h1>How Manchester City can make Kaka deal pay for itself</h1>

              <p><strong>A football marketing guru insists Manchester City can make their record-shattering Kaka deal work. Our European expert, who has dealt with some of the biggest names in world sport, currently works for one of AC Milan's rivals and prefers to remain anonymous.</strong></p>
              <p>But he insists City can recoup their colossal outlay, saying: "The bigger the name and the bigger the price, the more massive the player is as a marketing instrument.</p>
              <p>"In the world of football every decade there is only room for one or two really world star players. "At the end of the 90s there was Brazil striker Ronaldo, with Nike, the Brazil team and moving from one big club to another. Then David Beckham got the marketing machine rolling.</p>
              <p>"Ronaldinho was close to following him, but did not become as big. "Now it is Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka set to take centre stage. You could say Lionel Messi too, but it also has to do with appeal, looks, the glamour of a player.</p>
              <p>"Kaka has all that. His price will be close to £250m. But really he is for free." So how can City balance the books on Kaka?</p>
              <p>The Euro marketing boss added: "He will get a five-year contract. That means City will have to get back £50m per year. "Their commercial and marketing firm will be able to get millions from friendlies all over the world.</p>
              <p>"At the moment City can probably earn £200,000 for a friendly. With Kaka they will get £2.5m in the Far East. "The sale of replica shirts around the globe will boom. "And with a star like Kaka they can justifiably put £10 on the price of every season ticket next year and expect a bumper sale.</p>
              <p>"They'll look to exploit TV rights and contracts to all South American commercial stations and to the Middle East, Far East and Australia. "I'd guess they'll take £5m from increases in sponsorship."</p>
              <p>City are close to announcing new kit and shirt sponsors. Puma are likely to be the kit manufacturers with Etihad, the United Arab Emirates airline, emerging as favourites to become shirt sponsors.</p>

              <p><br>No lah, Starhub already said their current contract until 2010... Hope 2010 onwards they don't make more excuses and come chop people again... They should open it up and make it more transparent and not used words like "Said to be worth so, so so..." But never tell us the actual figure or sum then come and chop us like carrot head...</p>

              </span></p><p class="ss-text-bold"><strong>AC Milan general
              manager Adriano Galliani has declared that if Kaka does join Manchester
              City they will not be on the look out for a replacement. </strong></p>
              <p>Milan are reportedly still considering City's offer
              and if the deal does go through the Italians will be able to take their
              pick of the top stars across the world.</p>
              <p>But despite a sale
              raising possible transfer funds to over £100million Galliani insists
              that the club will not be looking to spend.</p>
              <p>Arsenal's Emmanuel
              Adebayor and Chelsea's Michael Essien are some of the names to be
              linked with Milan should Kaka swap Serie A for the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"There are no replacements for Kaka, because he is unique," Galliani told <em>Sky Italia</em>.</p>
              <p>"Therefore if he leaves we will remain as we are. We don't need second hand players.</p>
              <p>"The club have debts and a good club should know how to settle them on their own, without running to their owners.</p>
              <p>"However, the future of Kaka is not already set in stone. We still have to evaluate, think hard and decide."</p>
