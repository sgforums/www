              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>SINGAPORE: He was such a die—hard fan of Liverpool Football Club that he wore the familiar bright red team jersey even in death.</strong></p>
              <p>The body of Teo Kok Hun, 33, was found hanging from a bathroom window by his wife on Oct 26, a day after the club had beat archrivals Manchester United.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo, a driver, was clad in the football jersey with a pair of bermuda shorts. A suicide note was found on the living room table.</p>
              <p>It was not clear why he took his life but in the note, Mr Teo apologised to his wife and parents and admitted to his gambling habit. Mr Teo was known to have also gambled on football.</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, a coroner’s inquiry heard that Mr Teo’s wife, a travel agent, had returned from work at 7.30pm that day.</p>
              <p>Noticing that the lights in the house were not switched on, she called Mr Teo’s mobile phone which rang inside the house. Thinking her husband was playing hide and seek with her — which he sometimes did — Mrs Teo started a hunt for her husband.</p>
              <p>She saw his figure in the shower of the master bedroom toilet and told him to come outside for dinner.</p>
              <p>When he did not budge, she pushed the shower door and saw that Mr Teo was hanging by his neck from a window.</p>
              <p>Mrs Teo immediately called her mother, then Mr Teo’s sister, who called for an ambulance.</p>
              <p>In her statement, Mrs Teo said she last saw her husband at 7 that morning, before she left for work. During the day, she spoke to him twice on the phone, and the couple made dinner arrangements.</p>
              <p>Mrs Teo added that they had just bought the house in January, and as a result, they were tight on money. Mr Teo had also taken no—pay leave from his job to find another job.</p>
              <p>Those who last spoke to Mr Teo detected no change in his mood.</p>
              <p>In a statement, one of his close friends said the night before his death, he had called Mr Teo while both of them were watching the football match. When Liverpool scored, Mr Teo even teased his friend.</p>
              <p>State Coroner Victor Yeo returned a verdict of suicide.</p>
