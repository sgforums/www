              <p>MADRID -- Espanyol captain and defender Dani
              Jarque, 26, has died from heart failure while on a pre-season
              tour of Italy, the Primera Liga club said on their website
              (www.rcdespanyol.com) on Saturday.</p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="300" align="right">
              <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td></td>
              </tr>
              </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>Jarque had trained in the morning but collapsed in his hotel
              in Coverciano while talking to a family member on the telephone
              in the early evening, Spanish media reports said.</p>
              <p>"The Espanyol player died due to a systolic heart failure,"
              the club said in a statement.</p>
              <p>"(Club doctor) Doctor Cervera tried CPR on the player and
              used a defibrillator but said it was not possible to
              resuscitate.</p>
              <p>"Within minutes, the first emergency ambulances arrived from
              Florence, and tried their defibrillators but again were unable
              to resuscitate."</p>
              <p>Medical services tried to revive Jarque for an hour before
              pronouncing the player dead, the club said.</p>
              <p>"Espanyol are distraught and wish to put themselves at the
              complete disposal of our captain's family," they added.</p>
              <p>Spanish media reported the club were cutting short their
              Italian tour, where they had been due to play friendlies against
              Bologna and Livorno in the coming days, and were returning to
              Barcelona on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Jarque came up through the youth ranks at Espanyol, helping
              them win the King's Cup in 2006 and to reach to UEFA Cup final
              in 2007, and had just been made captain of the club for the new
              season.</p>
              <p>Jarque's death comes nearly two years after that of Sevilla
              midfielder Antonio Puerta who died on Aug. 28,
              2007, three days after collapsing during a Primera Liga
              match against Getafe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I still remember him when Juande Ramos was thinking of bringing him to Spurs a sad loss.</p>

              <p>He was in his hotel, players can't possibly be scrutinized 24/7. Anyway, if you've gotta go... you've gotta go.</p>
