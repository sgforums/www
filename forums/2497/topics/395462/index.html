              <h2>The deadline set by the Rhone Group for Liverpool to accept a £110 million offer to take a 40 per cent stake in the Anfield club expires on Monday, with the only concrete proposal received by current owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett in their search for fresh investment likely to be effectively rejected.</h2>

              <p><strong>Rhone became the first suitor to show their hand when the New York-based fund management firm, run by billionaires Robert Agostinelli and Steven Langman, presented their offer to Liverpool in the early hours of March 13.</strong></p>
              <p>It is believed they informed the club they expected to discover whether their bid had been successful by April 5.</p>
              <p>There has been no further contact between the parties and <em>Telegraph Sport </em>understands that Rhone are not prepared to extend that deadline.</p>
              <p>Though it is believed Rhone's offer met Liverpool's valuation, it is thought the level of control they hoped to acquire for their stake as well as the nature of their investment has proved a stumbling block. Hicks is believed to be particularly resistant to seeing his stake being decreased.</p>
              <p>Rafael Benítez, the Liverpool manager, had met with representatives of the group to discuss their plans for the club and it is believed he had kept senior players, including Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres – who has been unequivocal in his demands for Liverpool's owners to back Benítez in the transfer market this summer – abridged of developments.</p>
              <p>That Rhone's deadline – barring an unexpected and unlikely turnaround in the next 24 hours – will pass with no progress made will no doubt come as a blow to those attracted by the group's promise of a £25 million infusion of funds for transfers, but it is far from the only cause for concern for a club whose immediate future remains clouded.</p>
              <p>On the pitch, Liverpool know they must beat Birmingham at St Andrews on Sunday to maintain the pressure on Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City in the race to qualify for next season's Champions League. Off it, sadly, matters are far more complicated.</p>
              <p>The Royal Bank of Scotland, Liverpool's bankers, have informed Hicks and Gillett that they must reduce their £237 million debt burden by £100 million by July if they are to be granted a deal to refinance their loans.</p>
              <p>Christian Purslow, Liverpool's managing director and the man charged with securing a cash infusion to reduce the debt, has consistently identified Easter as the time by which he "hoped" to have a deal agreed with an outside investor to bring an end to the stagnancy induced at Anfield by the current, unpopular regime and to enable work to begin again on the long-awaited new stadium on Stanley Park.</p>
              <p>Though sources at the club insist that was more guideline than deadline, that the holiday period will pass with Liverpool no closer to securing their financial future will hardly inspire confidence for Benítez's squad or the club's fans.</p>
              <p>Sources at Anfield, though, remain confident of attracting the required investment "in good time" for the club's loans to be refinanced.</p>
              <p>As many as "six or seven" serious investors were believed to be looking at matching or bettering Rhone's offer three weeks ago and noises emanating from the club suggest that as many as two of those are expected to materialise into firm proposals.</p>
              <p>What is not in doubt, though, is that Liverpool are reaching their end game.</p>
              <p>In the next three months, Hicks and Gillett's tenure will almost certainly reach an end, at least in its present form. More straightforwardly, defeat at Birminghamon Sunday and against Benfica in the Europa League second leg on Thursday, and much the same may be said of Benítez.</p>

              <h3>LIVERPOOL will hit the £150million jackpot in a mega new shirt manufacturers' deal with adidas. </h3>
              <p>The sports giants are to offer the Reds a massive contract extension to rival Manchester United's record-breaking deal with Nike. </p>
              <p>Liverpool's current £12m-a-season deal with adidas has two years to run but they have already contacted the club to discuss another TEN years. </p>
              <p>They are desperate to reaffirm their commitment to the Reds who, alongside United, blow their Premier League rivals out of the water when it comes to worldwide shirt sales. </p>
              <p>adidas are convinced investment is on its way to Anfield and a new board will soon be in place following the £110m debt reduction from the Rhone Group. </p>
              <p>They have told Kop MD Christian Purslow they want to start negotiations to renew terms at the earliest opportunity. </p>
              <p>adidas also believe star names including Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard will stay beyond this summer, so are moving swiftly to protect their lucrative partnership. </p>
              <p>The Reds' revamped commercial team will consider all their options as they look to maximise the club's money-making potential, but they know their relationship with adidas reflects Liverpool's elite status. </p>
              <p>United signed a £300m deal with Nike for 13 years in November 2000 - but that included their entire merchandising rights. </p>
              <p>Liverpool will be looking to better Chelsea's 10-year deal with adidas which was worth £100m in 2005. They will want a minimum of £15m a year.</p>

              <p>New York's Rhone Group 
              are the only party whose interest in injecting £100 million to bring 
              down the club's debt in return for a stake of up to 40 per cent has been
               made public.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Talk is cheap: Steven Gerrard warns team-mates</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Liverpool
               appear to have snubbed the first firm offer of new investment after it 
              emerged they had not responded to the Rhone Group’s £110million proposal
               as last night’s midnight deadline loomed.</p>
              <p>But the private equity 
              firm are thought to be open to further discussions if Liverpool’s 
              American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett decide they want to talk in
               future.</p>
              <p>Two other potential investors are said to be interested 
              but are set to wait until the end of the season, when Liverpool’s 
              financial situation will be made clearer.</p>
              <p>Although the Rhone 
              Group’s offer was for a 40 per cent share of the club, it is believed 
              that was dependent on Rafael Benitez’s side being in the Champions 
              League — something that looks increasingly unlikely.</p>
              <p>Steven 
              Gerrard warned his team-mates yesterday that talk of competing for 
              fourth place is meaningless unless they can back it up on the pitch.</p>
              <p>Gerrard’s
               look of disbelief when Benitez replaced top scorer Fernando Torres 
              after 65 minutes of Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Birmingham said everything 
              about the frustration in the camp. The Liverpool manager said Torres was
               exhausted, but it raised suspicions Benitez may be pinning his hopes on
               Europa League success and Thursday’s return leg against Benfica as the 
              best way to appease supporters.</p>
              <p>Gerrard said: ‘It’s all right 
              saying we’ll be OK if we go and win our last five games, but we have to 
              go out on the pitch and win them rather than talk about it.</p>
              <p>‘We 
              had to take maximum points against Birmingham. It’s going to be really 
              difficult now.</p>
              <p>‘But what you notice is the race for fourth place 
              seems to change from week to week. You have to look at the teams above 
              us, they’re the favourites and we’re the underdogs at the moment.’</p>
