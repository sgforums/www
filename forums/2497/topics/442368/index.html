              <p>Terry was cautioned by ref Lee Mason on Saturday for time-wasting at a throw-in in the last minute of the game. It was his fifth booking of the season which brings a ban, ruling the Blues' captain out of tomorrow's quarter-final tie at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>But smiling Chelsea boss AVB insisted it wasn't a cynical, pre-planned act.</p>
              <p>He explained: "Terry got a yellow card from a throw-in. Ashley Cole was looking for the best options and couldn't find any so Terry's out on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>"It wasn't a deliberate yellow card as they're not allowed by UEFA.</p>
              <p>"Frank Lampard was also on four yellow cards and we didn't force it."</p>
              <p>Terry will now be free to lead Chelsea into a hectic December programme which includes vital games against Man City, Spurs and Newcastle United.</p>

              <p>The Reds condemned their Carling Cup opponents to back-to-back Premier League home defeats when <span style="color: #000000;">Glen Johnson netted a late winner at Stamford Bridge earlier this month</span><span style="color: #000000;">. </span></p>
              <p>Torres was left kicking his heels on the bench until the final six minutes and has become little more than a bit-part player during Chelsea's recent slump.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But Saturday's 3-0 win over Wolves</span> went some way to restoring the Blues' battered pride and boss Andre Villas-Boas is expected to turn to the Spaniard to shoot down his former club tomorrow night.</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas is likely to make a handful of other changes with midfielder Josh McEachran, left-back Ryan Bertrand and central defender Alex in the running to feature.</p>
              <p>Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish has threatened to field a youthful side due to the lack of time between his side's clash with league leaders Manchester City and this cup tie.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Dalglish's men impressed in a 1-1 draw with City</span> yesterday but the Scot is far from impressed with the fact only 48 hours will have passed before they return to action.</p>
              <p>He has warned the Liverpool faithful not to expect a strong line-up and even urged them not to make the long journey to London.</p>
              <p>But the wily Scot could simply be indulging in some mind games with Villas-Boas as the Carling Cup arguably represents Liverpool's best chance of winning some silverware this season.</p>
              <p>Regardless of who takes to the pitch, this encounter promises to be a fiery affair due to the intense rivalry which has built between the clubs in recent years.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">MAXI RODRIGUEZ scored again at Stamford Bridge as Liverpool heaped more pressure on Andre Villas-Boas.</h2>
              <p>Argy winger Rodriguez opened the scoring for the Reds — just as he did in the league nine days ago — to help fire Kenny Dalglish's side into the Carling Cup last four.</p>
              </div>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
              </span></p><p>Andy Carroll missed a first-half penalty but an emotional Craig Bellamy inspired Liverpool in the second half, just days after sitting out the draw with Manchester City following the death of Gary Speed.</p>
              <p>Rodriguez finished a Bellamy cross after 58 minutes, before a fine free-kick from the Welsh wizard found Martin Kelly who headed in for his first senior goal.</p>
              <p>A much-changed Chelsea were never at the races and AVB's men slumped to their fifth defeat in just nine games and their third loss in four.</p>
              <p>Liverpool also made seven changes from the side that hosted City on Sunday and the victory will come as huge boost to Dalglish after earlier blasting the FA's scheduling of the game.</p>
              <p>Multi-million pound January signings Fernando Torres and Carroll lined up against each other after both warmed the bench in the league clash earlier this month.</p>
              <p>And there were starts for old heads Frank Lampard and Jamie Carragher as both teams mixed youth with experience.</p>
              <p>Prior to kick-off the sides lined up for a heart-felt minute's applause following the tragic death of Speed, with his former Welsh team-mate Bellamy shedding a tear.</p>
              <p>The opening half was dominated by referee Phil Dowd and Chelsea could have had a penalty just two minutes into the game.</p>
              <p>David Luiz appeared to be caught by the knee of Sebastian Coates as he rounded the Uruguayan in the box but only succeeded in being booked by Dowd for a dive.</p>
              <p>Dowd and Luiz were back in the thick of action just minutes later at the other end as the Brazilian defender was lucky to get away with a shove on Carroll after a Jose Enrique cross.</p>
              <p>But the referee did finally point to the spot in the 22nd minute in equally controversial circumstances.</p>
              <p>Alex clearly handled the ball under pressure from Carroll but Dowd waved away Liverpool's appeals until fierce protests from the England striker.</p>
              <p>Dowd eventually changed his mind but Carroll did nothing for his fragile confidence as he smashed his penalty straight at Chelsea keeper Ross Turnbull.</p>
              <p>Chelsea finally found their way into the game without threatening but were dealt a blow when their young England starlet Josh McEachran limped off before half time.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>And there was still time for another Dowd blunder in the opening period when he booked Ryan Bertrand for a challenge on Jordan Henderson when it was Romelu Lukaku who could have seen red for a horrible foul.</p>
              <p>The Blues were inches away from taking the lead early on in the second half as Florent Malouda hit the bar before Coates cleared Luiz's follow-up off the line.</p>
              <p>And just minutes later it was Dalglish's men who broke the deadlock as Henderson found Bellamy on the right hand side, who timed his run perfectly to play in Rodriguez to comfortably finish.</p>
              <p>Liverpool's large and noisy travelling contingent were back on their feet five minutes later as they grabbed a second.</p>
              <p>Once more Bellamy supplied the ammunition — this time from a free-kick — and England Under-21 full-back Kelly was given all the time he needed to nod home.</p>
              <p>The only blow for Liverpool came when instrumental midfielder Lucas was carried off after 70 minutes, but that could not stop the joy of visiting fans who taunted Villas-Boas with chants of "you're getting sacked in the morning".</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Jamie Carragher is trying to take the Carling Cup one game at a time but the Liverpool veteran cannot help having one eye on a Wembley final. <br></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Carragher played as the Reds won 2-0 at Chelsea to book their place in the last four with Maxi Rodriguez and Martin Kelly grabbing the goals. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Defender Carragher has been at Wembley on international duty but has never turned out for his club at the national stadium. <br></span></p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div id="ext-gen1991" class="moduleHalf"> </div>
              <div class="moduleHalf"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Carragher said: 'There is a still a semi-final to play over two legs and there are some massive sides in there so it is going to be very tough. We'll take the semi-final very seriously.</span></div>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">I've played at Wembley once or twice for England but I've never done it for Liverpool. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I'd love to do that but when we have got to cup finals they have been in Cardiff so I've never been there with Liverpool.'</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">At 33, Carragher has played alongside a succession of quality defenders over the years and 21-year-old right-back Kelly certainly impressed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'Kelly is a young lad coming through, he's still learning the game,' said Carragher. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'He can learn off Glen Johnson, England's right-back. But hopefully in the future Martin Kelly will be in that position himself and he showed that against Chelsea.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Kelly nodded home Craig Bellamy's free-kick for Liverpool's second goal. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The England Under 21 international came through the ranks at Anfield and was delighted to open his account. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">He said: 'I was made up with the goal and it was a long time coming getting my first one for Liverpool. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'It was a great cross from Craig and I managed to get a free header. We were attacking the end with all the away supporters and it was brilliant seeing all their emotions as they celebrated. It's fantastic to get a goal for such a big club. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'I scored a couple of goals for England Under 21s recently and it was great to score against Chelsea and help us reach the semi-final of the Carling Cup. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We have beaten Chelsea twice now in the space of a few weeks and it was a great team effort. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">'We definitely deserved the win. With the possession we had in the first half we knew the goal was coming and we are delighted to get the victory.'</span></p>
