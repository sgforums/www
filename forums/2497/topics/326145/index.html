              <h2>New Tottenham Hotspur signing David Bentley has expressed his
              desire to score against the side with which he started his career,
              their bitter rivals Arsenal.</h2>
              <p>Bentley, a self-confessed Spurs fan, came through Arsenal's youth
              system before being sold to Blackburn Rovers, where he then made his
              name and became a recognised England international.<br><br>He made his
              intentions clear at the end of this summer as he looked to seal a move
              away from Ewood Park to further his career, with Liverpool initially
              thought to be interested, but Spurs the only club the 23-year-old had
              his eye on.<br><br>A deal was finalised last week, with Arsenal thought
              to have netted over £7 million from the deal due to a sell-on fee
              received from Blackburn, Bentley has since scored on his Spurs debut in
              a friendly against Celtic and already looking ahead.<br><br>"I can't
              wait to run out at Arsenal wearing a Spurs shirt," revealed the winger.
              "In fact, I've not been sleeping at the moment, just thinking about
              running out there.<br><br>"I've always wanted to play in a North London derby. It will brilliant. I know it's coming up on October 29.<br><br>"What I'd love to do is go there and score the winner against them. That would be excellent.<br><br>"I know I'll cop a bit of abuse from their fans, but that's what people go and watch football for. I'll enjoy that.<br><br>"You
              don't want a boring life as a footballer. You want it to be
              entertaining and things like that will inspire me. If you don't get a
              buzz off that, well..."<br><br>As a Tottenham fan, the England
              international did his utmost to explain how he ended up joining the
              Arsenal youth ranks at the age of 13. "You know how it works - life
              isn't perfect all the time," he said.<br><br>"I played for the Arse, as
              you call it. I grew up playing with a lot of talented kids. But my
              heart is at Tottenham. I'm a Tottenham boy, I'm happy.<br><br>"I hope Spurs are closing the gap on Arsenal. I want to be a part of that. Only performances on the pitch will achieve it.<br><br>"This club is spending money. Arsenal also have a good team. We'll see who comes out on top."</p>
