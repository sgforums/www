The Arsenal boss met Ferran Soriano, the Spanish clubÂ’s financial director, in Paris this week for preliminary discussions, according to reports in The Times. </strong><br><br>Wenger wants to sign Samuel EtoÂ’o as part of the deal, but Barca are reluctant to allow the Cameroon striker to leave despite his problems at the club this season. EtoÂ’o has fallen out with Frank Rijkaard, the coach, and Ronaldinho, his team-mate, but this week spoke of his desire to stay at the Nou Camp and play alongside Henry, 29, whose arrival would represent a greater threat to the Brazil forward.<br><br>EtoÂ’o is a close friend of Henry and the pair have spoken recently about the prospect of forming a new strike partnership. Even if Barcelona were willing to release EtoÂ’o in order to secure HenryÂ’s services, they would demand at least Â£10 million from Arsenal to complete the deal. AC Milan are also interested in Henry, but Barcelona would be his preferred destination.<br><br>Barcelona are expected to make a preliminary offer next week of Â£15 million and with ArsenalÂ’s asking price Â£20 million, the parties are not too far apart. The negotiation of HenryÂ’s personal terms may not prolong the process as Barcelona have prepared a three-year contract offer worth Â£7 million a year with an option for a further 12 months.<br><br>Henry was close to joining Barcelona last summer after playing in the 2-1 Champions League final defeat against them. Henry joined Arsenal in 1999 and although he has been the centre of many transfer rumours, he has never publicly stated he will leave the club.</div>

Henry is considered as a talismanic player in Arsenal, and is one of those who can really score. Robin van Persie is also a budding star.<br><br>We all know what can happen to Arsenal if Henry and RVP are out of the way; there is a good chance Arsenal won't get to score at all, or have a low scoring ratio when compared to the other top clubs.<br><br>Wenger won't be allowing Henry to go, and I don't think Henry will want to leave yet anyway.<br><br>I think people should have the habit of stating and linking their source when posting articles.
