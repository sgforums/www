              <h1 class="storyTitle" style="margin-bottom: 0pt; font-size: 2.8em;">Chelsea confirm assistant Clarke's resignation</h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chelsea have confirmed that assistant manager Steve Clarke has handed in his
              resignation.</p>
              <div class="sp-inlinePhoto"><img src="http://soccernet-assets.espn.go.com/design05/images/JonMC/April2007/steve-clarke-205.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="205" height="345">

              <p class="photoDesc">Steve Clarke was happier under Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The
              former Scotland defender reportedly handed in the request on Thursday
              night and it could paves the way for a move to West Ham United, where
              he could work in a similar capacity under Gianfranco Zola, the new
              manager.</p>
              <p>A Chelsea spokesman said: ''Chelsea can confirm that West Ham have made an
              approach with regards to talking to Steve Clarke.</p>
              <p>''They have not been given permission to talk to him.</p>
              <p>''Steve Clarke has tendered his resignation as assistant first team coach. We
              have not accepted his resignation. Talks are continuing.''</p>
              <p>His
              appointment is expected to be announced in the next few days, once the
              club have agreed a severance package with Chelsea. Although the West
              London club are demanding £1.2 million in compensation because Clarke
              has two years left to run on his contract.</p>
              <p>Clarke's decision
              comes as something of a shock given that he has ties that go back over
              20 years with the club, but after four years as No 2 at Stamford Bridge
              it became clear that he would not fit in with the Luiz Felipe Scolari
              regime.</p>
              <p>It is understood that Clarke has been effectively
              sidelined since Scolari was appointed in the summer, with the Brazilian
              relying almost entirely on Darlan Schneider, his other assistant, whom
              he brought with him from Portugal.</p>
              <p>Despite taking what many
              have seen as a backward step, Clarke is said to be relishing the
              opportunity of linking up again with Zola, with whom he played for two
              years at Chelsea.</p>

              <p>Chelsea is looking worse and worse... First Robinho rejected to join them then gone to City... Then now even their long serving No 2 would rather go to West Ham to be their No 2 than to stay back...</p>
              <p>This is surprising to me... cos its not as tho he is going there to be their No 1 at least that is still understandable... But go there to be their No 2... its like he rather take a step down and go to a lower club to be their No 2 than to stay at Chelsea...</p>
              <p>weird...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea </span>coach Steve Clarke has quit to join Gianfranco Zola at <span style="color: #003580;">West Ham</span>, sparking a bitter compensation battle between the rival clubs. Stamford Bridge officials today insisted they had not given permission for the Hammers to speak to the Scot and are refusing to accept his resignation. But Clarke is determined to cut his ties with the club, despite a last-gasp bid by Luiz Felipe Scolari to persuade him to stay.</strong></p>
              <p>The Chelsea manager said: 'Yesterday I invited Steve to my house to discuss the situation with West Ham and his project for his life. 'I open the door for Steve and when I listened to his project I told him that I am the coach to open more doors for you to become a manager in England. 'I said I would give him more responsibility in my team and in Chelsea. I also said that I would let everyone know that Steve wants to fly alone in the future.</p>
              <p>'I don't know what's happened since I met with him but I arrived today to find out he has resigned. Sometimes we think our best direction is one way when it is another. I don't agree with his decision.'</p>
              <p>Talks between the two clubs over compensation broke down yesterday with no settlement reached. Chelsea are thought to be demanding about £1.5m for the 45-year-old, who has two years left on his contract.</p>
              <p>A Chelsea spokesman said: 'We can confirm that West Ham have made an approach with regards to talking to Steve Clarke. They have not been given permission to talk to him. 'Steve has tendered his resignation as assistant first-team coach. We have not accepted his resignation. Talks are continuing.'</p>
              <p>Clarke has spent 20 years at the club as a player and coach and is a popular figure with the fans. However, he became unsettled under Scolari's predecessor Avram Grant and also clashed with former assistant Henk Ten Cate.</p>
              <p>Zola, a former team-mate of Clarke, started his new role at Upton Park yesterday and immediately moved to recruit him as No2. A compensation claim is the last thing West Ham need given the financial problems facing the club following the collapse of shirt sponsor XL.</p>
              <p>Kevin Keen, the current reserve team coach, will take charge of the team at West Brom tomorrow — with 42-year-old Zola taking control of first-team affairs next week.</p>
              <p>Alongside Clarke, Zola will have former Chelsea, Monaco and Juventus fitness coach Antonio Pintus working with the team.</p>
