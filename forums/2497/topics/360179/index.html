              <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo Takes Coaching Tips From Usain Bolt At Manchester United</h1>

              <h2>The sprinter claims that he can help the Portuguese powerhouse stay on his feet a little longer.</h2>
              <p>Cristiano Ronaldo
              has been taking some coaching advice from Jamaican Olympic sprinter
              Usain Bolt, the multiple gold-medallist who will be cheering on the Manchester United team from the stands when they face Arsenal at Old Trafford tomorrow.<br><br>United
              need merely a point from their final two games to make sure of their
              18th English league title in total, and 11th since the inception of the
              Premier League in 1992. And Bolt, who took <span class="kLink" style="text-decoration: underline ! important; position: static;"><span style="color: #0464d1;"><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: 1px solid #0464d1; color: #0464d1 ! important; font-family: Verdana,Arial; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static; background-color: transparent;">gold</span></span></span> in both the 100 and 200 metres at the Beijing Olympics, becoming a hero
              to his nation in the process, is keen to enjoy what is likely to be a
              celebratory occasion against the Gunners.<br><br>"I want to run on the pitch and score in the net if they let me," he told <em>Four-Four-Two</em> magazine.<br><br>"It will be something for me to have pictures of. Who knows, maybe I can be a Man U player in the future."<br><br>Bolt
              was also present during United's Friday training session, and claims to
              have given dynamic forward Cristiano Ronaldo some advice about altering
              his running style in order to avoid being knocked to the ground so
              easily.<br><br>"I explained to him a few things about when he is
              running and reaches top speed he starts to tip over, he always does
              that," the athlete added.<br><br>"I let him know if he brings his foot
              on the centre of gravity, or even in front of him, it will be much
              easier. He will be much better and he will go faster for longer.<br><br>"Because he's so fast they keep pushing him around, he needs to be more aggressive, [then] they will leave him alone."</p>

              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p class="heading"> </p>
              <p><strong>It took Usain Bolt 9.69sec to put himself on sport’s most precarious pedestal, but he breezed into Manchester yesterday with a vow not to become one of athletics’ fall guys. He then explained how he could prevent Cristiano Ronaldo from continuing to be the football version.</strong></p>
              <p>The Jamaican megastar turned speed coach as he reflected on his meeting with Ronaldo at Manchester United’s training ground. “He was asking me about it and I told him the reason why he has problems,” Bolt said, thus ending a perennial debate. “When he gets to top speed he tips over, so I told him to get his foot on the centre of gravity and he will stay upright and go faster for longer distances.”</p>
              <p>The alchemic powers of the man who “blew the world’s mind” in winning three gold medals at the Olympic Games in Beijing last summer evidently have no end. “I told him he should be rougher, too,” Bolt said of his pep talk. “They really pick on him because he’s very skilful. I told him to take a few more yellow cards. He needs to be tougher because he’s so soft and that’s why they keep pushing him around. Ronaldinho had the same problem, but he got more aggressive and so they stopped.”</p>
