              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword"> Liverpool right-back Glen Johnson could be investigated by police after allegations of an assault outside a west London nightclub at the weekend.<br><br><em>The Liverpool Daily Post</em> reports that a man made the allegation against the Reds' star in a
              police station in the capital on Sunday, apparently claiming that
              Johnson had assaulted him outside the Movida club in Argyll Street at
              around 4am that day.<br><br>The victim claimed to have been punched. He apparently suffered very minor injuries to his arm, chest and face.<br><br>Police
              have reportedly confirmed that they will be looking closely into the
              incident before deciding whether there are sufficient grounds for
              charges to be brought.<br><br>"There have been no arrests," a Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed.<br><br>Johnson had been in the south of England following the Reds' disappointing defeat at Portsmouth on Saturday.</span></p>

              <p>This guy can attack but cannot defend one... I feel he is one more of Rafa's poor judgement purchased... Cost almost as much as Torres and paid even more than anyone in the Pool squad but he is no "star player" for them...</p>
              <p>I still feel a lot is down to Rafa rather than owners or players fault... But Rafa has good entertainment value, after mourinho he is number 1 for making news...</p>

              <h1>REVEALED: Liverpool handed Glen Johnson £139,000-a-week deal to beat off competition from Chelsea<br></h1>

              </div>
              <p>It has emerged that Liverpool are paying <span class="inline-link">Glen Johnson</span> a staggering £139,000 a week.</p>
              <p>Eyebrows were raised when the Reds splashed out £17million on the Portsmouth right-back this summer but his salary will leave fans gobsmacked.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/08/26/article-1209134-061D3018000005DC-395_468x286.jpg" alt="Glen Johnson" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>In the money: Glen Johnson signed a bumper contract at Liverpool</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>The sum must make him the best paid full back in the world - even after Chelsea defender <span class="inline-link">Ashley Cole</span> agreed a new £120,000-a-week deal to stay
                  at Stamford Bridge.</p>
              <p>Spiralling wages in the Barclays Premier League have reached such a crazy level that <span class="inline-link">Liverpool</span>, so desperate to ensure Chelsea would not beat them for the signature of Johnson, were forced to offer a huge contract.</p>

              <p>Johnson is the most overly priced players of recent years... 17 million for him is an insane amount of money... wages of 139000 pounds per week is simply out of this world.. no wonder liverpool is struggling this season...</p>
              <p>What has johnson done for liverpool?? Against arsenal, yes an OWN goal, followed by some poor defending against arshavin that lead to the second goal. Against portsmouth, johnson gifted another goal by heading directly into the path of the striker, thus allowing portsmouth to score.</p>
              <p>Is this wat a top class player would do? Seriously, johnson is not worth 17 million, at most i think he is only worth 6-7 million.</p>
              <p>Simply saying, Rafa benitez fails in most of his transfer dealings except for the torres one. Even aqualiani is nt worth 20 million at most, he is only worth 10-11 million dollars.</p>
              <p>Bad, simply bad!! Learn from wenger, when you have limitd funds and still able to make good purchases..</p>

              <p>Can escape the law one la, Gerrard managed to do it right? Marlon King is the suay one probably because he is not a top player, not famous and not an icon.</p>
              <p>Honestly speaking, i was amazed when Liverpool bought in Johnson this season. I thought they will spend on a striker since Keane left but they did not, sold off Aberloa, Alonso, Keane, bought Johnson, promote Lucas and played Ngog.</p>
              <p>Benitez has lost his plot, or maybe he's plotting something bigger? Like jump ship to the  Santiago Bernabéu?</p>

              <p>Liverpool paid only 10m pounds for Glen Johnson with 7m still owed to down from Portsmouth after the sale of Peter Crouch.</p>
              <p>And Manyzer, I would agree that 139k a week is overpaying but you must be having a laugh. Johnson worth 6-7m? He fits easily in the top right-backs in the this world and only Maicon is better than him imo. Take a macro view, he might have been poor the last few games but look at his performances in the first few games. He was absolutely phenomenal. Benitez should learn from Wenger? Had N'gog been in Arsenal, the media would have been lauding Wenger for spotting a gem.</p>

              <p>I find your reason you gave is a bit weird... Its like you are saying if Pool didn't bought him from Portsmouth, they are also ready to write off the $7m Portsmouths owe them like that... lol</p>
              <p>I can understand that he is worth more given his age and being English but if you see the skill level he is on, I think $10m is a more likely figure to me... Arsenal just bought Vermaelen for a lot lesser and I think many will agree he is a good and worthy purchased by Wenger...</p>
              <p>And I also find it very hard to belief that only Maicon is better than him in this world... I think just in the premiership alone, I can find a few others in my opinion are better or on level terms with him...</p>
              <p>I understand some people says and thinks he is very good going forward... But my personally opinion of a good defender is... First, and the most important to be a good defender is, you must be able to defend well... and not average or above average kind but good. And once you are well versed in this area then get to the attacking aspect of it... Cos teams don't lose matches if a defender can't attack, but teams do usually lose matches if your defender cannot defend well... Leave the attacking part to the strikers first...</p>
              <p>Anyway, I also think there are a number of right-backs in the premiership who are better or level with him. Those like... <span style="color: #000000;">Bacary Sagna, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Luke Young, </span><span style="color: #000000;">Corluka and </span><span style="color: #000000;">Micah Richards... I think the no nonsense Sagna is a much better right-back than Johnson... And Micah Richards would be better value too. And I also wouldn't trade Rafael of United for him... At least to me that is...</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I meant the attacking part of his play. His defending is really questionable. While he has been an improvement from the stagnant Arbeloa, more goals have leaked in as a result. A good defender must be able to defend well. That I agree. But in Liverpool's case, because we play two holding midfielders, the fullbacks have to play an attacking role. Luke Young and Corluka are definitely not better. Bacary Sagna and Micah Richards would be a better call. They might not be better in attack than Johnson but they certainly offer more in defence. This makes them overall better players. Good call. haha.</p></div>

              <p>true. johnson can attack, set up play, run down the flanks dangerously.<br>but whats the use if he cant defend well at all.<br>he is overrated because he plays for england as a first choice right back.<br><br>in the EPL alone, currently the best would be Sagna. followed by Corluka, Ivanovic, L.Young, Richards. even Eboue, who can attack well, also can defend well, just that his occasional nonsense give him 2nd choice right back place.</p>
              <p>Bundesliga's Lahm is also a lot better(IMO best in the world). La Liga you have got Ramos and Alves. all world class.</p>
              <p>one more point to note. what happen to babel? what did RB do..</p>

              <p>Rafa seems to have a problem with Babel, maybe with his attitude. This guy performed well in his first season but slowly fizzed out because of the lack of opportunities. A lot of fans are questioning his committment because he seems really into hip hop music as well.</p>
              <p>But like others, I just cant understand why Rafa seems to always leave Babel on the bench. Kuyt has been shit and will always be shit but this guy is always the first on Benitez's teamsheet. Even Riera has been shit and Benitez chose to go with 18 year old Nathan Ecclestone instead of giving Babel some opportunities.</p>
