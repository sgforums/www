              â€¢ Â£350m loan to be refinanced after 24 July deadline
              â€¢ Hicks reported to be 'very relaxed' and 'confident'
              .
              .
              
              *Liverpool's beleaguered co-owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, look set to Â­refinance their Â£350m loan with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia from next month's deadline, the Â­Guardian has learned. The extension could cost up to Â£3.5m for the arrangement fee, with Â­interest payments â€“ approximately 4% above the banking rate â€“ similar to the terms on their current facility.*
              
              It was announced last week that Hicks' and Gillett's parent company, Kop Â­Football (Holdings) Limited, suffered a Â£42.6m loss for the year ending July 2008 despite a record turnover of Â£164.2m. A Liverpool supporters group, Spirit of Shankly, has launched a protest campaign to dissuade RBS from extending the loan beyond the 24 July deadline.
              
              However, the two banks are willing to extend their loan, given rising income at a club who finished second in the Premier League last season, qualifying for the lucrative Champions League for a Â­seventh season in a row. "Banks won't want to jeopardise growth through Â­taking control," a source close to the situation said.
              
              Facing multi-billion pound losses, banks are pushing unprofitable companies into insolvency or demanding Â­control through a debt-for-equity swap. In Spain the local savings bank Bancaja has Â­practically taken control of Valencia, who have about Â£500m of debt. However, the source added: "It doesn't make sense to take control of a business that's performing well; this approach could be applicable to Liverpool."
              
              The refinancing deal will buy Hicks and Gillett time as they attempt to avoid having to sell Liverpool, although their prospects of borrowing a further Â£400m to build a new stadium on Stanley Park have receded. Last week's accounts included a warning from the accountants, KPMG, that there would be "significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern" without an extension to the Â£350m loan. A source close to Hicks responded that the Texan was "very relaxed" and "confident".
              
              Liverpool's manager, Rafael BenÃ­tez, meanwhile, has Â­confirmed that he has funds to enhance his squad this summer. "I won't talk about any figures and I can't say how much we have," he said. "Clearly we don't have too much to spend but I think we have enough money to add the one or two players that we need."
