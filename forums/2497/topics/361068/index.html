As revealed by SunSport, Ancelotti is set to quit AC Milan and take charge of the Blues this summer. But Kaka, previously a target for Manchester City, has no intention of leaving the San Siro.</h2>
              <p class="article">The Brazilian said: "I am tied to the club and, of course, to the coach. "But I have a contract through 2013 with Milan and not with Ancelotti.</p>
              <p class="article">"Right now my contract speaks clearly and with regards to any transfer news related to me it will be the club that speaks."</p>
              <p class="article">Kaka turned down a record-breaking move to City in January. And he is determined to stay in Serie A - despite Real Madrid and Chelsea reportedly chasing his signature.</p>
              <p class="article">The striker added: "Manchester City's offer in January was real. "But if in the future the club decides to evaluate other offers for me, it will be the club to announce it.</p>
              <p class="article">"If now they don't say anything it must be that there are no offers. "I am happy here. In the future many things can happen but it's difficult to imagine myself far from Milan.</p>
              <p class="article">"As I have said many times, while Milan and I have the same aims, there will be no problems."</p>

Italian Ancelotti is expected to be unveiled as the new man in charge at Stamford Bridge when temporary boss Guus Hiddink returns to the Russia national team after next weekend's FA Cup final.</strong></p>
              <p>Milan are due to make an official announcement on Monday with former striker Marco van Basten tipped to take the reins from Ancelotti.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="scrollText">But Kaka, has no plans to take the same path as his boss to the Premier League. 'I am tied to the club, and of course, to the coach,' Kaka said. 'But I have a contract through 2013 with Milan and not with Carlo Ancelotti. 'Right now my contract speaks clearly and with regards to any transfer news related to me it will be the club that speaks.'</p>

              <p>'As I have said many times, until Milan and I have the same aims, there will be no problems.'</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho has claimed Ancelotti will definitely be the Chelsea boss next season.</p>

              <p><strong>Mourinho, who won back-to-back Premier League titles with the Blues before parting company with them in 2007, said that he was '99.9 per cent' certain he was staying at Milan's rivals Inter and added that he also knew the destiny of Ancelotti.</strong></p>
              <p>'Ciro Ferrera will go to Juventus, Ancelotti will go to Chelsea,' he said in a discussion with Paolo Rossi and Gianluca Vialli on Sky Italia.</p>
              <p>While owner Silvio Berlusconi has been critical of Ancelotti, blaming him for the team's failure to stop Inter winning their fifth consecutive Serie A title, there are others within the club who would like their coach to stay.</p>
