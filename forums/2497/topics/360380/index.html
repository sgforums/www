              <h3>FRANK Lampard's ex has taken revenge on the football star's cheating by publicly flaunting a new hunk. </h3>
              <p>Elen Rives snogged the man in the middle of a busy street. Then they spent the night together at a London hotel. Smouldering pictures of them together will devastate soccer hero Frank Lampard. </p>
              <p>They show his ex-fiancée Elen Rives passionately snogging and caressing the mystery hunk - before spending the night with him at a hotel. </p>
              <p>The very public display of affection happened last Sunday, just weeks after Elen dumped the Chelsea and England soccer star who had cheated on her twice.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>One witness told us: "Frank used to say he loved Elen's passion and that was certainly on display with this new guy. And once they started kissing it was no holds barred.</strong> </p>
              <p>"They were snogging on every corner, in doorways and alleyways. They didn't care who saw them. Elen is clearly smitten." </p>
              <p>And last night a friend of the 34-year-old Spanish beauty confirmed: "Elen has met someone she really likes and has fun with. It's early days but they laugh together, which is exactly what she needs to take her mind off everything." </p>
              <p>Our sources saw Elen and her mystery man: </p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>DRINK</strong> pink champagne cocktails at the swanky Soho House private members' club. </li>
              <li><strong>FLIRT</strong> with until he could not keep his hands off her any longer. </li>
              <li><strong>KISS </strong>and cuddle on public streets as they hopped between bars. </li>
              <li><strong>BOOK</strong> in to a five-star hotel and spend the night together.  </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their passionate evening came just days after Elen broke down in tears over Lampard, calling him an "emotionless b******". </p>
              <p>She was devastated to discover he had been out on dates with socialite Saskia Boxford, 23, so soon after their split in February. </p>
              <p>Lampard, 30, one of the Premier League's highest earners on £140,000 a week, spoke of his heartbreak at being ditched by Elen, the mother of their girls Luna, three, and Isla, one. </p>
              <p>That heartbreak will surely intensify when he sees how close she clearly is to her Latin-looking new man in our pictures. </p>
              <p>The couple spent the early part of their night together at Soho House in the heart of London. </p>
              <p>Over four hours there former model Elen, looking stunning in skin-tight jeans, black vest top and sexy heels, twirled her hair and subtly touched the hunk. </p>
              <p>Club members watched as the pair giggled and flirted, occasionally popping out to a rooftop patio so Elen could smoke. One witness told us: "He didn't have his arms around her at this point, but they were leaning into each other and it was clear there was chemistry. </p>
              <p>"They were sitting quite close together and even at a four-person table they took chairs on the same side. And even though it was cold they spent ages on the roof." </p>
              <p>The duo left just before midnight, winding their way through the West End to Bar Italia. </p>
              <p>Another witness said: "Elen especially looked like she'd had plenty to drink. She was swaying as she walked. They were wandering around, not knowing where they were going.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>Teasing</h4>
              <p>"He put his arm around her and they were laughing before going in for food. "At one stage he nearly fell off his chair and she went to grab him, laughing hysterically. </p>
              <p>"It was when they left that they started kissing non-stop. He'd initiate and she seemed to enjoy teasing him by pulling away slightly. </p>
              <p>"She was loving the attention. Once they started snogging there was no end to it. They were really deep, passionate kisses. </p>
              <p>"He was quite tall compared to Elen, even though she was in heels. She cuddled up to him and let him touch her. </p>
              <p>"They walked around looking for a cab, stopping on every corner for a kiss and snuggle. Eventually they got a car and were off." </p>
              <p>The pair arrived at the plush Sanderson Hotel, which has a suggestive lip-shaped settee in the foyer. The man was seen booking a room, where prices range from £215 to £545-a-night, before they disappeared upstairs. </p>
              <p>They weren't seen again until the next morning, when he dashed out just after 9am. Elen left about ten minutes later. </p>
              <p>She is staying with friends while builders put the finishing touches to renovations at the £3million four-bed home Lampard has bought her in Chelsea. He is also paying for the work. </p>
              <p>It is just around the corner from the former family home, now Lampard's bachelor pad. </p>
              <p>Elen's friend told us: "It has taken a few months, but Elen is ready to be with another man. Her heart was broken after the split with Frank. It doesn't matter who makes the decisions in a break-up, it always hurts. </p>
              <p>"Things were made even worse after reports of Frank with other women so quickly after the split. But Elen is strong. She didn't want to shy away into oblivion. Elen is sometimes portrayed as super-strong and almost a bit cold, but deep down she is very sensitive. </p>
              <p>"She is a huge romantic and loves hot kisses like any red-blooded Spanish woman." Elen's split with Lampard came 19 months after the News of the World caught the midfielder picking up a mystery brunette at a Las Vegas casino. Nine months before that he bedded blonde Montserrat Lucas, 36.</p>
