              <p class="imageCaption"><em>London calling: Robinho in action for Real Madrid</em></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #003580;">Chelsea</span> were close to completing the signing of Robinho for £25million last night after chief executive Peter Kenyon was seen arriving in Madrid to tie up the deal. The Brazil forward described a switch to Chelsea as his 'dream move' earlier in the summer but Real Madrid's failure to secure the services of Cristiano Ronaldo from <span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span> had put the transfer in jeopardy.</strong></p>
              <div class="fLeft fullWidthArticle">
              <div class="searchPreviewHolder">
              <p>The situation now seems to have been resolved and Luiz Felipe Scolari will be delighted to add his countryman to a list of summer signings that includes Deco and Jose Bosingwa.</p>
              <p>Robinho's arrival will lead to the departure of Andriy Shevchenko, who has been told by Chelsea that he can return to AC Milan on a one-year loan after a disastrous spell in the Barclays Premier League.</p>
              <p>Chelsea are prepared to take a massive financial hit on the deal, by paying Milan to take back the Ukraine striker.</p>
              <p>Shevchenko, 31, is expected to return to the San Siro in the next 48 hours, two years after he joined Chelsea for £30m. The 2004 European Footballer of the Year will have part of his £5m-a-year contract covered by Chelsea.</p>
              <p>The club's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich met Milan counterpart Silvio Berlusconi to discuss the deal in Sardinia last week, and Silvano Ramaccioni, a director of the Italian club, confirmed: 'There really isn't much more to be done. We are close to the end of the deal.'</p>

              <p>Real don't really value him at all, Just that their president just don't want to lose face after missing out on Ronaldo and losing out on Robinho in the same manner he tried to get Ronaldo...</p>

              <p><em>Blues go £32m for Robinho?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Real Madrid have told Robinho that he will be allowed to leave the Bernabéu after all, though only if Chelsea offer what would amount to a British record sum of £32m for the Brazil international as negotiations between the clubs continue to crawl towards a resolution.</strong></p>
              <p>The Chelsea chief executive, Peter Kenyon, travelled to Madrid on Wednesday to meet the Real director, José Angel Sánchez, though the Londoners' second bid for Robinho, worth about £26m, has been turned down. Negotiations between the two clubs remain ongoing, with Chelsea confident a compromise can be reached. Kenyon has since returned to England but is expected to travel back to the Spanish capital today in an attempt to break the impasse over the 24-year-old's future as the transfer deadline of September 1 edges closer.</p>
              <p>He can be encouraged that the Real president, Ramón Calderón, has at least indicated that the player, who has long since stated his desire to move to England, will be allowed to depart even if Chelsea will resist raising their offer to such an inflated level. Calderón, in a meeting with the player's agent, Wagner Ribeiro, and the club's sporting director, Predrag Mijatovic, earlier this week, had tried to persuade Robinho that his suitors' efforts to sign him had been half-hearted and said Real would not allow "such an important player to go at a knock-down price".</p>
              <p>However, during that meeting Calderón and Mijatovic did concede that they would allow Robinho to leave if Chelsea upped their offer to £32m, a fee they did not anticipate the London club matching.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Andriy Shevchenko’s move from Chelsea back to AC Milan could be off after the Italian club refused to buy the striker outright.</p>

              <p><br>Well, if they don't continue to spend the way they have been over the last 4 yrs... Perhaps in time they will be able to do so... Kenyon already said they plan to break even by 2010 a few yrs back (and rule the world by 2014), then after that year (2010) if they have profits, they can use it to repay their almost $600 million debt to Roman i guess... But looking at how they manage, with deficit every year, its going to be rather difficult to break even by 2010...</p>

              <p>Real are holding out for £31.7 million for a player who has failed to live up to expectations at the Bernabéu, but Chelsea believe that they can reach a compromise quickly after Real turned down offers of £19.7 million and £25.4 million. “I dream of playing in the English league,” Robinho said. “Chelsea have a great squad and a great team. My objective is to play there. I've got nothing against Madrid, but I want to resolve this as soon as possible. It's not about money, I simply want to leave.”</p>
              <p>Chelsea have offered to double the Brazilian's wages to about £70,000 a week and are confident that they will have signed the two players that Scolari wanted - Deco and Robinho - when he agreed to replace Avram Grant last month. Peter Kenyon, the Chelsea chief executive, met Scolari and Frank Arnesen, the director of scouting and youth development, yesterday to update them on developments after flying back from Madrid.</p>
              <p>Robinho has become disillusioned in Spain after Real tried to use him as a makeweight in their attempts to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United this summer and after he was refused permission to play for Brazil in the Olympic Games in Beijing.</p>
              <p>Scolari trained with his first-team squad yesterday morning to prepare for tomorrow's match away to Wigan Athletic and the Brazilian made a point of having a quiet word with Frank Lampard after the England midfield player was booed by his own supporters during England's 2-2 draw with the Czech Republic at Wembley on Wednesday. Scolari advised Lampard to try some retail therapy. “I asked Frank if he was upset and he said no,” Scolari said. “I told him that now he had renewed his contract he should go out and spend some money.”</p>
              <p>Lampard was happy to stay at Stamford Bridge after the club agreed to give him a five-year contract worth about £140,000 a week, but there are still question marks about the futures of Shaun Wright-Phillips and Andriy Shevchenko. Portsmouth are trying to sign Wright-Phillips on loan and Scolari will not stand in the winger's way if he decides to move to Fratton Park.</p>
              <p>“I have 26 players in my squad so to lose one or two would not be a problem,” Scolari said. “I don't know what Shaun thinks about offers from other teams. I have three or four wide players so if we sell one it will not be a problem for me.”</p>
              <p>Shevchenko stopped off in Milan on Thursday on his way back from Ukraine's 1-0 victory over Poland in Kiev but his hopes of returning to the San Siro appear to have been dashed temporarily after AC Milan insisted that they would sign him only on loan.</p>
              <p>Steve Bruce, the Wigan Athletic manager, goes into the match at home to Chelsea tomorrow having suffered humiliation at the hands of one of the London club's players this summer. Bruce, a keen golfer, could not resist a round with Andriy Shevchenko when the pair bumped into one another while holidaying in Barbados.</p>
              <p>“I got hammered,” Bruce said. “Shevchenko's partner was the pro at Wentworth, while I was left with Stephen Hunt, from Reading. I have to say, Shevchenko is one hell of a golfer. We were beaten by the 9th hole, but I blame Stephen. He was hopeless.”</p>

              expect to complete the signing of Robinho from Real Madrid “within the
              next 48 hours”.</strong></p>
              <p>The Brazilian has been at the centre of a proposed transfer from the
              Spanish champions to Luiz Felipe Scolari’s side for a number of weeks
              now, with The Blues’ desire to acquire him having been well documented.</p>
              <p>Robinho’s team-mates at Real – Iker Casillas and Gabriel Heinze –
              have both spoken in favour of granting the player his wish to leave.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old himself has been open in his desire to join The
              Blues, and was booed by his own fans in Real’s Spanish Super Cup win
              over Valencia at the weekend.</p>
              <p>Robinho’s agent, Wagner Ribeiro, stated on Tuesday that a deal “was
              about to be reached”, and Kenyon has now substantiated that claim with
              his explanation that the West London outfit are on the verge of pushing
              through a transfer.</p>

              <p><br>Well, if they don't continue to spend the way they have been over the last 4 yrs... Perhaps in time they will be able to do so... Kenyon already said they plan to break even by 2010 a few yrs back (and rule the world by 2014), then after that year (2010) if they have profits, they can use it to repay their almost $600 million debt to Roman i guess... But looking at how they manage, with deficit every year, its going to be rather difficult to break even by 2010...</p>

              <p><br>well with probably ard 2 years to go i would seriously doubt they can break even, unless he is just trying to say something like excluding Roman's loan they can break even by 2010, anyhow, if spending Roman's millions doesn't pain Roman it could only be good for EPL, with more and more better players coming into England while Chelsea released players not up to their requirements in a lesser rate it would also kinda benefit the smaller clubs... just keep our finger close and hope Roman wouldn't get sick of football and move on to sponser a F1 team or something else... </p>

              <p><br>Err... the 2 yrs timetable left is to break even from their yearly operation cost and not their total debt amount... At present, Kenyon has not even been able to control yearly expenses due largely to the high salaries that they are dishing out to almost every member of their huge squad... Examples like SWP sitting around are also on $70k a week... And I guess they also have too many above $120k a week players in their squad... Sheva (Just left but still need to pay part of his weekly salary), Ballack $130k, Terry $135k, Lampard $140-$150k and even Deco, tho mentioned on $80 or $90k but his is believe to be tax free like what he got at Barce, so it might still work out to about there...</p>
              <p>They also seem to have too many players on $70 to $90k in their squad... Kenyon sure has his job cut out for him... He has to work on increasing sponsorships and cutting back on salaries in order just to break even on yearly operating cost... Of the $700 over million debts, he can forget it... it will probably take decades to clear... Hopeful nothing happen to Roman or Chelsea the club will suffer for decades too... </p>
