Benin lost the Group B match 1-0 after conceding a second-half penalty. </strong><br><br>Fabisch is willing to give the Confederation of African Football the name and number of the man who claimed to be from a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Singapore-based company</strong></span>.<br><br>"He wanted to find out from me if there was any possibility of manipulating the match," Fabisch told BBC Sport. "I told him: 'Look, you have two minutes to leave the hotel or I will call the police'."<br><br>Fabisch added that the man - a black African - spoke to him at the team's hotel on Saturday, two days before the Mali defeat. The man said the company he represented claimed to be able to fix matches across Africa and planned to win money in bets on the tournament's opening goal.<br><br>The first goal of the Africa Cup of Nations was Ghana's penalty against Guinea on Sunday 20 January, a game the tournament hosts won 2-1. "I was astonished that he had the guts to approach a German to fix a football match," said Fabisch.<br><br>"I think that African players are vulnerable to this kind of approach, because many of them don't have money. "This is why poor countries like Benin are targeted. "I cut him short and told him to leave. It doesn't help football.<br><br>"I assume that if someone approaches you like that, then they have that (money) in mind." Subsequently Fabisch warned his players to tell him if they were approached. Benin next play Ivory Coast in Sekondi on Friday.<br></div>
