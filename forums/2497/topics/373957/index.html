              <div class="content">
              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> have come to the defence of striker Eduardo da Silva ahead of his disciplinary hearing.</p>
              <p>The Croatian international has been charged with ‘deceiving the
              referee’ after a fall earned his side a penalty in last Wednesday’s
              Champions League qualifier against <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Celtic</span></abbr> at Emriates Stadium.</p>
              <p>The Gunners have submitted a 19-page defence to the charges which UEFA described as ‘grossly unsporting’.</p>
              <p>A fax received by <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> from UEFA general inspector Gerhard Kapl outlined that Eduardo
              "succeeded in deceiving the referee, who was influenced by the player's
              gross unsporting behaviour".</p>
              <p>It added: "There are no exceptional circumstances that would justify a plea for mercy."</p>
              <p>If found guilty, Eduardo faces a two-match European ban but it
              seems the Gunners will do everything they can to not allow that
              sanction to be imposed.</p>

              </div>
              <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/arsenal"><span style="color: #005689;">Arsenal</span></a> have submitted a strident defence of Eduardo da Silva to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/uefa"><span style="color: #005689;">Uefa</span></a> ahead of the striker's disciplinary hearing tomorrow and they hope it can persuade the governing body to spare him a suspension of two European matches.</p>
              <p>The London club believe that Uefa's process in arriving at the decision to charge Eduardo with "deceiving the referee" after his tumble earned a penalty against Celtic in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague"><span style="color: #005689;">Champions League</span></a> play-off last Wednesday has been flawed.</p>
              <p>Arsenal were stunned to learn of the charge on Friday and were left to digest the wording of a fax from the Uefa general inspector, Gerhard Kapl, which appeared to point to conclusions already formed. In the fax outlining the charge and the surrounding circumstances, Eduardo is said to have "succeeded in deceiving the referee, who was influenced by the player's gross unsporting behaviour". It added: "There are no exceptional circumstances that would justify a plea for mercy."</p>
              <p>Eduardo is also said to have won the penalty with an "obvious dive" and "through the act of cheating", while the referee's observer is quoted as saying that there was "not the slightest interference with the player", with regard to the Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc's challenge. It is implied that Eduardo ought to have immediately told the referee, Manuel Mejuto González, that he did not feel a penalty should have been awarded.</p>
              <p>One of Arsenal's complaints, in their 19-page submission, is that, having also studied the video evidence, they feel that there was some element of contact from Boruc. They believe that this is shown in the footage that Uefa has sent them and, therefore, there is inaccuracy in the governing body's analysis. They have urged Uefa to scrutinise the flashpoint again.</p>
              <p>Moreover, Arsenal contend it is impossible for Uefa or anybody to read any intention to deceive into Eduardo's tumble. They have pointed out he did not appeal for a foul and they have also stressed Eduardo's blemish-free disciplinary previous and the fact that, following his horrific leg break at Birmingham City in February 2008, he is generally mindful of the need to pull out of potential collisions.</p>
              <p>Arsenal have drawn attention to what they believe is inconsistency in Uefa's application of Article 10 (1) (c), which gives them the opportunity to revisit incidents containing alleged deceptions, even if the referee has seen and acted upon them. Even though the article entered the rules in 2006, Uefa's retrospective charging of Eduardo has been the first time that it has applied it and Arsenal argue that there have been countless other occasions when it could have been employed.</p>
              <p>Notwithstanding the potential to set a dangerous precedent, Arsenal are perplexed that Uefa has effectively condemned Eduardo with video evidence while it continues to refuse to use it to help referees to arrive at their decisions. The case will be judged on the basis of written submissions from both sides. Eduardo is on international duty with Croatia.</p>

              <p><abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr>'s defence of Eduardo is likely to fall on deaf ears at UEFA.</p>
              <p><em>The Times</em> says <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> have made a 19-page presentation to Uefa before the striker’s disciplinary hearing today.</p>
              <p>The Gunners point out that Eduardo did not appeal for a foul and claim
              that the striker could be mindful of pulling out of collisions after
              the broken leg he suffered against Birmingham City 18 months ago.
              Because of this, they believe it is impossible for anyone to judge
              Eduardo’s intention in falling.</p>
              <p>But <abbr><span class="glossary-term">Arsenal</span></abbr> can expect little leniency. So far, the club’s view has gained little
              sympathy within the sport and with diving and simulation still very
              much a problem in the game, Uefa is most unlikely to back down.</p>

              <p class="article">Europe's governing body banned the striker for two games after finding him guilty of 'deceiving the referee' by diving to win a penalty during last week's Champions League qualifier against Celtic. </p>

                  i caught that too, yeah totally agree. they were also talking about introducing the challenge system as used in tennis. maybe not 3 challenges, 1 should be sufficient. however, technology would have to be used in the process &amp; Michel Platini doesn't approve of it.<br><br>well i rather this over the 2 additional officials. if they are introduced to the game, wouldn't it depend on the majority (i.e 3 officials over 2) to make decisions? that would be contentious.

              <p>Personally, I think its a good direction to take by Uefa. Cos it is getting out of hand now and if nothing was done about it, it could just get worse...</p>
              <p>I still remember those matches where Chelsea and Barce were outdoing each other in the dive and stimulation department when they were meeting each other those 2, 3 years... Touch a bit and they will start going down holding their legs in great pain or didn't even touch them and they would go down covering their face as though they got hit there... Yellow and Red cards were the order of the day then...</p>
              <p>Actually, these last few years it has become more obvious... Since the Mourinho's Porto doing it well and winning, it has got more and more frequent... Arsenal and Eduardo are unfortunate that they became the first to be made an example... But we can argue that it has to start somewhere and the fact is Eduardo did dived... I honestly don't belief Arsenal will appeal as they are at the losing end of it... The earlier it is forgotten the better for them, if they prolong the problem, it will only bring more negative news on them... But they like to threaten hoping that Uefa will not dare to go ahead with the punishment...</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, we just have to say Arsenal and Eduardo was at the wrong place and at the wrong time only... I think Uefa wants to put down a marker early and gunners were playing in the first matches, so... just their luck.</p>
              <p>But I think after this, players will think twice before taking a dive or even going down easy...</p>

              <p>You can thank the president of FIFA (Sepp Blatter) for that.</p>
              <p>According to him, video replays take away the spontaneity of the game.</p>
              <p>I'm like, isn't fair play more important? If spontaneity is an issue, then just allow video replays only for heavy decisions like penalties and red card situations. There wouldn't be much impact on spontaneity that way, and there would be more fair play.</p>
              <p>That said, I hope they will punish <em>all</em> blatant divers across the board. They cannot just go after Eduardo and not do anything about all the other world-class champion divers.</p>
