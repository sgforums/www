              <p><br>I don't think so.. Even let Man U overrun, they still cannot win EPL ma. So might as well don't let them overrun. Haha..</p>
              <p>Chelsea last game against Wigan at home ground. So Chelsea very likely to clinch EPL title but wigan last time met, beat them before wo.</p>
              <p>But at Stamford Bridge, it will be a different game.</p>

              <p>but anelka has been important in several games when he gave assists. like lampards 2nd goal last night.</p>
              <p>kalou before stoke was condemned but he seems to have gotten much better since that game?</p>
              <p>most important, without essien and mikel, chelsea's true defensive midfielders, chelsea is still good at intercepting and defending. partially can be attributed to kalou backtracking and defending when needed.</p>
              <p>ballack is their other holding midfielder, very good at breaking up opponent play and push ppl and fall down claim foul.</p>
              <p>kalou is like kuyt, got high stamina and can participate in attack and defence. definitely more useful than ballack now that i think of it.</p>

              <p>ballack was not there to play football.  he was there to commit fouls.</p>
              <p>what exactly is drogba trying to prove?  i have no doubt he holds the all-time record for the lying-on-the-field-grimacing-in-pain act.  he seems to do it every single match.</p>

              <p><br>i agree with you... this match though crucial to whoever is ultimately gonna win the title, a title is not won over one match but over 38 league games, why whine about liverpool losing to chelsea? purposely finding excuse to bash liverpool. furthermore we have seen that pool has been very inconsistent this season, so we are supposed to play very very very well all of a sudden so that we beat chelsea and do man utd a favour, that all you man utd fans will be very happy?</p>
