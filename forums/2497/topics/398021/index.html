              <p><strong>Sir Alex Ferguson is confident </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Liverpool </strong></span></a><strong>will not "throw away their history" by standing aside for </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea </strong></span></a><strong>at Anfield on Sunday.</strong> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/manchester-united.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Manchester United</span></a> head into the penultimate weekend of the campaign knowing their last realistic chance of overhauling Carlo Ancelotti's side depends on Liverpool avoiding defeat this weekend. </p>
              <p>If Chelsea are denied maximum points, United can seize the advantage by beating <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/sunderland.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Sunderland </span></a>at the Stadium of Light a couple of hours later.  </p>
              <p>All this has been noted at an increasingly agitated Liverpool. And quite apart from drawing a veil on what has been a disastrous season for the Merseyside giants, that took another downturn last night with a Europa League semi-final exit at the hands of Atletico Madrid, the sub-plot is United attempting to clinch a record 19th league championship.  </p>
              <p>That would eclipse Liverpool, a situation that seemed impossible when Ferguson came south from Aberdeen in 1986. </p>
              <p>It has led a number of Liverpool supporters to voice their desire for their team to lose, even though it would cost them what slender chance they still have of finishing in the Champions League places. </p>
              <p>Ferguson cannot see that eventuality and is convinced Liverpool have too much to lose by not trying.  </p>
              <p>'I am confident they will do their maximum,' he said. 'Great clubs don't throw their history and traditions away for one game. They have been in 11 European finals. They have won 18 titles. </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Convinced: Ferguson is confident Liverpool will not allow the Blues to coast to victory at United's expense</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>'That is a fantastic history. You don't throw that away. The fans know that too. Do you think the fans want to go home saying their players capitulated and they didn't try and thinking it wouldn't happen again?'</strong></p>
              <p>There is a precedent. On the last day in 1995, United headed to West Ham knowing it would take a victory at Upton Park and a Liverpool win over Blackburn at Anfield to give them the title. </p>
              <p>Given Kenny Dalglish was the Blackburn manager, the attachment was arguably even greater. As it turned out, Liverpool did their job, but United were unable to capitalise.  </p>
              <p>'We were depending on Liverpool producing - and they did,' recalled Ferguson. 'You have to earn a right to win the title. Okay, there were a lot of English players in their team that day and they understood the history of Liverpool FC.  </p>
              <p>'But I don't think there has been such a swing that the current players do not understand the history of Liverpool.'</p>
              <p>They presumably also know they are tired, weary and unhappy given they slogged through 120 minutes last night before falling to Diego Forlan's extra-time decider. </p>
              <p>It leaves Rafa Benitez in a similar position to the one Ferguson found himself in when United crashed out of the Champions League at the hands of Bayern Munich.</p>
              <p>And it also gave the United boss a chance to air his long-held view about the Premier League not giving any assistance to clubs sidetracked by European commitments.  </p>
              <p>'It is difficult to say how Liverpool's players will feel,' said Ferguson. 'It is Rafa's job to prepare his players. The way we lost to Bayern Munich gave me a difficult job to raise players. But you have to do it. That is your job. It took me a couple of days to get over it. But you can't wallow in pity.</p>

              <p>'Having to play Sunday lunchtime after a Thursday game is not fair but it happens time and again when we see repeatedly teams abroad being allowed to bring games forward to suit their programme. That is a fact.  </p>
              <p>'They say there is congestion but it is not that big you can't help a team by one day or a few hours. We have all had to cope with it over the years. You depend on the great resilience of the English player.'</p>
              <p>For his part, Ferguson could have Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand back in contention after recent groin injuries, providing a welcome selection poser ahead of a visit to Wearside, where Sunderland have lost just twice in the league all season. </p>

              <p class="article">But when asked about Sunday's game at Anfield, Moyes insisted his only focus was his own team's trip to Stoke.</p>
              <p class="article">He said: "What game? I have got no interest in Liverpool-Chelsea. I am only interested in Everton.</p>
              <p class="article">"I don't know what will happen in the Liverpool-Chelsea game.</p>
              <p class="article">"The race for seventh is a different question. All we can do is do our job and then we will see what happens after that.</p>

              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1270159" rel="1270159|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1270159/Chelsea-manager-Carlo-Ancelotti-tells-Liverpool-Well-teach-history-.html"></a></p>
              <p><strong>There is a verse they like to sing at Anfield when </strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"><span style="color: #003580;"><strong>Chelsea</strong></span></a><strong> visit. It is about history and it points out rather impolitely how three league titles is nothing compared to a record haul of 18 plus five European Cups.</strong></p>
              <p>Carlo Ancelotti knows a little about <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/liverpool.html"><span style="color: #003580;">Liverpool</span></a>’s glorious past, having been on the wrong end of the fifth of those European successes when his AC Milan team squandered a three-goal lead and lost on penalties.</p>
              <p>He admits that night in Istanbul in 2005 was the most painful moment of his managerial career but he cannot agree the sentiment behind the Kop song.</p>
              <p>‘The past is the past,’ said Ancelotti. ‘Everyone respects the history of Liverpool and everyone has to have respect for our history, too. Maybe it’s a different history but everyone has to have respect for the history of this club.’</p>
              <p>When Roman Abramovich set about the task of luring Ancelotti from his beloved Milan, he summoned him to an interview in Paris and spoke about identity.</p>
              <p>Twelve months later, when the Italian left the San Siro for Stamford Bridge, he was under no illusions. His job would be to win trophies, entertain and — perhaps hardest of all — make Chelsea more likeable.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti arrived in England saying he wanted to win the Champions League and the Premier League and ‘maybe both’.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/30/article-1270159-08BE94FA000005DC-899_306x444.jpg" alt="Let down: Carlo Ancelotti (right) was beaten by Jose Mourinho in the Champions League, much to the anger of Roman Abramovich" width="306" height="444">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Let down: Carlo Ancelotti (right) was beaten by Jose Mourinho in the Champions League, much to the anger of Roman Abramovich</em></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Defeat to Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan did not go down well with Abramovich but the club’s first League and FA Cup Double would not be a bad start and, if entertainment is all about goals, he has done well in that department too.</strong></p>
              <p>As for making Chelsea more likeable, well, that may take a little longer but Ancelotti has made a start, with his humility and good humour. It is not his style to berate the referee or launch verbal attacks on fellow managers.</p>
              <p>His sense of humour is dry and he happily plays along with the incessant comparisons to Mourinho. There is no love lost between the pair but Ancelotti is a diplomat and knows there are no points to be scored by criticising someone the Chelsea fans adore.</p>
              <p>He sent Mourinho a message of congratulations after Inter Milan had beaten Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final.</p>
              <p>Asked if he would sprint across the pitch in celebration as Mourinho did at the Nou Camp on Wednesday, Ancelotti showed only empathy.</p>
              <p>‘When I won the Champions League I ran on the pitch,’ he said. That was in 2003. Would he do it at Anfield, if he won on Sunday?</p>
              <p>‘I am not able to run any more,’ he smiled. ‘I risk injury.’</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption"> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>Ancelotti was such an unpopular manager at Juventus that he sometimes required a police escort to get from his home to the training ground. Fans called him a ‘pig’ because he was raised in part of Italy famed for its ham.</strong></p>
              <p>‘Why do you keep asking about Juventus,’ he asked reporters on Friday. ‘You want me to be nervous?’</p>
              <p>The questions included the time his Juve team lost the Serie A title with a defeat in a deluge at Perugia on the last day of the season.</p>
              <p>‘I hope there’s no rain in Liverpool,’ Ancelotti said. ‘That’s what happened in Perugia. We have to wait 90 minutes to play the second half. That’s too much for a team involved in a fight for the title.’</p>
              <p>The human touch works for him. When Lampard asked to play deeper in midfield rather than at the top of a diamond, Ancelotti listened, moved him back, adjusted the shape of the team and watched the goals roll in.</p>
              <p>He accepts Liverpool may have tired legs after two hours against Atletico Madrid on Thursday but rejects the conspiracy theories that the team will not try to win because they do not want to help rivals United win the title.</p>
              <p>‘It is not my job to play mind games,’ said Ancelotti. ‘I prefer to stay focused with my players. I have a lot to think about. We have to prepare for the game tactically, physically.</p>
              <p>‘My job is to maintain a good atmosphere in the squad. We have to be fresh and relax, though not too much. We have to believe we are able to win at Liverpool.</p>
              <p>‘But it is easy to motivate my players. We have 180 minutes to the end of the season and we have to stay focused for every minute, keep our concentration. If we do that, we can be champions.’ </p>

              <p>In a normal situation, I believe Chelsea won't get more than a point at Anfield even in present form...</p>
              <p>Reason is, it's very difficult to beat Liverpool at Anfield if they are up for it. And another major point people forget is, Chelsea have been playing very poorly away from home. They beat Villa by 7 goals as well and the next weekend they were lucky to get a win at Old Trafford with a Drogba's offside goal even though United were tried from their CL match and travelling...</p>
              <p>Again they were very fortunate to win Bolton at home when a Terry hand ball was not punished with a penalty... Again, we all saw how they were away at Spurs a few days later... They were totally outplayed away from home... Therefore, tomorrow's match being another away game... I belief Chelsea will struggle again if Pool play to their normal standard. And I don't mean any special level, just their normal level will trouble Chelsea.</p>
              <p>And on the Torres thing, I am not sure if its a good thing or a bad one... Against smaller sides, having Torres is great but against better sides, I am not too sure there cos if Pool have him, everything will get through him... and better sides have better defenders so just mark Torres and everything is shut out... But without him, their fringe players will get more chances and also the defenders don't have a priority to mark a certain player... and a goal could come from anywhere or anyone...</p>
              <p>So I belief if Pool are up for this, they won't lose this match... And the longer it drags on, the chelsea players will get more nervous and start to play rougher... Anything less than a win for Chelsea tomorrow would be seen as a big disaster cos to be fair, United were actually dead where the title was concern 11 days into April... They were just given a slim chance to make this one last push...</p>
