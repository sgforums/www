The London rivals meet in Sunday's Carling Cup final at the Millennium Stadium and Wenger has responded to Mourinho's jibe about Arsenal's record in Europe's elite club competition by launching a thinly veiled attack on the Portuguese.<br><br>"Plenty of managers have won the Champions League who will not be considered great managers," he said. "What is important is that you look at their careers in 10, 15 or 20 years. What kind of quality have you brought through in your work and on how consistent a level have you done it? If you would like to compare every manager you give each one the same amount of resources and say: 'you have that for five years'. After five years you see who has done the most."<br><br></div>

You ask yourself... if they are not making the news then no one can create any news on them right? Like i have said earlier, i only post news that were publish unlike some people who are so creative as we see in Sports coming up with their own titles, some even have foul language on them... But of course they don't dare to use their real account so... Create clones lah.  (i am not implying its you ah, so don't anyhow assume)<br><br>As to your take on my beloved... I only have one at the moment leh and it not man u...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  If you must know, i already have very little time and i post news on any or every team/clubs that is worth the thread... there is no need for favouritism... Anyone can post whatever they want, it don't necessary have to always come from me right... Anyway, don't you know there is already someone doing that job very well? Yes, our friendly neighbourhood blue guy... isn't he doing a great job already? So why do i need to double it?<br><br>And I where got hide... you can find me here every other day just like you have found me right now isn't it? and if you can recall the last time i posted in Sports you and that blue guy kpkb remember? Like that i where dare to go there... i don't like to create trouble leh, you can see its not my style i never post in those clones created senseless threads... So if i go Pool forum even worst right...

Why are you so defensive? The thing is since you took a stand on it and have not admitted otherwise, I was only checking if your position has changed...<br><br>Thank you for the invitation, i will drop by when i have a chance. I won't post anything negative unless it is publish to be true. Nevertheless, i welcome different views or anyone who so wishes to challenge it.<br><br>Others has been here and to the man u forum and they have got a very balance and moderate views and everyone is just there for a simple discussion. The rebuking you experience at the man u forum was because, to begin with... your point was wrong, your statements were wrong. Your intentions... you have to be honest, if you were only out to reason as you claim with the people over there then you should also be open to reasons by others as well, wouldn't you think so?<br><br>If your remarks or statements were right, you won't have anyone challenging them.<br><br>The fact of the matter is you got it wrong, others over there pointed out to you like what a proper forum is all about but your replys were not friendly at all. And when they have proved to you that you have got it wrong, unlike most people who would accept it and move on, you still claim otherwise... Is this really called reasoning or unreasonable?<br><br>Ok names calling... if you were to take the trouble to look up this thread again you will notice i didn't once use a unpleasant name on you... i don't think i even called you a name for that matter. But if you were to take a look at your own posts here... you may notice that every of your reply seem to have a name for me... If i was any smaller, i will most likely also have a name or 2 for you too then it probably will not end. But I know you have a history of doing so... So i won't take it too serious. But who do you think look more like a joke here?<br><br>As to your last sentence... I really don't know where you get your idea that "reason why the ABU fans not coming here are becos u pple handle things immature way that's why they post in sport forum."<br><br>You just go and take a look at Sports forum today... Go and take a long hard look at it. Its in a mess. It didn't use to be like that before, clones springing out almost everyday with senseless and unsubstantiated threads/news... Names calling are almost a everyday thing over there now... sometimes you will also get foul language throwing around at each other. Are these what you call mature stuff? Because if these are your kind of "mature stuff" i am more than happy to give it a pass and stick to proper news which makes more sense in the long run...<br><br>And lastly, before you laugh at that guy because he is still quite new in here and didn't know who i was referring to, (full marks to you for taking the trouble to find that thread out again) you should also pause for a moment and take a look at yourself.<br><br>Your own "free-kick rule" remember?  Different from Uefa's free-kick rule also... Do you see a similarity to it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
