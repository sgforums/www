Mongai told the Daily Star.<br><br>"They are a successful club and Harry Redknapp is their manager.<br><br>"Fredi knows all about him from when they worked together at West Ham.<br><br>"It's Fredi's choice to play in England again but he's scored a lot of goals for Sevilla and they want a lot of money for him."</div>
