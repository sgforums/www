I've spoken to him. We thanked each other for the last four years at Birmingham and we both move on.<br><br>'There is no animosity there. I know his gripe is with the Blues board and that's what he told me. I hope West Ham play Birmingham in the Premiership next season. That would be ideal.<br><br>'Now I just hope my calf injury is not too bad. I leapt high and just landed off balance and put too much stress through my right calf and it just tightened up.<br><br>'There is no major problem, just a tightness of the muscle. We will see how it is after the weekend and hopefully the results of the scan will show it's not a big issue and it will settle down.'<br><br>He said: 'When I was sitting on the ground at Villa Park my emotion was just disappointment because I'm desperate to play and desperate to keep this club in the Premiership.<br><br>'That's what I've been brought here to do and I feel an obligation to want to do that.<br><br>'I want to play football at the top level. I feel in the condition, in my body and in my mind, to do that and I felt really good in the time I was on the pitch.<br><br>'I felt steady, calm and physically in good condition. It was just one of those things. There is nothing I can do about it other than think positively and get back as quick as I can.'</span><br><br>i bet bruce was laughing when upson suffered the same fate as neil</div>
