              <h1>Fulham manager-elect Martin Jol given £20m and he's Keane on 
              Tottenham striker Robbie <br></h1>

              <p>Fulham
               manager-elect Martin Jol is eager to bring Tottenham
               striker Robbie Keane to Craven Cottage after being promised a 
              £20million transfer kitty by club owner Mohamed Al Fayed.</p>
              <p>Jol
               spent Monday afternoon in Holland with Fulham officials finalising his 
              move from Ajax, despite the Dutch side making a last-ditch attempt to 
              keep him.</p>
              <div class="floatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/19/article-0-02813A670000044D-653_306x423.jpg" alt="Friends reunited? Jol wants to re-sign Keane " width="306" height="423">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Friends reunited? Jol wants to re-sign Keane </em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Also present were the former Spurs and Hamburg manager's agent Mino 
              Raiola and his brother Cock Jol, who is expected to join the staff at 
              Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>And once his expected move to west London is 
              rubber-stamped, Jol is ready to spend a large chunk of his transfer 
              windfall, far more than was given to Roy Hodgson, to engineer a reunion 
              with Keane, 30.</p>
              <p>The pair worked well at White Hart Lane, and 
              with Harry Redknapp ready to listen to offers for the striker, who spent
               the back end of last season on loan at Celtic, Jol will try to pip 
              Aston Villa to his signature. Spurs would be willing to listen to offers
               in the region of £5m.</p>
              <p>Steve Sidwell's £2m move from Villa to
               Fulham should be completed once Jol's appointment as manager is 
              official. The Dutchman could also be in the market for a goalkeeper if 
              Arsenal complete the signing of Australia No 1 Mark Schwarzer.</p>
              <p>Jol's move back to England has been smoothed by the fact that a release 
              clause was included in his contract, allowing him to return to a 
              Barclays Premier League club in return for compensation of around £1m.</p>
              <p>The
               54-year-old's basic salary will be around £1.5m a year, with a wide 
              range of performance-related bonuses. Jol is said to have fallen out 
              with Ajax's board over the sale of the club's top stars.</p>

              <h1>Martin Jol snubs Fulham as Ajax convince former Tottenham manager to
               stay in Holland<br></h1>

              <p>Martin Jol has turned down Fulham's
               offer to step in as Roy Hodgson's replacement at Craven Cottage.</p>
              <p>Jol
               has committed himself to the European giants after days of negotiations
               between the Dutchman, Fulham and Ajax.</p>
              <p>The west London club will 
              now be forced to look at other candidates for the job, with former 
              England and Manchester City boss Sven Goran Eriksson leading the 
              contenders.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/22/article-1296756-0A863A02000005DC-165_468x314.jpg" alt="Martin Jol " width="468" height="314">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Amster-damn! Fulham failed in their bid to prise
               Jol from Ajax</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>Jol told the Cottagers earlier in the week that he was ready to take 
              over the hot seat vacated when Hodgson left for Liverpool.</p>
              <p>But 
              Ajax have assured the 54-year-old of their ambition and promised him 
              transfer funds, which has convinced the former Tottenham Hotspur manager
               to stay at the Amsterdam Arena.</p>
              <p>Jol said: 'Ajax let me know they 
              didn't want me to go. And I don't think I can bring myself to leave Ajax
               at this time.</p>
              <p>'I came here last summer to be successful, to build
               a good team and to have fun. And those three things are what I am 
              interested in achieving next season.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/04/13/article-0-071A2E07000005DC-931_468x445.jpg" alt="Luis Suarez" width="468" height="445">

              clubs across Europe</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>'It was always my intention to build Ajax further. It is full speed 
              ahead and we all need to roll up our sleeves. That is essential.'</p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/22/article-1296756-0A7AA7D0000005DC-514_233x348.jpg" alt="Liverpool boss Roy Hodgson" width="233" height="348">

              </div>
              <p>Fulham were convinced they had got their man when details of talks 
              emerged at the weekend, with Jol frustrated that he could not achieve 
              his dream of winning the Dutch league with Ajax while working under 
              serious financial constraints.</p>
              <p>Several players have left the Dutch
               club this summer, while none has signed, and there are a number of 
              European clubs eyeing up Uruguay forward Luis Suarez and emerging 
              Holland right back Gregory van der Wiel.</p>
              <p>Jol still has concerns 
              but is committed to turning Ajax around.</p>
              <p>'We have held 
              detailed talks in the last few days,' he said. 'The club and I share 
              each other's concerns. Everyone knows that Ajax have financial 
              difficulties.</p>
              <p>'Last year we lost another million. But what is
               equally annoying is that we want to perform better next season than 
              last season.</p>
              <p>'The expectations are always high at Ajax. But 
              now I have lost, among others Marko Pantelic, Dennis Rommedahl, Kennedy 
              (Bakircioglu) and Gabri, and nobody has been signed. Also, there is 
              uncertainty about whether key players will stay.</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/21/article-1296363-0A845FB1000005DC-674_468x349.jpg" alt="Ajax v Fulham" width="468" height="349"></div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>'I received offers from other clubs in April and May, and I 
              brushed 
              them aside, but this time my agent Mino Raiola held serious talks with 
              the British delegation.</p>
              <p>'I am pleased that these hectic days are over. Together with the club
              I am looking to the future. We now have a priority and that is 
              Wednesday's (Champions League) game against PAOK.</p>
              <p>'And we want to strengthen the team. Both on and off the pitch it is 
              an exciting time for Ajax. We are all going to do our best to quickly 
              get the team to the desired level.'</p>

              <p>Fulham
               are turning to Sven Goran Eriksson to fill their managerial vacancy 
              after they missed out on securing Martin Jol by 72 hours.</p>
              <p>The 
              former England and Manchester City boss is Fulham’s first-choice option 
              after the expiry of a break clause in Jol’s contract brought an abrupt 
              end to their interest in the Ajax chief.</p>
              <p>Fulham’s hierarchy 
              were forced to admit defeat in their pursuit of Jol after the Amsterdam 
              club stood firm in their refusal to allow the former Spurs boss to quit.</p>

              </div>
              <p>With the start of the Barclays Premier League season just three weeks
               away, Fulham have wasted little time moving on and the Swede will now 
              be approached to replace Roy Hodgson.</p>
              <p>Eriksson does have 
              significant support at the club and it is understood owner Mohamed Al 
              Fayed and chief executive Alistair Mackintosh were originally split on 
              who should take over.</p>
              <p>The controversial former England coach,
               who worked alongside Mackintosh at Eastlands, was always a strong 
              contender in the eyes of his former colleague. This should help smooth 
              negotiations and allay fears that Fulham will enter the season in 
              disarray as their current tour of Sweden continues.</p>
              <p>Fulham 
              were, however, surprised at the collapse of talks with Jol this week 
              when it became clear a £1million break clause in his contract was no 
              longer valid. </p>
              <p>Ajax had finally relented and agreed to see a 
              delegation from
              south-west London on Wednesday night. But what was to be a new dawn for
              Fulham turned out to be a false one.</p>
              <div class="clear"></div>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/07/22/article-1296999-0A863A10000005DC-411_468x286.jpg" alt="Staying put: The expiry of a break clause in Jol¿s contract 
              brought an abrupt end to Fulham's interest in the Ajax chief" width="468" height="286">
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>Staying put: The expiry of a break clause in

              chief</em></p>
              </div>
              <p>They, along with Jol, believed the Dutchman’s determination to quit 
              the four-time European champions, allied to the escape clause, would 
              force his paymasters into accepting defeat. But upon closer inspection 
              it was found the window of opportunity had closed on Sunday.</p>
              <p>Had
               it still been in operation, Fulham would have been able to hand over 
              £1m and speak to their target, irrespective of Ajax’s wishes.</p>
              <p>But
               with a vital Champions League qualifier next week, Ajax officials stood
               firm, leaving chief executive Rik van den Boog to crow: ‘We would not 
              let Martin go for €10m to Fulham.</p>
              <p>'It’s been hard that it 
              lasted an entire week but for us the most important thing is the result —
               and it’s good. Martin is staying with Ajax.’</p>
              <p>Jol was then 
              pushed into a very public U-turn, saying: ‘I had immediately rejected 
              offers from other clubs which came in April and May, but this time my 
              manager Mino Raiola had serious discussions with the English delegation.</p>
              <p>‘Ajax
               let me know they didn’t want me to go. And I don’t think I can bring 
              myself to leave at this time.’</p>
              <p>So with the Jol chapter 
              closed, Fulham are seeking to open another one with Eriksson. </p>
