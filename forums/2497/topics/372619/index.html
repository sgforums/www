              <h1>Toffees drop City target Lescott</h1>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Joleon Lescott has been axed
              from Everton's squad for Thursday's Europa League play-off first leg
              against Sigma Olomouc at Goodison Park.</span></p>

              </span></p><p>Lescott did not train with
              the first-team squad earlier on Wednesday following weeks of transfer
              speculation linking him with Manchester City, who have had two bids
              rejected for the defender.</p>
              <p>Everton boss David Moyes said: "Joleon's attitude has not been
              right these past days, he has disappointed me and he has disappointed
              his team-mates. He is not in the right frame of mind."</p>
              <p>But Moyes insisted he still does not want to sell the player,
              saying: "I hope this will all be sorted out, after the (transfer)
              deadline."</p>

              <p><abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Everton</span></span> boss David Moyes has told <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Manchester City</span></span> they can have defender Joleon Lescott, but they must pay £30million for him.</abbr></abbr></p>
              <p>The England international has been linked with City for much of the summer but the Toffees rejected bids to keep him at Goodison Park.</p>
              <p>Now, Moyes is believed to have lost patience with Lescott and has told City boss Mark Hughes that the player is his if he wants him.</p>
              <p>Lescott’s recent mood and attitude, especially since the 6-1 opening day loss to <abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Arsenal</span></span>, influenced Moyes to drop him from Thursday night’s Europa League qualifier against Sigma Olomouc.</abbr></p>
              <p>“His attitude has been poor post-<abbr><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Arsenal</span></span>,” Moyes said.</abbr></p>
              <p>“I have made a decision now and though we have always thought of him as a good boy, things have happened that have changed him. After September 1 he needs to get his head back around it.</p>
              <p>“Joleon has said he would rather move, I have chosen to ignore it and not go with it. We have not had a significant enough offer for us to sell and that remains the case.”</p>

              said Hughes on <em>Sky Sports News</em>.</p>
              <p>"I've said time and time
              again that we've made bids for Joleon Lescott and they've been rejected

              <p>"There
              hasn't been any update since we came back from Barcelona, so that's

              people have been busy."</p>
              <p>When pushed on whether there comes a time to turn to other targets, Hughes confirmed he is no longer looking to sign Lescott.</p>

              <p><span id="intelliTXT">Manchester City manager Mark
              Hughes says he has not given up the chase for Everton's Joleon Lescott,
              despite claims to the contrary.</span></p>
              <p><img src="http://images.teamtalk.com/09/08/330/Joleon-Lescott-stands_2350555.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="248"></p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">
              </span></p><p>City have had two bids rejected for the Toffees' England central defender but are still keen to secure his services.</p>
              <p>On Friday morning, it was reported that Hughes had revealed his
              decision to cease his pursuit of the 27-year-old after his managerial
              counterpart David Moyes slated his behaviour.</p>
              <p>However, the City boss now says he has not in fact abandoned hope of a deal for Lescott.</p>
              <p>"We are not at that point at this moment," said Hughes.</p>
              <p>"When we feel there is nowhere else to go and it is not going to happen, then we will walk away.</p>
              <p>"We do not think we are quite at that point as yet. Only time will tell."</p>
              <p>Hughes is still in the market for fresh faces before the window
              closes. He said: "We are just trying to go about our business and bring
              good players to the club.</p>
              <p>"We have been successful in that respect. Almost all the players we hoped to bring, we have been able to do.</p>
              <p>"Some we have missed out on but that will always happen. That's
              a process you legislate for and make sure you have other targets.</p>
              <p>"We have been quite active in the window but there is always
              speculation and I am sure that is not going to go away when it closes."</p>
