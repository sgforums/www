"We're still in the race to win everything and I'll try to do it."<br><br>Anelka, who has now cost Â£85m in transfer fees, began his career at Paris St Germain before joining the Gunners in 1997.<br><br>He also played for Real Madrid, Paris St Germain again, Liverpool, Manchester City and Fenerbahce before joining Bolton.<br><br>There were rumours he found it difficult to mix with teammates but he said: "Sometimes you are happy when you play football and sometimes you are not happy.<br><br>"Maybe some people saw me when I was not happy but no, I don't think it's fair."<br><br>Now at Stamford Bridge, Anelka insists he does not expect to be permanently guaranteed first-team football but will remain fully committed to the Chelsea cause.<br><br>"It's a big club with big players and if the manager gives me the chance to play, I'll play and try to do my best," he said.<br><br>"If I have to start on the bench, I'll do the same. I knew this before I signed. I'm just happy to be here."<br><br>Another mischievous suggestion that Anelka was quick to play down was that he could not form an effective strike partnership with Didier Drogba, who is currently away at the African Nations Cup.<br><br>"It's not very difficult to play with him," Anelka said.<br><br>"He can do everything and he's clever and can play with his back to the goal. I like this kind of striker. I can turn around him and give him some good balls to score."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But he should be happy now that he has another Frenchman as a new successor to the "Le Sulk" title in Lassana Diarra... Make noise at Chelsea, make noise at Arsenal, and when a bigger club come for him at Portsmouth one day, you can be sure he will make noise again... as he has already declared that his transfer to Portsmouth was simply a stepping stone to better things.<br><br>"I'll be off like a shot when big clubs call, Diarra tells Portsmouth"<br><br>Le Sulk Jr...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
