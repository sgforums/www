              <p>It was the first time they had faced each other since the 
              revelation of her torrid affair with John Terry.</p>
              <p>But in her black
               stiletto heels, dark jacket and skin-tight trousers, Vanessa Perroncel 
              was fighting for far more than her already tarnished reputation..</p>
              <p>Her
               former partner, footballer Wayne Bridge, 29, took her to court today 
              convinced that she had been paid up to £800,000 in hush money by Terry 
              not to talk about their affair.</p>

              <p class="imageCaption" style="text-align: left;"><em>The former underwear 
              model had looked calm and happy as she arrived at court this morning</em></p>
              <p>At
               London’s High Court, Bridge’s lawyers argued that the alleged
              'bung' from the disgraced England captain should mean he pays less in
              monthly maintenance to Miss Perroncel, 33, and their three-year-old
              son, Jaydon.</p>
              <p>Miss Perroncel has insisted she had never received any money from
              Bridge’s former Chelsea and England team-mate Terry after their
              five-month relationship was exposed.</p>
              <p>Terry, who is a married father of twins, moved in on the former
              lingerie model last year after she split with Bridge following his move
              from Chelsea to Manchester City.</p>

              </div>
              <p>But the brief fling only came to 
              light after Terry, who is paid
              £170,000 a week, lost a court battle preventing details of the affair
              becoming public. </p>
              <p>The tawdry revelations – including the bombshell allegation that
              Terry paid for Miss Perroncel to have an abortion – cost him the
              England captaincy last month when he was sacked by manager Fabio
              Capello.</p>
              <p>However, after she decided not to sell her story, French-born Miss
              Perroncel was alleged to have been paid between £650,000 and £800,000
              to buy her silence.</p>
              <p>But today Miss Perroncel’s lawyers presented all her bank statements
              to District Judge Peter Greene to prove she had not received any
              payment from Terry.</p>
              <p>Yet, despite this apparent evidence, Bridge would not improve on his 
              offer of £3,000-a-month for Miss Perroncel and their son.</p>
              <p>Lawyers for Miss Perroncel and £88,000-a-week Manchester City
              defender Bridge could not come to an agreement despite an all-day court
              battle.</p>
              <p>Miss Perroncel’s spokesman Max Clifford said: ‘All Vanessa is trying
              to do is quietly sort this matter out privately so that her little boy
              Jaydon will be fairly looked after by his dad.’</p>
              <p>At court a 
              grim-faced Miss Perroncel, who at all times was
              accompanied by a burly minder, refused to speak to Bridge.</p>
              <p>For
               weeks
              the couple have been locked in a war of words over her claims he was
              neglecting Jaydon. </p>
              <p>A friend said: ‘Wayne earns a huge amount of money – more than
              £350,000-a-month – and what he’s offering Vanessa and Jaydon is a drop
              in the ocean for him.</p>
              <p>‘She’s not greedy, she just wants a sensible amount of money, in the
              region of £10,000-a-month, so she can properly look after their son.’</p>
              <div class="thinCenter"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/25/article-1260528-08DDA795000005DC-55_468x362.jpg" alt="Vanessa Perroncel " width="468" height="362">
              <p class="imageCaption" style="text-align: left;"><em>Showdown: A soberly 
              dressed Perroncel seen arriving here with her legal representatives </em></p>
              <p>It
               is also understood that Miss Perroncel wants an exclusive London
              mansion as part of her settlement.  Bridge, dressed in a grey
              three-piece suit with black tie and white shirt would only laugh when
              asked how the negotiations were going.</p>
              <p>But friends say he could no longer stand the sight of Miss Perroncel.</p>
              <p>A source close to Bridge said: ‘Wayne cannot stand Vanessa. He felt
              hurt and betrayed by her but now he’s just angry and is determined not
              to be taken to the cleaners. He loves his son and wants to be part of
              his life. But he wants nothing to do with her.'</p>
              <p>Today’s two hearings, one to settle the disagreement over hush money
              and the other to decide maintenance payments, took place behind closed
              doors in front of two district judges.</p>
              <p>The settlement was adjourned to a later date.</p>
