              <p><span><strong>Luka Modric has been fined by Tottenham Hotspur for the second time in three days after refusing to travel on the club's pre-season tour of America, in his latest attempts to force through a transfer to Real Madrid.</strong></span></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              </div>
              <p>The club had previously been discussing leaving the player behind in London as they tried to come to an agreement with Madrid but, on Saturday, Modric took matters into his own hands and did not turn up for the team flight to Los Angeles. While it was always a possibility that he might miss the three-match tour, the club feel that the way in which the player has gone about it has been ill-judged.</p>
              <p>Modric has been fined for a second time by the club for missing the flight, following an earlier fine for missing training on Friday without permission. He stands to lose up to four weeks' wages – around £160,000 – with the likelihood he will be fined the maximum two-week fine for both offences.</p>
              <div class="fourthPar">
              <p>Modric’s whereabouts were unknown by Spurs on Sunday although it is understood he may have returned home to Croatia as he contemplates finally handing in a transfer request.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="fifthPar">
              <p>Much may depend on the outcome of Monday’s meeting with Real so far refusing to go beyond the £27 million - including add-ons - that they have already bid for Modric who is also wanted by Paris St-Germain and <span style="color: #000000;">Chelsea</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>although Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will not sell to another Premier League club.</p>
              </div>
              <p>His absence prompted an angry response from Andre Villas-Boas, the new Spurs manager, who told the Spanish sports newspaper AS that this latest move on Modric's part would not go down well with the club's chairman, Daniel Levy. Villas-Boas said: "I think Modric is wrong. This will go against him. He has worsened the situation with what he's doing and now the chairman [Daniel Levy] is very angry."</p>
              <p>The deal to sell Modric to Madrid has been accepted by both sides as a probability for some time, but the two clubs have not been able to get close to agreement on a fee for the player, with Levy chasing a value of around £40m. Spurs' priority is a cash deal and that is still the most likely outcome, although it is not impossible that a player might be put in by Madrid. So far they have offered the Turkish midfielder, Nuri Sahin, whose high wages are a problem for Spurs.</p>
              <p>Villas-Boas admitted selling Modric would be a “big loss” and has already warned the 26 year-old of Spurs’ determination to achieve the right price for him and the club is braced for a transfer saga that could run until the window closes.</p>
              <p>Modric’s advisers, however, hope to move things along on Monday and are trying to persuade Real to raise their bid.</p>
              <p>Levy has consistently proved to be not only a stubborn negotiator but a man who will dig in his heels if needs to be - as he proved when stating that Modric was not for sale at any price last year and had to stay despite a series of offers from Chelsea culminating in a bid of £40 million. In return, Modric refused to sign a new contract.</p>
              <p>As has been the way in recent dealings with Levy and big-name departures from Tottenham, the chairman holds all the cards having persuaded Modric to sign a six-year deal in May 2010, which puts the club firmly in the driving seat. The 26-year-old took Spurs to the brink last summer in an attempt to leave for Chelsea but failed, and once again he is unlikely to break the resolve of Levy.</p>

              </span></div>
              <div class="widget storyContent article widget-editable viziwyg-section-1825 inpage-widget-6296940">

              <p>The Croatia international is determined to leave White Hart Lane for the Bernabeu this summer but a price cannot be agreed for the player.</p>
              <p>Standard Sport can reveal negotiations have been complicated because Modric’s old club, Dinamo Zagreb, inserted a five per cent sell-on clause when he joined Spurs for £16.6million in 2008.</p>
              <p>It is why Tottenham are demanding close to £40m for his signature, rather than the £35m fee that has been reported.</p>
              <p>Dinamo Zagreb president Zdravko Mamic, whose son, Mario, is one of Modric’s representatives, said: “I don’t deal with Modric, professionally speaking, but Luka is like a son to me, as well as a friend.</p>
              <p>“Of course I want him to sign for Real because Dinamo stand to earn a lot from the transfer. We would get five per cent of the fee.”</p>
              <p>Real Madrid have offered £27m so far and their president, Florentino Perez, is adamant they won’t go any higher.</p>
              <p>He said: “The limit for the Modric deal is 35m euros. We will not pay any more than that for him.”</p>

              <h3>LUKA MODRIC has made a grovelling apology to chairman Daniel Levy for going on strike.  </h3>

              <div class="clear-left">
              <div id="bodyText">
              <p>The Croatian playmaker stopped off at Tottenham’s HQ to play down his latest bust-up with Levy before he eventually flew to America for his club’s pre-season tour.</p>
              <p>Modric, 26, hoped his no-show at Heathrow on Sunday would force Spurs to push through a deal with Real Madrid. But the tactic infuriated Levy, who wanted to hit him with a £15,000 fine for each day he was on strike.</p>
              <p>Boss Andre Villas-Boas said last night: “The club must protect themselves. We have to hold on to our values and rights. Last year Luka behaved professionally. Unfortunately this is the first time he has taken these actions and it is not common professional behaviour.</p>
              <p>“Either the clubs interested must now meet our demands regarding his value or the player must continue with his club duties.</p>
              <p>“Hopefully this won’t drag on as it doesn’t help Luka or us.”</p>
              <p>Modric has already been fined £80,000 after refusing to train last week and Levy has made it clear he can only leave if a club meet his £40million valuation.</p>

              <p><strong><span>Tottenham have rejected Real Madrid's latest £38million offer for Luka Modric as the transfer saga threatens to drag into the new season.</span><br></strong></p>
              <p><span>And the Bernabeu club are now threatening to completely pull their interest in the wantaway midfielder as frustration grows at Spurs' hardline negotiation tactics.</span></p>
              <p><span>Modric is one of Jose Mourinho's primary transfer targets this summer and the Spanish giant's have already seen several bids turned down by the White Hart Lane club.</span></p>
              <p><span>The latest to be refused is a £30million offer plus an additional £8m in add-ons spread across the length of the Croatian's contract.</span></p>
              <p><span>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has set a £40million asking price for Modric and will not accept a penny under the asking price.</span></p>
              <p><span>Levy is also said to be unhappy with the structure of Madrid's latest offer, wanting more money up front and less in add-ons.</span></p>
              <p><span>The rebuffed offer is yet another blow for the Spanish club in their summer-long chase to sign Modric - who has agreed personal terms on a five year deal with Madrid.</span></p>
              <p><span>And it is understood Real chiefs have told their Tottenham counterparts they will now look at alternative midfield targets - with a move to re-sign Wesley Sneijder from Inter Milan a possibility.</span></p>
              <p><span>Whether Madrid's threat to pull the plug on their interest in Modric is serious or merely a bargaining ploy remains to be seen, but nevertheless the long-running saga is showing no signs of coming to a conclusion.</span></p>
              <p><span>Tottenham are adamant Modric - who still has four years to run on his current deal - will stay in north London if Madrid do not meet the asking price.</span></p>
              <p><span>The 26-year-old remains desperate to quit White Hart Lane for Real ahead of the new season.</span></p>
              <p><span>Modric has embarked on a mini-revolt by boycotting pre-season training sessions and the club's tour of the US.</span></p>
              <p><span>Andre Villas-Boas' side will return to London today with the Portuguese manager seeking a quick resolution to the Modric affair in one way or another.<br></span></p>
