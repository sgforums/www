              <h1>Is FIFA'S Man Of The Match Award Really Fair?</h1>
              <h2>Goal.com's Ewan Macdonald investigates how the top man is chosen.</h2>
              <p><span id="divAdnetKeyword">Perhaps nobody was more surprised than 
              Cristiano Ronaldo himself when he was awarded the official FIFA man of 
              the match award during Portugal's 0-0 draw with Cote d'Ivoire. After 
              all, other than one delicious shot that rattled the woodwork, he had a 
              quiet game by his standards. Meanwhile the likes of Gervinho and Kolo 
              Toure, and even an out-of-position Didier Zokora, all seemed better for 
              the Ivorians.<br><br>To find the answer as to why CR7 topped the charts,
               we need to look at how the man of the match was chosen. The answer is, 
              by text message and online vote.<br><br><strong>New Era<br><br></strong>For
               the first time, is chosen by the fans. Previously such votes existed on
               the FIFA website, but the official Man of the Match, whose name would 
              be immortalised in the record books, was selected by a committee known 
              by the somewhat Orwellian name of the FIFA Technical Study Group.<br><br>Now
               that this panel of experts has been replaced by democracy, there have 
              been both complaints and plaudits levelled at FIFA. Those on the side of
               the vote believe that previous systems were elitist, based on 
              exclusion, and often shrouded in needless secrecy. The fans, the 
              lifeblood of the game, were not afforded the privelege of choice. 
              Meanwhile others will contend that voting can comprise a mere popularity
               contest, or is open to abuse from spoilers.<br><br>Which system is 
              correct? Well, both, which is why <strong>Goal.com</strong> offers the 
              pair. From our worldwide readership comes the wisdom of crowds and the 
              true feelings of the fans on the ground. Meanwhile our editorial team 
              strives to offer a balanced, technical, and wholly unbiased view of 
              proceedings. Most fans, of course, do likewise, but at the same time 
              there are certain loyalties that can come into play. And of course as 
              there is little barrier towards voting,e ven people who didn't watch the
               game can have their say!<br><br>Now that each team has played one 
              match, here we have compiled a table indicating the Man of the Match 
              awards from FIFA fans, the Goal.com editors, and of course you, the 
              readers. Some conclusions to draw from the below:<br> 
              </span></p><ul>
              <li>On just a quarter of occasions - four of sixteen - were all parties 
              in agreement.</li>
              <li>FIFA Fans and Goal.com Editors chose the same on a mere four 
              occasions -  and each one of those was a "clean sweep."</li>
              <li>Goal.com Editors and Goal.com Fans met an accord on just five.</li>
              <li>FIFA Fans and Goal.com Fans picked the same player on fully eight 
              occasions.    
              <ul>
              <li>It appears, then, that the Fans have more in common with each other 
              than with Editors.</li>
              <li>It could even be that the two Fan bases overlap.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              </ul>

              <p>the only thing unfair about it is that usually strikers or attacking midfielders are the one who grabs it.</p>
              <p>defensive midfielders, only when they score goals, or defenders when the match is a dull boring one, or one keeper who's on form saving like 10 shots will then be considered.</p>
