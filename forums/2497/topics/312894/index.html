              <p><span style="color: #888888;"><strong>Abou Diaby is sent off after a nasty looking tackle on Gretar Steinsson</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Arsene Wenger had no complaints about Abou Diaby's red card in the 3-2 win at Bolton — but the Arsenal manager said it did not compare to the lunge that broke Eduardo's leg.</strong></p>
              <p>The Ivorian midfielder was sent off in the 31st minute for a reckless challenge on Gretar Steinsson. Diaby's tackle drew comparisons with the foul by Birmingham defender Martin Taylor which broke Eduardo's leg last month.</p>
              <p>Wenger, who initially wanted Taylor banned for life for that offence, said: "Diaby was a fraction high and he can't complain. "But there was no comparison with the foul on Eduardo because that tackle was much higher."</p>
              <p>Eduardo insisted this week would forgive Taylor for the horror tackle. "He came to the hospital but I did not see him," he said. "My wife told me he came to see me while I was having the operation. "Maybe he was there when was unconscious but if he comes to me now then I will accept an apology."</p>

              <p><strong>Arsène Wenger has denied that Abou Diaby’s dreadful tackle on Gretar Steinsson during Arsenal’s 3-2 victory away to Bolton Wanderers on Saturday was as bad as the infamous challenge by Martin Taylor that nearly ended Eduardo Da Silva’s career.</strong></p>
              <p>Da Silva, the Arsenal and Croatia striker, is expected to be sidelined for nine months after breaking a leg during the Barclays Premier League match against Birmingham City last month. Wenger initially called for Taylor to be banned for life before retracting his comments, but the Arsenal manager had a different view of Diaby’s challenge on Steinsson. “He hit him, but it was not comparable to what happened a few weeks ago,” Wenger said. “The tackle was a fraction high. I don’t complain about the red card.”</p>
              <p>Steinsson, the Iceland defender, escaped serious injury as Diaby became the sixth Arsenal player to be sent off this season after Chris Foy, the referee, showed him a straight red card. “The red card was the referee’s decision,” Steinsson said. “It was not down to me. He caught me on the ankle, but I was in the process of jumping.”</p>
              <p>Defeat at Bolton would have virtually ended Arsenal’s title hopes, but a stirring comeback kept Wenger’s team six points behind Manchester United. “After an hour we were 2-0 down, it was pouring with rain and we were playing Bolton away – it couldn’t have been worse,” Robin van Persie, who scored Arsenal’s second goal, from the penalty spot, said. “It was unbelievable what happened. A little miracle that we summoned the strength to fight back. Out of little miracles sometimes come big miracles.”</p>
