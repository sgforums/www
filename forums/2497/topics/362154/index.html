              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Carlo Ancelotti is set to be unveiled as Chelsea's new manager this week and the FA Cup winners will make a further statement of intent by stepping up their pursuit of $50million forward Sergio Aguero.</strong></p>
              <p>Ancelotti is expected to confirm his intention to move to Stamford Bridge after his current employers, AC Milan, complete their Serie A season against Fiorentina.</p>
              <p>Chelsea also believe they have overtaken Inter Milan and former manager Jose Mourinho in the race to sign Atletico Madrid's Argentine star Aguero, one of the hottest properties in world football.</p>
              <p>Sources in Italy insist Ancelotti will take up the reins at Chelsea this week, with the only doubt being about precisely when he will start work. If sacked he could, in theory, take over tomorrow but if he resigns the clubs are likely to spend the day discussing compensation and so delay his arrival until Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Ancelotti, who will rely on former AC Milan team-mate Ray Wilkins to help him settle in after his efforts to bring in backroom staff from Italy were foiled, is said to have agreed a three-year contract worth almost $5m a year, with a bonus of nearly $1m more for every major trophy he wins.</p>
              <p>To help him do that, Chelsea are moving closer to signing Aguero, the Argentina international who would help provide the flair owner Roman Abramovich craves. The 20-year-old is almost certain to leave Atletico Madrid this summer and join the club's previous idol, Liverpool's Fernando Torres, in the Premier League.</p>

              <p><strong>Manchester City have also shown a keen interest in Aguero, but even the deep pockets of the club's Abu Dhabi owners will not persuade him to join a club who cannot provide him with Champions League football.</strong></p>
              <p>Chelsea, who had an offer for Aguero rejected last summer, are one of the few clubs who could afford anything close to the $50m fee specified in his contract's buy-out clause and securing his services would be a bold statement of intent for the new era, as well as one in the eye for Inter and Mourinho.</p>
              <p>The Italian club had hoped that Argentina manager Diego Maradona, whose daughter Giannina is Aguero's girlfriend and mother to their baby son, Benjamin, would help persuade his compatriot to leave Spain for Serie A, just as Maradona himself did in 1984, when he left Barcelona for Napoli.</p>
              <p>But it is understood that Chelsea are now in pole position to sign him. Jose Segui, who works for Aguero's representatives, IMG, said: 'I cannot deny big European clubs want Aguero, but the decision is down to Atletico.'</p>

              <h1>Aguero Commits Future To Atletico Madrid</h1>
              <blockquote>
              <h2>Los Colchoneros received another boost after qualifying for the
              Champions League, with 'El Kun' committing to the club for next season.</h2>
              <p>Speaking to reporters after the match, Aguero said, "I am happy with our campaign.<br><br>"We had good and bad moments. We played in the Champions League, and with some signings, we can win titles next season."Aguero then eased the concerns of Atleti fans worldwide by pledging his
              future to the club, continuing, "I want to continue here, and I expect
              to win a title next season."<br><br>The Argentine forward then
              expressed his wish that his partner in crime, Diego Forlan, would also
              stay at the club, stating, "It would be great if he stayed, and I hope
              we can both contribute to a title next season."</p>
