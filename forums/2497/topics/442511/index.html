              <div>
              <h2 style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">IT was Panto season at the Emirates last night with the villain getting booed and the hero having a laugh at Arsenal's expense.</h2>
              <p>Former Gunner Samir Nasri was the villain — and Manchester City keeper Costel Pantilimon the hero.</p>
              <p>Nasri was jeered every time he touched the ball while back-up Pantilimon produced two breathtaking saves in a fierce opening exchange that should have seen Arsenal go ahead.</p>
              <p>And the last laugh in this Carling Cup quarter-final went to Sergio Aguero, who mugged the Gunners with a sensational winner for City seven minutes from time to give the blue half of Manchester their first victory at Arsenal for 36 YEARS. </p>
              </div>
              <p>Romanian stopper Pantilimon kept City in it and Aguero shoved Arsenal out of it.</p>
              <p>The home side were unable to find the killer touch in front of goal despite their dominance.</p>
              <p>It was clear Arsenal fans thought it was the colour of money that took Nasri away from the Emirates, not the colour of his shirt. And they let him know what they thought of his 'treachery'.</p>
              <p>They sang "You only went for the money" and chants of "Stand up if you hate Nasri" echoed off the terraces.</p>
              <p>And whenever Nasri touched the ball, he got the bird.</p>
              <p>The money? Well, that works out at around £180,000 a week for the Frenchman.</p>
              <p>The fee? That was a whopping £24million, a pittance for mega-spending City but a transfer deal that works out at only a few quid less than the entire cost of the side Arsene Wenger put out.</p>
              <p>The difference? Hardly any... except where it mattered most. In front of goal where Aguero showed his undoubted class.</p>
              <p>There seemed little danger when Arsenal lost the ball on the edge of City's area and the visitors launched what looked like a half-hearted break on 83 minutes.</p>
              <p>Edin Dzeko picked up the ball and increased the pace of the attack with a slide-rule pass that found Adam Johnson bursting through.</p>
              <p>The England winger wrong-footed the Gunners defence with a clever flicked pass and Aguero finished magnificently.</p>
              <p>Sure, it was tough on the Gunners, who went for City's throat but ended up cutting their own when they were caught by a classic counter-attack.</p>
              <p>But it had been so different in the first half as Arsenal went desperately close to going ahead when Francis Coquelin floated over a teasing 12th-minute cross that picked out Chu-Young Park at the far post. The South Korean met the cross with a first-time shot but was left banging the ground in frustration as Pantilimon somehow turned a corkscrew in the air and palmed the ball away.</p>
              <p>Stefan Savic mopped up the mess at the far post with a cool clearance that steadied City's nerves.</p>
              <p>That a goal never came in the first half was down to Pantilimon.</p>
              <p>He bettered his earlier save when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slammed in a dipping 25th-minute drive that had goal written all over it until the Romanian fisted the ball away.</p>
              <p>The Gunners, a collection of first-team wannabes and future hopes, took the game to City.</p>
              <p>And such was their progress with Oxlade-Chamberlain dominating down the right that City boss Roberto Mancini hauled off Aleksandar Kolarov and threw on Aguero with just 32 minutes on the clock.</p>
              <p>Dzeko went close for City with a cheeky 57th-minute backheel from a surprise cross by Nigel de Jong.</p>
              <p>It had been 28 games over those 36 long years since City last won at Arsenal and they rode their luck as they ended that record.</p>
              <div>They were given a lesson in passion and desire by young kids who know their only hope of a game is in the Carling Cup — the competition Wenger rates as the least important.</div>
              <p>Arsenal were beaten finalists back in February and have been to the semi-finals five times in nine seasons.</p>
              <p>But the late winner from Aguero is one of the biggest lessons these young Gunns will learn.</p>

              <p>Manchester City's former Arsenal star clashed with Gunners midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong after the final whistle.</p>
              <p>There has been bad blood between the pair since Frimpong reacted to Nasri's £24million switch to City in August by tweeting: "Money is the root of all evil."</p>
              <p>And the pair squared up to each other after Sergio Aguero's 83rd-minute winner booked City's place in the last four of the Carling Cup.</p>
              <p>A Gunners spokesman said: "Words were exchanged — and that was that.</p>
              <p>"No punches were thrown but there was a lot of noise. Samir was speaking in French but they did not touch. It was handbags."</p>
              <p>Nasri received a hot reception from baying Arsenal fans who booed his every touch.</p>
              <p>City boss Roberto Mancini revealed: "I played him to spare him a hostile reception when we play here in the Premier League.</p>
              <p>"I think Nasri can play better than he did tonight — he's a top player. But this was the first time he came back to Arsenal and maybe he was nervous.</p>
              <p>"It was not easy for him coming back here."</p>
              <p>Aguero's late winner gave City their first win at Arsenal for 36 years and keeps the Premier League leaders and FA Cup holders on course for a domestic Treble.</p>
              <p>Mancini said: "The season starts now. December and January will be crucial months because we have some big games. After that we will see where we are."</p>
              <p>Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said: "I felt we were a bit naive with the goal. We made it easy for them to score.</p>
              <p>"I disagree with the Arsenal fans' reaction to Nasri. I want the players who play with us respected.</p>
              <p>"There are no hard feelings, I'm sure the fans love him and wanted him to be here."</p>
              <p>The semi-final draw will be held after tonight's tie between Manchester United and Crystal Palace.</p>
