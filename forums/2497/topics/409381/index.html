              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Sam Allardyce reignited his feud with Arsene Wenger yesterday, suggesting the </span></strong><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/arsenal.html"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Arsenal</span></strong></a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong> manager once produced the dirtiest team in Premier League history.</strong> </span></p>

              <div class="thinCenter">
              <p class="imageCaption"><span style="color: #000000;">Allardyce has lost just six times to Arsenal in 16 League meetings as manager of </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/bolton-wanderers.html"><span style="color: #000000;">Bolton</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/newcastle-united.html"><span style="color: #000000;">Newcastle</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> and Blackburn and, with Wenger once again complaining about a lack of protection for goalkeepers ahead of today's trip to Ewood Park, Big Sam was quick to remind him of his own club's poor disciplinary record in their heyday. </span></p>

              <p>'Players like Vieira, Petit, Campbell and Keown would mix it anyway you wanted to mix it. They would say, "C'mon, what kind of game do you want to play?" and then completely dominate you.</p>
              <p>'His (Wenger's) change of tactics from that day is quite remarkable. He has a team bred on getting the ball down and passing and moving, and we all agree it is the most pleasing football anyone can watch. But they are still not as good as that team he used to have.</p>
              <p>'They used to cause everyone huge fear whenever you faced them because you wondered how you could beat them. Now there is a way.'</p>
              <p>That 'way' involves exploiting Arsenal's weakness to long balls and set-pieces.</p>

              <p><strong>Wenger yesterday acknowledged that his team would have to be ready for the bombardment from Paul Robinson's long goal kicks.</strong></p>
              <p>A look at the physical specimens Allardyce has at his disposal emphasises the struggle ahead: Christopher Samba is 6ft 4in, Nikola Kalinic 6ft 3in, Steven Nzonzi 6ft 3in and Ryan Nelsen 6ft - all threats in the air.</p>
              <p>'You have to be physically much stronger than you did in the old days,' adds Allardyce.</p>
              <p>'You use those strengths and abilities to promote your skills as a footballer. 'One of our areas of good ability is our aerial presence. When we aerially bombard any team with our quality, skill and ability, we cause them problems.</p>
              <p>'On Saturday morning it will be a case of trying to expose Arsenal's weaknesses if we can, and then we might be able to get something out of the game. We have found a niche, an opportunity and a way to beat Arsenal.</p>
              <p>'Our technical and tactical ability on several occasions at Bolton and here have been better than theirs and that is why we won. It is nothing to do with bending or breaking the rules, nothing to do with bullying. We've never got the credit we deserved for our technical and tactical work, me as a coach and manager or the players.</p>
              <p>'We should never beat Arsenal but we do. It is not rugby tactics because rugby tactics are illegal in football. Until the game becomes a non-contact sport, the physical side of the game is very important.'</p>
              <p>Last season saw Blackburn win 2-1 at Ewood Park and Wenger once again moaned about his goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski not being given enough protection.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="imageCaption">Tough guys: Allardyce says Emmanuel Petit (left) and Patrick Vieira (centre) could mix it with the best</p>

              <p><strong>It was that which partly provoked his attack about teams playing rugby instead of football, words Allardyce was delighted to hear.</strong></p>
              <p>'If Arsene is saying something now it means he is worried before we even start and that can only be positive from our point of view. It means they are worried about what we are going to do and how we are going to do it. Last season we managed to beat them within the rules, contrary to what he says.</p>
              <p>'I am a little bit surprised he bites so easily. It is not just about this next game coming up, it's been over a period of years with me.'</p>
              <p>Wenger has bitten many times with many people and last week it was Paul Scholes on the receiving end. The Frenchman accused the Manchester United midfielder of having 'a dark side', provoking an annoyed response from Sir Alex Ferguson yesterday.</p>
              <p>'I don't know why he said that,' argued the United boss. 'Paul is not the best tackler but he has not injured anyone in his time here. He should focus on the strengths and abilities of someone and the contribution he has made to English football over an 18-year period. It is phenomenal.'</p>
              <p>Ferguson then stirred things up further, suggesting the same accusation could be levelled at one of Arsenal's stars, a comment which might have Cesc Fabregas wondering after his various run-ins with United.</p>
              <p>'It is very easy to look into the dark side of any player. I could say the same about one of the Arsenal players, in particular, but I don't need to do that.'</p>

              <h2>KEOWN'S DEFENCE</h2>
              <p>Sam Allardyce's comment about the Arsenal team I played in is disrespectful, provocative and unnecessary the day before a match.</p>
              <p>Yes, we could be physical but we could also play football. And when we were physical it was mostly in response to the way teams played against us.</p>
              <p>We weren't a dirty bunch - we were hard but fair. There was a time when we had so many red cards that I said to the manager we might become the first team to win the title with only 10 players.</p>
              <p>But there are no regrets. That team will not be remembered for its dirtiness.</p>
              <p>It will be remembered for its flair and flowing passing and I'm proud to have played with some of the greatest players we will ever see at Arsenal.</p>
