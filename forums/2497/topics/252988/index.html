            <div class='col-md body'>There could yet be a shock twist to the English Premier League title race.<br><br>Manchester United face a probe, which could lead to a points deduction, into Tim Howard's 3 million pounds(s $9million) transfer to Everton.<br><br>The goalkeeper joined Everton on a year-long loan deal last summer, and it was made permanent in February.<br><br>Under the loan deal, he could not play for Everton against United. But that restriction no longer applied when the deal was made permanent.<br><br>Still, United asked for Howard not to play against them on April 28 as one of the conditions of making the transfer permanent.<br><br>So Everton played Iain Turner. They were up 2-0 when the second-choice goalkeeper made a bad mistake to allow John O'Shea to score.<br><br>The Red Devils eventually won 4-2 at Goodison Park.<br><br>Both clubs have declined to comment.<br><br>The League's spokesman Dan Johnson told the News of the World : " As Howard is a permanent transfer, there is no reason why he could not have played against Manchester United.''<br><br>"Had such a clause been included in the transfer, we would not have allowed it. It would have been a clear case of third-party interference.''<br><br>The issue of third-party agreements in player transfers has been under the spotlight. West Ham were fined a record 5.5million pounds on April 27 for breaking the rules over the transfers of Argentinians Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano.<br><br>Last season, Brimingham were refused permission to insert a clause into transfer deal forbidding Robbie Savage playing against them for his new club, Blackburn</div>
