In an interview due to be published on Friday, the striker, 29, says morale has plummeted since Jose Mourinho left.</strong><br><br>"I want to leave Chelsea. Something is broken with Chelsea," Drogba said. "The damage is big in the dressing room." But Chelsea said: "Didier signed a new four-year contract last year. As a top professional we're sure he is committed to Chelsea and intends to honour it."<br><br>France Football is a well-established magazine in France that awards the Ballon d'Or for the European Footballer of the Year.<br><br>Drogba joined Chelsea from Marseille for Â£24m in July 2004 and has been the subject of regular speculation since then despite a prolific record with the Blues. He signed his new deal last November but told the BBC the following month that he had considered leaving the previous summer in the wake of Chelsea's second successive league title.<br><br>In the interview, Drogba is quoted as saying he wanted an even earlier exit and will not change his mind even if the club make high-profile signings next summer. "Nothing can stop me from leaving now," he said.<br><br>Drogba says Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan or Inter Milan would be his preferred destination. "Since the day I arrived, I wanted to leave Chelsea and then again every summer," he said. "I know that Ronaldinho and Kaka are linked to come next season but even that won't change my mind."<br><br></div>

"I am a Chelsea player and will be 100% committed and supportive to my manager, my team-mates and the club," he said in a statement released by Chelsea. "I will not be discussing my future any further until I meet privately with the club at the end of the season."</strong><br><br>In an interview with France Football, he said he "wanted to leave Chelsea". "Something is broken with Chelsea," he was quoted as saying. "The damage is big in the dressing-room. "Nothing can stop me from leaving now," he added, listing Barcelona, Real Madrid, and both Milan clubs as possible destinations.<br><br>Drogba, 29, joined Chelsea from Marseille for Â£24m in July 2004 and has been the subject of regular speculation since then despite a prolific record with the Blues. His comments suggested the Ivory Coast star was keen to leave the club in the January transfer window.<br><br>But Chelsea manager Avram Grant said on Friday he was keen to speak to the player in private to quell any further dressing-room unrest. "I can't tell you something because I read it in the paper. I need to discuss it with him," Grant said. "I have read many things that were not true about problems in the dressing-room.<br><br>"Now you know there was no problem in the dressing-room until now and I hope it will continue like that. "This attitude has brought us good results in a very difficult time. "I am very happy with the atmosphere and the attitude of the players until now and I am sure that it will continue."<br><br>Drogba signed a four-year contract in November 2006 but told the BBC the following month he had considered leaving the previous summer in the wake of Chelsea's second successive league title.<br><br></div>
