The Swedish ref was accused by Chelsea boss Mourinho of letting Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard into his dressing room at half-time of their Champions League clash in February 2005.</strong><br><br>After a stormy game in which the Blues were beaten 2-1 and had Didier Drogba sent off, Frisk retired after receiving death threats from Chelsea Â‘fansÂ’. UEFA later banned Mourinho for two games and called his Frisk allegations Â‘more than frivolousÂ’.<br><br>Now as Chelsea prepared for tonightÂ’s Champions League showdown against Valencia, Frisk has put his side of the story.He said: Â“It all started after I shook hands with Rijkaard as we left the field. "While I saw Jose Mourinho before the match, I had not seen Rijkaard and it was just a friendly Â‘Welcome to BarcelonaÂ’ handshake.<br><br>Â“The handshake was dynamite. There was a big brawl in the tunnel, all started because of my handshake. Â“Some people were aggressive because the Barcelona coach shook my hand. "The truth about RijkaardÂ’s alleged visit was we didnÂ’t get into the dressing-room at half-time. The man with the key was involved in the brawl!<br><br>Â“Officials from both clubs were involved as I reported to UEFA.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Uefa: Rijkaard did approach Frisk<br>But vindication will only frustrate Blues<br><br>Staff and agencies<br>Thursday April 7, 2005<br><br>Guardian Unlimited<br><br>Chelsea's resentment at their treatment by Uefa over the Anders Frisk affair intensified today after confirmation that Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard was ordered back to his dressing room by the match official during that infamous match in the Nou Camp.<br>Jose Mourinho was banned for two games last week and he and Chelsea were fined for bringing the game into disrepute, after their claims that Rijkaard met Frisk in the referee's room.<br><br>The club have since accepted Frisk spoke to Rijkaard outside his room but have been adamant all along that such an approach by the Barca coach took place - a claim supported by Uefa's venue director Pascal Fratellia and today confirmed by Uefa.<br><br>The revelation will serve to further infuriate Chelsea and Mourinho who are already angry at the club being branded cheats and liars by Uefa officials in the build-up to the disciplinary hearing.<br><br>The club could also claim that there had been a cover-up of what really happened at half-time during the Champions League first leg on February 23, especially with Rijkaard having claimed he only shook Frisk's hand.<br><br>Fratellia says in his report that he personally spoke to Frisk immediately after the match. His report states: "The referee told us that he had contact with Frank Rijkaard from the pitch to the front of his dressing room door (closed). Rijkaard wished to say hello to Frisk at the beginning of the tunnel and then tried to talk to him climbing the stairs.<br><br>"Frisk told us then that he said to Rijkaard that it was not the moment or the place to speak about any match situation and instructed him when he was in front of his dressing room door (closed) to go to his dressing room."<br><br>Frisk reported a similar version of events to Uefa, but saying he could not understand some of what Rijkaard was saying. However, Fratellia's version is contradicted by Uefa officials Frits Ahlstrom and Graham Turner, who were also present for the post-match meeting with Frisk.<br><br>It is understood that Chelsea pointed out these inconsistencies at last week's disciplinary hearing in Switzerland, believing it showed that the truth of what happened was not accurately conveyed by all those involved.<br><br>Assistant manager Steve Clarke and security official Les Miles had claimed to have seen Rijkaard coming out of Frisk's room but the fact they were only given reprimands indicates the panel accepted there had been a misunderstanding over where they actually saw him.<br><br>Chelsea are unlikely to appeal, despite today's revelations, because they do not want to risk an increased ban for Mourinho.<br><br>The Chelsea boss' real mistake was to question Frisk's integrity in the Portuguese magazine Dez Record, saying the result was "adulterated" and that he was not surprised when Didier Drogba was sent off in the second half.<br><br>Fratellia's version clears Frisk of any misbehaviour but does point the finger at Rijkaard. A Uefa spokesman said: "We are aware of the comments regarding Frank Rijkaard speaking to Anders Frisk. This observation was made in the referee's report and included in the case file together with the report of the venue director.<br><br>"All parties had full access to the case file and examined it and the verdict of the disciplinary panel took this into account as well. Chelsea and Jose Mourinho have since waived their right to appeal." </span></div>
