              <p><em>Suits you: Kenny Dalglish is said to be interested in returning to the Anfield hotseat</em></p>
              <p><a class="addstories-link myst-add myst-article-1285106" rel="1285106|3| nofollow" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1285106/King-Kenny-comes-calling-Dalglish-tells-Liverpool-return-manager.html"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Kenny Dalglish has put himself forward for the Liverpool manager's job after telling the Anfield hierarchy that he wishes to withdraw from the selection panel.</strong></p>
              <p>After parting company with Rafa Benitez last week, the club issued a statement saying that Dalglish would lead the search for a new manager alongside managing director Christian Purslow. </p>
              <p>But the 59-year-old, who quit as Liverpool boss in 1991 before going on to manage Blackburn and Newcastle, has taken one look at the shortlist of candidates and decided he could do a better job than those who have so far been identified.</p>
              <p>Dalglish's passion for the club has never been in question and he now believes he is the man to revive them after a difficult end to Benitez's tenure.</p>
              <p>Despite the Scot's transition from king-maker to would-be king, Liverpool will still seek permission to meet Fulham manager Roy Hodgson by the end of the week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thinFloatRHS"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/08/article-0-0978DAF8000005DC-820_239x349.jpg" alt="Roy Hodgson" width="239" height="349"></div>
              <p><em>The 62-year-old Hodgson (right) had been seen as the favourite to succeed Benitez, who will be confirmed as the new Inter Milan manager today.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Hodgson has made no secret of his wish for one more high-profile job, whether it be as manager of England or a leading club in the Barclays Premier League, and his feats at Fulham have not gone unnoticed.</strong></p>
              <p>Fulham chairman Mohamed Al Fayed is desperate to keep the veteran Englishman, who maintained his focus on the London club's future yesterday by signing Philippe Senderos from Arsenal, but the call from the Anfield hierarchy is expected soon.</p>
              <p>Compensation is unlikely to prove an obstacle, with Hodgson on a 12-month rolling contract at Craven Cottage and a fee of around £2million should be enough to secure his release.</p>
              <p>Liverpool were rocked by infighting last season between Benitez and top boardroom figures and the club are anxious to end the recent turbulence by bringing in an experienced figure capable of restoring harmony.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Liverpool fans were informed yesterday that season-ticket prices have increased by seven per cent for the next campaign.</p>

              <h2 class="padding-bottom-7" style="line-height: 1.05em; font-size: 1.05em;">ROY HODGSON will get a £2million jackpot from Fulham in the hope of keeping him away from Liverpool. Owner Mohamed Fayed is prepared to double the manager's salary to make him stay at Craven Cottage. </h2>
              <p>Hodgson, 62, signed a £1m-a-year 12-month rolling contract in January but is Liverpool's top choice to replace sacked Rafa Benitez.</p>
              <p>Fulham insist they have had no approach yet but are braced for a fight to hang on to their manager.</p>
              <p>Al Fayed recently made <strong>£1.5BILLION</strong> from the sale of posh London store Harrods and has vowed to use it to plough more cash into the club.</p>
              <p>Hodgson is also a candidate to eventually replace England boss Fabio Capello and could miss out if he joins Liverpool this summer and the Italian quits after the World Cup.</p>
              <p>A Fulham insider explained: "Leaving Fulham to take over at England would be seen as the pinnacle of Roy's career.</p>
              <p>"And everyone thinks that's what he would love to do.</p>
              <p>"He could miss out on that if he gets tempted by Liverpool and then the England job comes up not long after.</p>
              <p>"There's also the question of Liverpool being up for sale at the moment. Roy could go there under the current owners, new men come in and the job could end up being very short-term."</p>
              <p>Hodgson's stock is at its height after he led Fulham to an unlikely Europa League final last season.</p>
              <p>In barely two years, he saved the club from relegation then clinched seventh place in the Premier League and European football on a relatively meagre budget.</p>

              <p class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15"><img class="blkBorder" src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/10/article-1285518-09EAAEB2000005DC-785_306x423.jpg" alt="King Kenny: Dalglish wants another crack at the top flight" width="306" height="423"></p>
              <p class="imageCaption"><em>King Kenny: Dalglish fancies a return to the top flight</em></p>
              <p class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15"><br></p>
              <p class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15"> </p>
              <p><strong>Should Roy Hodgson become the new manager of Liverpool, he will do so knowing that Kenny Dalglish wanted his job. And there we were thinking that Rafael Benitez’s departure was meant to cure Anfield of its internicine politics.</strong></p>
              <p>Instead the in-fighting may grow worse now that Dalglish, the Club Ambassador, has put his employers in an awkward position by allowing it to be known that he wants to be considered for the post.</p>
              <p>He must have done so aware that thousands of supporters would swing behind King Kenny, deluded by romantic notions that he can click his fingers and bring the good times back to Merseyside. After all, his only valid claim to the job, more than a decade after he last worked in management, is his popularity.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Christian Purslow, the managing director, now finds himself in an unenviable position, given that scepticism about Hodgson around Anfield is liable to increase simply on the back of Dalglish’s expression of interest.</p>
              <p>But then doubts about Hodgson are reasonable, too. Is the Fulham manager, able though he is, truly the best man for the job or is he someone soothing, someone grateful for the opportunity, who can muddle through during a turbulent period?</p>
              <p>To decide on an easy option without chasing after more ambitious targets such as Guus Hiddink, or even speaking to Martin O’Neill, is dangerous short-termism at a time when Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres are considering their futures.</p>
              <p>It paints a sorry picture of Liverpool, a great club fast in danger of becoming a Premier League basket case, where the owners are divided, the club is in vast debt and even loyal players are disaffected.</p>
              <p>On the terraces, Mark Hughes is dismissed not because he has negligible experience in Europe but because he is associated with Chelsea, Everton and Manchester United. Dalglish is considered credible by many simply because he is King Kenny.</p>
              <p>At this rate Liverpool will become another Newcastle United — a club where emotions run high and logic flies out of the window.</p>

              <p>Dalglish spent 14 years as player and then boss at Anfield and has thrown his hat into the ring to succeed Rafa Benitez following the Spaniard's departure last week.</p>
              <p>'I just think that hopefully he does get it because I know how much he wants it,' said Paul, now head coach of Tampa Bay Rowdies.</p>
              <p>'To be honest with you it would be an unbelievable story for my dad to be going back.</p>
              <p>'Some people say, well what happens if it doesn't work? He's been out of the game for 10 years.</p>
              <p>'My question is, what if it does work? What person loves Liverpool more than my dad?</p>
              <p>'Who would Liverpool fans love to see have success more than my dad? Nothing could make my family more proud. I'd love to see it happen.'</p>
              <p>Paul, a former Liverpool reserves striker, backed Sammy Lee to work alongside Dalglish.</p>
              <p>He added in the Liverpool Echo: 'Sammy Lee is a great coach and very passionate about Liverpool. He's the best man for that job. I don't think they'd sleep at night until they were successful.' </p>

              <p>because of his track record. he never stay long in the job for long. when a manager quitted, the work he has done and players bought, are all back to square one, including the backroom staff. a new manager comes in with his new backroom staff, sell and buy the players he need and doesnt need. is it not a disruption?</p>
