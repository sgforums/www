            <div class='col-md body'>Mourinho: I'm a good loser<br><br>Jose Mourinho has declared that he is not a bad loser and that surrendering the Premiership title to Manchester United did not hurt as much as he had expected.<br><br>After guiding Chelsea to Premiership glory in his first two seasons at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho had to congratulate Sir Alex Ferguson last week as United clinched the title.<br><br>Mourinho will again pit his wits against Ferguson in the FA Cup final next Saturday, and he maintains that he has already put his Premiership disappointment behind him.<br><br>"After all that has happened this season - and that is a lot - I've reached the conclusion that I am a good loser," Mourinho said in the News of the World<br><br>"Losing the title to Ferguson and Manchester didn't hurt me as much as I thought it would.<br><br>"After four years in a row of winning the league title at Porto and then with Chelsea, I thought when I didn't win it would be unbearable.<br><br>"But it is not. I have dealt with it and I am fine."<br><br>Far from viewing this season as a failure, Mourinho insists his players have done superbly to run United close in the face of adversity.<br><br>"Our season has been extraordinary," he explained.<br><br>"The first season here was incredible because the club won its first title in 50 years, but this year I can almost say I am prouder.<br><br>"My group fought like warriors, they have given everything even when others were saying hope had gone."<br><br>Mourinho also warned that Chelsea would mount a stronger challenge next term.<br><br>"We will come again. Chelsea will come again and fight for the title again."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jose Mourinho has defended the contribution of Chelsea's summer recruits.<br><br>The Blues saw their stranglehold on the Premiership prised off by Manchester United and some have pointed the finger at Chelsea's summer signings.<br><br>Chelsea splashed out some Â£30million on Andrei Shevchenko, grabbed Germany star Michael Ballack on a free transfer and also brought in England full-back Ashley Cole and forward Salomon Kalou.<br><br>The quartet have shown only flashes of their true form, but Mourinho has been happy with their first seasons at Stamford Bridge.<br><br>"Young Salomon has done fantastically for a boy coming from a different culture," said Mourinho.<br><br>"He is still very naive but his contribution has been very, very good.<br><br>"For Ashley Cole it was not easy to change. Willie's (Gallas) season at Arsenal was also not superb.<br><br>"I think it is easier to go from Chelsea to Real Madrid or from Arsenal to Real Madrid. But Ashley has played well. He is one of the heroes who has played injured the whole season and his integration has been smooth.<br><br>"Ballack, even against some opinion, has contributed to the team very positively. In big moments, he scored the goal to put Chelsea into the FA Cup final and scored the goal that put us in the Champions League semi-final.<br><br>"Sheva's season was not what everyone was thinking, including myself. In his defence he has a history of many years in a completely different culture. That can be on his side.<br><br>Would a good loser say this -&gt;"For Ashley Cole it was not easy to change. Willie's (Gallas) season at Arsenal was also not superb.<br><br>why a need to mention Gallas??<br><br></div>
