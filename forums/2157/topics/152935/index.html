            <div class='col-md body'>SHOCK No 1: A woman, now known to be a Filipino maid, had been hacked to death with parts of her body found at Orchard Road and MacRitchie Reservoir.<br><br>Shock No 2 came yesterday: The alleged hack-and-carry killer is not a man as expected, but a woman.<br>Click to see larger image<br><br>For Filipina Pamela Wee, shock No 3 was news that the police arrested a fellow Filipina, a maid who works in Singapore.<br><br>Mrs Wee, a housewife, had the same reaction as most in the Filipino community who heard the news that a maid had been arrested yesterday, at 12.40am.<br><br>'The area where the head was found is popular among Filipinos, especially on Sundays,' she said.<br><br>'I already had a bad feeling that it could be a fellow countryman.'<br><br>Then came the question on many lips: 'How does a woman have the strength to chop the body and carry it around with her?<br><br>'Why was she killed in the first place? This case is the only thing we talked about all day.'<br><br>News that the two main characters in the latest body parts case were Filipina maids had spread quickly among the Filipino community and was the hot topic in town.<br><br>Mrs Wee, 32, who married a Singaporean and moved here from Manila three years ago, had met up with three other friends outside Lucky Plaza, a favourite haunt among Filipinos.<br><br>She had read from newspapers that a woman's head and limbs had been found in a blue sports bag outside the busy Orchard MRT station on Friday.<br><br>The woman's torso was later discovered in a suitcase at MacRitchie Reservoir, clad only in her underwear.<br><br>Police believe that she is a 26-year-old Filipina maid but are not releasing her name until her family back home is informed.<br><br>The New Paper on Sunday found out that she is married and is known as Jane. She came from northern Luzon in the Philippines and has worked here for a few years.<br><br>Less than 12 hours after the body parts were discovered, the police swooped on Sunglade condominium in Serangoon Ave 2.<br><br>There, they took another Filipina maid called Guen back for questioning. They also seized some red plastic bags and a chopper with a 17cm-long blade from the apartment.<br><br>She was arrested after they interviewed her.<br><br>CHARGED TODAY<br><br>The suspect, 29, who works for a permanent resident, will be charged with murder before a magistrate in a special court sitting today.<br><br>Her employers were out of the country when the alleged murder took place.<br><br>Both maids knew each other well and are said to be from the same province.<br><br>The New Paper on Sunday understands that the police are still trying to establish a motive, and where the killing took place.<br><br>It is still a mystery how the bag was transported to Orchard Rd. Footage from security cameras at the MRT station did not capture anything suspicious.<br><br>Evidence from the trolley bag at MacRitchie had apparently linked the suspect to the killing. Could fingerprints have been left behind?<br><br>Jane's slightly decomposed body was found by a cleaner behind the mosaic wall near Orchard MRT station on Friday during lunch time, just metres away from the pedestrian walkway.<br><br>No identification papers were found on her but the police traced her through her fingerprints.<br><br>How can a woman have the strength to dismember another human being? While it may seem incredible, this is not the first time that a woman has dismembered a body.<br><br>In 1974, Singaporean housewife Sim Joo Keow, 44, chopped up the body of her sister-in-law, Ms Kwek Lee Eng, 53, after strangling her during a fight over money.<br><br>Sim had got the idea from seeing fish being chopped up in the market. She was convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and jailed 10 years.<br><br>The legs were discovered in a shed off Aljunied Road, the head and arms on a tree by the banks of Kallang River and the torso in Sim's house in Jalan Besar.<br><br>The dispute which led to the murder had been over a sum of $3,000, which Sim owed.<br><br>For now, fellow Filipinos can only wonder what could have happened between the two women for it to end in a killing.<br><br>Ms Mary Dime, 35, a sales assistant at a handphone accessory shop at Lucky Plaza, thinks it could be a money dispute or jealousy.<br><br>'Maybe the killer got angry with her over another man or it could just be about money,' said Ms Dime.<br><br>'I can't think of what else could lead a person to kill. I'm interested to know who the two women are because they could very well be my customers too.'<br><br>Officials from the Philippines Embassy met the suspect at the Police Cantonment Complex yesterday, where she is being held for investigations.<br><br>The embassy has also arranged for a lawyer for her when she appears in court this morning to face the murder charge.<br><br>Other killer maids<br><br>FILIPINA Flor Contemplacion, 42, was hanged here for murdering another Filipino maid and a Singaporean boy in 1991.<br><br>Contemplacion had handed over to Mrs Della Maga, 34, a package to be carried to the Philippines. It was large and heavy, and when Mrs Maga objected, Contemplacion became angry, strangled her and drowned Mrs Maga's ward, four-year-old Nicholas Huang.<br><br>In 1997, another Filipina, Edna Sumawang, 33, who had come here to work, was arrested after the killing of her sister-in-law, Mrs Anita Fuggan, also a maid, in a Pasir Ris flat.<br><br>The two women had fought before Sumawang stabbed Mrs Fuggan, 36, with a pair of scissors. She was found guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and jailed for three years.<br><br></div>
