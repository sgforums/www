              <p><span class="messageBody">The above is a very meaningful article. It says why we worry about this life which is so short (most of us live less than 100 years old). Most of us can't remember exactly what happened few years or few days ago but that does not mean those days did not exist. Likewise for our past lifes, we can't remember but that does not mean we have no past lifes.</span></p>
              <p><span class="messageBody">We worry about tomorrow and future which we can't see and can't predict. Our future in this life is so short. We have countless of future lifes and yet very few bother to care. If we care so much and plan for this short life time, don't you think we should care more and plan for our countless future life times.</span></p>

              <p>Mistakes, regrets and wrongs... it makes us human when we are aware of it. One's action on each turn of events should be a reflection of one's wisdom on one's life. These are not burdens, but little treasures that make life worth the living. Don't dwell on the inevitabilities, work on the endless possibilities that life can be as good as it gets.</p>

              u asking a dead man to give money? sorry we don't teach superstition.  pray for money or 4d number is not buddhism. 
                  even then the prince became a homeless, where got money? 
                  and if want, there's a way in Dharma, to gain wealth, but not all people dare to do. thats èˆ� å¾—. u can learn this from the true original story of God of wealth. the more he gave, the more he gain.

              <p>we worry about our future, old age, sickness, no money, etc. basically these are uncertainties. since we aged, fall sick, and will die in old age or diseases, why worry. when the time for you to go, just go and then reincarnate.</p>
              <p>I heard that when K Sri Dhammananda, who passed a few years back, was told by his oncologist that he had cancer, he started laughing. his doctor was taken aback by his attitude, as most of his cancer patients, when told that they had cancer, either broke down, worried sick or depressed.</p>

              <p>we worry about our retirement funds ie CPF, we worried we have enough money to last until we die, we worry if we will be unhealthy in old age, we worried when the stock market goes down, we worried if our children are growing up healthy and their ability to cope with their studies, we worried if our spouse is faithful to us, we worried if the company will retrench us when we are older and how to find a job after retrenchment?</p>
              <p>we worried sick with all these things from young to old. there is not a moment when we enjoy a day without worrying about all these things. since its a fact of life there is diseases, sicknesses, death, old age, why worry. will worry improve our present situation?</p>

              <p>Can you ask Buddha to give enough money to every one before asking everyone not to worry?</p>

              <p>As long as the money is not spent, the money is not yours because you do not know whether you have the opportunity to spend it.ä¸�çŸ¥ä½ æœ‰æ²¡æœ‰å‘½èŠ±ã€‚ Life is so unpredictable.</p>
              <p>Instead of adding to your possessions, reduce from your desires. As one of the Venerable said, if you don't have the merits to have so much money, even if someone gives you a bank, the bank will collapse. å‘½é‡Œæ²¡æœ‰ï¼Œé€�ä½ ä¸€é—´é“¶è¡Œï¼Œé“¶è¡Œéƒ½ä¼šå€’ã€‚Buddha had already taught us the way to accumulate merits, it is just many people who don't believe and don't listen.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>live IS unpredictable. People tend to be caught up in the environment or rat-race they are in and lose focus on what really matters in life. A life or death situation will make you realise what is relevant in live to you. I know as i have experience it. Your need to focus less on things like brand-consciousness, money, status, reputation, expectations. Things that wont matter to you and focus more on people, oneself and inner peace. Its a lifelong process and im trying now, struggling actually.</div>

              <p>i heard if u ask a lot of very rich ppl, most of them are not happy. and they say if they can do it all over again, they rather spend more quality time with a complete family. think most of them don't have a healthy family and they need love, spiritural wealth than material wealth.</p>
              <p>in an extreme manner, i think in nowaday big enviroment, one cannot be too poor also. it's hell like. so suffering that there's no time to cultivate.</p>
