              <p>one way to curb this is to control your mind by meditation. the other is by positive thinking. also it is good to learn to let go, as this is very difficult. most of us are attach to our career, money, family, wife, kids, parents etc.</p>

              room every day. worrying about death. i think he lose the meaning
              of living. he cant let go of his wealth and status.</p>

              Why a young person like me can let go, he can't let go? He should have enough wisdom to Kan Po or See Through.

              <p><br>Yes, you are correct. Wisdom is what many people lack of. Some people can be very old but have no wisdom. Though you are young, you have wisdom. Congratulations!</p>
