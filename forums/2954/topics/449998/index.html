This naturally includes the hells, where there is the most suffering. He is also with King Yama (a wrathful Dharmapala deva; Dharma-protector god) to support his work of meting out justice. With King Yama together at one place, which represents their like-mindedness in wanting to serve justice, he is however seated apart, which represents Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's objectivity. <br><br><strong>2.</strong> Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is in the hells to help ensure that the guilty realise their mistakes, to offer second opinions in case judgements and karmic records are muddled up, to ensure those who reached the hells are karmically there at the right time, as some might die in untimely ways, who karmically should resurrect to their previous lives, thus escaping the hells (for good later, if they make amends in time.) He also receives and guides those departing from the hells, so as to ensure they are reborn accordingly, with appropriate parting advice where possible. <br><br><strong>3.</strong> These deeds above do not limit his boundless skilful means in the hells. For example, he also encourages those with the appropriate conditions to be mindful of Buddha, so as to swiftly create great merits (to dilute the effects of negative karma) and connect to the Other-power of a Buddha to leave the hells. However, it is very difficult for the very evil who have weak good roots to practise this well. (The more reluctant one is to practise mindfulness of Buddha well in the human realm, the harder it will be to do so if one reaches the hells. See <a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/303"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #234786;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/303</span></span></a> to check if your Faith, Aspiration and Practice is resolute enough, and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/248"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #234786;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/248</span></span></a> for the story of 'The Boy Who Lacked Good Roots'.)<br><br><strong>4.</strong> It is interesting that Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is sometimes mistaken as King Yama in Chinese culture. In a way, since he aids King Yama in his work, he is as if an extension of King Yama, and can override King Yama's role in authority too. In this sense, King Yama's final decisions and actions are ultimately bodhisattvic in nature, to admonish the evil and to awaken repentance in them. Judgements in the hells will always be karmically fair and accurate - as manifestations of the natural processing of karma.<br><br><strong>5.</strong> Even when there seems to be some 'unfairness' or 'misjudgements' along the way, they are still natural karmic processes in function, unfolding and ironing out themselves, with lessons to learn for the guilty. Such is the case for 'unfair' sentences in the human world too, which can be appealed against, just as Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva can change the mind of King Yama. Appeals fail only when one is truly guilty in one way or another. In the larger picture, everything turns out fair. If karma can process itself naturally, is there a need for the roles of King Yama and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, in helping to ensure there is justice? Ultimately, no. However, just as it is useful to have good human judges in our world to serve as living moral examples and purveyors of justice, their compassionate presence makes a lot of sense.<br><br><strong>6.</strong> Perhaps not all hell-beings get to encounter King Yama and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, as there are non-Buddhist recollections of hell experiences (if they are true accounts) without mention of them. Perhaps the presence of the two can be seen as skilful manifestations by beings of great compassion, only perceived by those who have the karmic affinity to receive their teachings of both gentle and tough love, as exemplified by Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva and King Yama respectively. Of course, with or without King Yama and Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, life in the hells, being a realm manifested and sustained naturally by karma, goes on.<br><br><strong>7.</strong> If King Yama is, as described in the sutras, an actual being, could the demonic hell guards be 'actual' too? Or are they merely manifestations from hell-beings' guilty minds? It is possible both ways. They can be karmically manifested from hell-beings' minds and/or be 'actual' beings, also experienced karmically. Usually, they are taught as the first to emphasise the primary cause for their appearances being karmic, of heir own making. Hell guards being 'actual' is only possible when they are enlightened beings manifesting to teach hell-beings via the wrathful way, because the suffering in the hells is so intense for hell-beings that no ordinary beings there would be distracted by the urge to cause others to suffer. In this sense, any 'actual' hell guards must be very special. They must be 'above the law', as in not being able to suffer themselves, and not being able to create any negative karma, as there is nowhere worse to go to as a negative karmic result of inflicting great suffering upon others. However, when we speak of 'hell in our world', such as during a World War, there can be actual torturers, who are also experienced karmically by their victims, although the torturers definitely create negative karma if their intention is to harm. <br><br><strong>8.</strong> The mindful and thus meritorious practice of creating Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva’s images, copying of this sutra, and/or mindfulness of his name enables one to reach Amituofo's Pure Land if the process of doing so includes the proper Three Provisions of Faith, Aspiration and Practice. (See <span style="text-transform: none; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-family: arial; white-space: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-size: small; font-weight: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/229"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #234786;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Amituofo/message/229</span></span></a> for details) </span>The practice of mindfulness of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's name is the easiest practice for doing so, and the guidelines for doing so are the same as those when practising mindfulness of Amituofo's name, especially crucially applicable on the deathbed, in order to connect to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, to be received by him, to be directed to Amituofo's Pure Land. Upon reaching Amituofo's Pure Land, as empowered by Amituofo's vows, one will be able to access other Pure Lands, heavens and any other realms to accumulate wisdom and merits, and practise compassion. <br><br><strong>9.</strong> This sutra about Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, 'The Buddha Speaks of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva Sutra' (ä½›è¯´åœ°è—�è�©è�¨ç»�), is very concise, in comparison to 'The Sutra of the Original Vows of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva' (åœ°è—�è�©è�¨æœ¬æ„¿ç»�), which is much lengthier. However, despite its brevity, it doubly focuses (repeats) on how Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva vows to personally guide beings to Amituofo's Pure Land by default. This is in contrast to the longer sutra which teaches the benefits of mindfulness of Buddhas in general, without mention of specific ones. (Note that the specific Buddha or Bodhisattva one is mindful of will appear by corresponding cause and effect when dying.) All great Bodhisattvas will guide beings to be reborn in the Pure Lands these beings choose. For beings unsure of which Buddha or Bodhisattva to be mindful of, and which Pure Land to go, mindfulness of Amituofo is recommended directly by default as his Pure Land is universally recommended by all Buddhas. <br><br><strong>10.</strong> It should no longer be mistaken that Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's good works are confined to guiding beings in the hells, as they extend to guiding beings to Pure Land too. (He guides beings to avoid and leave the hells; not to reach them, and the point furthest and safest from the hells is Pure Land.) In fact, as stated in the sutra, he also manifests in Amituofo's Pure Land to always accompany and guide beings to Buddhahood. This is after all, the complete scope of perfect compassion, the guiding of beings at every level - from the 'worst' to the 'best'. As Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva personifies perfect Practice in Buddhism, and was entrusted and empowered by Shakyamuni Buddha to guide beings in our world to enlightenment (at least) before the arrival of Maitreya Buddha, his choice of<span style="text-transform: none; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-family: arial; white-space: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-size: small; font-weight: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"> guiding beings here to Amituofo’s Pure Land also represents it being the most skilful choice for us, both due to its excellence and our great affinity with it.</span><span style="text-transform: none; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-family: arial; white-space: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-size: small; font-weight: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><br></span><br><strong>11.</strong> <span id="yui_3_2_0_1_133321105356295" style="text-transform: none; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-family: arial; white-space: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-size: small; font-weight: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">There is an account of a man who felt closer to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, who requested that the longer sutra above be chanted to aid his smooth passing, instead of the relatively more popular Amitabha Sutra with the name of Amituofo. However, amazingly, after his confirmed passing, a single recital of 'Namo Amituofo' was heard from his body left alone in his room. What could had happened is that the deceased managed to connect to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, who appears and teaches him to be mindful of Amituofo with the Three Provisions, to be born in his Pure Land. This redirection is aligned to the teaching in this sutra! </span><br style="text-transform: none; font-variant: normal; font-style: normal; text-indent: 0px; font-family: arial; white-space: normal; letter-spacing: normal; font-size: small; font-weight: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"></p></div>

              <p>Yes, this is what I'm referring to. In fact, just recite his name daily. It still works when one did not recite his name 1000 times a day and have not fulfilled 1000 days, just recite his name daily.</p>
