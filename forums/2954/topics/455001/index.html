              <p>Yes, you are correct. To be born as humans is not easy. Once we lose our human bodies, it will take a very long time or countless life times to be reborn as humans again. Thus, we should cherish this lifetime, practice and liberate ourselves from being reborn in samsara again.</p>
                  <p>The safest and more secure practice is to vow to be reborn in Amituofo's Pureland as this world is full of temptations, to rely on our merits is not good enough. We need both our own merits and Amituofo's vow.</p>

              <p>é˜¿å¼¥é™€ç»�‏ is not about emptiness. It is about Pureland. Pureland is different from heaven. Heaven is still within the reincarnation 6 realms. Meaning heavenly beings will have to go through reincarnation after their good merits have depleted. Whereas Pureland is a place without sufferings and temptations, it is an ideal place for us to practice till we achieve Buddhahood. Pureland is more for people who can't achieve enlightenment in this life.</p>
              <p>Though I do not know your objective, but by reciting é˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½› can help you have a smooth sailing life.

              Thanks for enlightening me. My shixiong told me to chant it only when I have achieve wealth and stability and was about ready to leave this world. You are absolutely correct about the 2 sutras is about emptiness and that sutras can improve our lives better and bazi becomes irrelevant.

              <p>May be you are trying to say that decent people like you and your wife are having a tough life whereas people who are not decent lead a better life. You and your sister-in-law have not come to the end of life yet, thus you can't tell who's leading a happier life by judging now. People who are not discipline easier get into trouble in life. I've seen friends who are not discipline gambling at casino and end up heavily in debt.</p>

              <p>é˜¿å¼¥é™€ç»�‏ is not about emptiness. It is about Pureland. Pureland is different from heaven. Heaven is still within the reincarnation 6 realms. Meaning heavenly beings will have to go through reincarnation after their good merits have depleted. Whereas Pureland is a place without sufferings and temptations, it is an ideal place for us to practice till we achieve Buddhahood. Pureland is more for people who can't achieve enlightenment in this life.</p>
              <p>Though I do not know your objective, but by reciting é˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½› can help you have a smooth sailing life. There's a sayingå¿µä½›ä¸€å£°ï¼Œç¦�å¢žæ— é‡�ï¼Œç¤¼ä½›ä¸€æ‹œï¼Œç½ªç�­æ�’æ²™ã€‚I've recited Amituofo for many years and I've seen changes in my life. As long as your objective is right, by reciting é˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½›will help you to achieve your objectives in your life.</p>
              <p>Heart Sutra and Diamond Sutra are about emptiness. There were people who chant Heart Sutra and Diamond Sutra and they were enlightened. For me, I find this world is full of temptations, I have no confidence in attaining enlightenment, thus I chose Pureland practice.</p>

              <p><br>About 50% of the people around me are divorcees. Someone did ask shifu whether it was karma that caused her to divorce. Shifu said not everything that happens in life is due to karma. There are many times are our own free will. Shifu said we should not say that it is due to karma (some cases are due to karma) but most of the times are due to situations or conditions (å› ç¼˜) that we are in. Most of the time, we have the ability to change it, it is whether do we want to.</p>
              <p>I feel nothing strange about hearing people getting divorce. It is as normal as hearing someone is getting married.</p>

              <p>During our parents' days, couples stayed together for the sake of the children. People have different thinking nowadays. One of my friend said that sometimes marriage has to beå°†é”™å°±é”™. I think it depends on case to case basis.</p>
