              <p>In the lower realm (say hell or ghost realm), the hell beings suffer all the time. If one is reborn in the lower realm (let's say hell or ghost realm) due to some reasons, one will be relieved of sufferings on those days or time when he/she was a vegetarian as a human in his/her past life.</p>
              <p>Let's say the person is a vegetarian on 1st and 15th of every month, he will be relieved of sufferings on 1st and 15th if he is reborn in hell or ghost realm due to some reasons. If the person is a vegetarian at lunch time, he will be relieved of suffering in hell or ghost realm during lunch time if he is reborn in hell or ghost realm due to some reasons.</p>

              <p>Yeah, talking about 8 precepts. I understand that if one observes  1 day of 8 precepts on earth, one has accumulated enough merits to go to heaven. However, heaven is not a permanent place, one will still go through reincarnation after the merits are depleted. I'm actively participating in observing 8 precepts event in temples nowadays but my aim is to be reborn in Amituofo's Pureland.</p>
              <p>I also understand that observing 1 day of 8 precepts on earth is equivalent to 100 years of practice in Amituofo's Pureland. Reason being it is more difficult to practice on earth than in Amituofo's Pureland.</p>

              <p>in Contemplation Sutra, we see the Queen observing the 8 precepts given by a Buddha's disciple. Queen later reborn in PL.  8 precepts is a powerful merit that one can recall even during the bardo state, good rebirth will still befall you. can use it as a "çŽ‹ç‰Œ" to reborn in PL. :)</p>

              <p>Yes. Followings are the 8 precepts. In fact, it is not difficult to observe just for 24 hours because sleeping already takes up at least 8 hours.</p>
              <p>1) No stealing</p>
              <p>2) No telling lies</p>
              <p>3) No sexual activities (including husband and wife relationship)</p>

              <p>8) No eating after 12 noon but allow to drink (don't worry that you will go hungry.

              <p>I think it is better to read Dharma books on that day as we have to try our best to have a pure mind on that day. Anyway, I don't think you will have the time to read any books because the event usually starts early in the morning like 8.00 am till night about 8 pm. By then you reach home, take a bath and it will be almost bed time.</p>

              <p>I think it is better to read Dharma books on that day as we have
              to try our best to have a pure mind on that day. Anyway, I don't
              think you will have the time to read any books because the event
              usually starts early in the morning like 8.00 am till night about 8
              pm. By then you reach home, take a bath and it will be almost bed
              time.</p>

              <p>Oh. I was thinking about doing it by myself. I didn't know I had to go to a temple to observe the 8 percepts.</p>

              <p>Sheer curiosity... why the interest in New Age books?  Any
              specific areas of interest?</p>

              <p>I enjoy reading about psychic abilities. It seems a very interesting subject and seems even more so since it is not discussed by many.</p>
