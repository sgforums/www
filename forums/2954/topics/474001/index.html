              Hi all, 
              
              I just read this book on commentary of Hsin Hsin Ming (ä¿¡å¿ƒéŠ˜) poetic text verse on the Faith Mind by Sosan Zenji, Third Zen 
              
              Patriarch. I saw many forummers' questions which has an answer within the verses. It helps me by clarifying the path ahead 
              
              and I hope it will do the same for you too. If you don't understand what it means, you may like to read the book which goes 
              
              into more detail explanation in the commentary. The book is titled "The Eye Never Sleeps - Striking to the Heart of Zen" by 
              
              Dennis Genpo Merzel (ISBN: 0-87773-569-7; Publisher: Shambhala). Even if you don't understand after reading the book 
              
              commentary, your reading would have planted a good seed which will surely ripen for you when the conditions are right in 
              
              future.
              
              If you need help to access the book, drop me a private message.
              
              With Metta, the following are the verses (The words in parenthesis are the chapter title of the above mentioned book) :
              
              (1. Have No Preferences)
              
              The Great Way is not difficult
              for those who have no preferences.
              When love and hate are both absent
              everything becomes clear and undisguised.
              Make the smallest distinction, however,
              and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart.
              If you wish to see the truth
              then hold no opinions for or against anything.
              To set up what you like against what you dislike
              is the disease of the mind.
              When the deep meaning of things is not understood
              the mind's essential peace is disturbed to no avail.
              
              (2. Serene in the Oneness of Things)
              
              The Way is perfect like vast space
              where nothing is lacking and nothing is in excess.
              Indeed, it is due to our choosing to accept or reject
              that we do not see the true nature of things.
              Live neither in the entanglements of outer things,
              nor in the inner feeling of emptiness.
              Be serene in the oneness of things
              and such erroneous views will disappear by themselves.
              When you try to stop activity to achieve passivity
              your very effort fills you with activity.
              As long as you remain in one extreme or the other,
              you will never know Oneness.
              
              (3. Return to the Root)
              
              Those who do not live in the single Way
              fail in both activity and in passivity,
              assertion and denial.
              To deny the reality of things
              is to miss their reality;
              to assert the emptiness of things
              is to miss their reality.
              The more you talk and think about it,
              the further astray you wander from the truth.
              Stop talking and thinking
              and there is nothing you will not be able to know.
              To return to the root is to find the meaning,
              but to pursue appearances is to miss the source.
              At the moment of inner enlightenment,
              there is a going beyond appearance and emptiness.
              The changes that appear to occur in the empty world
              we call real only because of our ignorance.
              Do not search for the truth;
              only cease to cherish opinions.
              
              (4. Undisturbed in the Way)
              
              Do not remain in the dualistic state;
              avoid such pursuits carefully.
              If there is even a trace
              of this and that, of right and wrong,
              the Mind-essence will be lost in confusion.
              Although all dualities come from the One,
              do not be attached even to this One.
              When the mind exists undisturbed in the Way,
              nothing in the world can offend,
              and when a thing can no longer offend,
              it ceases to exist in the old way.
              
              (5. Objects Vanish, Mind Vanishes)
              
              When no discriminating thoughts arise,
              the old mind ceases to exist.
              When thought objects vanish,
              the thinking-subject vanishes,
              as when the mind vanishes, objects vanish.
              Things are objects because there is a subject or mind;
              and the mind is a subject because there are objects.
              Understand the relativity of these two
              and the basic reality: the unity of emptiness.
              In this Emptiness the two are indistinguishable
              and each contains in itself the whole world.
              If you do not discriminate between coarse and fine
              you will not be tempted to prejudice and opinion.
              
              (6. Neither Coming nor Going)
              
              To live in the Great Way
              is neither easy nor difficult.
              But those with limited views
              are fearful and irresolute:
              the faster they hurry, the slower they go.
              Clinging cannot be limited;
              even to be attached to the idea of enlightenment
              is to go astray.
              Just let things be in their own way
              and there will be neither coming nor going.
              
              (7. Obey Your Own Nature)
              
              Obey the nature of things
              and you will walk freely and undisturbed.
              When thought is in bondage the truth is hidden,
              for everything is murky and unclear.
              The burdensome practice of judging
              brings annoyance and weariness.
              What benefit can be derived
              from distinctions and separation?
              
              (8. Strive to No Goals)
              
              If you wish to move in the One Way
              do not dislike even the world of senses and ideas.
              Indeed, to accept them fully
              is identical with true Enlightenment.
              The wise man strives to no goals
              but the foolish man fetters himself.
              There is one Dharma, not many;
              distinctions arise from the clinging needs of the ignorant.
              To seek Mind with discriminating mind
              is the greatest of all mistakes.
              
              (9. All Dualities Are Like Dreams)
              
              Rest and unrest derive from illusion;
              with enlightenment there is no liking and disliking.
              All dualities come from ignorant inference.
              They are like dreams of flowers in air:
              foolish to try to grasp them.
              Gain and loss, right and wrong:
              such thoughts must finally be abolished at once.
              
              (10. Timeless Self-Essence)
              
              If the eye never sleeps,
              all dreams will naturally cease.
              If the mind makes no discriminations,
              the ten thousand things
              are as they are, of single essence.
              To understand the mystery of this One-essence
              is to be released from all entanglements.
              When all things are seen equally
              the timeless Self-essence is reached.
              No comparisons or analogies are possible
              in this causeless, relationless state.
              
              (11. Movement and Stillness Disappear)
              
              Consider motion in stillness
              and stillness in motion,
              both movement and stillness disappear.
              When such dualities cease to exist
              Oneness itself cannot exist.
              To this ultimate finality
              no law or description applies.
              
              For the unified mind in accord with the Way
              all self-centered striving ceases.
              Doubts and irresolutions vanish
              and life in true faith is possible.
              With a single stroke we are freed from bondage;
              nothing clings to us and we hold to nothing.
              All is empty, clear, self-illuminating,
              with no exertion of the mind's power.
              Here thought, feeling, knowledge, and imagination are of no value.
              In this world of Suchness
              there is neither self nor other-than-self.
              
              (12. Not Two)
              
              To come directly into harmony with this reality
              just simply say when doubt arises, "Not two."
              In this "not two" nothing is separate,
              nothing is excluded.
              No matter when or where,
              enlightenment means entering this truth.
              And this truth is beyond extension or diminution in time or space;
              in it a single thought is ten thousand years.
              
              (13. Empty Infinity)
              
              Emptiness here, Emptiness there,
              but the infinite universe stands
              always before your eyes.
              Infinitely large and infinitely small;
              no difference, for definitions have vanished
              and no boundaries are seen.
              So too with Being and non-Being.
              Don't waste time in doubts and arguments
              that have nothing to do with this.
              
              (14. To Live in This Faith)
              
              One thing, all things:
              move among and intermingle,
              without distinction.
              To live in this realization
              is to be without anxiety about nonperfection.
              To live in this faith is the road to nonduality,
              because the nondual is one with the trusting mind.
              
              Words!
              The Way is beyond language,
              for in it there is
              	no yesterday
              	no tomorrow
              	no today.
