              <tr>
              <td width="100%"><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>It is definitely true that bowing before
                          the Buddha and Bodhisattvas to pay respects has merits. However, merits and blessings are
                          different. Generally, when a person performs an act of giving, it is often knowledged that
                          his "merits are boundless". Over time, the practice becomes a habit, resulting
                          in a confusion between merits and blessings. To one who has enlightened to the truth, his
                          virtuous deeds can be considered meritorious. Prior to that his noble deeds are acts of
                          cultivating blessings.</strong></span>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Many people
                          criticize Buddhism for worshipping idols and images. In reality, many religions in this
                          world worship idols and images. Those who pass such remarks about Buddhism may themselves
                          pray religiously to idols and images. From an ultimate point of view, we will realize that
                          Buddhism is the only religion that does not worship images. It is only because of sentient
                          beings’ attachment to forms and images that the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas manifest
                          themselves in these forms. Generally speaking, people who do not yet have a profound
                          understanding of Buddhism, need to rely on the image of the Buddha as a guide. To those
                          who have been enlightened to the truth, they are capable of realizing that in Buddhism the
                          ultimate reality is formless. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Let me illustrate with an example. Supposing there are
                          some young children in kindergarten whose grandparents have long passed away, and they
                          never knew how they looked like. The teacher may use pictures to illustrate how generally
                          grandpas and grandmas would look like. These children will learn to understand that
                          grandpa looked like an elderly man, and grandma looked like an elderly woman. These
                          children soon progress to primary level education, followed by secondary level and
                          eventually university education. It would be ridiculous for the university professor to
                          use the same pictures that the kindergarten teacher had used in reference to their
                          grandparents. At that level of education, the professor would perhaps use other more
                          appropriate terms of ancestral relationship.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>It is the same with learning Buddhism. To a beginner, it
                          helps to introduce the images of, for example, Amitabha Buddha, Avalokiteshvara (Kuan Yin)
                          Bodhisattva or Sakyamuni Buddha, in order to inspire their respect for them. When one has
                          attained a certain higher level of understanding, then one will be able to realize the
                          following as stated in the Diamond Sutra: "All forms are but illusions; in seeing
                          that all forms are illusory, then one sees the Tathagata." As to the true meaning of
                          the "Buddha characteristics" of "all forms are illusory", it can only
                          be realized through cultivation and awakening.</strong></span></p>

                          incense is symbolic of ethics and morality. These are the virtues of the Bodhisattva
                          spirit of benefiting others and self. If we do not practise ethics and live immorally,
                          then the offering of incense does not serve any purpose. Offering of incense is only
                          meaningful if our conduct befits the correct standard and principle of ethics and
                          morality. </strong></span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Flowers
                          are symbolic of wisdom. We learn and practise Buddhism to unfold and develop our wisdom.
                          When the wisdom blossoms in each and everyone of us, then as human beings, our conduct is
                          like flowers in bloom. Everyone admires beautiful flowers and they are welcomed
                          everywhere. Thus, when we make an offering of flowers to the Buddha, it is that we want to
                          be like the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas who are so filled with wisdom.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Water serves two purposes. Firstly,
                          it quenches our thirst. A drink of water is so soothing and comfortable when we are
                          thirsty. Secondly, it is for cleansing, for example, washing our clothes or the floor,
                          etc. When we learn and practise Buddhism, the Dharma is like the morning dew, cleansing
                          the impurities of our hearts and minds so that we are soothed and happy.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>The offering of fruits is made not
                          because Buddha wants to eat them. When we learn and practise Buddhism, and perform
                          virtuous deeds, these virtuous deeds should bear sweet fruits. Thus, the offering of
                          fruits is symbolic of the results of our virtuous deeds. It is best to offer fruits that
                          are round. This is again symbolic that when we cultivate in accordance to the
                          Buddha’s teachings, we will eventually be perfectly rounded and attain the fruit of
                          Buddhahood. For obvious reasons, we should not offer fruits that are sour, bitter or of
                          unpleasant shapes.</strong></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a id="bowing" rel="nofollow" name="bowing">What is the significance of bowing before the images of the Buddha and the Bodhisattvas? Is there any merit in doing so?</a><br><br></span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #008040; font-size: small;">Bowing before the Buddha image</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>It is definitely true that bowing before the Buddha and Bodhisattvas to pay respects has merits. However, merits and blessings are different. Generally, when a person performs an act of giving, it is often knowledged that his "merits are boundless". Over time, the practice becomes a habit, resulting in a confusion between merits and blessings. To one who has enlightened to the truth, his virtuous deeds can be considered meritorious. Prior to that his noble deeds are acts of cultivating blessings.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Many people criticize Buddhism for worshipping idols and images. In reality, many religions in this world worship idols and images. Those who pass such remarks about Buddhism may themselves pray religiously to idols and images. From an ultimate point of view, we will realize that Buddhism is the only religion that does not worship images. It is only because of sentient beings’ attachment to forms and images that the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas manifest themselves in these forms. Generally speaking, people who do not yet have a profound understanding of Buddhism, need to rely on the image of the Buddha as a guide. To those who have been enlightened to the truth, they are capable of realizing that in Buddhism the ultimate reality is formless.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Let me illustrate with an example. Supposing there are some young children in kindergarten whose grandparents have long passed away, and they never knew how they looked like. The teacher may use pictures to illustrate how generally grandpas and grandmas would look like. These children will learn to understand that grandpa looked like an elderly man, and grandma looked like an elderly woman. These children soon progress to primary level education, followed by secondary level and eventually university education. It would be ridiculous for the university professor to use the same pictures that the kindergarten teacher had used in reference to their grandparents. At that level of education, the professor would perhaps use other more appropriate terms of ancestral relationship.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>It is the same with learning Buddhism. To a beginner, it helps to introduce the images of, for example, Amitabha Buddha, Avalokiteshvara (Kuan Yin) Bodhisattva or Sakyamuni Buddha, in order to inspire their respect for them. When one has attained a certain higher level of understanding, then one will be able to realize the following as stated in the Diamond Sutra: "All forms are but illusions; in seeing that all forms are illusory, then one sees the Tathagata." As to the true meaning of the "Buddha characteristics" of "all forms are illusory", it can only be realized through cultivation and awakening.</strong></span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff; font-size: x-small;"><a id="offering" rel="nofollow" name="offering">What is the significance of offering incense, flowers, water and fruits?</a><br><br></span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #008040; font-size: small;">Offering incense, flowers, water and fruits</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>The fragrance of the incense is symbolic of ethics and morality. These are the virtues of the Bodhisattva spirit of benefiting others and self. If we do not practise ethics and live immorally, then the offering of incense does not serve any purpose. Offering of incense is only meaningful if our conduct befits the correct standard and principle of ethics and morality.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Flowers are symbolic of wisdom. We learn and practise Buddhism to unfold and develop our wisdom. When the wisdom blossoms in each and everyone of us, then as human beings, our conduct is like flowers in bloom. Everyone admires beautiful flowers and they are welcomed everywhere. Thus, when we make an offering of flowers to the Buddha, it is that we want to be like the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas who are so filled with wisdom.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Water serves two purposes. Firstly, it quenches our thirst. A drink of water is so soothing and comfortable when we are thirsty. Secondly, it is for cleansing, for example, washing our clothes or the floor, etc. When we learn and practise Buddhism, the Dharma is like the morning dew, cleansing the impurities of our hearts and minds so that we are soothed and happy.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>The offering of fruits is made not because Buddha wants to eat them. When we learn and practise Buddhism, and perform virtuous deeds, these virtuous deeds should bear sweet fruits. Thus, the offering of fruits is symbolic of the results of our virtuous deeds. It is best to offer fruits that are round. This is again symbolic that when we cultivate in accordance to the Buddha’s teachings, we will eventually be perfectly rounded and attain the fruit of Buddhahood. For obvious reasons, we should not offer fruits that are sour, bitter or of unpleasant shapes.</strong></span></p>
