              <div><span style="font-size: medium;">Some people may ask, is attaining a rebirth in Pure Land the ultimate goal of all Buddhists? Informed Buddhists who possess a correct understanding of the Buddha's teachings would not aim for a heavenly rebirth because, with the exception of rebirth in the five pure heavenly abodes and Maitreya Buddha's Tushita Pureland, beings born in the heavenly realms are still within the bounds of life and death and cyclic existence. Meaning one will be reborn in the 6 reincarnation paths after one's merits are depleted. Some can be from heavenly realm to animals realm etc.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: medium;">All practicing Buddhists desire to become liberated from the cycle of death and rebirth. This is a clear goal that we all have because we can only attain lasting peace and happiness when we are totally free of the cylce of life and rebirh itself.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: medium;">The Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss is created from the great vows and aspirations of Amitabha Buddha. Even those with store of negative karma created in the past can be reborn in Pure Land, taking birth in lotuses of the lowest grade if they are able to recite the name of Amitabha Buddha with sincere devotion continuously for ten times. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: medium;">To be reborn in Amtiabha Buddha's Pure Land, one needs to have ä¿¡(faith)ï¼Œæ„¿(vow)ï¼Œè¡Œ(practice).</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: medium;">Some Buddhists practitioners pray to remain in this world out of great compassion so that they can continue with their work of teaching and benefiting sentiment beings. Buddhists in Theravada-dominant countries do not know of the existence of the Pure Lands aim to achieve Arhatship in order to attain liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth.</span></div>

              <p><strong>Why is Amituofo's Pure Land Practice So Popular ?</strong></p>
              <p>In terms of attaining liberation in a future life, Amituofo's Pure Land method has an advantage - it allows practitioners to gain rebirth there despite having negative karma.</p>
              <p>The Pureland of Ultimate Bliss is a place of unsurpassed beauty and as the name implies, this Pure Land is the happiest place in the universe. It is pure joy that is untainted by attachment and suffering.Those who are born in Pure Land experience only the highest form of happiness. No worries and sufferings.</p>

              <p>This is å¸¦ä¸šå¾€ç”Ÿ.</p>
              <p>Even with negative karma, one can still regain rebirth in Pureland, provided one has fulfilled the conditions of Faith, Vows and Practice. </p>
              <p>Practitioners continue their cultivation of the Buddhist path in this Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss, until they reach Buddhahood.  Or, they may choose to return to <em>samsara</em> to help deliver sentient beings from suffering. </p>
              <p>Being reborn in the Pureland, one is also assured of non-retrogression.  In simple terms, this means that one will not "backslide" in one's cultivation.  Pureland is a place that is conducive to Dharma practice.</p>

              <p>When a Pureland practitioner is about to pass away,  following are the  signs of gaining a Pureland rebirth :</p>
              <p>1. Knowing the time of death in advance.</p>
              <p>2. Seeing Amitabha Buddha and his entourage coming to receive him/her and</p>
              <p>3. Miraculous lights, fragrance, heavenly music or chanting filling the room.</p>
              <p>After death :</p>
              <p>1. The deceased's countenance bcomes radiant and happy.</p>
              <p>2. The body remains soft and crown of the head remains warm even after the rest of the body turns cold.</p>
              <p>3. After the cremation of the body, many coloured relics may be discovered amongst the ashes and</p>
              <p>4. Family and friends may dream of the deceased appearing happy and contented.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, there are many Pureland Practitioners able to know the time of their departure which is a sign of gaining rebirth in Pureland. This is really amazing! This is really called "Call Home By Amitabha Buddha".</p>

              <p>No matter how unreasonable our parents are, we still have to respect them. We can't be yelling at them even though they are unreasonable. Respect does not mean follow blindly what the parents say.</p>
              <p>If a person can't respect his parents, how do you expect him to respect Buddha and other sentiment beings. So, practice must start from home and those who are close to us.</p>
