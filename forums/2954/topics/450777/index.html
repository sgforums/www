              <p>In my dream, there were monsters disguised as humans but they showed their true self when I recited the buddha's name, and I was able to get away from them.

              <p>Recitation of Buddha's name is simple and auspicious at all times. Nothing will go wrong with recitation of Buddha's name. I believe many people have nightmare every now and then. I used to have nightmares last time but hardly have them anymore lately. It is a good sign because you were able to recite Buddha's name in your dream. Nothing inauspicious about your dream.</p>

In my case, I do notice that during such sessions especially during meditation, if such thoughts as anger or dislike for someone do arise, I do usually have unpleasant dream that night. No sure whether such is the case for others.</span></span></p>

              <p>Somewhat of a late reply.  I find that sometimes when I have had too much on my mind or I drank coffee/tea later in the day, I will get nightmares. </p>
              <p>I too think it's good that you were able to remember Buddha recitation even in your dream. </p>
              <p>It is also possible that we have scary dreams as a form of karmic clearing.  So, rather that experience unpleasantness in real life, you only need to experience it in your dream.  I've read one sutra that mentions such clearing of karma in dreams.</p>
              <p>If you think the dream is trying to teach you something, or your subconscious telling you to improve your behaviour, then by all means try to implement necessary corrections.  However, no need to be freaked out by such dreams. </p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Dreaming scenes</p>
              <p>If the events or scenes result from evil seeds, the practitioner, in his dreams, may see various species of worms crawling out of his body, or witness himself, night after night, removing from his body six or seven loathesome creatures with many limbs, such as scorpions or centipedes. Or else, he may see various species of wild animals and/or spirits or ghosts. Such realms are innumerable and cannot all be described!</p>
              <p>In general, individuals greatly afflicted with greed, who are miserly and wicked, usually see marks of men and women,<a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2954/topics/bwf112.htm#Note63"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[63]</span></span></a> snakes and serpents and odd species with white features and forms. Those harboring a great deal of anger and resentment usually see tigers and leopards or strange species with red forms and features. Those who are heavily deluded usually see domestic animals, clams, oysters, snails or different species with black forms and features. The above, however, is merely indicative; it does not mean that everything will be exactly as described.</p>
              <p>If the scenes in his dreams come from good, wholesome seeds, the practitioner sees tall trees and exotic flowers, beautiful scenery, brightly adorned with nets of pearls.<a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2954/topics/bwf112.htm#Note64"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[64]</span></span></a> Or else, he sees himself eating succulent, fragrant food, wearing ethereal garments, dwelling in palaces of diamonds and other precious substances, or flying high in open space.</p>
              <p>Thus, in summary, all the seeds of the ten Dharma Realms are found in the minds of sentient beings. If wholesome seeds manifest themselves, practitioners view the realms of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, human and celestial beings; if evil karma is manifested, they witness scenes from the wretched three Evil Paths. If the cultivator has followed externalist ways in lives past, he usually sees his body emitting electric waves, or his soul leaving the body to roam, meeting demons, ghosts and the like, to discuss politics and the rise and fall of countries and empires.<a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/2954/topics/bwf112.htm#Note65"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[65]</span></span></a> On the other hand, when the practitioner's mind is pure, he will know in his dreams about events that will occur three or four days, or seven or eight months, hence. In general, those who have cultivated in previous lives will immediately see auspicious realms when reciting the Buddha's name. Those with heavy karma, lacking merit and virtue, will usually see evil realms when they begin Buddha Recitation. In time, these evil omens will disappear and gradually be replaced with auspicious omens.</p>

              <p>Yes. As long as you believe in Amituofo's Pureland and his vow that he will save anyone who recites and vow to be born in Pureland. Besides that, you have to try your best to practice as per Buddha's teachings. To be born in Pureland, one must haveä¿¡æ„¿è¡Œ. As long as your vow is stronger than your bad karmaæ„¿åŠ›å¼ºè¿‡ä¸šåŠ›, you will be born in Pureland.</p>
              <p>Unlike heaven, Pureland is not within the 6 reincarnation realms. There's a possibility that heavenly beings reborn in hell, animals or ghost relams when they have no more merits to let them remain in heavenly realm.</p>

              <p><br>Sure go, just continue. All buddhism practices are classified into 4 main methods i.e Contemplation of thought, contemplation on buddha statue, Actualization over Buddha remembrance and lastly Buddha name recitation. According to Amitabha Sutra, it specifically wanted practitioner to attach on Buddha name recitation. However, once should not discriminate your practice aGainst other Buddhism methods or religions and daily living - this is called let go not on a higher ground but a more lower ground of let go. This will enhance your Buddha name recitation. </p>
              <p>If you could participate in the buddha name recitation in the temple/association or at time organzied by the association on one day or 3 days etc be relax while on name recitation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
