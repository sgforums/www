              <p>During Dharma Assemblies, we must be sincere when reciting the Sutra texts in order to touch the hearts of the attending Assembly.

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Essence of the Heart Sutra</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The 5 Aspects of existence: </strong></p>
              <p><strong>form, feeling, perception, mental formation and consciousness</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Among more than countless beings in this world, only a handful of them are "enlightened ones" who have understood the ultimate truth in life. We refer to each of them as ''Buddha''. Let's presume that the world they live in as ''The Other Shore''</p>
              <p>Most of the rest of all sentient beings mistake the real essence of life and live in distorted illusions of this world. Let's call their world ''This Shore''. People who live on This Shore are preoccupied with the subjective ego-self. At any space and time</p>
              <p>they happen to be in, they hold onto their sense of ego-self like a needle falling</p>
              <p>into a bucket of water not willing to dissolve into the water of space and time. As long as the ego-self, "I", exists, discriminations in this space and time exist, such as good vs. bad, high status vs. low status. As long as the ego-self exists there is ''they''. Through a person's own senses, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind, information is received from the external world. Sight, sound, smell, taste touch and all other phenomena these information enter a person's inner world. After the information</p>
              <p>is transferred to the cortex of the brain, it is stored in the information center, and then compared and contrasted. New information is compared with existing information</p>
              <p>and the ego-self's ever-changing emotional values are added to analyze, deduce and reason. And finally, it comes to the decision to act. Therefore, these inner responses</p>
              <p>and decision-making processes produce their results. This inner world is ever-changing in response to external stimuli and is referred to as sensations, perceptions, decisions and awareness. All of the external world including the self's own physical body which is outside of the inner mind is referred to as the material world. The external material world and the sensations, perceptions, decisions and awareness of the inner world are referred to as ''the five aspects of existence''. All living beings exist in the relative world of ego-self and objects. Therefore, there is the contrast of</p>
              <p>big vs. small, Beauty vs. ugliness. The mind distinguishes fortune from misfortune.</p>
              <p>When people live with this attitude of separating ego-self from time and place</p>
              <p>we refer this phenomenon as living in the ''REALM OF FORM''</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Emptiness</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The enlightened ones who live spiritually on The Other Shore have a different attitude</p>
              <p>toward their lives in this world. Whatever place they happened to live in they dissolve themselves into that space without any ego involvement. Whatever time they happened to live in they dissolve into that time without any ego involvement as well.</p>
              <p>"A nice hot day. Perfect for sun bathing". When an enlightened one observes flowers,</p>
              <p>"I am the flower. I am the fragrance". When an enlightened one listens to the rain,</p>
              <p>"I am the rain. I am the sound of the rain". When an enlightened one gets born</p>
              <p>grows old, gets sick and dies. "I am birth! I am aging! I am sickness! I am death!"</p>
              <p>An enlightened one lets go of the ego and sincerely embraces all changes in the external world. And mindfully appreciates any moment of space and time.</p>
              <p>An enlightened one's attitude toward living in this world is like a grain of salt</p>
              <p>dissolving into a bucket of water. A grain of salt dissolves into water </p>
              <p>as countless molecules. Although the ego-self disappears every part of the water is salty. In the water bucket of space and time, there is no more ego-self to be found. Instead, it has dissolved into one with the entirety of space and time. An enlightened</p>
              <p>one is like endless light that fills up all space. Like an endless life-span</p>
              <p>that lasts throughout all time. We refer to this attitude of high consciousness in living as: Emptiness!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Form and Emptiness</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the world is like a big meadow and everyone is a blade of grass. If you consider yourself to be a tiny blade of grass, you are living in the ''Realm of Form'' on This Shore. "I am a tiny blade of grass!" If you consider yourself to be one with the meadow, then you are living in the ''Realm of Emptiness'' on The Other Shore. "I am the meadow!" If the world is like a vast ocean and everyone is a drop of water. If you consider yourself to be a drop of water, you are living in the "Realm of Form".</p>
              <p>"I am one drop of water in a vast ocean." If you consider yourself to be one with the vast ocean then you are living in the "Realm of Emptiness". "I am the vast ocean!"</p>
              <p>The so-called This Shore and The Other Shore are as a matter of fact in the same physical space and time. "How boring..."."How serene..." The only difference lies in the mindset (This Shore or The Other Shore) adopted by those living in any particular space and time. And thus the quality of life between them differ significantly.</p>
              <p>"How noisy..."."What a delightful sound!" Therefore, the Buddha Shakyamuni says :</p>
              <p>"Form is not different from Emptiness." "Emptiness is not different from form."</p>
              <p>"Form is Emptiness and Emptiness is Form." A human being in any space and time</p>
              <p>should be like a grain of salt dissolved in a bucket of water. The moment a grain of salt lands into a bucket of water, there is ego-self and there is water. "I am a grain of salt!" After it dissolves into the water, there is no more pure salt or pure water.</p>
              <p>Ego disappears as self dissolves into every part of that particular space and time.</p>
              <p>Every part of the water has me. I am one with the water. Dissolve the ego-self</p>
              <p>into a bucket of water. You therefore possess the entire bucket of water. Dissolve the ego-self into the space and time you happen to be in and you possess the entire space and time. Most people are always carrying the burden of the past and anticipating the future while missing life at the present moment. Be a person who dissolves</p>
              <p>into the present moment. Do not be a slave who carries the burden of the past and anticipates the future. Be like a boat that flows in time and space. Wherever the water flows to, the boat will there at the same place too wherever the boat is at, the body will be there at the same place too wherever the body is, the mind will be there at that place too</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>The path of enlightenment</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This Chinese character (å®‡) represents " Space" (Up and down and in all directions).</p>
              <p>It is inclusive of everything from the nearest to the furthest away and thus, there is no end or boundary. This Chinese character (å®™) represents ''the beginningless of time to the present moment". It comprises time from the first beginning to the last ending inclusive of all time periods. And thus, there is no starting point and no ending point in time. When Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara utilized a selfless mindset to obtain the most perfect and profound wisdom, he realized that everything in the universe is of one essence and nothing can truly exist independently. The external material world </p>
              <p>and one's inner sensations, perceptions, decisions and awareness all flow and change constantly in space and time. One should dissolve the ego of self into the unity of space and time. The concept and practice of being part of the universal whole is defined as ''Emptiness'' When one understands and appreciates that everything is empty and puts this into practice, by completely allowing oneself to immerse into the realm of emptiness. Thereafter, there is no more hardship and misfortune as both are sufferings generated by the distorted viewpoint of the ego-self. Buddha Shakyamuni said to his disciple Sariputra: "Sariputra, we often see external entities as completely </p>
              <p>independent and separated from us. In reality, all objects are one with the same ultimate essence and this essence is inseparable from any entities. Nothing can be independent of this ultimate essence. And this includes your body and mind, </p>
              <p>as well as sensations are all part of this essence. This ultimate essence of the universe is referred to as "emptiness". All entities you see may be referred to as form. As a result, Emptiness and Form are not different. Form is Emptiness, and Emptiness is Form. Both are not different from each other. This is also the case for all our sensations, perceptions, decisions and awareness. They are all included in the essence of emptiness. Sariputra, all of your observations and opinions originate from the point of view of the ego-self!" Phenomena such as Birth and Death, Beauty and Ugliness, Abundance and Scarcity are all generated from one's individual point of view!</p>
              <p>Thus, if you are able to see the world without any particular viewpoint</p>
              <p>or pre-existing attitudes. When I observe a flower, I am mindful of the flower. When I observe a butterfly I am mindful of the butterfly at any time. You can dissolve the ego-self into that particular time. At any space, you can dissolve the ego-self</p>
              <p>into that space. When I am in the water, I am mindful of the water. When I am with a school of fish, I am mindful of these fishes. Transform the ego-self into countless molecules and dissolve into any space and time you happen to be in. All this time</p>
              <p>there is no more separated ego-self and no more separated universe phenomena, space and time. This is like a grain of salt dissolved into a bucket of water. Although the grain of salt has disappeared, Every part of the water is now a bit salty. No more pure salt and no more pure water. They became one complete whole. As such, there are no more activities of the ego-self. No more use of the six senses to view the external world from an ego-self. And thus one will not have all of the distorted information obtained from the senses. No attempt to understand ''death'' from the standpoint of ''life'', no illusion of ''presence'' from the standpoint of ''absence''. Without distorted viewpoints, there will be no more discrimination. There will be no such thing as ''causes'' and therefore no such thing as the cultivation of seeds (causes). There will be no such thing as ''result'' and therefore, no such concerns of 'harvesting the fruit (results) .The meaning of life is found in completely dissolving into the process of living and no longer focusing on any specific goals in mind. With such an understanding, one will no longer be troubled by the problems of aging and death.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(1) Understanding what Suffering is</p>
              <p>(2) Discovering the Origin of Suffering</p>
              <p>(3) Arriving at the Cessation of Suffering</p>
              <p>(4) Practicing the Path to the End of Suffering."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These are the Four Noble Truths. When we understand the true nature of existence which is an ever-changing and endless cycle of life and death and when we dissolve into this process of existence there are no more problems of birth, aging, sickness and death and no more Four Noble Truths. This principle appears profound. However, there is nothing profound about it. This principle clearly lies in front of everyone's eyes. It is just that most beings are ignorant of it. One who practices this principle</p>
              <p>would appear to have a lot to gain. But what is there to be gained? This principle basically exists the as way it is. It is just that most people don't know how to use it.</p>
              <p>The enlightened ones have realized these principles and clearly see everything</p>
              <p>as they truly are. The enlightened mind is therefore freed and no longer influenced</p>
              <p>by distorted points of view After letting go of one's ego-self and the sense of discrimination, one no longer possesses fear, desire and fantasy. and no longer lives a life influenced by a distorted point of view. Because an enlightened one knows</p>
              <p>that all distortions of existence are generated from an ego's selfish viewpoint. Therefore, an enlightened one's mind is like the water in a lake which gradually settles down from muddiness to complete clarity and serenity. This is what is meant</p>
              <p>by "The Other Shore". All enlightened ones from the past, present, and future follow this kind of wisdom to reach from This Shore of worldly life to The Other Shore</p>
              <p>of highest consciousness. Cleansing oneself of all distorted attitudes and illusions means fully reaching The Other Shore. Therefore, we should know that such utmost and perfect wisdom is a method of ultimate illumination, A method of supreme excellence and an outstanding method without comparisons! This approach can alleviate all suffering and free one from delusions generated from distorted viewpoints. This method is realistic and practical. Everybody can adopt it to reach The Other Shore.</p>

              <p><strong>THOSE WHO SERIOUSLY WISH TO SEEK REBIRTH IN AMITABHA'S LAND OF ULTIMATE BLISS AND BE LIBERATED FROM BIRTH AND DEATH, MUST MAKE VOW TO BE REBORN THERE, IN ADDITION TO RECITING NAMO AMITUOFO (NAMO AMITABHA)</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yHmjZCD.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>In The Amitabha Sutra spoken by Buddha Shakyamuni towards the end of His teaching career, the Buddha Shakyamuni has emphasized three (3) times, living beings who hear, spoken and hold the name of 'Amitabha', should the make vow to be born in that land.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Below are excerpts from the text of Amitabha Sutra, translated into English by the City of 10,000 Buddhas. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>| First emphasis to make vow in Amitabha Sutra |</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shariputra, those living beings who hear should vow, ‘I wish to be born in that country.’ And why? Those who thus attain are all superior and good people, all gathered together in one place. Shariputra, one cannot have few good roots, blessings, virtues, and causal connections to attain birth in that land. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>| Second emphasis to make vow in Amitabha Sutra |</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shariputra, if there is a good man or a good woman who hears spoken ‘Amitabha’ and holds the name, whether for one day, two days, three, four, five days, six days, as long as seven days, with one heart unconfused, when this person approaches the end of life, before him will appear Amitabha and all the assembly of holy ones. When the end comes, his heart is without inversion; in Amitabha’s Land of Ultimate Bliss he will attain rebirth. Shariputra, because I see this benefit, I speak these words: If living beings hear this spoken they should make the vow, ‘I will be born in that land.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>|Third emphasis to make vow in Amitabha Sutra |</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shariputra, if there are people who have already made the vow, who now make the vow, or who are about to make the vow, ‘I desire to be born in Amitabha’s Country,’ these people, whether born in the past, now being born, or to be born in the future, all will irreversibly attain to anuttarasamyaksambodhi. Therefore, Shariputra, all good men and good women, if they are among those who have faith, should make the vow, ‘I will be born in that country.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddhists and cultivators of Pure Land Dharma Door can recite the below vow any time of the day and use it as your daily practice:</p>

              <p>English:</p>
              <p>With one mind, I return my life to Amitabha Buddha who is in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Wishing His pure light illumines me, and his kind vows gather me in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, with proper mindfulness, I praise the Thus Come One's name, in order to take the path of Bodhi and to seek rebirth in the Pure Land.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the past, the Buddha vowed: "If living beings who wish for rebirth in my Land, and who resolve their minds with faith and joy even for just 10 recitations, are not reborn there, I will not attain the proper enlightenment."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Through mindfulness of the Buddha, I enter the sea of the Thus Come One's Great Vows, and receive the power of the Buddha's kindness. My multitude of offenses is eradicated and my good roots increase and grow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I approach the end of life, I myself will know the time of its coming. My body wll be free of illness and pain. My heart will have no greed or fondess, and my thought will not be upside down, just as in entering the samadhi.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Buddha and the Assembly of Sages, leading me by the hand to the golden dias, will come to welcome me. And in the space of a thought I will be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. The flower will open, and I will see the Buddha, straightaway hear the Buddha vehicle, and immediately attain the wisdom of a Buddha. I will cross over living beings on a wide scale, fulfilling my Bodhi vows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All Buddhas of the ten directions and the three periods of time.</p>
              <p>All Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas.</p>
              <p>Maha Prajna Paramita.</p>

              <p>Many people nowadays do not really understand the proper teachings and are not interested either. Their interest lies in repenting past offences and often come to the Way Place for that sole purpose. It is our responsibility to explain the proper teachings to them and point out the correct way of cultivation. Only through cultivation can they truly eradicate past offenses, for they will know where they wronged and won't repeat their faults.</p>
