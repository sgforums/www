              <p>Every subatomic interaction consists of the annihilation of the original particles and the creation of new subatomic particles. The subatomic world is a continual dance of creation and annihilation, of mass changing into energy and energy changing into mass. Transient forms sparkle in and out of existence, creating a never-ending, forever newly created reality.<br><br> ----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br> There are those who look on death with a naive, thoughtless cheerfulness, thinking that for some unknown reason death will work out all right for them, and that it is nothing to worry about. When I think of them, I am reminded of what one Tibetan master says: “People often make the mistake of being frivolous about death and think, ‘Oh well, death happens to everybody. It’s not a big deal, it’s natural. I’ll be fine.’” That’s a nice theory until one is dying.<br><br> --------------------------------------------------------------<br> From weeping and grieving, no mental peace can come.<br> It will only lead to greater pain, and bodily harm.</p>

              <p>WISDOM FROM AJAHN CHAH<br><br> Whatever arises in the present moment is impermanent. <br> I say this often, but most people don't pay much attention. <br> They're reluctant to make use of this simple little teaching. <br> All that is subject to arising is impermanent. It's uncertain. <br> This really is the easiest, least complicated way to reflect on the truth.If you don't meditate on this teaching, when things actually do start to show themselves as uncertain and changeable you don't know how to respond wisely and tend to get agitated and stirred up. Investigation of this very impermanence brings you insight and understanding of that which is permanent. <br> By contemplating that which is uncertain, you see that which is certain. This is the way you have to explain it to make people understand the truth - but they tend not to understand and spend the whole time lost, rushing here and there.<br> Really, if you want to experience true peace, you must bring the mind to that point where it is fully mindful in the present moment. Whatever happiness or suffering arises there, teach yourself that it's transient. The part of the mind that recollects that happiness and suffering are impermanent is the wisdom of the Buddha within each of you. The one who recognizes the uncertainty of phenomena is the Dhamma within you.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Master Jingzong æ·¨å®—æ³•å¸«<br><br>June 13 at 8:30pm · <br> .<br><br> Accounts of Amitabha-Recitation:<br> Reciting the Name in the Surgery Ward<br><br> (1)<br> When I worked as an intern in the hospital’s gynecology department, I met a woman who needed surgery because of a stillbirth. She was deeply distressed, both by the loss of her baby and her fear of the operation.<br> I visited her and urged her to recite Amitabha’s name. I said to her, “Amitabha Buddha, out of his infinite compassion, cannot bear to see sentient beings suffer. He will definitely bless you.”<br>She took my advice and kept reciting “Amitabha Buddha” over and over before being given the anesthetic.<br> When she came round from the surgery, she told me, “Reciting Amitabha is really wonderful. It works!” She had felt no pain at all.<br> During the operation, she dreamt of a Bodhisattva, whose beauty surpassed that of any fairy she had seen in movies. She was also given a tour of a place that not even cinematic fairylands could compare with, and where she saw many big lotus flowers.<br> Then she heard a voice saying, “Time’s up. You can go back now.” And she slowly woke up.<br> - Recounted by Dr. Guo Huizhen<br><br> (2)<br> In my first year as a resident doctor in the department of internal medicine, I was on duty in the intensive care unit (ICU) one night when a heart-attack patient was rushed in from the emergency room. The man had stopped breathing and was unconscious. His face and tongue were dark purple. An ECG (electrocardiogram) and blood test showed that his heart had been seriously damaged. <br> According to the director, even patients with a less serious heart attack could not be saved. We asked the family to be psychologically prepared for the worst.As usual, I recited Amitabha Buddha’s name while I was giving emergency treatment.<br> We had already put the patient on an intravenous drip but could not detect any blood pressure. He remained unconscious and could not breathe by himself. His wife said with great sorrow, “People say god loves simple honest folk. How come he doesn’t love me? Doctor, please try your best to save him. I will take care of him even if he goes into a vegetative state.”<br>I could feel that she did have a sort of simple-minded sincerity. I comforted her and said, “In order to have a breakthrough from a crisis, one should make a great vow and recite Amitabha’s name.”<br> “How do I make such a vow?” she asked.<br>“Do it with your own sincerity,” I said.<br> She immediately said, “From now on my husband and I will become vegetarian and we will recite the name of Amitabha Buddha. Being a school teacher, my husband can help promote the Dharma when he is well again.”<br>I handed her and her children each a string of recitation beads and said, “It doesn’t help if you simply stay outside the ICU and worry. Why not calm yourself and do 10,000 recitations? Pray for Amitabha’s unfathomable blessings. We will do our best. Dedicate the merit of your recitation to him. If he doesn’t pull through, he will be reborn in the Pure Land.”<br>Two other doctors and I were busy watching the ECG monitor and adjusting the dosage that whole night, from 7 or 8 pm until 3 in the morning. One of the doctors sighed, “The three of us spent the entire night on a person who doesn’t even have a pulse.”<br>About 4 or 5 in the morning, the patient’s blood pressure miraculously rose. He was gradually coming round. I immediately opened the door of the ICU to break the news to his family. What I saw moved me to tears – the whole family was in line reciting most earnestly and faithfully.<br> One of his kids wrote this on a piece of paper: “Dear Dad, how I wish you will open your kind eyes again!”<br>A young man came to visit and was crying so intensely that I mistook him for a relative. He said to me, “This man was my teacher. In those years, he lived in a simple hut outside someone’s courtyard and gave up his salary so we could be educated. It it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t be here today. Doctor, please bring him back!”<br>He was choked by tears before he could finish. I then realized that this patient was once voted one of the Top 10 Most Benevolent Teachers.<br> He was on a breathing machine for three days after he recovered consciousness. However, he was able to recite Amitabha’s name. Besides the heart attack, he also had a rather serious case of tuberculosis. Yet he managed to walk out of the hospital, alive and well. Later, he came back to help me fund the publication of some Buddhist scriptures.<br> The doctors who had reviewed the man’s ECG and blood-test reports and witnessed his recovery all found the entire episode incredible!<br> - Recounted by Dr. Guo Huizhen<br><br> (English translation by Foxin, edited by Linghui)</p></div>

              <p>This is extracted from another Buddhist forum posted by a forummer. The article is long and below is part of it.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">To conclude, as soon as a Pure Land practitioner settles his mind on Amitabha’s deliverance, he or she has taken Refuge in Amitabha Buddha. Not just the matter of rebirth in the next life, but all his or her personal affairs in this world fall under the compassionate care of Amitabha Buddha.<br><br> Exclusively reciting Amitabha’s name is really the only job done by the practitioner; the rest is guided by Amitabha Buddha. We entrust ourselves sincerely and joyfully to Amitabha, who acts in our best interests in all mundane and supramundane matters.<br><br> Because of the embrace and deliverance of Amitabha Buddha, we have no selfish interest in our service to the communities of this world. We are not trying to earn our deliverance. Even if benefits accrue and merits are attained, these are attributed to Amitabha Buddha, not to us. This is how an aspirant in the pristine Pure Land school practices bodhichitta.</span></p>
