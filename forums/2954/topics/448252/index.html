              <p>Hi my buddhist friends,</p>
                          <p>Actually, I wanted to continue to post in Realization's thread: <a href="/forums/2954/topics/444652">http://sgforums.com/forums/2954/topics/444652</a> but afraid that it might go off topic and so I started a new one.</p>
                          <p>I was still quite confused between samantha and vipassana meditation... why is there a difference...? And also, is nianfo considered samantha method...?</p>
                          <p>To begin with, I googled on samantha method 1st</p>
                          <p><a href="http://www.knowbuddhism.info/2009/02/what-is-samatha-in-meditation.html">http://www.knowbuddhism.info/2009/02/what-is-samatha-in-meditation.html</a></p>
                          <p><strong><em><span style="color: #3366ff;">Samatha is concerned with the concentration of one’s mind on a suitable meditation object in order to prevent the mind from wandering about.</span></em></strong></p>
                          <p><span style="color: #000000;">this means there's is a "object" to concentrate on. I thought, can nianfo considered as samantha too...? since we focus on Amituofo sheng hao, can it be an object too..?</span></p>
                          <p>1 - Mindfulness of Amituofo can it be samantha meditation?</p>
                          <p>Next....</p>
                          <p>2 - Can samantha and vipassana reach the same goal? Liberation?</p>
                          <p>but what I got from another website is this...</p>
                          <p><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/vmed_1.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/vmed_1.htm</a></p>
                          <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>One is Samatha meditation; the other is Vipassana meditation. Samatha here means concentration. Vipassana here means insight or experiential knowledge of bodily and mental phenomena. Of these two types of mental training Samatha meditation is practised to attain higher concentration of the mind, peaceful and blissful living and the cessation of suffering. Vipassana meditation is practised to attain not only deep concentration of the mind but also liberation from all kinds of mental and physical dukkha or suffering, through realisation of our body-mind processes and their true nature.</em></span></p>
                          <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #0000ff"><em>As I explained to you, Samatha meditation is practised to attain higher concentration of the mind. So when you practise Samatha meditation, the first type of mental training or mental culture, you have to concentrate your mind on a single object of meditation. You want to concentrate your mind on a single object very deeply. That object may be a concept or observed reality, but most Samatha meditative objects are concepts. There are also a few objects which are observed reality as the object of meditation in the first type of training and Samatha meditation. But whatever the object may be the aim of Samatha meditation is to obtain deep concentration of the mind, or the higher concentration of the mind.</em></span></p>
                          <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #0000ff"><em>So you have to take a single object and focus your mind on it. When you focus your mind on this object gradually the mind will be concentrated on it very deeply. But in the beginning of the practise your mind may go out or wander. Your mind doesn't stay with the object always. Sometimes it just goes out and thinks about something else. It wanders and goes astray. Then you have to bring the mind to the object and focus it on that object again and again. Whenever the mind goes out you bring it back and focus it on the object of meditation. In this way your mind gradually becomes concentrated well on the object of meditation.</em></span></p>
                          <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>As you have practised it for some days or months the concentration becomes better and better, deeper and deeper. Finally the mind is absolutely concentrated on the object of meditation as its absorbed into the object of meditation. Such a state of mind which is absorbed into the object of meditation is called jhana, or apana in Pali. Jhana means 'fixed as', or absorption. When the mind is totally fixed to the object of meditation it's called jhana, fixed mind. And also it is called absorption, apana.</em></span></span></p>
                          <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #0000ff;"><em>Jnana has four stage, or five stages, in accordance with the teaching of the Buddha. So, the second stage of jhana concentration becomes better than the first. Then the third stage, the concentration better than the second. So with the fourth. As long as the mind is deeply concentrated on the object of meditation its free from all mental impurities such as desire, greed, lust, hatred, anger, ignorance, and jealousy. Because there are no impurities in the mind which is absorbed into the object of meditation you feel happy and peaceful, and calm and tranquil. Tranquillity, serenity and calmness is the result of Samatha meditation.</em></span></p>
                          <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>But in ancient times there were some devotees who practised Samatha meditation with a view to obtaining supernormal powers such as clairvoyance and clairaudience. These supernormal powers can be attained based on all the four jnanas, of the four stages. When a meditator is skilled in entering any stage of jnana he can then proceed with his meditation in order to attain psychical or supernormal powers. But though he may be able to attain them through the four stages of jnana, concentration, he is not able to rightly understand the intrinsic nature of mental and physical phenomena. He is not able to destroy any mental defilement because the purpose of Samatha meditation is to obtain deep higher concentration of the mind and psychical or supernormal powers. Because he is not able to uproot any of the mental defilements such as anger, hatred, desire, and craving, he cannot get free from all kinds of suffering, mental or physical, because these mental defilements are the causes of the suffering, dukkha. As long as one can uproot or exterminate these mental defilements, mental impurities, he is subject to suffering, dukkha.</em></span></span></p>
                          <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #0000ff;"><em>The aim of Vipassana meditation is to free oneself from all kinds of dukkha, mental suffering and physical suffering, through realisation of the body-mind processes and their true nature. So if you are able to realise mental and physical phenomena as they really are you can do away with all kinds of mental impurities or mental defilements which arise dependent on misunderstanding or ignorance of mental and physical phenomena and their true nature. That's why we have to practise Satipatthana Vipassana meditation, insight meditation.</em></span></p>
                          <p><em></em></p>
                          <p>I continued to search but I found another from Wikipedia (sorry Wiki is just stepping stone) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi</a></p>

              <p>Hi Novice, I think the answers are below which I copied from the article that Relization had posted. Samatha &amp; Vipassana are efforts of total self-reliance whereas Pureland practice (Amituofo recitation) allows the Buddha's merits and blessings to overflow us and with Amituofo's vow, we are able to secure a good rebirth in Pureland. However, nianfo can be considered as Samantha too. We can practice both as they do not obstruct one another.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The above does not imply that Samatha or Vipassana meditation is ineffective on the deathbed, but that the Pureland method is relatively easier to practise for the average person. In fact, when Samatha or Vipassana meditation is practised well in everyday life, this aids practice of the Pureland method. Likewise, when the Pureland method is practised well in everyday life, this aids practice of Samatha or Vipassana meditation. The effects of concentration and insight, which are usually associated with Samatha and Vipassana meditation respectively can also be realised when one practises the Pureland method well. Generally, when one practises different methods well, they should foster, and not contradict or obstruct one another. This is because they are all methods leading towards liberation.</span></span></p>

              <p>Hi Dawn,</p>
              <p>actually I aspired to go Pure Land already :)</p>
              <p>but while im still "here", I will also learn as much as i can... if best be a stream-enterer, if not sheng wen, anything that i can grab on not to fall on evil paths.</p>
              <p>but, nianfo is samantha method right...? The point is- only vipassana can uproot the mental defilements (i copied from buddhanet) while samantha focus on your concentration.</p>
              <p>I thought, if nianfo would lead to realization, that would be best of both world... practising Pure Land and insight realization as well lol <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Vipassana meditation is an awareness meditation. It teaches to be aware of everything that comes to you and is happening to you. By keeping your mind on the object of meditation, you are able to develop concentration or one-pointedness of mind which is necessary for the penetrative knowledge into the true nature of mind and body to arise. Without concentration, this cannot happen. And in order to have concentration, you must first keep your mind focused on one object.</p>

              <p>to me, nianfo can also be Vipassana. like dawn said Vipassana meditation is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">awareness</span> meditation. Vipassana, which means to see things as they really are. Vipassana is a way of self-transformation through self-observation. To know an object during vipassana meditation means to experience it with bare, nonverbal awareness.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.dhamma.org/en/vipassana.shtml">http://www.dhamma.org/en/vipassana.shtml</a></p>
              <p>so while doing nianfo, observe the mind, be aware and see things as they are, then that's "Vipassana". Vipassana not necessary stereotype, must use breathing. even use breathing also need to observe the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mind</span>. both breathing and nianfo, without observation and just taming the mind from wandering is samantha/concentration. both if do it with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">observation, with experience to bare, nonverbal awareness</span> is Vipassana.</p>

              <p>Thanks Sinweiy for sharing. I've a better understanding of Vipassana meditation now but I've problem in putting it into practice. I guess it is better for me to go for course and learn it from the Master. Is it that we must learn Samantha meditation before we go on to Vipassana and is Vipassana a step "higher" than Samantha?</p>

              <p>oh... ic. Thx Sinweiy for the post.</p>
              <p>That's what i initially thought, when vipassana also needs an "object" to focus on 1st... e.g. movement of the abdomen or breathing...</p>
              <p>I was puzzled why a distinct difference in samantha and vipassana and I see Theravada and Mahayana have different interpretation to it now</p>
