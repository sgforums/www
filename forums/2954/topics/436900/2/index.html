              <p>Yes, we have the same feelings as past life. If we had let go of attachments, hatred, love etc. in our past life, we will not be reborn in this world. There is a Buddhist saying :</p>
              <p>çˆ±ä¸�é‡�ï¼Œä¸�ç”Ÿå¨‘å©†ã€‚</p>
              <p>å¿µä¸�ä¸€ï¼Œä¸�ç”Ÿæž�ä¹�ã€‚</p>
              <p>The 1st verse means if your love and attachments are not strong, you will not be reborn within samsara (our world).</p>
              <p>The 2nd verse means if you chant Amituofo but your love and attachments are still strong, you will not be born in Amituofo's Pureland.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>I thought of the 48 vows of Amituofo... and used abit of imagination to string up some of the Vows (LoL  please click this link <strong><a href="http://hi.baidu.com/fodizi/blog/item/ee157e0ffb82c42b6059f3b2.html">48 vows in pictures :)</a></strong> 1st before reading)</p>
              <p>Need to use abit of your imagination when u are reading this:</p>
              <p>Imagine right now u are at Pure Land right now... enjoying the greenery and birds etc</p>
              <p>OK.. then in accordance with Vow 7- Divine eyes (for example- Mu Lian used his supernatural powers and saw his mother suffering in the Hungry Ghost realm)</p>
              <p>u can see where your past loved ones are in which realm... u seek to teach them about Pure Land to bring them here.</p>
              <p>then next... with Amituofo's Vow 36- ability to travel different universes and realms to spread Dharma <em>(one of my favourite Vows... sound like an adventure to me... can go many universes and realms lol...)</em></p>
              <p>U go down to where your loved ones are and teach them about Pure land</p>
              <p>Then lastly... in accordance with Vow 22- perhap some of your female family members... sporting moustaches or beards... learning Dharma with you.... lol</p>
              <p>as stated in Amituo Sutra: è�šä¼šä¸€å¤„ gathering together at one place</p>

              <p>Novice, yes indeed.  If you cultivate in the Pureland, sooner or later you will be able to help deliver all those who ever were your relatives in many, many lives past...  not just this life. </p>
              <p>The compassion that one will develop while treading the path towards bodhisattva-hood or Buddhahood is a larger, more all-encompassing type of compassion than mere concern about earthly matters.  We will want to help deliver sentient beings from suffering, not just put a band-aid (or handyplast) on a minor wound... only to have the wound fester again, or appear on another part of the body.  Suffering will keep assailing us unless we become awakened.</p>
              <p>That's not to say that we shouldn't love those around us, but that we should realise that the only way all suffering can stop is to get enlightened.  Hence, we get enlightened so that we may help others along the path.  Along the way too, we should help friends along; who are also working towards the same goal of liberation. </p>

              <p>I understand that making vows to be reborn in pureland is very important, but I do not know if making a vow for pureland is the same as having and expressing the desire to be reborn. </p>

              <p>Basically, in layman term is conscience divided into two categories - Absolute and Relative. Expressing desire is necessary, until it reaches the progress of natural desire. Unlike samsara, for Pureland, though relative is absolute as well, varied in grades and levels. Similarly to conscience in samsara, not many could specifically relate conscience in absolute term flawlessly, besides master venerables dharma talks sharing like Patriarch Hui neng, Zen Master yong ming yan shou among others.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Absolutely magnificent and attributing to the glory of all buddhas.</p>
