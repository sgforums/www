              <p>I am saddened by the news of  mother and son (3 years old) found dead at Bedok Reservoir.</p>
              <p>According to the newspaper, both mother and son wore red T-shirts, had fingernails painted red and were joined by red string at their wrists. According to Chinese belief, wearing red in death means revenge.</p>
              <p>Ghost realm is very suffering. If I remember correctly, the sutra says the minimum life span of ghosts is 200 years. Those who listen to Dharma will understand that the spirits of those who died from committing suicide are very suffering. There's still hope when living. Wisdom is all we need to overcome hatred and difficulties in life.</p>

              <p>May the merits dedicate to both mother and son, hope they will let go of their hatred , attachments and be reborn in a better realm.</p>

              <p>Drama unfolded on Friday night at the wake of a mother and son whose dead bodies were found floating face down in Bedok Reservoir, as angry family members tried to accost the woman's estranged husband. <br><br>Tan Sze Sze, 32, and her three-year-old son, Jerald Chin, were <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/mother-and-son-found-dead-in-bedok-reservoir.html"><span style="color: #005790;">found dead on Thursday morning at Bedok Reservoir </span></a>by PUB officers, after the mother and son were reported as missing two days ago.<br><br>Tan's husband Willy Chin arrived at 8.45pm to pay his respects when a large crowd of angry family members rushed in his direction. <br><br>According to <em>The Straits Times</em>, the 33-year-old tried to escape in his van but Tan's mother and younger sister had blocked the vehicle, forced the door open and tried to pull him out, all the while shouting vulgarities at him. <br><br>His mother-in-law, Teo Guek Lai, confronted him and shouted in Mandarin: "Come and see what you've done to my daughter!"<br><br>Chin's van eventually managed to leave after 10 minutes, but it was only after struggling with family members as they continuously tried to block the vehicle and chase after it. <br><br>The drama however, did not end at the wake. <br><br>A group of Tan's family members, who included Tan's mother and sister, went to his house to confront him, and they created a scene when they could not get to him.<br><br>Police later arrested the sister's husband when he refused to leave.<br><br>Teo told reporters that her daughter was upset and scared that her son would be taken from her. In a custody battle with her estranged husband, she was previously fined for not allowing Chin to see Jerald. <br><br>"Her son was her life," said Teo, to whom Tan revealed her suicide plans on the day she went missing. <br><br>Telling his side of the story, Chin said that when police first told him about his wife and son, he was at a total loss. <br><br>The restaurant chef said that all he wanted was to see his son, but attempts to visit him every weekend were in vain. The last time he saw Jerald was in February for half an hour.<br><br>"I didn't do anything wrong. From start to finish, I just wanted to see my son. If she had just allowed me to take my son out on weekends, I wouldn't have had to pressure her by going to court," Chin said to ST.<br><br>Tan was found cradling her son, with their wrists joined together with red string. They were wearing red T-shirts and their fingernails were painted red, a customary Chinese symbol of revenge after death.</p>
