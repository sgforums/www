              <p>Please read the following important quotes from Ch'an Master Sheng Yen.  They tell you why it is necessary to take refuge in the Three Jewels.
                                                  <br><a href="http://www.dharmadrum.org/content/chan_garden/chan_garden2.aspx?sn=40">http://www.dharmadrum.org/content/chan_garden/chan_garden2.aspx?sn=40</a></p>
                                <p> </p>
                                <p><strong>Why is it important to Take Refuge in the Three Jewels?</strong></p>
                                <p>... Participating in the ceremony of taking refuge in the Three Jewels is 
                                                  the first, important step for anyone who wants to become a Buddhist. 
                                                  Why? Because the heart of Buddhism is the Three Jewels of the Buddha, 
                                                  Dharma, and Sangha...</p>
                                <p>... [Taking refuge] is about committing one's life towards a path to awakening, which is,
                                                   in fact, freeing not binding ... If we realize that the Buddhist 
                                                  teaching is beneficial or meaningful in our lives, then the next step is
                                                   to take refuge in the Three Jewels. When we become Buddhists, we commit
                                                   ourselves to bringing genuine liberation to ourselves and to everyone 
                                                  around us. This is the Buddhist path ... <strong>Trying to learn Buddhism without taking refuge is to be a bystander and not a participant...</strong></p>
                                <p>... Those who believe that having a pure, sincere heart is enough to qualify
                                                   them as Buddhist practitioners and who see no need to go through the 
                                                  formal refuge ceremony, are not really Buddhists. If you want to get an 
                                                  education, you must first register and then proceed through elementary, 
                                                  middle, and high school until you reach college—perhaps reaching as far 
                                                  as a Ph.D. It is impossible to progress in one's education without 
                                                  taking these successive steps.</p>
                                <p><strong>Similarly, self-proclaimed Buddhists are not real Buddhists. </strong><strong>They are 
                                                  like people who are fond of another country, emigrate there, pretend to 
                                                  be citizens, but never apply for citizenship. Those who refrain from 
                                                  taking refuge, but insist upon calling themselves Buddhists, may glean 
                                                  some benefit from the teachings, but the essence of Buddhism will always
                                                   elude him. Taking refuge is a required process, not an option.</strong> The 
                                                  sutras or Buddhist scriptures tell us that even people who perform good 
                                                  deeds will not be able to eradicate bad karma unless they take refuge in
                                                   the Three Jewels...</p>
                                <p>... Some people believe that their comprehension of the Buddhist sutras, 
                                                  which they take to be one and the same as the Dharma, is sufficient to 
                                                  enable them to advance directly to full enlightenment. They see no need 
                                                  to practice meditation or receive the Three Refuges. While this may have
                                                   its appeal, it is a serious mistake.</p>
                                <p>The Buddhist sutras were taught by the Buddha and his disciples, and
                                                   later collected and written down by members of the Sangha. 
                                                  Concentrating on these texts only yields a limited understanding of the 
                                                  Dharma Jewel. This would lead us to disregard the Buddha, who gave these
                                                   teachings, and the Sangha, who spread the Dharma. Buddhism stresses the
                                                   Dharma—the path which leads to the ending of suffering—only in 
                                                  conjunction with the Buddha and the Sangha. <strong>The three are inseparable. 
                                                  It is true that taking refuge requires investigation of the Buddha's 
                                                  teachings, but it also necessitates participation in the refuge 
                                                  ceremony, which must be conducted by a precept master, who is usually a 
                                                  member of the Sangha. This confers the formal recognition that you are a
                                                   Buddhist...</strong></p>
                                <p>... Lastly, I must stress that taking refuge in the Three Jewels is only the
                                <strong> first step</strong> in becoming a Buddhist. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Once we have taken refuge, we must 
                                                  embark on the path of spiritual cultivation, which involves finding a 
                                                  teacher and developing a regular practice.</span> Doing so will decisively set 
                                                  you on the Buddhist path of awakening to wisdom and compassion...</p>
