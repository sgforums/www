            <div class='col-md body'>In the past, retrenchment is used to be a feature of downtimes, and when economy pick up, there are rise in employment.<br><br>But not in this period of economy recovery. US companies reported increased revenue, but unemployment is still down. Many US, in fact Singapore too, companies began rely on outsourcing. Many simple menial tasks, or even production plants can be situated at places lile China, where labour is cheap, and Malaysia, where cost of production is lower.<br><br>Outsourcing is soon becoming a trend, even the phenomena of degree holders doing menial jobs may becoming extinct.<br><br>So, the problem is now, how could one make oneself relevant to any company? Bear in mind, we used to hanker for additional rewards such as pay rise and bonuses each year. Now many people are happy to just to have a job with wage cuts and less benefits.<br><br>People used to be hired to do mundane jobs. Now, we must be some sort of star performers, earning big bucks for companies, till they find us to hard to kick out.<br><br></div>

Who says they are cutting cost?<br>On one hand they cut staff.  On the other hand, new staff comes in and all of them were ex staff of McDonalds, used to work under the present big boss of the zoo.<br><br>Retrench staff costs money, lotsa lotsa money.<br>Hiring ex-McDonald staff is not cheap.  They are quite highly paid.<br>So in the end, no cost was cut.  Instead, expenditure will go up.<br><br><blockquote>those who were not retrenched had their workload doubled...........poor thing</blockquote>This I have to agree.  My excolleague got bullied into doing two other people's job, on top of her daily work.  She is just an Admin Asst, not superwoman.  She didn't get retrenched cuz the management refused to let her go.  Now she doesn't get the money, still get that kind of pay, but works like mad.<br><br>She could not reach her retrenched colleague on the phone.  Things were not handed over properly.  In the first place, they were not given the chance to handover (yes, they were told to F off immediately)!  Now cannot reach her.  Office cannot function.  My poor Admin Asst ex colleague is suffering.<br><br>I just spoke with my ex superior that I will be going back to office to see what I can help, since I know a bit of what my uncontactable ex-colleague used to do.<br></div>
