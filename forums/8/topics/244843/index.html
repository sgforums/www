            <div class='col-md body'>my main ptis tits: if u r required to wear formal office attire then pls do so from top to bottom...when u miz formal wif casual, ur whole physical image becomes unsightly...i dun agree tat u shld stand out n be the onli one wearinf formal when no one else in ur workplace is doing tat...tats madness...wad i mean is dress uniformly...if u put on long-sleeve wif formal pants/skirt then match tis wif proper leather shoes...<br><br>for guys, leather shoes tat dun look fanciful n formal is complete onli when a tie is on n worn properly...for females, dun wear slip-ons...wear shoes tat cover ur feet...heels r nt compulsory but its been proven tat heels do add on to professional image...for both genders, blazers r optional as long as long-sleeved is worn...<br><br>the above is my personal opinion of wad formal attire shld be...anything less than tat is nt considered formal...</div>
