            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It is really important that you supplement your diet with a multi B complex tablet on a daily basis if you aren't eating a well balanced diet or if you are lactose intolerant or a vegetarian. The B complex of vitamins is essential for healthy immune, neural and digestive functioning. Get one including all the B's ie: B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12 as they work best as a group.<br><br>The B complex of vitamins is a water soluble complex and as such our bodies can neither store or produce them. therefore, we need to ingest them on a daily basis or suffer the consequences as you unfortunately appear to be ....<br><br>When you take your daily supplement ensure that you take it with some type of calcium rich food ie: low fat cheese (which is really low in lactose) or milk or a calcium supplement as B12 needs calcium to be properly assimilated by the body......... also calcium needs vitamin D to be properly absorbed so get at least 10 minutes of sun each day.Consume magnesium which is known as the antistress mineral .... which is another thing you need to focus on. Your magnesium supplies are probably also low. Eat more foods rich in magnesium. ie: leafy and green vegies, nuts and seeds, wholegrains and cereals.<br><br>When our bodies are placed under added stress ie: sickness, new home, new job or just the grind of daily life really ...... the B complex of vitamins will usually be the first group to get used up and we therefore need to adjust our intake accordingly.................<br><br>Other symptoms of B complex deficiency you may be suffering from are fatigue and exhaustion, numbness and tingling and prickling sensations in the outer extremities (hands and feet and arms and legs), intolerable dry mouth, excessive urination and nighttime muscle spasms and leg cramps, insomnia, dizzy spells and loss of balance, inability to concentrate clearly, irritability and moodiness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, headaches and migraines, depression and even chest pains and heart palpitations......... !!<br><br>Quite scary actually if you don't reaise the vitamin factor.When you are getting any stress related symptoms or any of the above mentioned symptoms simply take another vitamin B complex tablet. As they are water soluble, our bodies will simply excrete any excess in our urine.<br><br>Also, if you are on you are a woman and on your menses you need to increase your intake of vitamin B12 so take another B tablet then too.<br>Another good point to make here would be that if you are deficient in vitamin B12 then any iron that you are eating will never be assimilated (absorbed) effectively by your body as iron needs ample supplies of vitamin B12 for proper absorption. ..... therefore, you would also be exhibiting symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia.<br>Drinks loads of fresh filtered water too, as the healthiest and happiest body will always be the most hydrated one.<br><br>Try to cut back on the things that will rob you of your precious B complex of vitamins too ie: caffeine, sodas and soft drinks, alcohol are all brilliant B complex thieves ---- things such as the oral contraceptive, antidepressants, antibiotics, eostroegen supplementation, laxatives, aspirin, diuretics will also do a great job of robbing you of your B's.<br><br>Vitamin B12 deficiency also causes excessive sweating.</strong></div>
