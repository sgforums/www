            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, it is glad that I will take a tour to sg and malayisa next week. At the end of the tour, I will come back to sg from Malaysia at Saturday night, I think it is around 10pm. And then I will take a very early plane back home at 6:30 am on Sunday. I can choose to live in hotel at Saturday night, but I really prefer not sleep rather than get up early at 4am to rush for the plane, and it is not economic to live in hotel too. So I bother about how to spend the Saturday night.<br><br>Can anyone suggest how spend that few hours? or any good places allow me to stay to 4 am and then take a taxi to airport? Your kindly help will be great appreciated. Thanks<br><br>P.S: I will go with a girl. So your suggestion must consider the safety for two girls. hehe<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahaha, iamabird, actually the idea of catching dogs are not constrained to hills and carparks, there are lots of other places like reservoirs, etc. Kekekeke, but somehow the fun is to catch those wild dogs and not to barbeque them. Hahaha......<br><br>As for popular night spots, well, if you are interested, u can loiter around at the east. There are several nice pubs in the Siglap area, whereby people there are trying to build up the reputation of that area to become the Holland Village of the East. Nice places you have there...... and you can maybe pop by the Cafe Cartel outlet there or Coffee Bean for some nice coffee and cheesecakes *droolz* afterwhich u continue pubbing until 3am. After that, more supper for u I guess, so travel down to either Bedok Market (it is not that far off, just tell the taxi driver you want to sample Bedok Bah Chor Mee and he will be able to drop you off), or go down to Geylang to have a try at the Beef Kuey Teow (quite popular u noe). Hmm...... I kind of forgot what time that stall closes, but u can try the local smelly beancurd and see the difference between those local and those at ur place. Not that smelly here I must say, hehehe, but worth a try too.<br><br>Aiyah, all in all, there are loads and loads of stuff that can be done in Singapore. Life maybe routine, but not a person's mind, hehe...... So do keep a lookout, Singapore has as much to offer as any other places  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
