It will be nice if you add in your own comments as well, for example whether or not you think there aren't enough japanese movies to please you, maybe supply your own guesses why there aren't so many of them screened in cinemas here.  That way the reader will have your question to answer and your comment to give feedback on.

            <div class='col-md body'>Heya adrian,<br><br>I was re-reading the "RA Movies" thread again just so that I could clarify certain issues with the "Sloppy Thoughts" thread.<br><br>Upon reading your reply a second time, it was especially promising to find the same sort of indefinate and misunderstood usage of the common lexicon of the English language.<br><br>"ok, censor is to decide with power whether to show the viewers things that r on the grounds of obscenity, threat of security etc."<br><br>Let's try to recuperate your original thoughts from this jumbled piece of mess.<br><br>How do you "decide with power"? It should be "the power to decide".<br><br>"whether to show the viewers things that r on the grounds of obscenity". Perhaps this should be rephrased as to be unambiguous. Currently, it is in fact suggesting that it is the role of the censor to show viewers footage that is obscene. *laugh*<br><br>Lastly, "threat of security ".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> This elicited guffaws for a non-stop 5 min. The threat of security???!!! Heh! Gee, most girls want to be threatened with secuirty then.<br><br>In ONE SENTENCE, you have managed to confuse all your thoughts and confuse the reader too ; meanwhile suggesting a totally contrasting stance to your "attempted" point.<br><br>I'm sure adrian wants to portray himself as a steadfast "Singlish" type... If any "Singlish" thread readers are reading this, this is perhaps what so dangerous abt the uncritical acceptance of Singlish into the national consciousness. Bad English simply gets muddled up with the overarching "positive" terminology of Singlish and thus is excused and *gasp* celebrated.<br><br>Dun misquote me out of context : I'm not saying that Singlish is bad but that it's very dangerous to leave ourselves a convienent hiding place for our inadequacy and inarticulateness.<br><br>In another post, Mateo commented that 12 Storeys was too "arty-fartsey". In a similar vein, what was engendered here was a discourse of the same rationale as Singlish. We resort to simplicity to articulate our lack of ideas and understanding. Proddy mentioned quite rightly that, instead of striving to understand better, we tend to dumb down. We want easy, piece-meal solutions and anything that requires a stretch of imagination or critical thought is to be considered "cheem", "artsy" and "intellectual" (there terms that are have bad currency in the capitalist Singapore).<br><br>I'm sorry that I am writing this in a movie thread. I think I shall post this under "Sloppy Thoughts" too, for coherence sake. Thank you for taking ur time to read this.<br><br>SINGA the courtesy lion strikes again. *irony dammit*<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>No universal history leads from savagery to humanitarianism, but there is one leading from the slingshot to the megatonne bomb.<br><br>Adorno</div>

I'm reluctant to post nowadays cos there's a dearth of posts that are interesting to me.<br><br>Anyways, been hard-up on Kenshin. D/L about 35 episodes and totally slacked off on work. Baggy eyes in the morning! Hope you enjoyed Mononoke Hime and Lain. Both are excellent series. The Legend of the Utema (I think) is gonna be shown at the SIFF. Catch it if you can. I just watched Mononoke Hime for the thrid time with a Japanese girl, and she was like, so totally into it. Dunno why. Mebbe it was fun cos I'll jabber in my fucked-up Japanese and make her laugh.  :p I made her breakfast this morning and we watched Shoymu Ni in bed. Crazy, lazy Sunday...<br><br>All da respect in the house to Bish, me main man!<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>No universal history leads from savagery to humanitarianism, but there is one leading from the slingshot to the megatonne bomb.<br><br>Adorno</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, adrian,<br><br>If you do not understand what we are debating about, there can only be 2 reasons, one, we are all talking rubbish (which I am very doubtful because I do spent time thinking about what I have written most of the time and I say that goes for the rest of the forumites who have contributed to the serious postings in the forum) or two, you do not try to comprehend and analyze what we are discussing. I don't want to comment on which reason you fall into and I am sure that you have a good idea where you fall under. Before, the tirade of accusations start falling into me, I would want to say that intelligence has nothing to do with this. It is not a question about whether the rest of the people are smarter or better in English than you, it is a question about whether you want to engage and think critically about an issue here.<br></div>
