            <div class='col-md body'>My friend Ah Huat sells fried oyster at Bukit Batok Central. Ah huat once had a helper whom he had employed for years. This young man is Ah Lim. Ah Lim started working for Ah Huat since he quit school at 14. He had since learnt the ropes, especially Ah Huat's unbeatable skills of oyster frying. Later, instead of 1, Ah Huat had 2 woks frying at the same time to be able to serve out plates of fried oyster faster. Usually, Ah Huat at one wok, and Ah Lim at the other.<br><br>Then Ah Huat's business deteriorate. Partly because the oyster farm closed down and Ah Huat had to buy frozen oysters that didn't taste as good. But most importantly, Ah Huat was beginning to drink too much. The store was hardly making money. Ah Lim, now married had not been receiving his salary for months. He tried to revive the business, but was scoffed by Ah Huat for being a busy body. Ah Huat told Ah Lim that if he wish to teach him how to run his business, then he should become a boss instead. Knowing that Ah Huat could hardly keep his business anymore, Ah Lim left to work for Mr Lee, the owner of another coffee shop elsewhere.<br><br>Then earlier this year. Ah Huat employed Zhang Xiao Dong, or better known as the Cheena. Xiao Dong was came from Shangdong and came to Singapore to on work permit. Xiao Dong fries the best oyster. Now Ah Huat hardly needs to work at all. Xiao dong is cheap to hire and he fries 2 woks with both hands. Ah Huat skived even harder now.<br><br>Earlier during a beer session, Xiao Dong reveals that his greatest wish is to open a store in Chinatown in the US. But like he said, Rome wasn't built in a day. He has to start somewhere... and thus he is working here now.<br><br>Then last week, Ah Huat met Ah Lim, who is now a proud owner of his own fried oyster store. Fuming, he stormed towards Ah Lim's store, kicked and toppled his stove. "You quitter!" he said. You "fair weather hawker" he said. "I am doing just as well without you."<br><br>Back at Ah Huat's wok, Xiao Dong is studiously frying oyster with both hands... and dreaming the dream that he will one day leave this stinking oily old place to fry oyster in the US.<br><br>Ã—ÃœÂ²Ãƒ</div>

How being appreciated har? In wat way can we 'feel' appreciated for our efforts?<br><br>Frying oyster in US annual income is 10x more than bukit batok, how leh?<br><br>Most people dislike changes, imagine they have to decide to migrate to a foreign land - they have to leave their relatives, friends, memories behind and goto a unfamiliar place to live. Lotsa uncertainties, yet they still migrate. Why? Sometimes we not only gotta think of ppl being 'fair weathered' when they migrate, we oso gotta tink WHY it happened?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Everyone has their own views, plz be more mature to comment on the views, not the ppl who posted them.</div></blockquote>wat is the difference if mscrewu was to comment on the views instead of attacking the person? if he commented on the views without mentioning names (which i see pointless becos i like to give recognition where it's due - if you said it then i will say u did, like how quotes give due respect to the one making the statement by putting his/her name at the end) the person will obviously know who he's talking about and may take offence as well..<br><br>for example if person X says.. "country ABC's govt is useless and doesn't think about about it's citizens.."<br><br>and person Y says "that comment is stupid, and based on a shallow analysis of the country's govt."<br><br>how is that different to "you are stupid and have a shallow brain" (which of course is a personal attack)???<br><br>anyway, if he wants to attack personally as u put it, then there's really nothing we can do. and i hope it doesn't affect u too much, it's not worth it getting worked-up over a few words on the screen...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally suggest that for those who thinks that Singapore is a bad place to live in to go and try to live their "ideal" country for a couple of years..... eat there, sleep there, earn your living there.  Then decide whether if Singapore is as bad as you think.<br><br>The only thing that is constant in this world is "change".  Contridicting isn't it? As constant is the opposite of change.<br><br>Everywhere is changing.... every minute and every second.  There is no such things as ideal.  Instead of thinking to shift here and there, why not put your time into better use by thinking of what you can do to make singapore a better place for yourself and for everyone to live in?<br><br>To let others appreciate you, you have to learn how to appreciate them....... and don't close your heart and mind.</div>
