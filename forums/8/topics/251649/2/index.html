This is what men try to do on a regular basis but with calamitous results. The hold they have on their significant others is so temporary, so weak and so deceptive, that before they even sense it, their woman has them by <strong>the balls</strong> again.<br><br>Is it amoral, as the political reality of Machiavelli was, to dispense this advice? Is it wrong? How can a man and woman foster a lifetime commitment on trust and respect when one is out to <strong>manipulate the other for personal gain and satisfaction?</strong> Simple. She must never know your <strong>intentions or methods</strong> to influence her mind.<br><br><strong>With wily deceit,</strong> you must approach this technique like a martial art: discipline, prudence and stealth are your friends. But whereas in practice martial arts seek to exploit the physical leverage of an opponent to gain the advantage, female mind <strong>manipulation</strong> in the context of a relationship must use <strong>mental leverage</strong> to do the same.<br><br>Despite the cloak of Machiavellian wisdom, female mind manipulation borrows from the restraint of Confucius, the quiet ruthless practices of Sun Tzu and the meditation of Zen. If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there, does it make a sound? If you bend your woman to your will and she is oblivious to the fact, did you even manipulate her mind in the first place? Think about it.<br><br>Do you have to be a <strong>Jedi Knight</strong> of the subconscious to pull this off? Does it have to be this complex? Well to be honest with you, yes. Women are intricate creatures and, unless vulnerable because of innate insecurity, trauma or low intelligence, resist deception with maddening ease.<br><br>They question our judgment. They question our expertise. They question our intelligence. They question our taste. <strong>It drives us absolutely crazy.</strong> In our quest to carve a better life, all we want is an impression of <strong>obedience</strong> and submission to our masculine dominance.<br><br><strong>In order to exert influence and win infinite support from your woman,</strong> you need to hold a position of worth in life. You have to stand for something significant. You have to command reverence in your respective field. People should respect your dignity and moral resilience. Why? Simple. Women gravitate toward men of <strong>strong character</strong> and go to bat for them time and time again. You can be a university professor, a neurosurgeon or a janitor. It matters not. Just be the man who people turn to for advice, counsel and wisdom.<br><br><strong>Bend like a reed</strong><br>Stop me if you know this one:<br><br>If a stronger enemy assails you,<br>better bend like the reed by the stream.<br>Do not rear like an angry snake<br>if unremitting prosperity is what you seek.<br><br>Following the lowly manner of the reed<br>a man gains great prosperity in time.<br>Adopting the overbearing manner of the snake,<br>he is simply courting death.<br>*Excerpt from Pancatantra<br><br><strong>Your woman may not be a "stronger enemy" or even an enemy at all.</strong> There are times however, when she may prove to be a stubborn and formidable adversary. Apply the advice above in order to scuttle convention and curry her favor and loyalty. Remember the moral at hand. Better to bend like a reed than attack like a snake. The reed is buoyant, pliable and endures with time. <strong>Mighty oaks may break in a vicious storm, but reeds stand firm and last.</strong><br><br><strong>Condition your woman</strong><br><br>You have to think like Pavlov in order to condition your woman to behave the way you desire. Your woman may expect you to bark orders at her, <strong>criticize her or become angry when she upsets you.</strong> But you choose to remain quiet, cast her an intense gaze and speak in a soft tone. Again, you are a reed.<br><br>In a quarrel or conflict, if you transmit the depth of your disappointment, anger and even rage toward your woman in a cool and quiet manner, not only will you scare her straight, <strong>you will gain immeasurable respect and obedience.</strong> In good times, when the two of you are in bliss, express your love with as much warmth as possible. Be spontaneous and romantic. Make love to her. <strong>Be the man and be her man.</strong><br><br>In other words, reward her with affection and attention when she warrants it. Make it comfortable, easy and to her great advantage to submit to you.<br><br><strong>Draw her natural feminine instincts out</strong><br><br>Women want men who <strong>take control, not men who are control freaks.</strong> The difference is important. Control freaks are narcissists who put their desires and needs first.<br><br>Men who take control are protectors and leaders. The satiation of their desires and needs are the natural result of the effortless and invisible control they wield. Men who take control take care of their women. They treat them like royalty. They shelter them from harm. They love them and they are loyal. But with a stern voice and demeanor and an unflappable charisma, they engender passionate <strong>loyalty</strong> in return.<br><br>A woman who displays the latter will do anything for her man. She will be a whore in the bedroom, a good mother to his children, a partner in business or in crime, and a fierce defender to his detractors.<br><br>The Clint Eastwood tour de force Mystic River has a scene at the end between Sean Penn and Laura Linney that best demonstrates the theory in discussion. In a display of impressive spousal devotion, Linney assures her husband of her steadfast support in the face of a heinous crime. Incredulous, Penn rests his head on the bed as his wife expresses her allegiance and obedience with not only words, but also aggressive sexual advances. "You are the King," she whispers.<br><br>How did Sean Penn's character provoke such loyalty in his wife? He was a man who took care of his family. Their respect and the respect of his peers were absolute and pure. As a result, his wife, while no pushover and a strong character in her own right, was ready to exercise his whims and let him lead.<br>then you get the power<br><br><strong>Be a real man</strong> and apply the advice in this article in order to manipulate the mind of your woman and gain control in your relationship. Remember; manipulation is neither cruel nor wrong if you love her. It is wise.<br>[/b]</blockquote>Good article, except for the manipulation part. It drives a point of being real men.<br><br>A few days ago, there's this article about men obeying women in China. This is so wrong. They are behaving like slaves to women.<br><br>Do women actually have any respect for such guys?<br><br>This is not much different from many men here. Their girls like to give them silly demands, in which of course the men caved in to.<br><br>Guys, don't be too soft just because of a woman. Don't make use of women either but do not ever let them have the chance to step on you.<br><br>As a man, do not be afraid to speak up your mind to the woman. Can you imagine you a man, being afraid of a woman? It should be the other way. Your mum will be so proud of you with a son like that. And women will like real men.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It shouldn't be about controlling women.  It should be about re-discovering what it is to be a man.<br><br>Men have become so soft, indecisive and naggy.  With some men, I feel like I have to be the man.  It shouldn't be the case.  If you want a woman to listen, you have to know what you're doing.. you earn her respect, and not thru sneaky ways.  Men have screwed things up in the past when their say was the only say.. that's why women rose to task.<br><br>And that's a good thing too, to remind us that one gender cannot exist without the other. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

In fact she carried you for a whole 9 mths before giving birth to you isn't that something respectable? A point to remember, the woman of today aren't like those of yesteryears.. long gone are the days in which a lady would stay at home and await her husband and give in to his every whine most are even single and well earning their own dough so give it some thought before you start critising.

Its something written by yet another human being do u seriously believe every single thing u read? Time to wake up buddy. A man obeying his wife doesn't make him a slave in any sense its his choice and to most it just comes across as being understanding and no one's asking him to "follow everything she says" as u put it. It is simply called a choice, one in which every single person is entitled to make so be clear and not stereotype or start sounding like some sexist. If u're one who doesn't like listening or doing what ur gf or wifes askes of u, by all means don't, no one's holding u at gunpoint to do so. What exactly are u trying to prove here? Try understanding the world more of the world or rather the human race. Really.</div>
