Its something written by yet another human being do u seriously believe every single thing u read? Time to wake up buddy. A man obeying his wife doesn't make him a slave in any sense its his choice and to most it just comes across as being understanding and no one's asking him to "follow everything she says" as u put it. It is simply called a choice, one in which every single person is entitled to make so be clear and not stereotype or start sounding like some sexist. If u're one who doesn't like listening or doing what ur gf or wifes askes of u, by all means don't, no one's holding u at gunpoint to do so. What exactly are u trying to prove here? Try understanding the world more of the world or rather the human race.

Maybe you hate men or think all men are stupid, I don't know nor wish to know.<br><br>To be fair, like you said, no one asked him to obey everything and you correctly stated it's a choice. And no, Im not trying to prove to you anything, but just let all the men know they have to have the respect, especially in a relationship, from a woman but should still treat them well. See, I say treat your kind well.<br><br>To sum it up, Im not attacking you or your sex. Im attacking the attitudes some women display, which I think is very wrong.<br><br>If after this post, you still say Im sexist, then you are a stubborn little girl who thinks all men owe you a living or you still need to read my post again until it sinks into your cute brain.

Do u not understand what I've written? I HAVE read the article but did I in any of the above sentence state that I agree that guys should be in any way treated as slaves?<br><br>And above u've mentioned that "i am a stubborn little girl who thinks all men owe me a living" yadah yadah, so which statement I've made suggests that? Assumptions and accusations on ur part. I agree that both sexes are NOT in any way or another to be treated as slaves and that a relationship is about compromising. Maybe u should be the one who should try to read and fully comprehend what I'm trying to saying before blasting off in such a manner which tries to convey that I'm that typical type of women whom u've read about in that article.<br><br>And in case u didn't understand me the first time, I'll re-explain it to u. An article is just a piece of news it may be true it may not be, than again it may only be a minority of what the writer has seen, who is to tell whether what was written was really the whole truth, it is afterall to gain viewership which in other words means money earned, thats the way the media works, not everything is the whole truth.<br><br>I have a bf too and we give each other mutual respect. So what were u saying again? Queen of the world? Seriously, treat me as a little girl all u want, its ur choice but remember its not neccessarily true that the older ones are wiser, life is afterall a learning journey. Listen and understand and u may learn a thing or two from the "little ones".</div>
