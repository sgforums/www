              <p>no leh, China is very weak and push-over before 2000.</p>
              <p>they got trounced and abused by almost every country that tried to invade it.</p>
              <p>it's only around 2001 or so that the dragon really start to shake it's sleeping body, and in 2002 onwards, they started to have insane economic growth that made the world sat up.</p>
              <p>now at this rate they're advancing, i think if China head-to-head clash with USA, China may very well win the war.</p>

              <p>I don't get it.. Why whine so much about China when you yourself are the issue? You are not good enough to stand on your own 2 feet and feed your own mouth?</p>
              <p>Your system has brought you up in such a way that you are just plain used to being spoon fed all the time. U just want everything to be spoon fed to you and if you do not get it, you complain. And being the pampered child you are, you will eventually get what you want. That was the previous situation. But now it has changed.. Now the world is more open and you are being impacted by factors outside of your puny little world. And you start complaining and nothing is happening. No nannys to run after you and spood feed you. So you start whining. Great way to go buddy.</p>
              <p>What plastic bag mentioned is true. I am working and so are many others here, so tell me if anything I state here is wrong. I have seen many a times cases where there is an opening and people from India, China and of course Singapore apply for the job. It can be a job for a guy with a diploma and our dear old locals expect to be paid 3k for it and demand all the perks and stuff. But the simple gentlemen from China or India tend to say ok to a 2.5k salary and are more loyal and work much harder too. They show much more sincerity and loyalty towards the job and company. Unlike the Singaporean who MIGHT demand much higher wages and in the end after getting all the training and stuff, resign in just under 1 year. These are facts I am talking which I have personally seen.</p>
              <p>So who is at fault? The simple foreigner or the over-demanding, over-expecting local?</p>
              <p>Go take a look at yourself in the mirror before commenting about others.</p>
              <p>You think foreigners are rude? I have seen more construction workers giving up their seats to pregnant women or old people rather than the locals. I have seen more foreigners giving their way while I cycle on the footpath than the locals. I have seen more foreigners holding the lift for me than the locals. I have seen foreigners helping people by lifting heavy objects like shopping bags than locals.</p>
              <p>In short, TS, you seriously have to take a closer look at yourself before jumping to conclusions.</p>
              <p>And please for the sake of all, stop whining.</p>

              <p><br>Have you ever considered why are singaporeans demanding more from their boss?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Simply because we have more expenses to pay than the foreigners. We have to support ourself, wife, children and parents. Even with a salary of 3k is still not enough for all these expenses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The foreigners come here to work a few years, save enough money than go back to their country and become rich people over there. Of course they can demand a lower salary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go take a look at yourself first and hope you realise how naive you are. If you are a Singaporean, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.</p>

              <p>All your cursing won't be making China weak man, they already have advancement in technology that puts them up there with the US army. And they spend so much on military is not to conquer Taiwan. Taiwan is already theirs, they just trying to not let taiwan go, so there's no conquering here, it's their own sovereignty issues but other people want to kaypoh and make China look bad. Besides, they've made such great economic advancements neglecting other things, so they are making up for military advancements now, and US spends greater amounts of they're GDP on military than China does. And US is lagi arrogant, China is pissed off and keeping them in check and helping the rest of the world which is 'not on the US' side' get back on their feet.</p>
              <p>They aren't technically stealing your job unless you see yourself cleaning toilets and waiting on tables in kopitiams or something. And just cause a few are home wreckers doesn't mean they all are. If Chinese women had a chance you think they would rather come here and let people like you curse at them than stay in their own homes.</p>
              <p>China also has like 1.3 trillion USD somewhere in their backyard, you think your measly donation is a big deal huh. Singapore has to suck up to China more than China has to to Singapore luhh. Singapore benefits so much from China just that you don't see it. If China wasn't great Singapore won't be so kan cheong to sign free trade agreement with China</p>

              <p><br>China is far worst than USA. China only care about themself. They can't be bothered about terriorism and all other world issues. USA still bothers and even donates money to poorer countries despite the fact that their economy is weak. That is how noble they are. Sure, they do make some mistakes like attacking Iraq. But humans all make mistakes.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><em>And it is so easy to differentiate between a China chinese and a Singapore Chinese. 1 can speak good english and chinese, the other 1 can only speak good chinese.</em></p>
              <p>You must be kidding Singaporean speak good English and Chinese.  Many times when I visited in native English speaking countries and I overheard Singaporeans trying to impress the locals with their good command of English, the locals just look with eyes wide open and have totally no clue what these guys were on about.  In fact, there are very few who actually speak good English.  And I don't mean English with fake accent.  As for good Chinese, it is almost impossible to find a Singaporean who can conduct a decent coversation in Chinese without adding English, dialects or Malay all over the shop.  Don't believe me!  Keep your ears peeled next time you go out.</p>
              <p>I have no comments about Mainland Chinese.  They are not my concern.</p>

              <p><em>And it is so easy to differentiate between a China chinese
              and a Singapore Chinese. 1 can speak good english and chinese, the
              other 1 can only speak good chinese.</em></p>
              <p>You must be kidding Singaporean speak good English and
              Chinese.  Many times when I visited in native
              English speaking countries and I overheard Singaporeans trying
              to impress the locals with their good command of English, the
              locals just look with eyes wide open and have totally no clue what
              these guys were on about.  In fact, there are very few who
              actually speak good English.  And I don't mean English with
              fake accent.  As for good Chinese, it is almost impossible to
              find a Singaporean who can conduct a decent coversation in
              Chinese without adding English, dialects or Malay all over the
              shop.  Don't believe me!  Keep your ears peeled next
              time you go out.</p>
              <p>I have no comments about Mainland Chinese.  They are not my
              concern.</p>

              <p>Well said.</p>
              <p>And besides, hazeynut, you said:</p>

                                      go to university we have to work part time and support ourself.
                                      Foreigners come here don't have to work part time to support

              </blockquote>
              <p>Work part time and support yourself? To pay 6k per semester? While some of the foreigners pay 21k per semester. Bro.. Your arguments are not credible enough la. Seriously.. How old are you? Becoz if you are anything more then abt 15, I will be appalled at your bigoted thinking. You speak as if you have never experienced the real life out there. You speak as if you know all these from just hear-say.. lol..</p>
              <p>And to top of all that, you keep on adding something about PAP or whatever at the end.. Another big mistake.. Just assuming that myself and others are "lackeys"  (God, don't you know any other word, its getting boring reading this) of PAP.. LOL! You don't even know anything about me. Going around making ASSUMPTIONS. Speaks a lot about your overly simplistic thinking. Well done :p</p>

              <p>Like monday blue said in the next comment, you don't need to be honest and perfect to make money in China. Singaporeans at the least know conversational English and can easily teach local students from primary schools. We can teach them anything in fact. We are from Singapore, which is considered very strong in education over there. You just have to start a tuition center and start teaching English and Maths and establish a name by saying you are educated in Singapore and are from Singapore. You can make a fortune there..</p>
              <p>Its a huge country and everyone is ready to accept what you say if you can make yourself look like a highly educated and wise person. Of course, I wouldn't recommend that method of earning money though :)</p>
