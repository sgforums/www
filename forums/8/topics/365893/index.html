              <p>I don't like them. They come to singapore steal our jobs, seduce our guys and break up marriages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And don't tell me craps like our ancestors are from China etc. Even though that maybe true, over the years our culture have developed completly different from them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just look at the way we speak chinese is already different from them. Singapore Chinese speak chinese language the accent is different from China chinese.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And for those people who say that we must be good to the Chinese people from China who come to our country to work because our ancestors used to come from China to Singapore to work too is crap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We treat the chinese people from China so good and what do we get back in return? Nothing. I wonder if 1 day Singapore get attacked by other countries will China think that we are all chinese people and their ancestors and people come to Singapore to work and they send their army to help us?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Definetly not!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When an earthquake strike their country and 50 000 of their people died, we donate money and food to them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If 1 day a disaster strike Singapore, will China send us money and food to help us too?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Definetly not!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>China people are selfish people who only care about their own survival.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I want China to be forever weak. They deserve to be bullied by Japan and the foreigners in the past.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And now that China is becoming more powerful, they are becoming more aggroant too. According to a military report from America, China is spending billions of dollars every year on their military forces, much more than America.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why are they spending so much money on their military? Just because they are preparing to conquer back Taiwan?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Definetly not! Only a tiny Taiwan does not require China to spend so much money on their military to conquer them. China people are up to no good!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We should get America and all the more powerful countries in the world to join force together to attack China. Let the year 1900, 8 allied countries join attack on China repeat itself again in history.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Teach the arrogant China people a lesson. Let them know that don't think they are becoming more powerful than we all have to be afraid of them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let China forever be weak than they won't be able to be arrogant.</p>

Ancient chinese culture is very much different from contemporary China. Hopefully, China's government can be changed to a monarchy. I think communism is not suitable for china. China now is not even practising communism even though its government is communist. Let us bring back the Emperor for China. China should learn from Japan. Japan also has an Emperor.

              <p><br>Yeah. China is strong. So why is it that we are still bullied by Malaysia and Indonesia calling us a tiny red dot?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The world take note of China because the world knows that China will become a big bully in future. And when China becomes a big bully in future, Singapore will become a victim too as we are chinese too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And it is so easy to differentiate between a China chinese and a Singapore Chinese. 1 can speak good english and chinese, the other 1 can only speak good chinese.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am impressed by how naive you are thinking that if China is strong people will respect all chinese.</p>

              <p>All your cursing won't be making China weak man, they already have advancement in technology that puts them up there with the US army. And they spend so much on military is not to conquer Taiwan. Taiwan is already theirs, they just trying to not let taiwan go, so there's no conquering here, it's their own sovereignty issues but other people want to kaypoh and make China look bad. Besides, they've made such great economic advancements neglecting other things, so they are making up for military advancements now, and US spends greater amounts of they're GDP on military than China does. And US is lagi arrogant, China is pissed off and keeping them in check and helping the rest of the world which is 'not on the US' side' get back on their feet.</p>
              <p>They aren't technically stealing your job unless you see yourself cleaning toilets and waiting on tables in kopitiams or something. And just cause a few are home wreckers doesn't mean they all are. If Chinese women had a chance you think they would rather come here and let people like you curse at them than stay in their own homes.</p>
              <p>China also has like 1.3 trillion USD somewhere in their backyard, you think your measly donation is a big deal huh. Singapore has to suck up to China more than China has to to Singapore luhh. Singapore benefits so much from China just that you don't see it. If China wasn't great Singapore won't be so kan cheong to sign free trade agreement with China</p>
