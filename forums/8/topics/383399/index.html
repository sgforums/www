              <p>I wish to have a career change to work in the social service sector.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I went to WDA website and found that they are offering PCP programme for Social Service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are 3 main providers, Hua Mei Training Academy Tsao Foundation, boxhill and SIM university.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I tried applying for Hua Mei Training Academy but did not get selected. For boxhill, I did a search and found out that although the fees are cheap, you spend around 1k plus and 3 months only you can get a diploma in social work already, but during these 3 months you are not given any allowance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Haven't try apply for the SIM University 1 yet. Its a 24 months part time course and you will work and study during these 2 years and get 1k allowance a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seems quite difficult to get into SIM university as alot of people apply for this programme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are there any other alternatives courses which are cheap and preferably it will be a work and study scheme whereby I will get a monthly allowance from the orgainsation?</p>

              <p>I got enough savings to last more than 3 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it will be better to have allowance when studying right? Also, most organisations who give you allowance when you are studying will require you to sign a bond to work for a certain period with them after you complete your studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I prefer this arrangement as it will assure me of a job when I graduate. Don't need to worry about can't find a job after you graduate</p>

              <p>Hi keeptouch,</p>
              <p>Besides the social service sector, have you considered joining the education sector? While studying for a diploma or a degree in Education in NIE, you will receive some pay, and your studies will be fully paid for as well. </p>
              <p>The bond is generally 3~5 years, depending on the specific diploma/degree taken, and since you wish to be assured of a job when you graduate, this will suit you very well if you have the interest and commitment.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
