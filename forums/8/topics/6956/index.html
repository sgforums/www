I met her at the void deck to return a book I had borrowed and we chatted awhile. Then I walked her to the lift and before she went up I just said, "No goodnight kiss?" I assumed she would either say no or just peck me on the cheek. Heh, imagine my shock when she held my head and kissed me on the lips.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I recieved my first kiss rite the morning after my school's prom thingy at Orchard Mandrin.<br>Right after my A Maths paper, I left straight for Desaru on a holiday.. so I did not get to see my then bf before I left lar..<br>So when I got back to spore I called him immediately but he was busy.<br>Then on the nite of my prom I remembered that my bf had to prepare for his own skool's prefectorial prom at the Le Meridian, so I left my hotel early just to give him a surprise visit, but he already left the Meridian. So I went back to my hotel. He paged me at around 12.. den we tok and arranged a breakfast date.<br>The next day .. argh!!! I had a sore throat.. but nonetheless, was extremely excited to see him. After breakfast he walked me back to my hotel where my good friends, who were still sleeping soundly, decided not to come down from the room to give me the keys to go up.<br>So I walked him to the bus stop. He was hugging me, and I was looking out for his bus. Suddenly, I felt him kiss me on my cheek. Not once, but twice! Darn my sore throat.. it could have been on my lips instead..<br>*sighs*<br>But maybe it was a blessing in disguise, cos my prom was on a friday nite, and we broke off the next friday.. cos he realised that he still loved his previous crush..<br>Anyway.. I'm thankful that I haven't given away my first kiss yet.. cos I want it to be shared with a really really special someone<br>*grinz*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It happened during a Xmas disco party in my university union in UK. My mate told me that there is a custom whereby if you hold this plant call Misotoes (not sure abt the spelling) above the other person head, you can ask for a kiss. I got hold of one and stand around, looking for potential target.. wanna try Brit gals but a bit shy. In the end I saw this cute Korean or HK gal dancing in the crowd. So, plant in my hand raise it above her head and she got the idea.. there goes my first kiss, although just a peck on the cheek.<br><br>The thing is I didn't see her around campus after than night and I dun even know her name.
