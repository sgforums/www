One lesser known rumour states that the true vampire is a female.The first vampire ever.And she descened from Eve<br><br>While others argue that the true vampire was a male and he's the brother of the devil -The satan.<br><br>It is said that the true vampire does not have the classic weaknesses like lack of immunity to sunlight, allergy to holy water ect. because at the time of its origin, there were no humans and no counter methods.<br><br>And that the true vampire could be walking earth right now and it does not cause harm to others. Feeding on animals instead of humans.<br><br>Now brings us the question are vampires real. I certainly think so. Because there could be a race of genetically mutated humans craving for blood.The medical world suggests a psychological condition for vampirism, the same as it is for cannabilism.<br><br></div></blockquote><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet Homecoming,<br><br>There exist many different kinds of people who either identify or have been identified with the label "Vampire". Generally they fall into three broad overlapping categories: (1) blood-drinkers, (2) psychic vampires and other energy-hungerers, and (3) Vampyre lifestylers.<br><br>Within the vampiric community, the word "vampire" is often used more narrowly to refer to sanguinarians and psychic vampires. The following links pertain to the broader categories of blood-drinkers and energy-hungerers, with an emphasis on, but not limited to, sanguinarians and psychic vampires.<br><br>A True bloodline Vampire of Today does not live forever, just they live longer &amp; don't fall sick.<br><br>Yes, "Vampire" do exist, they are neither just Myth nor Fiction or only exist in any Fabricated Media "Rubbish" like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"! "Vampire" depicted &amp; portrayed by the Media over the years has been distorted &amp; exaggerated in many ways! "Vampire" are among us, co-existed in our Human community for centuries...just as "WE" evolved, "Vampire" has gone through evolution to blend in with our societies &amp; communities...<br><br>Well have a look in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=78716" rel="nofollow">VAMPIRE ~ Truth or Fiction ~</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=102356" rel="nofollow">VAMPIRE ~ Truth or Fiction ~ Part II</a>, perhap you will have more understanding about them....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha... origins of vampires...<br><br>In White Wolf's World of Darkness, vampires descended from Caine, who slain his brother Abel. He was made to drink blood and only blood by God for his crime (the first homicide). Caine was taught the art of vampirism by the First Woman, Lilith. Caine is Cain in the Bible; Lilith is entirely fictional.<br><br>As for Dracula, he was originally a prince of Romania (Wallachia[spelling?], to be exact), who somehow turned into a vampire after his death. He was already rather bloodthirsty (pardon the pun) and cruel in his method of dealing with people who were against him (impaling them on wooden stakes)...<br><br>Oh, if you watch this Hong Kong drama series (My Date with a Vampire II and III only; vampires in the first part does not seem to share the same origin), the vampires are descended from a powerful vampire called Jiang Chen, or vampire commander (as he is subtitled, although the 'Jiang' is tone 4, for 'general' and not tone 1 for 'vampire'...)<br><br>This Jiang Chen, in turn, belongs to a group of people called Pan Gu. Yes, that is the same Pan Gu in Chinese Mythology who created the world, only that in the drama series, Pan Gu is not a single entity but a group/tribe of people.<br><br>There are also two other members from this Pan Gu tribe which appeared in Part III, both of whom are considered deities, and one of whom is even the image upon which Man was created (by the goddess Nuwa).<br><br></div>
