              <p>It's perfectly ok to criticise. But it is not ok to argue just for the sake of arguing or for personal glory, play to the gallery.</p>
              <p>Our parliamentary system is based on consensus. Debates must be argued based on facts, empirical figures, real and irrefutable evidences, logic and reasoning, to bring issues across.</p>
              <p>No 2 persons think alike. But at the end of the day, with more MPs, more brains, the best course of action can be deduced for our cabinet ministers to make a decision.</p>
              <p>Sometimes such decisions may not be the best for short term, but it will ensure survival in the long term, and it must benefit the majority of citizens, knowing full well that there may be a minority who may not be pleased, but as we live in a community, we must learn to compromise for the sake of others so that we may all live in peace to love and prosper.</p>
              <p>But the Outlaw had shown himself incapable of compromises for the betterment of the whole, traitorous, no qualms in smearing others without evidences, using others even naive kids to promote himself, self seeking and using unconstitutional means to put himself as a dictator, even when he is not elected or representative of anyone! Thus he is a dangerous man to have in politics, not to the ruling party, but to us citizens.</p>
              <p>If you are seeking excitment, watch a movie, join our army for realistic role playing simulation with real sweat and real weapons, or play some MMORPG. At least others who only want to live in peace and love can be spared political gridlock and chaos you seem to favour.</p>

              <p>If he is really destined to be such a person who cannot be bullied, can he at least win whenever he make noise or not? At least win once please ....</p>
              <p>Making so many noises and ended up as the ultimate loser every single time only proves one thing that is very true.</p>
              <p>CSJ isn't a very smart person in real life, he's just like any other regular Singaporeans out there.</p>

              <p>Do you think the future generations will know more about LKY and his empirical achievements or CSJ and his loyal merry men (if he had any...)?</p>
              <p>There is difference between animals, some are born to be stronger than others within the same breed.</p>
              <p>Same goes for humans, some humans are just born to be better than others. Losers usually address those differences as a gift or talent to suppress and pacify their own jealously and use it as an eternal excuse for their own uselessness in life.</p>
