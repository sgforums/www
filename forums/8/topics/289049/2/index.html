            <div class='col-md body'>I understand Edmund's situation. Sometimes, it can get too overwhelming when they get a whole bunch of idiots to psycho you into buying something you don't want to and that is scheming. I fully support Edmund's decision of going to CASE and do it fast too! They have no right to pressure anyone into signing any deals regardless of how large or small the amount. Bullying tactics that's what they are applying. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not understand why in the first place you are at that fitness centre. There are cheap government fitness centre where at a mere price of 2.50SGD per entry. There are also instructors there who will give you advices and trainings that you truely need. Also, you can make frens with the patrons there who will also give you good advices.<br><br>That place is well know for hard selling. No matter how confusing it is, you do not have to sign anything. They can credit one million credits into ur account but at the end of the day, if you did not agree to it, you have nothing to worry about. But by signing something, somehow the situation is made complicated.<br>Reporting to CASE seems to be a good idea as a revenue for grievences but they are rather powerless at times.<br><br>Can't find a girlfriend if you are not a hunk been trained at that fitness centre. Oh pls, you don't need thick muscles, you need thick wallet. And most of the time, you will need neither.<br><br>As adviced, try to call your credit card company and fill up the form to stop the transaction as it is aganist your will. Then call up CASE and report them. Now is not the time to act meek and humble. Act fast and tell off anyone that gets in your way. You can do it!</div>

Anyway even they credit it , they can uncredit it, card machine can do it.  So what they credit it - you can call the bank to say - you never agreed to it and never sign for it ........ then that transaction will be on hold ... for investigation which they do not have any signature - to prove of purchase.<br><br>Well you could have on the spot threatened to sue them for illegal transaction of card without your authorisation .<br><br>So what 3 -4 guy surround you ... just tell them - you are getting out ... if they stand in the way ... you will call police and sue them for threatening and illegal retention of people. They touch you .... you can sue them till you no need to work ... they feed you everymonth.<br><br>Why your brain is so weak !!! No mean no !!! just walk out !!!<br><br>You are a victim of not hardselling tactics but a victim of your own bloody weak mind.</div>

I was exercising alone when 1 instructor just came to me and said wanted to show me proper technique.  I wanted to be left alone but he seemed sincere in helping me, and he talk non stop anyway. After showing me abs n biceps, he got another guy to come over...then 2 instructors talking non stop etc etc. Keep saying must test my body on a machine to see how fat/muscular I am. So i wanted to do it to keep their mouth shut. I didnt expect it to continue for so long.<br><br>I called CASE up, got appointment with them tmr. Sigh.

He is here only to ask for advise.  I supposed you must be a street-wise and strong minded person and will not succumb to such hard-sell tactics but I guess the TS is not like you in this matter.  I am sure he has learnt his lesson and will not fall for such sale tactic in the future.  I am sure this tactic has worked for these trainers for them to keep on using it.<br><br>He may not be able to get his money back but going to CASE to lodge a complaint may make California Fitness be more mindful of their "bullying" ways in making a sale.</div>
