However, you can authorise your bank to stop this deduction, but then the penalty of not paying up or so call ceasation of contract by you is your liability, i.e to say that they can sue you or alternatively ask for compensation from you.<br><br>Case will take in your complain, but will not withdrawn your contract signed with the fitness centre, because they do not have the right to do that, the only thing Case will do is to hold a talk with the mgt of the centre, and if needed, warn the centre that they can be blacklisted if malpractice is provern truth. Remember, Case is not an agency for prosection but rather to provide consumer an avenue for better services.<br><br>Whether you are a victim of harassment or not, you had signed the contract with your EYEs OPEN. And in the law of the court, anyone above 21 yo breached a contract he/she signed and agreed upon with his/her EYEs OPEN, is liable to be prosecuted to pay compensation to the principal party he/she signed with, be fined by the govt. and shall foot all legal costs as necessary. And that to my experience, minimium 20k. I gather it will be very difficult for you to win the case, unless you can prove to the court that you signed the contract with your EYE Closed, that is, you are forced, drugged, stimulated, threatened, hallucinated, sabotaged, conned, or at gun or knife pointed.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by EdmundHeng80:</div><div class="quote_body">I was harassed by a few gym instructors from California Fitness Gym (Orchard) to buy a training package costing more than $1000. I kept on saying no but they still persisted. Calling more and more instructors to talk to me, even once I was cornered by 3 of them at the same time. The whole harassment lasted 1 hour from about 7:15pm to 8:30pm. The instructor called his senior to harass me, then his senior asked his Mgr to harass me.<br><br>And he just kept asking Â“So when you able to afford.Â” Finally I just say a month, December. I DID NOT WANT TO BUY THE PACKAGE!! Then he keyed in something to the pc and just said to me "I have credited the amount (bill) to your gym card". I was so shocked! I DID NOT AGREE TO BUY THE GYM TRAINING PACKAGE!! I simply said I will have money in December. I never once said I will buy or I want to buy. So I was shocked with his actions. How can he just say I have credited the amount to my gym card when I did not agree?!! Saying I will have money does not mean I want to spend it on the gym package!!<br><br>He then passed me some contracts to sign which I did because I was so confused since he said he ALREADY credited the amount to my gym card. The amount will only be credited on 11th Dec, bcuz I said I will only have money in Dec. I just anyhow made up the month, becuz I wanted to drag as long as possible, if not I will have to pay immediately.</div></blockquote>Hi there. From the situation you have described, I believe what the manager had done constituted an unfair practice under the consumer protection Act because the instructors exerted pressure on you and the manager misled you into signing the contract. You have a case against him simply because he have or claimed to have credited the bill to your gym card which was AGAINST YOUR WILL.<br><br>Don't worry too much. Explain your case and situation accordingly when you meet the CASE representative. Don't miss out on any vital information.<br><br>Whatever the outcome, I don't think you would want to walk or go near that gym again. After settle everything, cut your gym card into pieces and throw them down the rubbish chute.</div>

In fact every 1-2 months or so I will either get harassed to sign up for a gym package or they will want me to spend a lump sum of nearly $3k to upgrade my card to the lifetime membership. Just 1 year alone I have been harassed like nearly 10 times.<br></div></blockquote>yes. WTF indeed. If what the instructor said is true, then we must have BIG BALLS if we want to get attached.<br><br>Tell me, SMLJ?!<br><br>Really ar...KNN PCB pui chao nua on that instructor....</div>
