            <div class='col-md body'>I am so gald for you man.. California Fitness.. Haiz.. They irritated me as well and they still do. They are real crappy people I tell you. So naggy and irritating. I had won their 14 day free pass, which everyone seems to be winning these days, and so went down to have a look around. Then woah.. They tried to brain wash me.. But they didn't realise that I was smarter then them. Becoz I was actually waiting for a friend and she was VERY VERY late.. So I didn't know what to do.. So as the person explained to me everything I kept on making excuses that this cannot that cannot and to my horror he OBLIGED to all my nonsensical comments and requests!'<br><br>Like I asked him to remove registration fees of 200 bucks or something then less then half the monthly fees and he said ok to everything! And he said to give me the 14 day pass I have to give 10 handphone numbers of my friends! BLARDY HELL! Guess what I did? I just wrote down nonsensical numbers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Idiots.. I am gonna preach every1 against them now. And eventualy when my friend message me that she was there, I just got up and told him, "Hey I will need time to decide on this, I gtg now as my friend is here, bye!" and before he can say anything I left! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Edmund,<br><br>Sorry to hear about your plight. My friends and i been with them for many years and can only say that their service has been very good. I think it's a black sheep that you have encountered. Nevertheless, since you have sign it, why not make full use of their facilities as well as their services?<br><br>With our hectic lifestyle, a gym membership is a small price to pay for the comfort to exercise and to de-stress, which is precisely the reason why i sign up for it. I would just encourage you to give them a chance to provide their service to you and thus make your $$ worth.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Take care and do not worry so much.</div>

My friends and i been with them for many years and can only say that their service has been very good. I think it's a black sheep that you have encountered. Nevertheless, since you have sign it, why not make full use of their facilities as well as their services?<br><br>With our hectic lifestyle, a gym membership is a small price to pay for the comfort to exercise and to de-stress, which is precisely the reason why i sign up for it. I would just encourage you to give them a chance to provide their service to you and thus make your $$ worth.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Take care and do not worry so much.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

This is to protect you against any issues that may arise in future. It is difficult to prove a verbal agreement and you did sign for something that day. That most senior manager may not be there by then to back you up.<br><br>Cheers,<br>BabyRex</div>
