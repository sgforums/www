            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I was harassed by a few gym instructors from California Fitness Gym (Orchard) to buy a training package costing more than $1000. I kept on saying no but they still persisted. Calling more and more instructors to talk to me, even once I was cornered by 3 of them at the same time. The whole harassment lasted 1 hour from about 7:15pm to 8:30pm. The instructor called his senior to harass me, then his senior asked his Mgr to harass me.<br><br>The manager (Zen Lee) was using very hard sell tactics. No matter how many times I say no to buy the fitness package of more than $1000, he keep asking me when I can pay. I told him I am financially UNABLE to spend that kind of money because I have retired parents to look after. I tell him I have no money more than 10 times. But he did not listen!!<br><br>And he just ask kept asking Â“So when you able to afford.Â” Finally I just say a month, December. I DID NOT WANT TO BUY THE PACKAGE!! Then he keyed in something to the pc and just said to me "I have credited the amount (bill) to your gym card". I was so shocked! I DID NOT AGREE TO BUY THE GYM TRAINING PACKAGE!! I simply said I will have money in December. I never once said I will buy or I want to buy. So I was shocked with his actions. How can he just say I have credited the amount to my gym card when I did not agree?!! Saying I will have money does not mean I want to spend it on the gym package!!<br><br>He then passed me some contracts to sign which I did because I was so confused since he said he ALREADY credited the amount to my gym card. The amount will only be credited on 11th Dec, bcuz I said I will only have money in Dec. I just anyhow made up the month, becuz I wanted to drag as long as possible, if not I will have to pay immediately.<br><br>Just to add on. I also have medical bills to think of. Costing $600 to more than $1k a month on serious cases....this incident will just wipe my bank dry.<br><br>Whalao! Guys. Have anyone had this experience before? I need to go to CASE tomorrow. I am so worried sick about this. Will CASE be able to help me??<br><br>Edit: This is NOT THE FIRST TIME such harassment case happaned to me. Even once, I was told by an instructor if I do not sign up a package with them, I will not be able to get a girlfriend bcuz my body is not impressive. I was like WTF MAN. In fact every 1-2 months or so I will either get harassed to sign up for a gym package or they will want me to spend a lump sum of nearly $3k to upgrade my card to the lifetime membership. Just 1 year alone I have been harassed like nearly 10 times.<br><br>Once even a manager, at the entrance where they will scan your gym card, did not give me back my gym card and wanted me to sit down with him to discuss the "Great Discounts" he can give me for the lifetime membership card. I am really sick of california fitness gym and I AM going to all forums that I can think of to paste this and let everyone read it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Check out the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act<br>http://app.mti.gov.sg/default.asp?id=84<br><br>extracted from the FAQ:<br>8. Would consumers be able to cancel contracts under the Act?<br><br>MTI has gazetted regulations to allow for cancellation of time share and direct sales contracts within a 3-day cooling off period (excluding Sat, Sun and public holidays). The cooling off period is specifically targeted at situations where the consumer is subjected to high-pressure sale tactics. During the cooling-off period, consumers should review their purchasing decision and, if they decide to cancel the contract, give the trader notice of cancellation in the manner provided under the Regulations.<br><br>In the event that the consumer encounters an unfair practice in the course of a time share or direct sales transaction, he would still be able to commence action under the Act and seek civil remedies. He may also exercise any other rights of action he may have under any other law, for example, contract or tort law. This is irrespective of whether the 3-day cooling off period has lapsed.<br><br>I think you can consider yours as a direct sales contract if you had signed any.<br>Anyway, I suggest you go to CASE first to seek advices.<br><br>Cheers,<br>BabyRex</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eh no wor. Tat time when i got dragged in. the guy asked me if i had XX credit card have discounted rates blah blah. Then i say have.. then he asked if he could see the card (check if its ok to use that card). so i took it out and showed it to him. Now that i think abt it He could have copied the credit card number -___- i think i aslo better call my card company to cancell card or to get me a new one. i read other reviews on Cali it seems they have a lot of problems with all this payment issues also .</div>
