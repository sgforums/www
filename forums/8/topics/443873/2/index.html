              <p>Let me share my story. I am one of the married women who has a lover. Maybe you all will think I am cheap, slutty, insensitive and evil.But unless you are in my shoes, you will never understand why the affair was so inevitable.</p>
              <p>I married a man who only knows how to work and love means just putting food on the table. For years, I lead a very lonely marriage and life was just about looking after 2 kids.Then one day, I discovered that my husband has a lover in his office. He decided to end the affair but I was so scarred that I could hardly trust him anymore.</p>
              <p>My mom decided to help me take care of my 2 kids while I work. I wanted to be independent. Later I got to know a colleague who just went through a divorce because of his wife's affair. I do not know why but I felt my life was restored when I was with him. I felt no more void and I could even bear with my husband's dirty past. I felt the marriage was dead anyway but we just hang on for the kids' sake. The kids are not aware of the tension between us.</p>
              <p>I am still with my lover now and we have been together for a year. I cannot imagine life without him and I am also hoping that the kids will grow up and I can leave the marriage. My husband and I are in separate worlds anyway.</p>
              <p>You may want to scold me or whatever but I have to tell you, when you are in a loveless, empty marriage, affairs become a way (though not the most ideal) to heal the deep void. Not trying to teach you bad but just sharing my story. I still hope you all need not have to resort to having affairs like me.</p>

              <p>Let me share my story. I am one of the married women who has a lover. Maybe you all will think I am cheap, slutty, insensitive and evil.But unless you are in my shoes, you will never understand why the affair was so inevitable.</p>
              <p>I married a man who only knows how to work and love means just putting food on the table. For years, I lead a very lonely marriage and life was just about looking after 2 kids.Then one day, I discovered that my husband has a lover in his office. He decided to end the affair but I was so scarred that I could hardly trust him anymore.</p>
              <p>My mom decided to help me take care of my 2 kids while I work. I wanted to be independent. Later I got to know a colleague who just went through a divorce because of his wife's affair. I do not know why but I felt my life was restored when I was with him. I felt no more void and I could even bear with my husband's dirty past. I felt the marriage was dead anyway but we just hang on for the kids' sake. The kids are not aware of the tension between us.</p>
              <p>I am still with my lover now and we have been together for a year. I cannot imagine life without him and I am also hoping that the kids will grow up and I can leave the marriage. My husband and I are in separate worlds anyway.</p>
              <p>You may want to scold me or whatever but I have to tell you, when you are in a loveless, empty marriage, affairs become a way (though not the most ideal) to heal the deep void. Not trying to teach you bad but just sharing my story. I still hope you all need not have to resort to having affairs like me.</p>

              <p>I always feel sad to hear about unfaithful people. I read about your case with mixed feelings. In a failed relationship, I think usually both parties are in the wrong. So is your case, BUT your husband is more wrong because he started the affair first.</p>
              <p>May I ask you, if your husband did not have an affair, but everything else (boring, unloving, etc) is the same, will you begin to love your colleague and have an affair with him? Which is the real reason why you strayed? His infidelity, or his boring lifestyle?</p>
              <p>Why did he stop being loving towards you? Or did you lose the magical feelings first? Did you care for his little things in life, and neglected him FIRST? I feel that relationship is like playing a ball game. You have to return the ball (feelings), and it goes to and fro. Once someone stop returning, the game is over.</p>
              <p>I am 36 and single. I so wish to find a nice girl to love and marry forever. But because all the stories of cheating spouses I heard all the time, it instilled fear in me. I will be shattered if I catch my wife screwing another man in bed when I come home from work.</p>
