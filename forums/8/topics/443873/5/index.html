              <p>So women are more prone to be unfaithful nowadays compared to
              30~50y ago ? I think its due to their increase in earning
              power....</p>

              <p>Yup, in the past, women stayed at home doing home chores, cooking, laundrey, took care of children. Now, women work , do not cook, kids leave to maids. They are exposed to more working men. They are competing with men in the working world now. With so much independence, they are taking charge of their own social lives and nobody can stop them if they want to fall for anyone .Women today are no longer the docile ones of our grannies' years.</p>
