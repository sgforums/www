              extremely one sided during a divorce......It would be best to

              <p>couples marry each other because they are in love.  nobody in the right state of mind thinks about all those things you just mentioned before signing the papers. if you do, then either you are so damn rich you worry about losing half your assets upon divorce OR you are intending to marry someone whom you are not such about.</p>

              Marriage is just a piece of paper. It does nothing but enables a couple to have kids without stigma.
              
              Men AND women will cheat when they get a better deal. It takes two hands to clap in a deal. So if not enough effort is invested in a marriage because they think everything is guaranteed-plus-chop-since-we-have-the-we're-married-paper, wouldn't it be better to not get married?
              
              So why get married unless you want kids?
              
              Too much liabilities. It's not easy to kick out/break away from a cheating spouse. And getting divorced will only result in stigma. Yes, people, advanced as they are in technology and intelligence, still stereotype and judge others. Sad case.
              
              PS: I'm not married btw, just know of true stories =) Just my two cents la.

              <p>It is actually possible to have kids without the need for marriage with sg women...problem is u need to be rich...one example is hong kong joseph lau...one of hk richest....see how many kids he father...all his women all ex ms.hk......but he din marry them....so same apply to sg women la....actually anywhere same as a guy if u really rich.....u dun marry the woman also can have kids.....but the main problem is...how many guys out there can be tat rich....&gt;&lt;"</p>
              <p>And it is pointless if the man is faithful..what if the wife commit adultery n yet want to claim alimony...it is not easy to prove adultery in the court leh.....so guys better think long n hard before u get into a marriage....</p>
              <p>And sad to say...a lot of ppl out there got married for the cheap hdb houses....wat to do government drive up the prices of the house....left the new generation with little choice but to get married to own a house...&gt;&lt;"</p>
