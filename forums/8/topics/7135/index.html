            <div class='col-md body'>Hi LittleMan,<br><br>If youÂ’re reading this today, good, if not, I hope you will read this when you next visit. Thank you for speaking up for me and the rest of the forumites who were unfortunate enough to be maligned by some really childish forumites whose cerebral craniums didnÂ’t developed properly and thus retarded their mental development in the other thread dedicated to you.<br><br>Kind of suay to be targeted like that, isnÂ’t it? It is so sad to see some so-called highly educated people so blinkered in their own narrow beliefs that they would stoop to new lows seen on this forum just to prove their point. Well, some people are just like that and enough words wasted on them.<br><br>You asked if I watched Â“Eyes Wide ShutÂ” in the other thread, the answer is no.<br><br>I believe that no forumite has the right to ask another to leave this forum, so donÂ’t feel that you have to go just because they said that you said so. So? Just because when one fall out of love and says that one will never fall in love again then, one will never do so meh?<br><br>Regulars to this forum would be intelligent and matured enough to know that all of us are separate entities, other than those few delusional imbeciles who are so bent on thinking we are the same of course. So long as our conscience are clear, there is no need to take to heart their baseless though spiteful words, time will bear them out.<br><br>Thank you for your advise to ignore them before it became the 3-ring circus it is now. In life, certain snubs and insults can be ignored but sometimes, there is just no avoiding them because there are people who are just hell bent on finding faults whether I ignored them or not. But not to worry about, I can take care of myself, if some forumites are want to offer themselves up on a platter for my flaming pleasure, who am I to refuse their requests?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Of course, I wonÂ’t waste unnecessary time on them, just when I have free time or so.<br><br>By the way, please convey to Belittled that I saw that he finally knew the right way to write my name.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh yeah, it just occurred to me that those people are just jealous that you had supporters while they had none. Probably also they wished they were smart like you but werenÂ’t.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Have a good time in UK and study hard. Same wish to Belittled.<br>colette</div>
