If no one wants to be in love, the main reason for falling in love wouldn't be there right?<br>For me, I always wanna be in love, but not to the extend that I am playing around.

It's most probably crush at first sight. Cos when u see the person, u just like the person's looks. Where as love.. now that's a different thing. It's more complex. Character should and must be taken into mind when u tok abt love. Would you rather fall in love with someone who you can get along very well with? Or someone who just looks good? Remember.. looks do change<br></div>
