            <div class='col-md body'>I had this incident too at my ex-working place.  2 Christian girls always reading their Bible every morning and then started to preach to me or their friends over the phone until 10.30am.  They will stop at this time coz they know the boss would be coming in soon.  As a Catholic I am not considered a Christian to them and they tried preaching the Bible teaching to me, or asking me to go to their church.  If I ignored them and I concentrated on my work, they will say that I am not interested in listening in God's teaching.  There was a day when one of them asked me whether I noticed that the moon turned red the previous night.  And according to them, that's a sign that the end of the world is coming soon.  Just then, a strong wind was blowing (just before rain), and she pulled me to the window to say that never such a thing happened before, so definitely end of the world is coming.  I was really frightened as I was not prepared to die yet.  Every day I would drag myself to work and develop fear of stepping into the office, coz I couldn't stand their preaching anymore.   I think part of my quitting the job was due to that.  Therefore, I agree that working in a Christian environment is sort of scary.  Religion should not be forced, you can invite, but no forcing, if not you will create more fear instead of peace.</div>
