Well, after that I told her I am not prepared to accept Christ in my life, but she was understanding, and we still remain friends.<br><br>In my JC, I had a gal friend who is passionate about Christianity, for her Jesus is everything, but we still get along, altho her passion scares other Christians away. So left me one guy only talk with her.<br><br>For me, aiyah, passionate or not, it doesnt matter, as long as they not overbearing, like keep pestering or even saying wrong things during an emergency like the above, just make sure dont be so overbearing and in the end piss people off. But at same time, everyone here should try to communicate with everyone...its challenging to communicate with someone so different, so passionate...try it!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>overbearing... yeah some of them are haha... in my sec sch days after i experienced the infamous church, i really had a bad view of them, but later on during NS, i met this dude who was christian but really cool n funny in my camp. He really improved my image of christians because he simply did not attempt to push his religion on me, instead he did not bring religion into the equation, but simply invited me along on some outings organised by his church for interests sake. I was impressed with how his church friends did not try to turn any outings into "recruitment" sessions, and just accepted ppl for who they are. in fact they were all pretty cool people. so, from this, i guess there are christians, and there are zealots, and then there are fanatics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tulip:</div><div class="quote_body">I had this incident too at my ex-working place.  2 Christian girls always reading their Bible every morning and then started to preach to me or their friends over the phone until 10.30am.  They will stop at this time coz they know the boss would be coming in soon.  As a Catholic I am not considered a Christian to them and they tried preaching the Bible teaching to me, or asking me to go to their church.  If I ignored them and I concentrated on my work, they will say that I am not interested in listening in God's teaching.  There was a day when one of them asked me whether I noticed that the moon turned red the previous night.  And according to them, that's a sign that the end of the world is coming soon.  Just then, a strong wind was blowing (just before rain), and she pulled me to the window to say that never such a thing happened before, so definitely end of the world is coming.  I was really frightened as I was not prepared to die yet.  Every day I would drag myself to work and develop fear of stepping into the office, coz I couldn't stand their preaching anymore.   I think part of my quitting the job was due to that.  Therefore, I agree that working in a Christian environment is sort of scary.  Religion should not be forced, you can invite, but no forcing, if not you will create more fear instead of peace.</div></blockquote>that is <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> scary. it is really the religious zealots that put a bad name to religions. i am a christian, but i used to hate christians. i had nothing against the teachings of God but i had alot of frustrations toward the people "practising" his teachings. they turned me off. it was until i met a christian who was different from the other overzealous christians i'd met that i began to accept God into my life. christians behaving like your colleagues will turn potential-believers away. and at the end of the day they'll have to ask themselves - is this what God wants them to do?<br><br>as a christian i still find myself being in conflict with other christians, but i told myself that what's more important is my personal walk with God, and i focus on that.</div>
