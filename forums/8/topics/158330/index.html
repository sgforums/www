            <div class='col-md body'>Oct 19, 2005<br>Wealth of S'pore households grows by $34b<br>By Lorna Tan<br>Finance Correspondent<br><br>SINGAPOREANS are getting richer, and by the tune of about US$20 billion (S$34 billion).<br><br>The combined wealth of households here grew from US$270 billion to US$290 billion by the end of last year, according to the latest Global Wealth report by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG).<br><br>The wealthy elite contributed to the lion's share of the wealth, with assets totalling US$275 billion. They are defined as those with at least US$100,000 in assets under management, including stocks, bonds, hedge funds and cash, but not property.<br><br>One of the main reasons why they have prospered is that Singapore has moulded itself on Switzerland, at least when it comes to changes in taxation and trust laws.<br><br>BCG vice-president and director Roman Scott said at the report's launch yesterday that recent law changes have helped Singapore become competitive and allow it to be positioned as the Asia-Pacific's Switzerland.<br><br><span style="color: red;">There is 'absolutely nothing' in Singapore tax and banking secrecy laws now that differentiates it from Switzerland,</span> he said.<br><br>However, Singapore's wealth figures pale in comparison to some Asian countries such as South Korea.<br><br>The total wealth of households in Asia grew to US$7.2 trillion last year from US$6.4 trillion in 2003, mainly because of strong expansion in South Korea, Australia and Taiwan.<br><br>They each achieved impressive compound annual growth rates - 20 per cent in Korea, 17.8 per cent in Australia and 8.7 per cent in Taiwan.<br><br>Taiwan and China had the highest asset holdings in absolute terms of US$1.47 trillion and US$1.44 trillion, respectively.<br><br>Wealth in both economies was extremely concentrated - about 2 per cent of households hold about 70 per cent of riches.<br><br>The proportion of Asian assets held as shares has increased slightly to 28 per cent, but most wealth is still held in cash and deposits.<br><br>In fact, this cash-is-king preference is a worrying trend which shows that the industry is 'failing' to provide suitable alternatives, said Mr Scott.<br><br>He pointed out that there was an alarming increase in average cash holdings by customers of banks in the Asia-Pacific to 43.2 per cent of assets under management last year. This is up from 35.7 per cent in 2003.<br><br>Wealth in Asia is expected to grow by 6.8 per cent annually from last year to 2009 with the 'established wealth' segment - those with more than US$5 million in investible assets - being the fastest-growing.<br><br>BCG cited China, India and Russia as 'the most attractive growth countries' in the near future and urged wealth managers to focus on them for diversification.<br><br></div>
