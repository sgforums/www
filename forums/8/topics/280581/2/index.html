I did call people names, but not at you. And if the person it was directed to did not ask me to apologise, who are you, an outsider, to get me to apologise? Does it involve you in the first place? Why are you such a kaypo? Are you a moderator?<br></div>

My post was in reply to another person. Why do you have to come in and call me names? And when I laughed and called you names in reply to your post, you get offended? Aren't you very childish?

Don't expect ppl here to pat your head and pander to your whims and fancies. And when called names and all, don't start crying to your mum. Hell, this is an internet forum, not nursery school.</div>
