            <div class='col-md body'>what grail and evolution said really puts me off. maybe i'm taking this too seriously, maybe i'm missing their POV but i totally object to what they feel/thk abt butches.<br>butches/lesbians/gays. arent they human too? what gives you the right to judge them? what makes you superior to them? to condemn their way of life and their behaviour. to term them as<br>"a bunch of people whose standards have gone a little off the track (in the sexual sense). Even if one is born with these tendencies that is not good excuse to let yourself be overtaken by them. I think this perversion of society is rampant because there's no law against it."<br><br>why must they conform to what society thks is right? why is it, if majority of the ppl thk a certain code of behaviour is the "right/proper" one everyone else must follow and abide to it? i'm not encouraging total mayhem, but i just feel tt just like you and i are given the right to express our opinions, homosexuals shld be allowed to lead the life they WANT, not what other ppl thk is best for them.<br><br>"They do not feel proud of themselves of being a female and they start to behave like a man. This may be caused by their hormones unbalance or may be caused by their bad experience from guys. But each and every human being on this earth do not choose to be born male or female."<br><br>i dont completely understand what you're trying to say or rather, i hope what i infer frm this isnt what you truly mean. true, our sex isnt somethg tt we can choose, so why are you condemning homosexuals? because they finally have the courage to "come out of the closet", face the rampant social prejudice and discrimination in order to lead the life they want to? to "follow their heart"?<br>the homosexuals i'm refering to are the so called "hardcores". the "true homosexuals" if such a term exists. i partially agree w evolution in tt "Lesbians are contagious". not exactly how i wld put it, but being in a convent sch, i thk i kinda get what she/he is trying to say.<br>lesbianism is contagious in tt, in many all-girls sch (or maybe it's only mine), lesbianism is extremely acceptable. everyone knows at least one lez. and rather than it being contagious or girls being forced to become lez, i thk it's more like girls are open to another alt, and some expt with it. they become more open and express their attraction for members of the same sex. it happens, i see it everyday. but for most it's merely an exptal stage, to see what they truly want, part of the search for their identity most teenagers go thru at this stage of their lives. however, some do realise tt they are truly homosexual or bi and cont this way.<br>most ppl seem to conclude tt all "normal-looking" girls ard butches are passive, what makes you thk so? does tt mean tt all the girls hanging ard a guy are attracted to him? why cant they just be frens? why must there be this instant conclusion tt: "yuck, bunch of wannabes passives and butches".<br>lastly, i guess there's this implication tt if laws are passed allowing homosexuals to get married, society wld inevitably collapse. but you have to realise tt, having the law condone homo marriages doesnt mean tt all of us wld "convert". in tt same way, prostitution is allowed in sg, does tt imply tt all girls wld automatically enter tt line? i feel tt such a law is merely providing an alt for them. how do you know tt what they're doing is unnatural and immoral? where is it stated in the bible (or any other religious book for tt matter)? i know islam doesnt condone such behaviour/"practices" but i feel such a law wld not cause the collapse of civilisation provided tt teenagers are educated abt the fine line between being attracted to members of the same sex and being homosexual.<br>in tt same way, passing a law against homosexuals wld not "wipe them out" so to speak. it'll just be like the ostrich burying his head in the sand, you're just refusing to acknowledge what exists. passing a law against them wld be open, blatant discrimination, and you guys are talking abt our basic human rights?<br>pls, just spare a thought for these "wierd individuals". you may not like the image they portray but tt doesnt give you a right to judge and condemn them. they're human too.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 29 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, after re-reading my post, i just wanted to apologize for making you guys sit through tt long, torturous essay of mine; kudos to those who actually managed to read the whole thg!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i know lots of ppl wld not agree w me and well, everyone's entitled to their own views and opinions, but i was really wked up at tt pt of time.<br>i guess the appearances of butches really irk some ppl, but i thk what tetrutetrumon suggests is kinda out of the qn. sex changes? do you have any idea what they cost? do you know how "easily available" they are in our "liberal" sg? and their dressing style is simply tt, a style of dressing they like. what's the big deal? i guess my main qn here is, what is it abt butches tt guys dislike??? any nice guys out there who'd like to enlighten me?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guess you all misunderstood what i'd said (except for Evolution). Thanks, Evo for noticing my "CONDEMN THE ACT, NOT THE PERSON". Guess I forgot to put that in FULL CAPS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Enigma,<br>I never said I wanted to kill butches, etc. My aggressive tendencies apply across the board - to everyone, no discrimination. But you will never find a man on earth who will EVER say that I am violent. This is what i've fought with inside me all my life. I've trained myself NEVER to be what I am to be naturally, and I think that gays, etc, can and should do the same.<br><br>Ataraxia,<br>If man has "no right to judge", then there will never be justice, so that little "truism" is a sham. I don't think you'd want a world where man had no right to judge. I judge butches in the same light as I judge myself - I know I do many wrong things, and of you point that out to me, I would agree with you.<br><br>Jasonnex,<br>Homosexuality IS a sin. Full stop. The Bible you've described doesn't exist and hasn't been translated and defiled over the centuries (or millenia). In comparison with the Dead Sea Scrolls, our modern Bible (KJV) is at least 98% accurate in meaning AND nuance. There is no question about the stand of God on Homosexuality. It is a sin. How ever, God does not condemn the sinner, but the sin. That's why he came to die for us in the first place.<br>Intolerance isn't a problem, prejudice is. Intolerance only concerns an issue, while prejudice is against a PERSON. I don't condemn people, God loves them too much to ever want me to. I condemn their depraved acts. As you rightly stated, homosexualtiy will not end the world, but it will contribute to its end.<br><br>Evolution,<br>Homosexuality has NOTHING to do with genes. Years of medical search have turned up nothing to suggest that homosexuality is genetic. If it was, wouldn't it be a paradox? How can you have offspring from people who won't actually reproduce? And even if some do by chance, why is the population actually GROWING? Homosexuality is a choice. You can be bred to be inclined to it, but it's ultimately your choice, as it was for me and violence.<br><br>If any of you have something to discuss in greater depth, don't hesitate to drop me a mail at  <a href="mailto:danyap@reborn.com" rel="nofollow">danyap@reborn.com</a> .

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i guess i just wanted to say tt it's glaringly obv tt there are two distinct arguments with vastly differing contentions and both sides can nv reach a compromise. i thk it's futile to cont this "discussion" since it wont do much help wld it? everyone has the right to his/her own opinions and no one shld be able to impose his/her views on others. all in all, i guess my main pt is tt this discussion wld be useless if none of us are willing to compromise, but i just hope tt we can accept others' POVs/opinions and respect them even if you cant understand it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Want to say something about this subject<br><br>WE cannot explain these tendancies that women and men have to be gay/les, but there are circumstances that do help to create this kind of mindset in people.  Usually it happens in their very early child hood.  Especially for gay men.  A lot of them have been severely abused by motheres or fathers and had no emotional supprt and all that...Also, overprotective parents and parents who don't pay enough attention to their children will usually make the child grow up hoping for their father's attention or  whatever...  It's more than what I'm saying, but u get the point right...:-)<br><br>But now a days, it's become a matter of people who don't know what they want and just want to experiment...and as more people experiment, there is a sense of pressure for those who aren't to experiment....just a quick way of saying it.<br><br>I don't find anything wrong with sharing toilets with people of the same sex.  This one place that I worked for here(yes in Singapore) had a unisex toilet.  It's really strange, even for someone like me from the USA.  It felt really funny having awoman walking in and washing her hand right next to you while ur peeing away into the urinal.  I felt uneasy, but you know what?...I thought that it was great.. Not from a perverted manner, but for the equalisation and acknowledgement of women as the same status as men and we actually shouldn't be segregated.  I loved the whole idea behind it.  U get used to it...:-)<br><br>Also to those postings quoting the bible and koran or whatever religious material it is that's being quoted or interpreted from.....<br><br>Did u know that gay and lesbiansm happens in the animal world also?  Don't beleieve me?  Put two male rabbits in the smae cage and watch them as they get comfortable with each other.....u'll see. Other larger mammals also, including us.  It's been going on since the beginning of civilisation.  Whether it's right or wrong isn't dictated by any written material, whether it's from us mortals or from the ultimate being, God, Buddha or what- have-you.<br><br>Just to let people know in advance that I am not blasting religion, but just putting aview to u to interpret any way u see fit.<br><br>Grail, lesbianism and homosexuality won't add to the end of anything.  My, home town, SanFrancisco, is the default home of gays/lesbos and whatever weirdos u can imagine.  ...and yes, it's legal to marry same sex and to even adopt children....and many may "choose" not to agree with this, but children from gay or lesbian parent susually grow up to be straight and very happily adjusted people...more so than most "normal" folk. And these children gain that advantage of being very accepting and open-minded about the world they live in...they usually have less prejudice and tend to be less judgemental about their world or other people....Don't believe me, go and search for the research...<br><br>...Even tho the law allows them to marry same sex and adopt, SanFran and a lot of other gay citites are considered to be cultural capitals around the world.  SanFrancisco and Paris are still considered to be one of those few places on the planet where they get the title "most romatic cities to live or visit".  No charm has been lost...in Fact, it has only added to the many cultural colors there and life there is beautiful...not kidding...must live there to believe.  I've lived in a few states before and different cities, but I still feel that San Fran is still where my heart is...It will always be home...yes, along with all the gays and lesbos.<br><br>...as for these acts being a cumulative addition to the end of the world,...well, I must say that it's all rubbish.  Like I said, it's been happening since men formed themselves into groups and encleves for survival.  By god, if grails statement about the act adding to the end, then we should all be gone already....the bible doesn't claim anything.  and, alkthough I am not religious in the normal sense, I truly believe that the bible shouldn't be used as a tool for man to use to make his point.  The world will continue no matter who does what.  The only thing that will end the world are phtysical thing....smog, gasoline, industry, war,....being gay won't eevn add a second less to the world.  How about smoking?  or drugs?  they are issues that should concern the idea of the end of the world, but even still, the world won't end becasue of it....it will just keep going, and it will leave behind people who keep thinking that the only way to save humanity is to make sure that all vice must be eliminated.  Again not true.  When u open up ur mind and let go of ur fear of them, u will find that it isn't them that is in the wrong of it, but ur perception of the world.  having a closed mind will more likely bring an end to humanity than being gay.<br><br>case in point is :  HITLER!!!!<br><br>He believed that all Jews should be eliminated and actually managed to eliminate a lot of them...and in the process, millions of lives of others.  And did u really think that he was going to stop at just the Jews...They were only the beginning.  His master race plan was to eliminate anyone who wasn't arian (blue eyes, blonde hair, white skin,..etc..)  Basically all other races.  He certainly hated the Russians also...:-)  Get the point.  his was a closed mind.  All the major human catastrophies were created by humans with small minds (closed views on the world).  I guess u must think that maturbation is going to add to the end of the world eventually right? :-)<br><br>Just a point I'd like people to know.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Grail, the Bible is, without a doubt, a translated piece of work. I wouldn't blabber much but I wanna tell you it's true that hundreds of different versions of the Bible exist since the death of Jesus. Someone just put them together, albeit with the help of various scholars, the present-day version. So you can't rule out the possibility that something erroneous might have happened during the process of translation and transcription (even such similarly-termed processes pertaining to DNA doesn't guarantee correctness in all cases). Don't say that the grace of God has rendered the Bible we have come to know and read today  totally accurate. Or that it represents God's Word without a hint of error. 'Cos we now know that even with God's grace, the Roman Catholic Church -- the Church on which Jesus built upon St Peter the Rock -- strayed from its original purpose. Man is certainly not immune to error and its consequence. The Bible is simply God's Word transcribed by Man. So, what makes you think Man's finite brain would interprete things the way that's meant to be, the way that God has always intended?<br><br>------------------<br>J A S O N N E X<br>http://jasonnex.cjb.net</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How true Jasonnexxx,<br><br>Exactly my point.  All religion is a transciption and perception of man.  It gets filtered thru our screwed up minds and comes out how we see it.  do the test...get 100 guys and stand them next to each other...tell one guy something andtell him to tell the next person...by the time it reaches the last guy, the words become totally different.<br><br>Religion by itself, is a great thing, but when u add the man to the equation, it becomes a thing that man interprets and not what god wants or says.  I'm glad that someone knows that religion is something that man sees and understands as individuals.  Different people reading the same bible will get different lessons from it.<br><br>This one time at a cell meeting(it has a strange ominous tone to it...no wonder I quit), we read this passage from somewhere in the bible..can't remember where.  Everyone there somehow seemed to think that the bible and thus God, was telling them to go and walk around the nieghborhood and pray for all the lost souls(people who believe in other religions), and sinners.  i totally didn't get that from reading the book.  I remember thinking that i thought the passage was trying to preach peace and acceptance into ur hearts...duh?  I'm not by any means bible illiterate.  6 years of Catholic school makes sure of that.  ha ha.:-)<br><br>But please people, don't demean god's grace by imposing ur views onto his work and casting it as his words when in reality, it is ur own...and never his.<br><br>take what u read fromm the bible with a grain of salt.  It is not the be all and end all of God's word.  :-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm glad firewire thinks the way I do :-)<br><br>I'm not here to demean the Bible, hehe... I'm also a Christian myself. Been a Protestant and a Catholic, and now an in-between  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>While I believe in God and Jesus, I've not come to share the perception that most radical, fundamentalist Christians have upon Christianity and other religions. The core of Protestant Christianity, so to speak, has always been to believe in Jesus and to accept Him as the Saviour. Thanx to John 3:16 we sinners may be saved, but also no thanx for the condemnation of those who don't.<br><br>What is being a Christian all about? I don't think it's just about believing in Christ. Accepting him as the Saviour is not the most important thing. And worse, to actually use Him as your passport to Paradise is totally vile and preposterous. A true Christian puts Jesus' words into practice. That's the most important thing. Christians all over the world are seeking new converts by cashing in on instant conversion packaged with promises of miracles -- through those "I-believe-in-Jesus-so-I-am-saved" proclamations that flyers and brochures from churches always have. Well this is certainly more benign than the "Be-a-Christian-or-die" principle adopted by Dominican friars and other Christian sects in the 16th century, but still the meaning isn't explicit. It's more than believing in Jesus. It's about becoming like Jesus.<br><br>If you agree with me on this, Buddha Himself is a Christian, for He is Christ-like. He shares the charity and compassion of Jesus. If the followers of Buddha are to be condemned, it follows that Christians are to be condemned. And if good people are to spend afterlife in the burning lake of sulphur, the existence of a good God is in jeopardy. So unless, you believe that there is no God, or that the God that rules the heavens and earth is a sick and evil god who divulges the good and enriches the bad, you have no reason to condemn people by faith.<br><br>Also... the Creation story. Why is it that Eve is represented as the cause of Adam's downfall? Notice how misogynistic the whole thing is? I have more respect for women to ever come up with a creation story like that.<br><br>Oh yes, and the tale about Lot protecting his two angelic visitors from being sodomised by the raging crowd outside his house. He'd rather prostitute his daughters than to let his visitors be harmed. A good host, yes. But a bad, bad father. He later had sex with his daughters so he could have offspring (actually his daughters are the willing partners). So from the Old Testament we learn that while sodomy is evil, incest is a social norm... until Jesus came onto the scene.<br><br>Now the reason why these days incest is viewed in the negative light is because Jesus said something about it -- that it should be discouraged. Notice He did not say anything about homosexual sex. The Old Testament is a book full of taboos. Did Jesus just throw in a new one, or did He refute all other taboos and sum up the de facto taboo... (like the way he selected the most important Commandment).<br><br>Masturbation (onanism), sodomy, eating animals who do not chew their cud (or something to that effect, which is why Muslims to this day abstain from pork) and all the other Mosaic laws stem from the Old Testament. All this while we have been measuring biblical perceptions of right and wrong based on societal relevance. So deciding whether homosexuality is right or wrong is not the first biblical debate. It is in fact one of many that have come to pass over the two millenia.<br><br>------------------<br>J A S O N N E X<br>http://jasonnex.cjb.net</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tetrutetrumon (what kinda name is that?!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">...<br><br>I did not misinterprete the Bible. I did not attempt to twist God's Word. What I'm trying to say is, which I hope you get it deep in your head, is that the Bible itself has falsities. It is God's Word has compiled by Man. Period. The first copy of the Bible did not just drop from the heavens. It has been compiled through various writers and before that biblical parables are all mentioned by word of mouth. Note that Jesus did not write anything, as far as history dictates. He did not come up with the Bible. It was his disciples. Or maybe He did write something but any original text would've been given to his disciples who referred to it and come up with new scribes depicting the life and teachings of Jesus. The Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Luke, Mark, John) aren't exactly synoptic. For each Gospel, there are parables here and there that are not mentioned elsewhere.<br><br>Of course you may argue that a true Christian will accept the Bible to be true. And you think by God's grace, it is true. It is God's Word. God did not destroy the Tower of Babel for nothing. It alone justifies the confusion humans have between languages. And the Bible was originally Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. Then it became Latin. And it got transcribed and transcribed. Books are annexed (the Apocryphic books which are still included as an appendix to the Old Testament in the R.C. Bible but which are excluded from Protestant editions).<br><br>The very fact that rhe Roman Catholic Church has been allowed to execute the brutal Inquisition (the part of history your church father will most likely not want to talk about) during the Middle Ages is reason to believe that even things perpetuated with God's grace can fall in the hands of Satan.<br><br>Oh and you wrote: "Yes, many cases in the bible, there are inter-marriage bewteen ppl of direct blood relation. You've got to put your mindset back into those olden days..."<br><br>Great, cos that's exactly what I meant. In the olden days, the Mosaic Law renders pork an unclean animal that is not to be eaten. Today we eat it like nobody's business  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. In the olden days, fathers can have sex with daughters, which after all is okay since their genes are pure, like what you said. But today, an act like that will land the father in jail, and an abnormal kid gets born...<br><br>Similarly, homosexuals are considered wicked then because they have sex without having children. And during primitive eras, reproduction is of paramount importance. Today, with more than 6 billion people living on our planet, it is time to reconsider the value of reproduction. And if homosexuals can make the world a less crowded place, why suppress their existence  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. In the next millenium, homosexuals should and will be accepted. And till then we would've stricken out another Biblical taboo out of our own taboo list -- like what we did when we first start eating pork, cut our hair, shave... and start not to screw our daughters  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>J A S O N N E X<br>http://jasonnex.cjb.net</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know this topic is 'What is it with butches?' But since it has gone to touch on issues relating to GBLTs (gays, bisexuals, lesbians and transsexuals), I thought I should chip in my 2 _gay_ cents worth.<br><br>Before you start protesting Â‘What is a damn faggot doing at JC Girls?Â’, let me explain.<br><br>I decided to check out Â‘JC GirlsÂ’ after reading about it on the newspapers, and I was right that it was just another case of sensationalized reporting. Just like most reports on gay issues. Following the link to the forum page, and subsequently this thread, led to this posting.<br><br>First of all, let me rebut statements saying that all gays are effeminate men. True, some gays are effeminate, but after being more than a year in the 'gay circle', I can safely conclude that most gays are not effeminate at all. That is why most of us are so transparent in public. The Â‘gaysÂ’ you _think_ you identify on the streets are only small portion of the total gay population. And even among those effeminate men, many are heterosexuals.<br><br>Also, please distinguish between homosexuals and transsexuals. The former have no wish to be a part of the opposite sex at all while the latter feel that they are trapped in the body of the wrong sex and hence go through a sex change operation to make them feel normal. Suggesting a homosexual to consider a sex change is totally irrelevant.<br><br>Next point. While teenagers may be vulnerable to peer pressure and succumb to thinking that they are gay, true heterosexuals will grow out of that eventually. ItÂ’s just a phase. *grin*<br><br>And the talk about homosexuality being scientifically proven to be related to the genes... Has it been officially proven? Where did you get that piece of information from? Please share. Then I can blame my ancestors for being who I am. *grin*<br><br>Then came arguments about telling gays to Â‘convertÂ’ themselves and reprimanding them for being Â‘weak-mindedÂ’ individuals overtaken by their sexual tendenciesÂ…<br><br>Now, think about this: who in his right mind would 'choose' an arduous path that is loathed by straight people and be considered as outcastes of the society?<br><br>Who would want to face possible discrimination at the workplace or even risk getting sacked just because of his sexual orientation? Who would want to feel the guilt of not being able to continue the family name when his parents talk about their longing for grandchildren? Who would want to fake stifled laughter every time his clueless friends tell corny gay jokes?<br><br>I canÂ’t speak for all gay males. But for myself, I know even though I _can_ suppress my gay tendencies, get married, have kids, lead the mainstream Â‘normalÂ’ heterosexual life and get the approving nods from the general public, I wonÂ’t do it. For I can never lie and exchange vows at the altar with a woman I have no feelings for. It is not fair to her.<br><br>And perhaps thatÂ’s why homosexuals persist generation after generation. *double grin*<br><br>CÂ’mon, we all want to be true to ourselves. Just like you straight guys can never bring yourself to love another man because it is Â‘abnormalÂ’, to the gay males, it is equally abnormal to love a woman.<br><br>I hope this posting gives a fresh point of view from a gay male. And hopefully after reading this, one day, when your neighbour, brother or that guy you had that terrible crush on tells you that he is gay, you can say 'right on!' instead of giving that disapproving oh-you-sicko stare.<br><br>------------------<br>'yah, it's just a phase --- those terrible guilt and struggles in life before finally coming to terms with yourself and admit that you are GAY'<br></div>
