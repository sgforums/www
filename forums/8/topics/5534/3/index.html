            <div class='col-md body'>Agree. Girls who behave or dress like guys may not be lesbians. ItÂ’s just as absurd to say that all effeminate males are gays. These are archaic social stereotypes that should have been flushed down the toilet bowl long time ago.<br><br>IMHO, thereÂ’s no such thing as a male/female concept in a homosexual relationship. Both parties have either vaginas or dicks. Perhaps one may be more passive than the other, but forcing the heterosexual couple concept on homosexuals is totally DUH!!!<br><br>And IMHO again, itÂ’s ridiculous to classify a personÂ’s sexual orientation just by his or her sexual experiences. Hot-blooded heterosexual males who engaged in macho-mutual-masturbation-shit doesnÂ’t necessary make them homosexuals. The lesbian wife getting fucked by her unwitting husband every night doesnÂ’t make her any less lesbian. And the poor guilt-stricken faggot who thinks he will turn straight by staying celibate will be sorely disappointed 60 years down the road.<br><br>Homosexuality, just like heterosexuality, is pretty much an innate thing. Guys arenÂ’t heterosexuals just because they woo women. They are heterosexuals because they _love_ women.<br><br>Who knows? Perhaps the chio bu you set your eyes on may be lesbian for all you know. *hic*<br><br>------------------<br>'yah, it's just a phase --- those terrible guilt and struggles in life before finally coming to terms with yourself and admit that you are GAY'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To start with, I am a perfectly straight and normal guy. I am not some sort of pro-gay/lesbian activist.<br>Most of my closest friends are lesbians. They are really just as normal as you can be. They are really very nice people. Lesbianism or gayism are not contagious. I don't see myself turning into one. Anyway, whatever one's sexual orientation may be, it's his/her choice. Just because you're straight, that doesn't mean you can judge them. Many of them will grow out of it once they hit their early 20s' but some will still be the way they are. It's true that some guys are really jerk and some butches are the same but butches, at their best, really encompass the best of both worlds; gentlemanly and sensitivity. They are faux males and cannot satisfy a girl's needs, well, you are wrong. Precisely they are girls in the first place, they understand what a girl wants in a relationship. Same to speak for a gay. Girls and guys are the same, they need some one to listen to their innermost feelings and for emotional support. Not many guys can do that, can't they?<br>Anyway, we guys have to buck up and perhaps they won't be anymore lesbians in this world.<br><br>-----^o^-----</div>

U noe, there r some girls who look better in more boyish dressing. And since butches r still girls physically, wat's wrong wif them mixing wif other galfrenz? It's as normal as those feminine girl groups we see on the streets. Interestingly enuf, hehe, y not look at the sissies? The opposite sex of butches...guys who behave femininely?<br><br>------------------<br>~*Luv &amp; Huggies*~<br>BabyC|eFairy^ (^_^)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sadly, so many people are all trying to stand up for the butches and lesbain, not that we should outcast them either but any 1 in the right mind would know that it is not a right thing to do, imagine your parents, gave birth to you a girl in every aspects but then there you are due to some reasons became a "son" to them do you think they are happy. Thus with this in mind, i also think that it is very sad, for even guys to become or act like woman. thus I am not against any1 in particular, but in general all these adnormal acts are bringing harms to the societ.<br><br>now u never know who u are dealing with even when u see that person face to face. The gal may be a guy and the guy maybe a gal. So is this the Society that u all wants, so pls stop supporting the actions of those butches and lesbain, gays, whatever you call them, but not to the extent of outcasting them, but instead try to guide them to the normal path. so that everyone can be happy.<br><br>Imagine, if they are not here on this earth in the first place, we won't have to argue over them in the first place. so problems caused by them is easily seen, and not a matter of respecting individual rights.,</div>
