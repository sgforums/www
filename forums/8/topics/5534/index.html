            <div class='col-md body'>What is it with Butches? Why do they (want to) behave like guys and/or look like them, and go through all the trouble like binding their chest, etc.? Some of you would have seen in town areas, mainly orchard rd, there are quite a few not bad looking/great looking girls together with butches. You wonder, WHY? "Why are they (girls) together with them (butches)?" Some guys will go," What a waste!" Im wondering, why are girls attracted to butches? Why do butches wanna be/behave like males? You might say that they are bored or going through a phase in life. But then, what about the older ones who are in their twenties or older?<br>I don't understand them (butches) and those girls that are with them. Anyone care to enlighten me?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I would like to know other people's views on them and if there is any of you(butches) out there reading this discussion, it will be interesting to know your point of view.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>[This message has been edited by KoOkY (edited 28 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't really have any objections to butches. Neither do I see it as a waste that pretty girls are going out with butches. I mean as long as not ALL the babes are with them. : )<br><br>I'm sure there are more pretty babes with guys then with butches. Besides, it's not as if all of them are lesbians, just because a girl dresses up like a guy doesn't make her a lesbian. I have got a few friends who dress up as such, and they are very nice people really, and definately very straight.<br><br>For some of the younger girls, it's just a phase in life, trying to find the real them. Some will grow out of it, and of course some won't (maybe they decided that was the real them?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on man !<br>Butches Suck !!!!<br>Big Time !!!<br>They need a life man .. !! no they dont why dont they just die off !<br>Alright sorry for rashness. I just could'nt control myself. Butches and Gays aren't they the same ? As loathed by straight people and identified as outcastes of the society. Pardon me if i'm wrong but that's exactly how<br>i feel.<br><br>Decoder, you mentioned something about great taste. Let me tell you, everyone has great tastes, it's just whether you can get that girl who you presume is really fantastic. As for these butches, how did they get to know the babes first. You got to boil down to how they become butches. Lesbians are contagious, it can spread. That means in a group if there's a lesbian , chances is that they will be more. For those who are better looking, those whom you call the babes, definately they won't be butches, just being the passive one and perhaps be a bi. Those who doesn't look feminine or don't look great, instead of trying to look good, they might as well put on the rugged look, which most of the time of should i say all of the time they FAIL to do so and look like FREAKS. Also when a girl gets to know a butch many a time, it's due to curiousity, sometimes, there is a stupid thinking that being lesbian is the IN thing or some girls have been hurt by guys, that's why they turn lesbians.<br><br>Yes it may be a passing phase and i truly hope it's a way of growing up coz i really hate to see those freaks on the street.<br><br>Please pardon me for the messy post. I'm kind  of agigtated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pardon me, but I don't think that they should be considered outcasts of society! Neither should they be loathed by everyone.<br>I'm defending not because I'm one, but what Evolution has just said is unjustified.<br><br>And I don't think that lesbianism or homonism is contagious. Being with one doesn't make you one by default, or turn you into one. Maybe the sight of them irks you, maybe you think they are all perverted, disillusioned people who are trying to find their way in this world. BUT, I happen to feel that they are beautiful people too, just like you and me and everyone else on this world. (I wasn't referring to looks when I said beautiful)<br><br>Your perception of people who are butches is highly flawed and biased. Your crictism for them is also uncalled for, and you actually have the audacity to say that they look like freaks just because they don't look feminine and attempt to get a rugged look!!<br><br>Grow up man!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>errr......i've seen a lot of butches hanging out at the basement of takashimaya.....i can't imagine what they look like if they leave long hair and put on make-up!!?!?!?!? One glance and i know that they will look like a piece of shit if they dress up as a girl. Maybe thats y they prefer switching to a butch..as they look rugged enuff  to look like a guy instead of a girl..since they can't get a bf....maybe they have a higher chances of a gf...this gives them a boast in confidence when they managed to get a gf...because they will have to wait a lifetime to get a guy...anyway guys...y be afraid when u see a babe with a butch...at least when they grow out of this passing phase...they still a virgin...better than letting a guy screwing them up..when they turn straight..it will be our turn to attack...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Engima what a strong reply !!<br>If you asked me i would think that you have something to do with butches. I'm sorry to have caused such great unpleasantness<br><br>Yes it is contagious if you got what i meant. I Homonism isn't contagious but lesbianism is .It definately is because I don't mean being with a lesbian will turn you into one. Being with one GROUP of lesbians will turn you into one. I don't mean that they will turn you into buctches but lesbians, the passive ones.<br>I know that because I have had a female friend who happened to became a bisexual from what i call "contagious" friends. Not that she's the only one, most of those in her group have evolved from the same way as she did.<br><br>Yes you got it. The sight of them irks me. Espicially when they try to act "macho", smoke, dont get it wrong here im not try to say that smoking is macho and by the way anyone thats smokes infront of me irks me, and basically act like guys. I just think that they have taken the wrong way in life and they should get a life if not just die off. Coz they aren't doing the right things they should do.<br>As quoted from the bible : When men become men and women become women, it's the end of the world.<br>I'm not a christian.<br><br>They don't look like freaks when they don't look feminine. They look like freaks when they try to look like their male counterparts and don't look like one. Same goes for those males who do likewise. Don't you think so ?<br>If they want to look "special" ( i call it strange), they have to accept crictism. And i dont think my perception is uncalled for. There is truth in what i have said. Think about it. Beauty is only skin-deep but sad to say, same goes for our eyes.<br><br>And yah im growing up. This is just a forum. I hope you aren't as worked up as your words.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought Evolution's message was bad enough, and now we have unicorn!!<br><br>What is it with you people?? One of you calls them a freak and the other calls them pieces of shit! And what is it about girls who butches remaining a virgin and about guys 'attacking' them after they turn straight? That's quite a derogatory remark! Girls talking like guys, smoking... so what about it? I find ah bengs with their vulgarities, their dressing, the way they walk, their airs and their hair more irksome then butches. I'd rather be in a room full of butches than a room full of ah bengs, at least the butches have some intelligence!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gosh! You make it sound as if it's a crime to be a little off the track!<br><br>Read "I have violent dreams of murder, kidnap and always wish that I had a gun in my hand, loaded and chambered, 24-7", how violent can you get? In fact I think you're the psychotic one here. All you need is a little push or provocation and you'll go on a rampage. That's how serial killers start off anyway.<br><br>First you said you condemn the act, and not the people. If so, why would you want to eradicate each and everyone of them? Wouldn't this be more like a condemnation of the person?<br><br>Controlling dreams and little urges is one thing, controlling your emotions is another. How often have people broken down and cried after a torn relationship? Could you tell yourself to stop your crush or affections for someone who does not reciprocate your love? Or... to put it crudely, are you able to have sufficient control to not want to have sex with your wife? No right? Just as they can't stop feeling to want to be the way they are.<br><br>Those who are in it for the fun, novelty or so other circumstances needs help. But those who really believe that this should be their way of lifes, I respect their decision, and you should too.<br><br>You can't have a law saying that you need to be heterosexual. It's wrong to have an affair when you are already attached, but do you go to prison for it? It's also wrong to cheat another person of his/her feelings, but do you end up in court for it? Of course, I'm not saying that it's wrong to be homosexual, just pointing out why they can't be a law for everything, or anything just because it doesn't pleases you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have no problems with butches, lesbians or gays...What I do have a problem with is the over- acting of said groups.  I believe that if ur going to be gay, be gay.  If u wnat to be lesbian, be lesbian....u get my point....<br><br>...But Don't over-act.  It's unnatural.  I don't know about gay people because I find that usually they are more into it as a lifestyle instead of a fad.<br><br>...For hardcore lesbians, I wouldn't know either...<br><br>...But for those young girls that try really hard to be something they are not, I don't agree.  Most of the time it is an "in" thing. They get into groups and gang up and pester girls who aren't lesbians or butches and thru peer pressure, manage to get these young girls, who are easily influenced, to "try it out....<br><br>My gal friend told me that she was berrated by girls almost everyday about why she wasn't a lesbo or Butch....It has stopped being what it is and become more of a fashion trend for young girls easily ibnfluenced by other girls who are into it.<br><br>Believe me, when u r young, whether u are into it or not, peer pressure can get u to do pretty stupid thing.<br><br>To those who are into it...cheers.<br><br>To those who pester other girls who aren't into it....don't.  Just don't.  I wouldn't go and force u to go straight.  Live and let live man.<br><br>If ur happy being butch, then fine...but remember that u aren't really a guy so don't go and start challenging guys on their level of machismo.  U'll end up looking like a fool.<br><br>I ever knew a les/butch from my school who always wanted to fight with other guys.  man talk about feelings of inadequacies...She was so thin and frail I'm surprised she's still alive after all those fights...(which her/his guy friends help in winning.).

            <div class='col-md body'>To Enigma and Arbiter,<br><br>Sorry if I am not getting my message across to you.<br><br>My opinions towards butches are, they are sad group of people. They do not feel proud of themselves of being a female and they start to behave like a man. This may be caused by their hormones unbalance or may be caused by their bad experience from guys. But each and every human being on this earth do not choose to be born male or female.<br><br>See, my point is, since you do not have a choice, lets make full use of it, and pray that you will become the opposite one your next life (if there is one). So why do they have to do all this?<br><br>From another point of view, these are just some "trends" thing. Butches could be the "in" thing now, and who know, gays might be another "in" thing the next millenuim. Isn't that situation makes our society kinna out of balance?<br><br>I do believe that we are brought to this world with a unique meaning to each of us. So I don't see their point of denying their born duties but to do things otherwise.<br><br>But I do not dispute their own rights to do things their way, as long as they are not infringing others.<br><br>And as for Evolution and Unicorn, they didn't really starts killing, do they?<br><br>ps. my selfish point of view, if girls are taken by butcher, what are we guys left with?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read Evolution's post with GREAT and UTTER disgust and pray to dear God that he's only a kid, for as an adult with such a mind and conscience, he is surely damned.<br><br>Butches, lesbians, gays and cissies are loathed by society because the largely heterosexual people who have for a long time seen sexual love possible only between males and females are intolerant individuals who refuse to accept "the odd ones" who bear the same kind of affection for others of the same sex. This is what intolerance is all about. It is a primal, physical asset embedded deep within all living species on earth, and in higher animals it manifests also in thought, intellect and emotion. It is this same intolerance that resulted in the controversial Christian Inquisition of the European Middle Ages. It is this same intolerance that perpetuated Nazism in Germany, apartheid rule in South Africa, Protestant-Catholic confrontations in Northern Ireland and other such bloody racial/religous wars in various parts of the world.<br><br>And the mention you made about lesbianism and homosexuality being contagious diseases goes to show that you are thoroughly ill-informed, misled and misguided by perhaps sick, arrogant people who are as intolerant and complacent as you are. Homosexuality and lesbianism are NOT diseases. They don't spread, for God's sake. Sticking around with a lesbian doesn't make you appreciate girls more. Nor does mixing around with gays turn you into one. There is no logic behind this, and if mixing with gays really make you a gay, it means by nature you are gay and being close with gays enables you to find your real self. You have, in fact, stepped out of the closet and cease being what you're not: a straight. Isn't that what life is all about? Being true to yourself. Speaking of which, I do encourage all of the closeted gays and lesbians out there who read this, to learn to accept what and who you are, rather than putting on a faÃ§ade for the sake of social convention and acceptance, and harbouring a secret that first is guarded by your misery and thereafter death itself.<br><br>There has been some studies to actually support the fact that lesbianism and homosexuality are gene-controlled traits in humans. Do a little research, and you'll discover that lesbianism and homosexuality are in fact natural. You may label them as mutations, but for the very fact that they're created in nature, they are natural. In a world where genetic engineering offers us countless opportunities of cloning identical genomes and creating superhumans with superhuman strength and out-of-this-world beauty, gays and lesbians certainly aren't as freakish and artificial as they're thought out to be.<br><br>------------------<br>J A S O N N E X<br>http://jasonnex.cjb.net</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If your hatred or disgust for butches stem from the very fact that they:<br><br>1) are irksome to look at<br>2) are snatching away the babes from you<br>3) denial that they are women<br><br>then you really should do a self-appraisal.<br><br>They may be the odd bunch and the non-conformists,  but who's to decide what's really right or wrong? Does the fact that majority observe a rule make it right? A matter of perception really.<br><br>I don't think we should consider them a sad group of people. In fact, we shouldn't even be classifying them as such. Why can't people just accept others for what/who they are and not what we expect them to be? This too is a point I've been trying to make here.<br><br>We can go on with this, classifying everybody. The more robust guys to the more subdued girls, or the more passionate guys to the more utilitarian girl. Why focus only on them? Why not focus on the girls who watch soccer? Or the guys who are make-up artists? Everyone GETS TO CHOOSE his own path in life. We may be born a certain way, but that doesn't mean we must be constrained by it. And just what exactly are our born duties? To have sex and reproduce? About the only duty all of us observe is to pass away when the time comes. Anything else is totally up to the individual.<br><br>Be more open-minded and receptive of what's going on around you. If people can accept bengs and lians, why not butches?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I knew that homosexuality has got something to do with genes. But that doesn't means they are not contagious and i refer to lesbianism which is contagious and not gays. Perhaps it's something you have not known of and not something which I made up.<br><br>Everyone has a liking towards their own sex if not how are friends made ? The liking and love towards the same sex should stay at where they are and not proceed to stages like LOVE between a couple. Couples are meants to be a man and a woman, not a man and another man or a woman and another woman. Maybe it's a way of showing that one is special. To me thats plain weirdness. Defying the majority does't account to wrong doing, but definately it doesn't means it's right too.<br><br>And to those who has closeted personalities of being gays and lesbians, i hope you guys and girls keep that to yourself or within your kind or get someone close enough to tide you past that crisis. I'm just sorry that i can't accept weirdness up to such an extent. People are bornt who they are and are definately not born with totally gay or lesbian instincts. If there are, I would think of that to be the extreme minority but the problem is that butches are all around and I don't think god or whoever created people would want to create so many of the kind.<br><br>Of course life is  not all about having sex and reproducing, but that is a part of life I must say. If everyone thinks otherwise and turn into gays and lesbians just because they realise that they have developed a certain kind of liking towards the same sex and presume that to be the closeted personality, the world will come to an end !<br><br>I personally dont think ah bengs and ah lians are acceptable too. As i have said, they together with those who like their same sexes belong to the same category. They are a group of people who need help. Speaking of these, altough i see ah bengs and ah lians are unacceptable, at least they did not defy what was given to them by nature. But butches and gays have violated whats supposed to be.<br><br>At the end of the day, I have learnt that ah bengs and ah lians are more acceptable already. I still despise them for their dressing, vulgarites ( note the way butches speak converse) smoking .. and so on but i have come to realise that these are not what i call opposition of nature, take not its not opposition of the norm but nature and that's what butches are - opposition of nature.<br><br></div>

In fact, I have plenty of les friends, butches friends, and gays friends around (of course I do have normal ones!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ). I am not turning their rights to stay alive and stay as what they are. If I did, my sincere apology here.<br><br>I am saying sad because I feel so. I feel that everyone should put in their effort to perform their part in keeping this world goes round and round. Looking from a nature point of view, predators and preys, I don't feel sad of seeing a cute little deer being eaten by a tiger, because that is what nature is, the stronger feed on the weaker. But when I see the deer trying to eat the tiger, I feel sad, because that's against nature.<br><br>Get me?<br><br>And yes, I think that one of our basic born duties is to reproduce our next generation. Or else, why are we equipped with that equipments? And without that basic duty, what makes you think you are here, in this world? By chances, I don't think so.<br><br>Of course, Butches are only minorities around now, and the majorities are still normal. Think about it, if they are the majorities, and you become the minorities, what will you do?<br><br>cheers ... take it easy ... it's not there yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look, Evolution. I dunno which satanic Bible you're reading from, but no where in the Holy Bible quotes that the world will end if men start having sex with men, and women with women. There are however lines in the Holy Bible that describes homosexuality is evil. Then again, you have to realise that the Bible is actually a combined piece of translated text with hundreds of different versions dating from just after the death of Christ. In early Greek versions the text implies that it is against nature for a man who is supposed to love a woman to love a man for the same reasons. And over centuries that came to be interpreted that as long as a man lies with a man, he has sinned. But the thing here is about nature. If a man is naturally born to love and therefore prefer sexual relations with someone of the same sex, shouldn't it be considered a sin for him to love a woman, because that would be going against his nature? And if the man is created bisexual, isn't it normal and therefore natural that he desires sexually for both men and women? And to curb that and deny that is to deny his very nature. The same story applies to lesbians. And as science has proven, homosexuality is controlled by genes. So it is therefore something crafted by nature and conformed through evolution. If you think it's bad, sinful and all, then blame it on evolution, which is after all the engine that generates living organisms.<br><br>Perhaps lesbianism or homosexuality is infectious in the sense of thought and sexual preference. I know what you mean:  girls hanging out with butches eventually gets influenced into thinking that they should love women instead. But the truth is, straight girls who eventually like girls are probably suffering from misandry (that All Men Are Bastards syndrome), or may have had adopted different tastes after a major turning point in their lives. Does that mean, however, they're going against nature? How can that be? Suppose you're rendered serile after an accident and you can't have babies no more. So does that mean you have gone against nature? Does that mean you have sinned?<br><br>------------------<br>J A S O N N E X<br>http://jasonnex.cjb.net</div>
