I tink mayb its so true dat they r juz playing punt on dividends..<br><br>minimum pay.. .i dun tink there's it... coz how come degree holder can take $900... no pride liao like dat...<br><br>Well.. yes it is audited.. but since my company cut pay, hack ppl, then we hav more $$$.. and riteful enough, we haf our dividends as the same as b4... nothing can b done if auditors like kpmg sees it or what so ever... coz cut pay, hack ppl is not illegal in accounts...<br><br>YES.. dats my MAIN purpose of posting in the first place and juz complain and complain let u frens know and share it out... i admit I not perfect, nor genius, nor Wan Shi Tong also... I agree share it out so i made the first step in posting...<br><br>mayb sometimes some issues is better to be talked rather than type.. coz harder to express...<br></div></blockquote>thanks! the atmosphere now is much better dun u agree?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>so if i dun read u wrongly u r unhappi tt ur company, altho not suffering in terms of dividends and profits, still went ahead to cut pay and retrench, so tt the rest wil have more.. or the company will haf more..<br><br>i canot say i noe how companies work.. whether there is any incentive for them in taking a risk in doing that.. i suppose tt is illegal? yes.. auditors cant do anything in this case cos from their pt of view there was no corruption, so similarly there is no case for corruption per se. but to cut pay and retrench workers using bad times as excuse when in reality the company is not suffering... somehow i feel its abit illogical..something is not rite.. but i realli canot finger it. prob cos i quite ignorant of the business world.<br><br>but now we r more clear wat was ur starting point at least. its not realli the gov rite? heh<br><br></div>
