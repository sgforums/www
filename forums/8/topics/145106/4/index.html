He could have been 'acting' a fall - like what GenX say, wanna drop, better fall flat on your face, no kneeling down or 'gu niang' fainting.<br><br>I've seen ppl who really passed out during parade, and they really fall flat on the face with arms by the side. ouch<br><br>Call me an arse, but i think if a soldier faints during parade, he has only himself to blame. Before parade, there will be ample opportunity for him to sit out if he's not feeling well. The onus is on him to voice out.<br>If he had a genuine physical or medical problem, the numerous training sessions would have sussed it out.<br>Granted, maybe that soldier who fainted was really eager to participate, but he should have known if his body couldn't take it.<br><br>Besides, ndp is a walk in the park compared to other military parades. That evening weather so cool somemore.<br><br>A parade is a symbolic act, so the arguments abt whether a human life more impt or the colours more impt really doesn't hold. The colours are symbolic, the practice of not letting the colours fall is symbolic. Its all a big wayang show.<br><br></div>
