I am in one of the GOH contigent. Heard about the COLOUR party dropping too. Which is something quite severe... He should uphold the flag with HIS LIFE. besides, there is a reserve too.<br><br>Din declare he was not feeling well.<br><br>A 40 min parade isn't that strenous too. Try doing SAF day parade. We stand for 90mins. With "Tun Do" observant, (which is a 1min remembrance for the dead), the 15min Prize presentation. And finally the TROOPING. which the colours have to march past the 3 GOH contingents.<br><br>Having been a soldier that have done 2 years for SAF day and NDP, a would say  that SAF really preserve the importance of the COLOUR.<br><br>Colour Down, Unit down. Colour is like a sacred symbol.<br><br>In fact, all people are suppose to salute when the COLOURS march pass u.<br><br>Every week, we do the casting and uncasting of colours. lan lan no choice have to embrace the repect and dignity of the colours. Haai, its a pity this year's COLOUR party cannot make it. They seem to slack and can' t be bothered.<br><br>The Ensign is usually the most promising junior rank officer and ,<br>The Escort is usually the best SGT.<br><br>In fact, i even seen the whole colour party kenna knock it down by Colour RSM.<br>Yes Commanders on pumping position for mistakes.<br><br>Perhaps sometimes, a unit need to have something , like a Symbol or Pride to fight of in War.... Colours Serve the best purpose.<br><br>Most of the ordinary folks out there would not even have seen the COLOURS before. Let alone know the importance of it.</div>
