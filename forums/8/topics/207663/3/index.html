            <div class='col-md body'>For us ladies, grappling (ground work) will come into handy the most.. like judo, jujitsu...  Coz most in danger of 1-on-1 assault by pervs.. Imagine this perv creeps up on u thinking he's gonna have his day .. then u juz disarm him and choke him out while calmly calling the cops on ur sleek cellphone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>For men, depends on ur pref la.  Although if u go n search on net, u'll find that most fighting styles lose out in real 1-on-1 fights if they don't incorporate grappling techniques.. after a Brazilian Jiujitsu user pwned some of the world's most powerful fighters using submission grappling techniques, many martial arts scrambled to incorporate similar moves in order to counter it..<br><br>Ideally for guys, u'd wanna have a good mix of both ground work and attack techniques to tackle both 1-on-1 and group situations.<br><br>Dun look at me, my fiance drives me crazy with all his talk abt jiujitsu and muay thai.. always wanna show me some new grappling technique he just learnt, or ask me to look at his shins "I dun need a weapon, I've got two mean nightsticks right here, HYAH, HYAH!!!"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Its like anyother martial art. The reason why u feel nothing of it is because of the refinement your coach did to the art or yr coach's coach. Now muay thai has become effective muay thai. All the things u learn is the most effective part of muay thai almost all the katas is filtered out due to the nature of quick training for competition.</div>
