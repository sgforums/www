            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone. To all those who have experiences having a kid around in the house, I have a a few queries and require some help. I'm currently giving tuition to my cousin who is in pri 3 now.<br>First of all, I had planned to give him 2 hours of tuition but it seems that at the most he can at least try to focus and concentrate is roughly about an hour and half. After that, whatever I say will not register in his mind and he will look tired and sleepy or he will simply not concentrate at all. Hence, I usually stop teaching after 1 and a half hour of tuition. Should I carry on doing this? His mom herself is having difficulty making him study and teaching him in his school work. She asked me to be very fierce with him. What should I do? Because I believe that the child would enjoy and understand his studies better if he is given a more relax and less pressurised environment? So currently I'm only strict if his concentration starts to wander off and I will scold him and ask him to pay attention. What should I do?<br>Second of all, the homework I gave him are not a lot. I believe he would be able to finish it in time but he always did not finish the homework I given him. Should I be harsher on this? If I punish him by giving him more homework, it would not make any sense.<br>How do I teach composition to this kid? It seems that he does not know the idea of a composition at all. He can write the sentences. The idea is there in the sentences but the sentences are not linked to each other. I'm thinking of buying a book of model compositions for him so he can get an idea of how it's suppose to be written. Should I?<br>In Maths, his problems in problem sums is that he can read each sentence and understand the sentences individually but as a whole, he would not understand. He would not know what to do. I used to believe for maths, practice makes perfect. Should I bombard him with a lot of problem sums with the same concept so that he would understand the concept of doing the various problem sums?<br>Also in his maths, he is so dependable on using his hands for calculations, that even simple additions and subtractions does not comes naturally for him. For example 8+3, 12-4, he would have to use his hands. How do I solve this problem of his? Even multiplication also. I forced him to memorize but he just can't memorize cos he will start using his hands when I test him. Division, he will start to trial and error. Just hantam only. I just want to ensure that the simpler calculations he are able to do it naturally and not waste time and even make costly mistakes. Any methods of teaching him?<br>When he do not understand certain things, I would explain to him using analogies and explain to him slowly bit by bit. He would nod and say "ahuh" and "yah" but when I ask him again he say he still don't understand. How leh?<br><br>Just asking any of you guys who are experienced in teaching kids or understand child psychology to give me a hand in some of these problems highlighted.. Thanks for any..</div>

What you have said so far is what I feel very strongly. I know rewarding helps but my auntie said no. I praised him whenever he did something correctly but somehow he would purposely "celebrate" if he got something wrong. It does not seems to work so far.<br>He is doing about 60ish now. And when he gets 70ish his mom would still be not satisfied as she wants him to get 80ish and above. Target set is high. So now, is it right to tell him well done as he has improved or should his mom reacted correctly? Because, if he is praised he would be just contented with getting 70ish and would not be determine to get any higher or improve but however, if we are not satisfied with his results, he would be demoralised and wouldn't attempt any better as even when he improved, we do not seem to appreciate his improvement. So how?<br>I am only his elder cousin and I only see him at most twice a week. And like I said I can't teach him for more then 1 and a half hour as he would be off track. How am I able to do so many things with him? His parents are working and the timings can be really weird sometimes and when they come home they are too exhausted to sit down and focus with their child. Any suggestions?<br>He likes to read but somehow what he shows in his english so far does not reflect upon the fact that he likes to read.<br>I will try playing some games with him like scrabble. Might help I think. Any other games that might help him?</div>

They know how to rebel. This cousin of mine has already knows how to use the word stress. My aunt has been strict to him. He very sacred of his mom. When his mom comes home, he would all of a sudden be very attentive to me, action paying attention only.. Haha..</div>

His mom is very motivated and is more then willing to improve her son's studies in anyway. But she just can't seem to find the right method. My elder brother taught her other elder son and it was good. My elder taught another of my cousin, and she is doing very well in her studies. When it comes to this cousin of mine, my elder brother went up to my aunt and said he surrender. I suggested making him go tuition centres but she say he would definitely not focus in a group study. I took this up as a challenge and also as an experience so I would know what to do with my children in the future.<br>You are right, the teaching process has to carry on after the tuition finished but how?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would punish if the child did something wrong on purpose.<br>In all seriousness, getting 60+ at P3 is really not too good. My own targets for my boys have always been 80+, in my case, they usually get it. But before someone starts to tell me that I've set my targets too high, let me say that my preparation for my boys' learning process started very very early. Therefore it is not a reflection of what everyone should do ( <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I also know of some parents who want nothing less than 95+).<br><br>To get a child to perform better, I usually sit with the child and review each question and look at why the child was not able to answer those questions. In the case of mathematics, I always pointed out to my son that if he's just a little more careful, he'd gotten a almost perfect score, but because of his carelessness, he lost some marks. The child need to know where he had gone wrong, meaning, he needs to understand the reality that if he'd just pushed himself a little more he'd get a much better marks. Most important, a child need to be able to push himself. Unfortunately, this has got to do with the home structure (see below on parenting)<br><br>I think the critical thing is NOT to make him get 80+ but to consistently delivering 70+. Consistency is the key word. So I'd say your immediately goal is to push his scores to 70+ for, say, over a period of 3 to 4 test. But in the interim you need to dissect each paper as to which section is he doing badly in (you are aware that the papers are all broken in sections right). Bear in mind that the long term goal is PSLE. Where the short term goal is concern, address all the weak areas in the tests.<br><br>Parental support - this is, to me, the weakest link. If a parent has no time for the child, I believe the child is lost. This is nothing you can do. I (with my wife) spent lots of time with my sons. We do lots of things together.

My family is extremely close and enjoy each others company and talks a lot with each other on how we spent our days.<br><br>Discipline - I firmly believe in the cane, but I have raised my boys well that I don't need it anymore. Discipline is NOT about venting the parent's frustration and anger on the child, it's about teaching and moding the child's behaviour. It has to be done in love and instruction. Never cane when the adult is angry. Never cane when there is no explanation.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

The problem sums leads to the problem of his english as he has trouble understanding them. Any suggestions how to improve them?</div>

When it comes to this cousin of mine, my elder brother went up to my aunt and said he surrender. I suggested making him go tuition centres but she say he would definitely not focus in a group study.

Really, I heaped the praises when he do something correctly, I break apart the chunk and explain to him even phrases by phrases and he will say he understand but put together, he don't understand haha sometimes this guy is really cute.. Because he is my cousin, he's comfortable with me so sometimes he just can't seem to focus. And thats the bad part cos it would be so difficult to explain stuff to him. He would yah yah everytime I ask him question even when I stop asking him question he will keep yah yah. Then I realise I had wasted my breath haha..<br>I believe that <strong>most</strong> children at this young age, they learn by emulating others. By examples. It's hard for them to try understanding some stuff.<br>In problem sums, how do I explain to him the "more than" "less than" questions? He thinks that "more than" is + and "less then" is -. It is true depending on how they are being used right? For example, "How many apples do Jane have more than Mary?" This is a minus question. But no matter how many times I teach him he would still comes back saying plus. How leh? I even tried doing models with him but even models also he has difficulty understanding.

If the parents reject them (through insulting comments) kids will just shut off.<br><br>30/40 is actually quite good - projected score is about 70+. His parents need to recognise that it is not possible to have hyper jumps in scores. Each time a score improve, is a definite move in the right direction. Each time a score deprove is an opportunity to know where and why something has gone wrong - and work on these mistakes.<br><br>P3 Composition is not too difficult. Perhaps you may ask him to write on anything that interest him. It can be a cartoon show, or trip to a shopping centre - anything he chooses. This way, he can freely express his thoughts. The number of words required are not that much anyway.

            <div class='col-md body'>Maths: I like to use visible tools like colour pencils or Lego blocks to explain more than or less than. Lego blocks are also good to demonstrate number bonds - you know, the long bars which needed to be broken down or added onto. I had heaps of problem last year too for more than/less than.
