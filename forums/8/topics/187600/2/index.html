One of my sons is less extroverted that the other one, yet his confidence level is always very very high. Simply put, he is not a very chatty person like his brother, but he knows who he is and what he can do. While my extroverted son is always attempting to play catch-up with his brother.<br><br>Perhaps children need to be pointed out to the little victories that they may have during the day. Simple things like being made the group leader for class decoration, or just coming in top 10 in a test is a good affirmation that something right was done. I use the half empty/half full glass sometimes to demonstrate the perception of success. For each little victories that happened, there will always be an encouraging word and I continue to invite them to do more. I tell them the reward is the feeling of accomplishment and the satisfaction that something is done right.<br><br>Confidence is not built overnight and it does not need mighty deeds. It need little things that are done right and the appreciation one gets for it. Gradually, a child will learn to be assured of themselves as to what they are capable of doing by being a change agent. Once they know that inspite of their age (and size) they can choose to participate in steering their own lifes (or their classmates), confidence will grow.<br><br>Some kids also need to understand their own psyche, ie, what they are and what can/cannot do. In household, there will never be sportsmen, and my boys are ok with it. They will never participate actively in the schools' sports day 'cos they are not really built for competitive sports, but both of them are quite good with mind games, like chess and nowadays, Scrabble. My younger boy is getting so good that he beats the entire family sometimes.</div>

It is true in all balance of life, humans are created such that you win in some and you lose in some. You are good in some areas, but not so in other areas. It's good you are highlighting their strengths but the main problem may not be your kids not recognising their strengths, but instead they are concerned with what they are losing out on which in this case are the medals.<br>Maybe if your daughter feels that way, you can ask her what she feels like to be good in. Discover her interest and talents. Together with your support and encouragement, let her pursue her interest and talent. Knowing that she has her mother behind her supporting her, who knows, she might excel in that field of interest.<br>Just my ramblings Hehe.. I'm not a parent so what I may say may be irrelevant..

Or he would just repeat the sentence to me. Maybe he did understand but have trouble expressing himself and his understanding. Is that the problem? If that is, how do I rectify that? His parents make it a point for them to conversate in Eng at home.<br>Actually comparing when I first came to him and now, there seems to be a slight improvement in his studies. So is it actually fine so far as he is learning and improving, or am I expecting too much from him in such a short time?</div>

(my mom hated those sweet valley and babysitter club books)... but i think they actually helped, cuz i really enjoyed reading them...<br><br>for him, mmmm... he is just pri3... i dont really know children's books that well... but i might actually suggest comics for a start? i know some parents might oppose this.. but it's also an art.. it's communicative, there is a plot, it might actually help him understand sentence structures, it helps build imagination (readers actually have to fill in the blanks for a lot of stuff in comics).... you can try to start him on a project of cutting and pasting calvin &amp; hobbes comic from the sunday times into a notebook... (if i remember correctly, the comic strip from each week actually flow... might have changed now.. it has been ages since i saw a sunday times since im overseas now) maybe at the end of every month, his homework is to summarize the plot (i.e. composition writing). or he can choose to change something different in what happens in the comic... (draw out and give the characters new dialogue) or reflect what he liked or disliked about the comic..<br><br>another idea is watching TV!!! lol~~~ ok, i know you see him just twice a week... cant really parent him like your child or something.. but just throwing this out since i thought of it... mmm.. well, i think for watching TV... the best is to watch something with subtitles.. i remember i often learnt a lot of english words when watching channel 8 dramas because of the subtitles =p my younger sister, she is crazy about cartoons.. by watching her dvd cartoons in different languages.. she actually picked up some japanese as well as cantonese..... lol<br><br>anyways~~~ good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Color can help in grabbing attention. Highlight each letter as and when with different colors randomly. U need not highlight all just randomly. U can try writing the timetables on pocket size card which he can carry around and look at. This way he can constantly remind himself of the timetable. He will be able to read it when hes waiting for the bus or in between periods. Remember dont cram the card, cramming will turn him off.<br><br>The ability to concentrate fully is said to be 1.5 hr even for an adult after some time people will start to drift its only knowing the important of what they are doing prevent them from wandering too much. A little humor during lessons does help to freshen one up. U teaches him english right? if so u can teach english after he seems to loss his attention. Engage him in an english conversation or make him write down anything interesting that happened to him. U can also bring some pictures along and make him discribe it. Along the way u can introduce to him new vocabulary. Remember to write this vocab in cards too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just gave him another tuiton yesterday. It went pretty good! I gave him some kind of science book with lots of information and pictures on science stuff and a model composition book I bought for him the previous tuition session. Yesterday when I come, immediately he showed me a piece of paper with some kind of a composition and some pictures on it enthusiastically. So I read it and I thought it was a big improvement on his composition but he showed that he copied it from one of the stories in the model composition book and he grinned seeing that I was tricked by him. <strong>But what exactly does this means?</strong> It seems he love reading and he read quite a lot of stories in the model composition book already. So I went through his homework, some story telling thing(composition), and went through a few problem sums with him. All along he keep wanting me to read with him the science book because he just love science. So i told him we finish up this first and this amount of problem sums. When we are done, we go down to the sofa and I read with him the science book. He agreed and we manage to finish up a number of problem sums more than usual. Then we are done, and I did as I promised and explain to him some of the stuff in the science book. Then I had to go and he was still reading the book when I left. Very much engrossed. Haiz, times like this makes me think the joys of parenthood. Hehe. Am I doing the right things so far?</div>
