The sand is everything else - the small stuff. If you put the sand into the jar first,Â” He continued, Â“there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life.Â”<br><br>Â“If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your spouse out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal. Take care of the golf balls first - the things that really matter.Â”<br><br>Â“Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.Â”<br><br>One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented.<br><br>The professor smiled. Â“IÂ’m glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, thereÂ’s always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend."<br></div>
