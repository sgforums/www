              <p>well. i'm 1.64m. used to be very insecure, tried all sorts of ways to grow taller but to no avail then decided to just resign to fate. anyway more guys than you think are in the 16X range. <br><br>I have a fellow shortie like me who said don't bother and worry about girls. It makes our choice easier ya?</p>
              <p>No one will take a measuring tape and follow you around. In fact, more often than not, it is ourselves who get affected by this affliction. Initially, it seems like a curse. You feel like when you imagine yourself, you feel very very small compared to other guys. Then you imagine yourself with your potential girlfriend (who is going to probably shorter than you), like a set of dwarfs. Then you get turned off by the image, then you think, life sucks. Then it spirals into more desperation and despair.<br><br>I think the key here is to not be affected by it. If you're affected by it, people can feel it. People who stand besides you can feel it. (who is the guy who keep trying to 'feel' the distance between our shoulders?). People who know your life will be able to feel it more. Though often there might be times of relapses (like getting rejected because a girl finds you too short or whatever), you should more often than not, accept whatever that is given. Find comfort, strength in other areas. If you don't already have one, find something that you can be extremely good at. Make the taller guys envy what you have. They might start poking you for height because they feel undermined. (they always tend to feel they're going to do better than you for some arcane reason). Don't let it affect you, just focus on the right things. <br><br><br>Everyone is imperfect. So even if you wished for a few inches more (I always had this "dream"), the next thing on your wish list is to have more muscles, bigger biceps, nicer abs etc....then after that on to the next level. More inches? Perhaps, or maybe then you will fuss about your face about not being "pretty" enough. There is no end. I was born with mostly everything (gifted, rich family, not bad looking etc...), there are countless of people who have told me if you were 10cm taller you would be really perfect. However, at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter.<br><br>Just my two cents.</p>
