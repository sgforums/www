            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this could be an allegory or an allusion to the current situations around the world, like the USA/IRAQ situation and particular i find it interesting and disturbing that the concept of 'Western' values are considered 'better' or of 'higher worth' than Asian values. I mean its kind of interesting that the west has penetrated every aspect of our lives.<br><br>Even though what i've said has nothing to do with the link, the reason i am going with the USA/IRAQ situation also extends to USA and Asian, or rather white caucasians in Singapore.<br><br>There was one convention i attended, it was a forum on local talents, and at this reception, there was a 18yr ABC boy who was surrounded by 3 or 4 Singaporean girls(all my friends btw) and were captivated with his speech.. and slowly i stood there listening to this ABC talking and suddenly, my other friend, also a girl, she tapped me on the shoulder and said "Wah, why all of them so mesmerised by this ABC?"<br><br>And that sort of shook me and got me thinking...cos in many ways, we keep bending to the west....seriously...<br><br>When have you heard Caucasians and specifically them....speak with a Singlish accent without mocking us?<br><br>Cos i used to work under this American who has a chinese singapore girlfriend and worked here for 4yrs. And whenever he tries to bring across his point and whenever any one of us dun understand what he says, he usually tries to get in a ..." Dun know ah? Understand ah?!, Very good lah..." which was puzzling because that seems to denote that Singlish accent is low class.<br><br>Like in WW2, the Japs were told or conditioned that the S.E.A asians races wer inferior, particularly the Chinese and needed 'liberating'...<br><br>And in USA and Irag, you hear words like 'giving them freedom' or 'the Iraqi ppl are better than they were before." It all seem so high-minded and absolute. Like Western ideas and thoughts are so much better.<br><br>Of cos, i'm not bashing the US. It is just one example. They are doing the right thing the wrong way. War is never an option.<br><br>But in terms of the topic thread, what is the difference between Japs and Sg? Seriously if you take away cultural and geograpy, we are essentially very much similar.<br><br>Same goes for the West and Asian? Are they really so much better in terms of values and ideas?</div>
