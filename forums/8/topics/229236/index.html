People also have a job to keep, Don't just simply ask to see their supervisor.<br><br>Maybe because of your own attitude, They decided to block you. And who knows, Your computer might actually be the problem.<br><br>Last time I also use Starhub, Call them and they say they will call me back after I leave my number, I didn't even receive a call.
