            <div class='col-md body'><br>good, at least we cleared up on the exact attire we are talking about.<br>okay, let me ask this qn then: in wat way is wearing such attire in skool a priviledge or benefit? lets first define priviledge or benefit as something good a person receives by virtue of his position, applicable only to those in such position.<br>that attire is warm, hot even, by s'pore's climate. its not a fashion symbol (in fact the whole point of wearing it is to not appear revealing, unlike today's fashion). if it were a priviledge, then would mean others would want to wear it too? are there any non-muslim girls out there who would like to wear such warm attire? and anyway if it were implemented as an acceptable form of the skool uniform, i dont see anything wrong with non-muslim girls wearing it either. (remember i talking about setting the design and color in accordance to the skool's original uniform, in effect making it a uniform much like school blazers, sweaters, etc).<br>another thing is, its good we both agree on the need to educate from young, but should we not educate them correctly? not to say your point on educating equality among the races wrong, but then neither is mine on educating tolerance of others' religous requirements. wouldn't both serve the purpose of reducing friction among the races?<br>and i oso agree it is difficult, impossible even, to be completely fair to everyone, especially in s'pore with so many diff races and such diverse needs. it is also difficult to change, but i am referring to a compromise, with as much fairness in mind. design according to original skool uniform, not restricted solely to only muslim girls, etc. change is difficult, but if we were to implement it would not our future generation accept it by then (assuming the negative impact as prescribed by those who disagree does not come to light, which you should agree, one can never be too sure)? national service was a difficult change but today it is widely accepted. i am not talking about bending rules but changing them for the future.<br><br>------------------<br>RockerZ!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ducati996 (edited 27 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ducati996:</div><div class="quote_body">good, at least we cleared up on the exact attire we are talking about.<br>okay, let me ask this qn then: in wat way is wearing such attire in skool a priviledge or benefit? lets first define priviledge or benefit as something good a person receives by virtue of his position, applicable only to those in such position.<br>that attire is warm, hot even, by s'pore's climate. its not a fashion symbol (in fact the whole point of wearing it is to not appear revealing, unlike today's fashion). if it were a priviledge, then would mean others would want to wear it too? are there any non-muslim girls out there who would like to wear such warm attire? and anyway if it were implemented as an acceptable form of the skool uniform, i dont see anything wrong with non-muslim girls wearing it either. (remember i talking about setting the design and color in accordance to the skool's original uniform, in effect making it a uniform much like school blazers, sweaters, etc).<br>another thing is, its good we both agree on the need to educate from young, but should we not educate them correctly? not to say your point on educating equality among the races wrong, but then neither is mine on educating tolerance of others' religous requirements. wouldn't both serve the purpose of reducing friction among the races?<br>and i oso agree it is difficult, impossible even, to be completely fair to everyone, especially in s'pore with so many diff races and such diverse needs. it is also difficult to change, but i am referring to a compromise, with as much fairness in mind. design according to original skool uniform, not restricted solely to only muslim girls, etc. change is difficult, but if we were to implement it would not our future generation accept it by then (assuming the negative impact as prescribed by those who disagree does not come to light, which you should agree, one can never be too sure)? national service was a difficult change but today it is widely accepted. i am not talking about bending rules but changing them for the future.<br><br></div></blockquote>Previlage...is something that when given to someone..he/she is able to benifit from it..so...by letting muslims to wear Islamic attire to schools is more of a previlage..well..you may say that it is not comfortable and things like that..another point..that to teach the youngsters abt racial equality and compromise...thats what the Govt is doing...in the initial stages of a young singaporean life..he is taught equality in the schools and in the nation..by makiung sure that they are seens as an entity and not seperated by religious attires...but..when they have grown and matured enouigh to understand compromise and tolerance amongst races and religions..then..they are allowed to wear whatever they like to work..or higher educations...so..do you see the whole picture now??Did anyone stop Muslim girls from wearing those attires to work??higher education??no..its only in the premlimary stages of education that they are not allowed to wear..thats the point... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ducatii..this article might be useful for you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Taken from Straits Times today..<br><br>Minister of State (Community Development and Sports) Yaacob Ibrahim said that some changes had already been made.<br><br>For example, Muslim girls may wear slacks instead of shorts during physical education lessons.<br><br>'So the movement is there but, at the same time, the community shouldn't get distracted by all this. 'There are larger issues looming and facing the Muslim community,' he said.<br><br>Addressing the Kampung Siglap Mosque Workplan Seminar, Dr Yaacob responded to comments made by the former Fateha chief, Mr Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff.<br><br>The latter had accused the Government of being insensitive to Muslims here, by not allowing Muslim girls to wear the hijab, or Islamic headscarf - also known as tudung - in schools.<br><br>Dr Yaacob said that while he and his colleagues can identify with this concern, they did not agree with Mr Zulfikar's approach.<br><br>'The negotiations for space between a community and the Government have to take place as part of a gradual process...<strong>Religious freedom has to be guided by a greater need for integration, and racial and religious understanding and tolerance</strong>,' he said.<br><br>Citing an example from Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs, he said <strong>Mr Lee had received a demand by the Chinese business community just after Independence, to elevate the status of Chinese among the four official languages here.<br><br>But, Mr Lee turned it down because it could have alienated the Malays and Indians here.<br></strong><br>'With time and the emergence of English as the language of business and communication, Mr Lee then created spaces for the Chinese community to preserve their language and culture. Is that being insensitive to Muslim feelings?' asked Dr Yaacob.<br><br>Putting the issue in perspective, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Abdullah Tarmugi said that no one was stopping Muslim girls from wearing the hijab outside school hours.<br><br>'So, really, we're talking about that period of school, secular school at that.<br><br>'If you look at it from that perspective, you can see how we've tried to balance these needs and the greater good of society,' he said.<br><br>The Government's stand on the issue was spelt out last week when Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng said that it was not just Muslims who had special requirements.<br><br>'<strong>The other religions may also have their requirements. So religion is a very personal thing. It's up to them to practise their faith at their own time, but when they are in school, the school rules, the school uniform, they have to be followed...</strong><br><br>'In the context of our multi-racial society, we have to learn to live together and accommodate one another.'<br><br>Asked about Mr Zulfikar's comments that the group would continue to press for a judicial review of the Government's decision, MP Ahmad Khalis Abdul Ghani said that pursuing a legal battle was not the way forward.<br><br>'We find that there are so many other issues that we need to tackle, such as problems arising from drug addiction, divorces, dysfunctional families and so on.<br><br>'So, if we put too much emphasis on the tudung issue, not that it's not important, are we doing justice to ourselves by putting our efforts solely on this, and by giving a rather inaccurate signal to the non-Muslims that we are so engrossed with the tudung issue?'<br><br>Hopes that this will let you understand what i am talking abt in these few posting... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
