            <div class='col-md body'>Saw the film .<br>Actually this song is good and has inmpressed everyone from online discusiion boards,, .reminds me of La bamba (nescafe advert in the 80s) but having the appeal of  Los del RÃ­o Macarena song of the mid 90s; also considering the indian song also features a train just like the nescafe advert. think he also made some  chinese song too. good song too<br><br>..the orginal maker of the song is a famous bollywood composer , highest selling music artiste in the world according to wikipedia<br>who also made a recent film i saw , a socio-documentary -" Swades", by checking the dvd print credits..i personally feel his music is uplifting, new and of high quality. brand of its own unique in the world.. have listen to tons of music , trust me nobody had done it like this before.<br>...The background of score of Swades will make you almost cry. The musical show lord of the rings playing in theatres now from the same composer. u can check out the Cd onc eit is released.<br>becos, his music is too novel for a normal listener arr he 's called may sound strange to some ears at first but slowly addicting stuff. listen to it many times and u will catch it f ull essence- Elton john combined with the grandness of John Williams<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Blanchard does right for Lee's 'Man' score<br><br>By Sheigh Crabtree<br><br>The opening and closing musical tracks of Spike Lee's "Inside Man" immediately attracted the attention of film critics and moviegoers alike because Lee chose an unexpected piece of Bollywood music as a curtain-raiser for his urban thriller.<br><br>Online discussion boards, particularly iTunes' "Inside Man" soundtrack homepage, were swamped with demands for the single "Chaiyya Chaiyya Bollywood Joint."<br><br>Longtime Lee composer Terence Blanchard says the song, which originally was featured in the 1998 Bollywood hit "Dil Se," is in perfect keeping with the director's distinct musical choices.<br><br>"To me it goes right back to when Spike did 'Do the Right Thing' and he used (Public Enemy's) 'Fight the Power'," Blanchard says. "He is a serious music lover and he knew ("Chaiyya Chaiyya") would create a unique viewing experience; it sends you off in an unexpected direction thinking in an expanded tonal palette for the picture."<br><br>Blanchard lightly rearranged composer AR Rahman's original track for the film by beefing up the song's orchestration with some strings, horns, brass and timpani, and he also tried to extend the musical structure of the song without being redundant.<br><br>Then the composer and the director brought in Panjabi MC to add hip-hop lyrics that play on the song's original themes of cultural divides.<br><br>The instrumentation also connects with Blanchard's jazzy original score for the film that the song bookends. And though Lee generally gives Blanchard a lot of room to create musical ideas around his images, the way they reached the song choice for "Inside Man" was slightly unusual even by the standards of their long-running relationship. "We hadn't had any musical conversations about the movie until he started to cut the picture together," Blanchard says. "Whereas on (the Golden Globe nominated score for) '25th Hour,' Spike told me to get prepared for wall-to-wall music."<br><br>When Blanchard saw a rough cut, the first thing that struck him was its distinct look and Denzel Washington and Clive Owen's performances.<br><br>"I said, I know the music has to have an aggressive pulse to it given those characters," Blanchard says. "But it's always interesting working with Spike -- he loves melody."<br><br>Of the previous films on which they have worked, Lee always has asked Blanchard for a CD of distinct themes, which the director then assigns to different characters. The same was true but with a twist on "Inside Man."<br><br>"Spike picked one of the prettiest themes and gave it to Dalton (Owen's character) who's supposed to be bad guy!" Blanchard laughs. "I said, You sure you want to do that? He always tries to go for some unique and different choices and by doing that he creates a challenging narrative that also helps tell the story."<br><br>Blanchard wrote the score over four weeks and recorded it with more than 60 orchestra members for four days at Todd-AO in Los Angeles.<br><br>But just days before he was set to record the score, Hurricane Katrina wiped out Blanchard's childhood home in New Orleans. He was unable to find his mother for two weeks.<br><br>The composer's story of personal loss will be documented in Lee's upcoming documentary "When the Levees Broke."<br><br>"Trust me, it's hard for people to fathom the vastness of the tragedy," Blanchard says. "We have friends who survived, but lost everything and died from broken hearts. Working on the 'Inside Man' score was a Godsend for me. When you hear the Dalton themes in the beginning, it's also what was going on with Katrina in my mind. Music was a great outlet during that period."</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>meanwhile comment on my review of Swades:<br><br>Hi thee i am local reviewer. I wite reviews for foreign movies and asian cinema.<br><br>Got the chance to see the movie Swades from  Bollywood.<br><img src="http://www.musicindiaonline.com/z/wp/movie_name/7522/s240x180/2.jpg"><br><br>Synopsis<br>Set in modern day India, Swades is a film that tackles the issues that development throws up on a grass root level. It is to this India, which is colorful, heterogeneous and complex that Mohan Bhargava (Shah Rukh Khan), a bright young scientist working as a project manager in NASA, returns to on a quest to find his childhood nanny. The film uses the contrast between the highly developed world of NASA, which has been at the forefront of advances in space research, and this world back home in India, which is at the crossroads of development. Mohan's simple quest becomes the journey that every one of us goes through in search of that metaphysical and elusive place called "home".<br><br>30 minutes after I had viewed the DVd on Sat, I was not sure about how I felt about this film. 48 hours hence, I vividly remember most of the scenes and can lucidly state that is truly 'haunting'. i<br><br>Swades is not colorful; Shahrukh doesn't appear in a GAP or POLO SPORT; there are no introductory shots; there are no romantic scenes and no fields with yellow Tulip flowers; It may be a tad slow and lengthy; But Swades hits you where your heart hurts the most; patriotic and root feelings of an individual with good intentions overcoming societal obstacle. It's brilliant, heartfelt and touching. The 'We, People' film really makes us feel like it's our film. We see in the film what we see everyday, the places as they are. It's very much contemporary and it's our story.<br><br>Swades is about the conscience trauma of an Indian, urging him to comeback and do something for his country. It haunts you for long enough after the cinema has ended.<br><br>Seeing the harsh reality and we'll find it difficult to suppress our tears. It's an answer to the generation of materialistic 'we', who never shy from proclaiming our great culture and tradition, but do nothing for our less fortunate people around us.<br><br>The asset of the film is Shahrukh Khan, looking ordinary and real but in an extra-ordinary performance.  The music' haunts both in terms of its visuals and wordings.<br><br>But above all, it's the good intention and the attention to detail, of director  that makes wonders for this truly experimental and moving cinema.<br><br>I can and will definitely view this movie once more, to celebrate it feel and spirit. I can't predict its box office outcome, as the masses love fantasies and escapist cinema. But it's definitely a treat for those who want to see moving and believable films on a large scale. Also if we need to embrace different cinema like this</div>
