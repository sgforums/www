            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Fishersprice, have seen your past few posts. Quite a good display of the Christian apologetics. Very rare for christians to be equipped with that kind of knowledge.<br>Anyway, just want to know more about the source of the informations. In Sunday School? In Church Service? Apologetics books (any titles?), Websites?<br>Good one on the creation of Adam and Eve. All along, I thought that there were only 4 and the population's growth depends on Adam and Eve only. In any case, it seems that promiscuity is inevitable among men in the early years to reproduce.<br>Now with your enlightenment, my doubt is removed. GOD is sovereign and he doesn't allow promiscuity before and after Jesus. Praise God for that. Thanks Fishersprice.<br></div>

That had I never met with people who only wanted to share their joy of being Christians and share their knowledge of the bible, that I would never have known, much less own a bible myself?<br><br>If you wish to discuss religion (your own) in such unbending ways, shall I just refer you to a Christian forum?  Perhaps you might find people more being able to talk to you about it?<br><a href="http://www.christian.per.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.christian.per.sg/</a><br><br>Just a short anecdote.  Quite a while ago, I was praying at Guan Yin Temple.  While I was walking within the temple grounds, I saw several Indians walking by, on their way to the Hindu temple.<br><br>The Hindu devotees were carrying their God upon their shoulders towards their temple.  However, as they walked by, they began to turn to face the Taoist Temple entrance.  They began to rock the statue of their God, and perhaps even bent their knees a little as a form of respect to a God outside of their own religion, before moving on.<br><br>I felt so moved by their ability to show respect for others outside their own beliefs, and their leading by example to their followers that we need not have religious conflicts between different gods, that after I finished my prayers at Guan Yin Temple, I walked over to the Hindu Temple and bowed in respect to them as well.<br><br>To me, this is my joy of being a Singaporean.  To be able to live in a multi-racial and harmonious country. I understand that Christians cannot believe in other religions and gods (I read the bible).  But I hope somehow, like my own Christian friends, they are able to give a basic respect for a human being.<br><br>"Don't judge others, least you be judged yourself" - Perhaps in the wrong words, but a teaching from the bible.<br><br>i meant no disrespect.  Much like yourself, I just want to share my personal opinion.</div></blockquote>That's a good comments.
