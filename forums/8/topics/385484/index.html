              <p><br>I tailor with CYC.  And they are nice enough to post to where-ever you are, if you ask them nicely.</p>
              <p>Oxford Tailor at top floor of OUB Centre (shopping mall side) does a decent job too.</p>
              <p>I also go to Lucky Tailor at City Plaza.  The old man tailor there (I am not sure he is still operating his shop) have some old fashion but pretty interesting textured fabrics that can make your tailored shirts looks a bit more one of the kind instead of those you get from Raoul.  He does only mens tailoring, but last time on request from my ex spouse, he did for me a lovely brown chinese collar shirt which I still keep and wear today, even if its looking really worn out.</p>

              <p>oh i heard "personality" is just so-so. friend recommended this tailor in boat quay for me. pretty pricey, but he said it's awesome for MTM clothes. anyone else want to tailor MTM shirts tell me! i don't want to put the tailor out here because of obvious reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>This is again, where your logic is flawed.</p>
              <p>Enemies do not practise what you think they should, and neither are they meant to do what you dictate they should.</p>
              <p>Because ultimately, you do not have the IQ so far as shown to quantify them being as low down the chain of IQ and EQ as you think they should be.</p>
              <p>But anyway, back to the shirts.</p>
              <p>I am wearing my CYC shirt now.  Either I really put on too much weight, or the material shrunk a bit more then expected by the tailors.  I bought the shirt back to them once, and they claim its still the correct length at my wrists though I think its a bit too short.</p>
              <p>Because CYC does Shanghai Tailoring, which means they used only one thread for the whole shirt.  Adjusting the cuffs might take some more time and work.</p>
