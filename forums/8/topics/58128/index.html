            <div class='col-md body'>The story of the painting, The Last Supper, is extremely interesting and instructive. The two incidents connected with it afford a most convincing lesson on the effects of right thinking or wrong thinking in the life of a boy or girl, or of a man or a woman.<br><br>The Last Supper was painted by Leonardo Da Vinci, a noted Italian artist; and the time engaged for its completion was seven years. The figures representing the twelve Apostles and Christ himself were painted from living persons.  The life-model for the painting of the figure of Jesus was chosen first.  When it was decided that Da Vinci would paint this great picture, hundreds and hundreds of young men were carefully viewed in an endeavor to find a face and personality exhibiting innocence and beauty, free from the scars and signs of dissipation caused by sin.<br><br>Finally, after weeks of laborious searching, a young man nineteen years of age was selected as a model for the portrayal of Christ. For six months, Da Vinci worked on the production of this leading character of his famous painting.<br><br>During the next six years, Da Vinci continued his labors on this sublime work of art. One by one fitting persons were chosen to represent each of the eleven Apostles; space being left for the painting of the figure representing Judas Iscariot as the final task of this masterpiece. This was the Apostle, you  remember, who betrayed his Lord for thirty pieces of silver, worth in our present day, currency of $16.96.<br><br>For weeks, Da Vinci searched for a man with a hard callous face, with a countenance marked by scars of avarice, deceit, hypocrisy, and crime; a face that would delineate a character who would betray his best friend.<br><br>After many discouraging experiences in searching for the type of person required to represent Judas, word came to Da Vinci that a man whose appearance fully met his requirements had been found in a dungeon in Rome, sentenced to die for a life of crime and murder.<br><br>Da Vinci made the trip to Rome at once, and this man was brought out from his imprisonment in the dungeon and led out into the light of the sun.  There Da Vinci saw before him a dark, swarthy man; his long, shaggy and unkempt hair sprawled over his face, which betrayed a character of viciousness and complete ruin. At last, the famous painter had found the person he wanted to represent the character of Judas in his painting.<br><br>By special permission from the king, this prisoner was carried to Milan where the picture was being painted; and for months he sat before Da Vinci at appointed hours each day as the gifted artist diligently continued his task of transmitting to his painting this base character in the picture representing the traitor and betrayer of our savior.<br><br>As he finished his last stroke, he turned to the guards and said, "I have finished. You may take the prisoner away."  As the guards were leading their prisoner away, he suddenly broke loose from their control and rushed up to Da Vinci, crying as he did so, "O, Da Vinci, look at me! Do you not know who I am?"<br><br>Da Vinci, with the trained eyes of a great character student, carefully scrutinized the man upon whose face he had constantly gazed for six months and replied, "No, I have never seen you in my life until you were brought before me out of the dungeon in Rome."<br><br>Then, lifting his eyes toward heaven, the prisoner said, "Oh, God, have I fallen so low?" Then turning his face to the painter he cried, "Leonardo Da Vinci! Look at me again for I am the same man you painted just seven years ago as the figure of Christ."<br><br>This is the true story of the painting of The Last Supper that teaches so strongly the lesson of the effects of right or wrong thinking on the life of an individual. Here was a young man whose character was so pure, unspoiled by the sins of the world that he presented a countenance of innocence and beauty fit to be used for the painting of a representation of Christ. But within seven years, following the thoughts of sin and a life of crime, he was changed into a perfect picture of the most traitorous character ever known in the history of the world.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>26 Armed Guards<br>Here's a story that will bring you chills. Have you ever felt the urge to pray for someone and then just put it on a list and said, "I'll pray for them later" or "when I have more time"? Or has anyone ever called you and said, "I really need you to pray for me, I have this need."? Read the following story that was sent to me and may it change the way that you may think about prayer and also the way you pray. You will be blessed by this.<br><br>--------------------<br><br>A missionary on furlough told this true story while visiting his home church in Michigan.....<br><br>"While serving at a small field hospital in Africa, every two weeks I traveled by bicycle through the jungle to a nearby city for supplies. This was a journey of two days and required camping overnight at the halfway point. On one of these journeys, I arrived in the city where I planned to collect money from a bank, purchase medicine and supplies, and then begin my two-day journey back to the field hospital. Upon arrival in the city, I observed two men fighting, one of whom had been seriously injured. I treated him for his injuries and at the same time talked to him about the Lord Jesus Christ. I then traveled two days, camping overnight, and arrived home without incident.<br><br>Two weeks later I repeated my journey. Upon arriving in the city, I was approached by the young man I had treated he told me that he had known I carried money and medicines. He said, 'Some friends and I followed you into the jungle, knowing you would camp overnight. We planned to kill you and take your  money and drugs. But just as we were about to move into your camp, we saw that you were surrounded by 26 armed guards.'  At this I laughed and said that I was certainly all alone in that jungle campsite. The young man pressed the point, however, and said, 'No sir, I was not the only person to see the guards. My five friends also saw them, and we all counted them. It was because of those guards that we were afraid and left you alone.'<br><br>At this point in the sermon, one of the men in the Michigan congregation jumped to his feet and interrupted the missionary and asked if he could tell him the exact day this happened. The missionary told the congregation  the date, and the man who interrupted told him this story: "On the night of your incident in Africa, it was morning here and I was preparing to go play golf. I was about to putt when I felt the urge to pray for you.  In fact, the urging of the Lord was so strong, I called men in this church to meet with me here in the sanctuary to pray for you. Would all of those men who met with me on that day stand up?" The men who had met together to pray that day stood up. The missionary wasn't concerned with who they were, he was too busy counting how many men he saw. There were 26.<br><br>This story is an incredible example of how the Spirit of the Lord moves in mysterious ways. If you ever  hear such prodding, go along with  it.  Nothing is ever hurt by prayer except the gates of hell. I encourage you to forward this to as many people as you know. If we all take it to heart, we can turn this world toward Christ once again.<br><br>As the above true story clearly illustrates, "with God all things are possible" and more importantly, how God hears and answers the prayers of the faithful.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Helen Roseverare, a missionary doctor from England to Zaire, Africa, told this as it happend to her in Africa.<br><br>A LITTLE GIRL'S PRAYER<br><br>One night I had worked hard to help a mother in the labor ward; but in spite of all we could do she died leaving us with a tiny prematre baby and a crying two-year-old daughter. We would have difficulty keeping the baby alive, as we had no incubator. (We had no electricity to run an incubator.)<br><br>We also had no special feeding facilites. Although we lived on the equator, nights were often chilly with treacherous drafts. One student midwife went for the box we had for such babies and the cotton wool the baby would be wrapped in. Another went to stoke up the fire and fill a hot water bottle. She came back shortly in distress to tell me that in filling the bottle, it had burst. Rubber perishes easliy<br>in tropical climates. "And it is our last hot water bottle!" she exclaimed.<br><br>As in the West it is no good crying over spilled milk, so in Central Africa it might be considered no good crying over burst water bottles. They do not grow on trees, and there are no drugstores down the forest pathways.<br><br>"All right," I said, "Put the baby as near the fire as you safely can, and sleep between the baby and the door to keep it free from drafts. Your job is to keep the baby warm."<br><br>The following noon, as I did most days, I went to have prayers with any of the orphanage children who chose to gather with me. I gave the youngsters various suggestions of things to pray about and told them about the tiny baby. I explained our problem about keeping the baby warm enough mentioning the hot water bottle. The baby could so easily die if it got chills. I also told them of the two-year-old sister, crying because her mother had died. During the prayer time, one ten-year-old girl, Ruth, prayed with the usual blunt conciseness of our African children.<br><br>"Please, God," she prayed, "send us a water bottle. It'll be no good tomorrow, God as the baby will be dead, so please send it this afternoon." While I gasped howardly at the audacity of the prayer, she added by way of a corollary, "And while You are about it, would You please send a dolly for the little girl so she'll know You really love her?" As often with children's prayers, I was put on the spot. Could I honestly say,  "Amen?"<br><br>I just did not believe that God could do this. Oh, yes, I know that He can do everything. The Bible says so. But there are limits, aren't there?<br><br>The only way God could answer this partidular prayer would be by sending me a parcel from the homeland. I had been in Africa for almost four years at that time, and I had never, ever received a parcel from home.<br><br>Anyway, if anyone did send me a parcel, who would put in a hot water bottle? I lived on the equator!<br><br>Halfway through the afternoon, while I was teaching in the nurses' training school, a message was sent that there was a car at my front door.  By the time I reached home, the car had gone, but there, on the verandah, was a large twenty-two pound parcel. I felt tears pricking my eyes. I could not open the parcel alone, so I sent for the orphanage children.<br><br>Together we pulled off the string, carefully undoing each knot. We folded the paper, taking care not to tear it unduly. Excitement was mounting. Some thirty or forty pairs of eyes were focused on the large cardboard box. From the top, I lifted out brightly colored, knitted jerseys. Eyes sparkled as I gave them out. Then there were the knitted bandages for the leprosy patients, and the children looked a little bored. Then came a box of mixed raisins and sultanas- that would make a nice batch of buns for the weekend.<br><br>Then, as I put my hand in again, I felt the..... could it really be? I grasped it and pulled it out - yes, a brand new, rubber hot water bottle I cried.  I had not asked God to send it; I had not truly believed that He could.<br><br>Ruth was in the front row of the children. She rushed forward, crying out, "If God has sent the bottle, He must have sent the dolly, too!" Rummaging down to the bottom of the box, she pulled out the small, beautifully dressed dolly. Her eyes shone! She had never doubted. Looking up at me, she asked: "Can I go with you, Mummy, and give this dolly to that little girl, so she'll know that Jesus really love her?"<br><br>That parcel had been on the way for five whole months. Packed up by my former Sunday School class, whose leader had heard and obeyed God's prompting to send a hot water bottle, even to the equator. And one of the girls had put in a dolly for an African child - five months before - in answer to the believing prayer of a ten-year-old to bring it "that afternoon."<br><br>"Before they call, I will answer!" Isa 65:24<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"LET ME EXPLAIN THE problem science has with Jesus Christ."<br><br>The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand.<br><br>"You're a Christian, aren't you, son?"<br>"Yes, sir."<br>"So you believe in God?"<br>"Absolutely."<br>"Is God good?"<br>"Sure! God's good."<br>"Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?"<br>"Yes."<br>"Are you good or evil?"<br>"The Bible says I'm evil."<br><br>The professor grins knowingly. "Ahh! THE BIBLE!"<br>He considers for a moment.<br><br>"Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help them? Would you try?"<br><br>"Yes sir, I would."<br>"So you're good...!"<br>"I wouldn't say that."<br>"Why not say that? You would help a sick and maimed person if you could; in fact most of us would if we<br>could... God doesn't."<br><br>No answer.<br><br>"He doesn't, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Hmmm?<br>Can you answer that one?"<br><br>No answer<br><br>The elderly man is sympathetic.<br><br>"No, you can't, can you?"<br><br>He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student time to relax. In philosophy, you have to go easy with the new ones.<br><br>"Let's start again young fella. Is God good?" "Er... Yes."<br>"Is Satan good?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Where does Satan come from?"<br><br>The student falters.<br><br>"From... God..."<br><br>"That's right. God made Satan, didn't he?" The elderly man runs his bony fingers through his thinning hair and turns to the smirking, student audience.<br><br>"I think we're going to have a lot of fun this semester, ladies and gentlemen."<br><br>He turns back to the Christian.<br><br>"Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?"<br><br>"Yes, sir."<br><br>"Evil's everywhere, isn't it? Did God make everything?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Who created evil?"<br><br>No answer<br><br>"Is there sickness in this world? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All the terrible things - do they exist in this world?"<br><br>The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."<br><br>"Who created them? "<br><br>No answer<br><br>The professor suddenly shouts at his student.<br><br>"WHO CREATED THEM? TELL ME PLEASE!"<br><br>The professor closes in for the kill and climbs into the Christian's face. In a still small voice:  "God created all evil, didn't He, son?"<br><br>No answer. The student tries to hold the steady, experienced gaze and fails. Suddenly the lecturer reaks away to pace the front of the classroom like an aging panther. The class is mesmerized.<br><br>"Tell me," he continues, "How is it that this God is good if He created all evil throughout all time?"<br><br>The professor swishes his arms around to encompass the wickedness of the world.<br><br>"All the hatred, the brutality, all the pain, all the torture, all the death and ugliness and all the suffering created by this good God is all over the world, isn't it, young man?"<br><br>No answer<br><br>"Don't you see it all over the place? Huh?"<br><br>Pause.<br><br>"Don't you?"<br><br>The professor leans into the student's face again and whispers,<br><br>"Is God good?"<br><br>No answer<br><br>"Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?"<br><br>The student's voice betrays him and cracks.<br><br>"Yes, professor. I do."<br><br>The old man shakes his head sadly. "Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you?"<br><br>"No, sir. I've never seen Him."<br><br>"Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"<br><br>"No, sir. I have not."<br><br>"Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus...in fact, do you have any sensory perception of your God whatsoever?"<br><br>No answer<br><br>"Answer me, please."<br><br>"No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."<br><br>"You're AFRAID... you haven't ?"<br><br>"No, sir."<br><br>"Yet you still believe in him?"<br><br>"...yes..."<br><br>"That takes FAITH!" The professor smiles sagely at the underling. "According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son? Where is your God now?"<br><br>The student doesn't answer<br><br>"Sit down, please."<br><br>The Christian sits...Defeated.<br><br>Another Christian raises his hand. "Professor, may I address the class?"<br><br>The professor turns and smiles.<br><br>"Ah, another Christian in the vanguard! Come, come, young man. Speak some proper wisdom to the gathering."<br><br>The Christian looks around the room.<br><br>"Some interesting points you are making, sir. Now I've got a question for you. Is there such thing as heat?"<br><br>"Yes," the professor replies. "There's heat."<br><br>"Is there such a thing as cold?"<br><br>"Yes, son, there's cold too."<br><br>"No, sir, there isn't."<br><br>The professor's grin freezes. The room suddenly goes very cold. The second Christian continues.<br><br>"You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat but we don't have anything called 'cold'. We can hit 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold, otherwise we would be able to go colder than 458. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it."<br><br>Silence. A pin drops somewhere in the classroom.<br><br>"Is there such a thing as darkness, professor?"<br><br>"That's a dumb question, son. What is night if it isn't darkness? What are you getting at...?"<br><br>"So you say there is such a thing as darkness?"<br><br>"Yes..."<br><br>"You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something, it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define the word. In reality, Darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker and give me a jar of it. Can you...give me a jar of darker darkness, professor?"<br><br>Despite himself, the professor smiles at the young effrontery before him.<br><br>"This will indeed be a good semester. Would you mind telling us what your point is, young man?"<br><br>"Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must be in error...."<br><br>The professor goes toxic. "Flawed...? How dare you...!"<br><br>"Sir, may I explain what I mean?"<br><br>The class is all ears.<br><br>"Explain... oh, explain..." The professor makes an admirable effort to regain control. Suddenly he is affability itself. He waves his hand to silence the class, for the student to continue.<br><br>"You are working on the premise of duality," the Christian explains.<br><br>"That for example there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science cannot even explain a thought.<br><br>It uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen, much less fully understood them. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life, merely the absence of it."<br><br>The young man holds up a newspaper he takes from the desk of a neighbor who has been reading it.<br><br>"Here is one of the most disgusting tabloids this country hosts, professor. Is there such a thing as immorality?"<br><br>"Of course there is, now look..."<br><br>"Wrong again, sir. You see, immorality is merely the absence of morality. Is there such thing as injustice? No. Injustice is the absence of justice. Is there such a thing as evil?" The Christian<br>pauses.<br><br>"Isn't evil the absence of good?"<br><br>The professor's face has turned an alarming color. He is so angry he is temporarily speechless. The Christian continues.<br><br>"If there is evil in the world, professor, and we all agree there is, then God, if he exists, must be accomplishing a work through the agency of evil. What is that work, God is accomplishing? The Bible tells us it is to see if each one of us will, of our own free will, choose good over evil."<br><br>The professor bridles.<br><br>"As a philosophical scientist, I don't view this matter as having anything to do with any choice; as a realist, I absolutely do not recognize the concept of God or any other theological factor as being part of the world equation because God is not observable."<br><br>"I would have thought that the absence of God's moral code in this world is probably one of the most observable phenomena going," the Christian replies. "Newspapers make billions of dollars reporting it every week! Tell me, professor, Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?"<br><br>"If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do."<br><br>"Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?"<br><br>The professor makes a sucking sound with his teeth and gives his student a silent, stony stare.<br><br>"Professor. Since no-one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a priest?"<br><br>"I'll overlook your impudence in the light of our philosophical discussion. Now, have you quite finished?" the professor hisses.<br><br>"So you don't accept God's moral code to do what is righteous?"<br><br>"I believe in what is - that's science!"<br><br>"Ahh! SCIENCE!" the student's face splits into a grin. "Sir, you rightly state that science is the study of observed phenomena. Science too is a premise which is flawed..."<br><br>"SCIENCE IS FLAWED..?" the professor splutters.<br><br>The class is in uproar. The Christian remains standing until the commotion has subsided.<br><br>"To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, may I give you an example of what I mean?"<br><br>The professor wisely keeps silent. The Christian looks around the room.<br><br>"Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's brain?"<br><br>The class breaks out in laughter. The Christian points towards his elderly, crumbling tutor.<br><br>"Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain... felt the professor's brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain?"<br><br>No one appears to have done so. The Christian shakes his head sadly.<br><br>"It appears no-one here has had any sensory perception of the professor's brain whatsoever. Well, according to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science, says the professor has no brain."<br><br>The class is in chaos. The Christian sits... Because that is what a chair is for.<br><br>An atheist has a reason, but no hope for his reason.<br>A hypocrite has a hope, but no reason for his hope.<br>A Christian has a reason for his hope and a hope for his reason; and, I might add:<br>Life with Christ is an endless hope.<br>Without Christ, is a hopeless end.<br></div>
