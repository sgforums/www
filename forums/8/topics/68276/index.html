            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Q</strong> I'm a polytechnic student and have had this problem since my secondary school days. I keep tripping over my words - I keep repeating them.<br><br>This has made me extremely nervous about speaking in front of the class, especially during presentations. When a new term starts, I am all nervous and worried, and dread that a presentation may be coming up.<br><br>What should I do?<br><br><strong>Nervous speaker</strong><br><br>[/quote]<br><br><strong>A</strong> This is a relatively common problem. Stuttering or stammering is the repeated interruption of the flow of speech by repetition, prolongation or blocking of sounds.<br><br>It usually starts before the age of 10, is three to four times more common in boys and tends to run in families. However, many outgrow it.<br><br>Initially, the stuttering may be over particular words or phrases, but can begin to involve wider social situations.<br><br>The problem lies in the associated fear and nervousness. This needs to be addressed as it can destroy one's self-confidence.<br><br>Treatment will involve fixing the speech pattern and dealing with the anticipatory anxiety when speaking to a big crowd.<br><br>Speech therapy may involve teaching the person, usually in a small group setting with professional guidance, to speak slowly, deliberately, regularly, syllable by syllable, within a calm and nurturing environment.<br><br>But dealing with the anxiety is just as important. Try speaking to gradually larger and larger groups, distracting yourself when anxious (the classic example is to imagine your audience in a semi-dressed state so that they appear less intimidating) and practising speaking in situations where you are not always expected to perform well, such as in meetings.<br><br>Other anxiety-reducing techniques include deep breathing, reassuring self-talk, such as telling yourself 'I can do it slow and steady' or 'I am in control', and focusing more on familiar or caring faces when in front of a large crowd.<br><br>You could also train yourself not to answer in haste when questioned by the audience. This will allow you more time to think, react and formulate the answers and thus reduce your anxiety.<br><br>I remember counselling a university lecturer who stuttered that he should first practise talking more in smaller tutorial groups before delivering a lecture to a larger audience. Some useful delaying techniques included getting him to say, 'That was a good question', 'What do you think?', 'What do the rest think?', 'Does anyone have an answer?', 'Let me answer that later', or even 'I don't know the answer now but will get back to you later.'<br><br>More severe causes of anxiety might require medication to help one calm down.<br><br>Remember, no situation should be viewed as a do-or-die one. Instead, be thick-skinned and focus on the following advice:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Do not be afraid of criticism or ridicule.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Do not avoid opportunities to speak up.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Join a Toastmaster's Club in the polytechnic or community centre.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Distract yourself when anxious and, if that fails, use the delaying techniques.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Talk to your lecturer about your problem so that he can allow for fewer presentations initially or allow you to speak as part of a team.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Use more graphics or video clips so the audience looks more at the screen and less at you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Do your research so that you are well prepared for questions.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Remember that as the speaker, you know more about the subject than the audience.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Acknowledge your anxiety.
