            <div class='col-md body'>Morally n ethically, the rich should help the less fortunate n the poor. However, to wat extent. As the saying goes, " U give a poor man a gold coin, he is fed for 3 days. Teach him to earn a silver coin everyday, he's fed everyday for the rest of his life." Now, charity itself could manifest into a social evil as well, encouraging dependence n destroying the very idea tt contributed to SG's success, meritocracy. Charity has to be responsible. The rich may be willing to offer the financial means, but who is going to ensure tt the poor will make use of it constructively n not abuse it? The rich is preoccupied with making more money. The govt bogged down with other affairs. Pple striving to climb the corporate ladder rather den being an active volunteer. In today's society, having the financial means to be charitable is very easy, but to genuinely help the less fortunate is really a more daunting task.</div>

The Singapore that I grew up with had none of this kind of sadness. Now it seems like this sadness is going to get worse. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I would help them if I had the money to do so, but unfortunately this will not solve their problems. If they're lazy and begging for money like what those beggar does in other countries, I wouldn't even care less for people like that. But unfortunately these people in Singapore are the genuine ones, they're genuinely poor...not that they prefer to dig trash for food. They are unable to find a job...nobody would want to hire them...and that's sad indeed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>These poor folks usually does that after hours...after 11pm and close to midnight. I'm not Batman spying on them ok? :-P I just happened to walk home around that time and saw them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>People are selfish and it has always been, I'm selfish too...and I don't help strangers unless I'm in a great mood...we all got our priorities in life and it's really sad to know that staying alive has become our top priorities for some of us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>It's true that our country is advancing by the year, but it's sad to discover that the people around us are no longer happy as the days goes by. It's becoming really difficult to survive and stay alive in Singapore. We may not feel it now as we have our parents to thank for. Some families are already feeling the stretch of this social crisis and suffering. We will feel it later when we're older.<br><br>The moment when the government decides that it's alright for companies that doesn't do well to retrench staffs, that sparked the beginning of our social problem. When the company that you've stayed loyal to for years suddenly decides that they're not obligated to keep you on their payroll when you're pass your prime, that's the beginning of your troubles even if you've saved a huge amount of savings over the years...cos your savings will not be able to feed till you go meet your maker...and not forgetting the sum of the medical bills which you must've left out while planning for your retirement. So when that happens, what are you going to do? You can't find another job not because there are not enough jobs around...and also not because you're too spoiled and picky for a job...and also not because you're not skilled enough to handle the job...and not because you're asking for a high salary. It's because employers felt that you're just too old for the job...of cos they won't tell you, all you'll know is that the position has just been filled.<br><br>What happened to the old virtues that our older generations once held? The virtue of employers treasuring the loyalty of the employees who have worked their prime off for the company are lost and denied in our society presently. Can we actually have a future in Singapore even if we worked for it? Who here can say with confidence that they will be able to support and provide their family and love ones with the basic necessities in life till they die?<br><br>It's really nice to see the government improving Singapore by so much...making Singapore seems really prosperous. I feel that a country is only truely prosperous when it's citizens are prosperous. There's so much lacking in there.<br><br>I've just discovered another funny fact today, why are older people paying more for their medishield? Shouldn't the younger people with better earning power pay more than the older folks? Old people are retired and living off their measly CPF funds and has a higher chance of being sick, so shouldn't older people pay lesser for their medishield? Young people are usually healthier than older people and has lesser risk of falling ill, so shouldn't they pay more when they're young and pay less when they're old?<br><br>I felt that the government have done a great job in improving Singapore and making it really prosperous than our neighbours. But it seems that Singapore is more prosperous than her own citizens, so maybe it's time the government work on a miracle to improve the citizens of Singapore before our country become so prosperous that we're finding 'gems' in our trash bins.<br></div>
