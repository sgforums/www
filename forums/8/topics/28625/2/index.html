            <div class='col-md body'>Police probe decade-old kidnapping of Hong Kong actress<br>HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police are investigating the abduction of a popular actress 12 years ago after a racy magazine published a topless photograph of her taken during the kidnapping.<br><br>The abduction was never reported to police, but the outpouring of anger since East Week magazine published the photo on its front cover last week has forced them into action.<br><br>"Yes, anti-triad (anti-gangster) police are involved. I believe they will contact the victim, if they haven't already done so," a police spokesman said on Monday.<br><br>Hong Kong gangs are widely believed to have been heavily involved in the local film industry for years.<br><br>"We can't reveal details of the investigation, but I hope the victim can come out and cooperate with police," Security Secretary Regina Ip told Hong Kong's Cable TV station.<br><br>East Week has since suspended publication due to widespread anger over the photograph, which shows her cowering in an unidentified location.<br><br>Although her eyes were shaded out in the photo, many film fans know her to be Carina Lau, who shot to fame among Chinese audiences in Asia for the girl-next-door roles she played in television drama serials in the late 1980s.<br><br>Lau spoke publicly of her plight for the first time on Sunday when she participated in a protest organised by the film industry to denounce East Week's publication of the photograph.<br><br>"I am stronger than what I always imagined myself to be. If such a tragedy could raise awareness of the importance of media ethics...then the suffering and indignities that I have suffered aren't such a big deal," she said.<br><br>Some of Hong Kong's tabloid newspapers and magazines have a reputation for racy reporting, showing gruesome pictures from accident scenes. Some sport daily supplements featuring brothel guides, complete with ratings.<br><br>The magazine may face prosecution under the territory's ordinance on the control of obscene and indecent articles, said a spokeswoman for the Television and Entertainment Licencing Authority.<br><br>Another magazine, Three Weekly, faces the same after it published the same photograph over the weekend, she said.<br><br>If convicted, they each face a maximum fine of HK$1 million and three years' jail.<br><img src="http://wwwi.reuters.com/images/2002-11-04T170001Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONP_1_Asia-132590-1-pic0.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Enough!<br>Hongkong stars rise against the paparazzi </span></strong><br><br>HONGKONG - Paparazzi journalism is far from exclusive to Hongkong, but the local brand is particularly in-your-face and some of the targets complain they need more protection.<br><br>Picture this: One photographer cut through a thick swathe of tall grass and tree branches to get close to a prison, while a rival kept watch from a helicopter hovering in the morning sky.<br><br>Jostling for space, photographers wait for disgraced pop idol Nicholas Tse to emerge from court. -- AP<br>The man on the ground, Choi Cho Fai, made the better guess - snapping exclusive pictures of pop idol Nicholas Tse emerging from his cell into a prison yard that were then run in the sensationalistic Oriental Daily News.<br><br>His airborne competitor, Ma Tsun Song of the Apple Daily, accepted defeat and soon joined Choi in the bushes to get images of Tse in jail, where the star was held awaiting sentencing in a plot to cover up crashing his Ferrari.<br><br>The small size of Hongkong makes it a virtual fishbowl that is hard for the rich and famous to hide in - and a seemingly endless supply of local entertainers, tycoons and socialites gives the tabloids plenty of tidbits to feed the local appetite for gossip.<br><br>The Hongkong Performing Artists Guild, whose musician and actor members bear the brunt of the aggressive prying, wants to draw the line.<br><br>The guild began a campaign to curb media excesses after a photographer allegedly bashed Tse's head following a court appearance in June.<br><br>The celebrity backlash gained momentum early this month after gossipy Eastweek Magazine ran a photo of a half-naked and visibly distressed star on its cover, saying the shot was taken years ago against the woman's will.<br><br>She was not identified and her face and breasts were obscured, but few here had any trouble guessing who it was.<br><br>'Is this what Hongkong has come to? Just for a few extra cents?' asked a furious Ng Si Yuen, a local movie director, at a news conference.<br><br>Ng was joined by some of Hongkong's best known celebrities, action film legend Jackie Chan and one-time Bond girl, Malaysia-born Michelle Yeoh.<br><br>Some stars wanted people to burn copies of the magazine, but many Hongkongers were buying it instead.<br><br>The celebrities are vague about what they want. But the chairman of the entertainers guild, Anita Mui, one of Hongkong's hottest singers in the 1980s, said she would like to see laws that stop the paparazzi from photographing celebrities on their private property.<br><br>'This goes beyond press freedom,' Mui said. 'I don't think we have special rights, but I think we have human rights.'<br><br>One media analyst said that while Hongkong readers are curious by nature, publications such as Next - the magazine run by flamboyant Apple Daily publisher Jimmy Lai - are fanning the flames.<br><br>'On one hand it's satisfying the market and on the other hand it's creating the market,' said Mr Clement So, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hongkong.<br><br>Others argue that pushy, sensational publications are also a sign of a diverse and healthy press, despite the occasional excesses.<br><br>'Whether you're working on investigation of some pop star or some politician you've suspected of having done something underhanded, it takes an aggressive, resourceful reporter to ferret out those stories,' said Mr Gene Mustain, a Hongkong University journalism professor.<br><br>Two years ago, Apple Daily revealed that Hongkong politician Gary Cheng sold government secrets to a client of his public relations firm, which later put him in jail.<br><br>Critics say muck-raking with a tangible payoff to society is the exception.<br><br>'It only happens once or twice a year,' Mr So said. --AP<br></div>
