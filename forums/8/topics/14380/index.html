More importantly, educated and talented people are needed to manage and effectively plan the use of such equipment.<br><br>Taking a look at Sun Tzu's Art of War, the use of technology today is comparable to the strategy of attacking by fire; without a good strategist, the attack by fire more often than not fails miserably.<br><br>Thus, education plays a very important role.  Furthermore, since it's a military matter, they can't engage foreign talent to join the army; maybe just as consultants.<br><br>In short, a good education system is needed to produce the talents which can propel a strong and advanced army.<br><br>What Dr M is doing now is like installing a porsche engine in the body of a car which has threadless tyres, a corroded body and a cracked windscreen.<br><br>But then again like what you said, there's not enough time so perhaps this is the best of a worst situation?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Imaginary (edited 15 April 2002).]</div>
