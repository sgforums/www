            <div class='col-md body'>Feeling very bad about myself.<br><br>I got into trouble at work today, even though I tried my best to help. Everybody scolded me for it. All I tried to do was to defend them. They said I made everything worse. One even said that I just wanted to take revenge and put people down. I felt so upset that they doubted me that I broke down and cried.<br><br>I don't think I've got a future. My grades are bad. I keep getting into trouble, even though I tried not to. I don't think I'll be able to stay long in this job. And I've been fired from another job because the boss shouted at me everyday and I complained. I can't believe I'm so terrible at everything I do.<br><br>I don't have many friends. I don't have any whom I can cry to. They're all too busy for me. And I know that some people look down on me because I keep getting into stupid scrapes.<br><br>I only have my boyfriend. He thinks I cling too much. He keeps asking me, "Where are your friends? Why aren't you spending time with them?" It always upsets me whenever he says that.<br><br>And I'm very guilty. I've aborted my baby.<br><br>I know you all think I am pathetic. I am. I'm too scared to kill myself. I'm not sure if god can forgive me. And I'm terrified of the pain.<br><br></div>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;and never finding the courage to let the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;person know how you feel.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;only to find out in the end,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;that it was never bound to be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;and you just have to let go.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;When one door of happiness closes,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;another opens but often we look<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;so long at the closed door<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;that we don't see the one<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;which has been opened for us.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;The best kind of friend<br>&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;It's true that we don't know<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;what we've got until we lose it,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;but it's also true that we don't know<br>&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;who makes you smile<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;because only a smile<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;makes a dark day seem bright.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Hope you find that person.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;There are moments in life<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;when you really miss someone<br>&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;cause you have only one life<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;and one chance to do all the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;things you want in life.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;May you have enough happiness<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;to make you sweet,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;enough trials to make you strong,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;enough sorrow to keep you human,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;enough hope to make you happy<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;and enough money to buy me gifts<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Always put yourself in other's shoes.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;If you feel that it hurts you,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;it probably hurts the person, too.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;A careless word may kindle strife,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;a cruel word may wreck a life,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;a timely word may level stress,<br>&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;be perfectly themselves,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;and not to twist them with our own image,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;otherwise, we love only<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;the reflection of ourselves we find in them.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;The happiest of people<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;don't necessarily have the best of everything<br>&gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;those who hurt, those who<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;have searched and those who have tried.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;For only they can appreciate<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;the importance of people<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;who have touched their lives.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Love starts with a smile,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;develops with a kiss and ends with a tear.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;The brightest future<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;will always be based on a forgotten past,<br>&gt;

            <div class='col-md body'>Jan, don't even think of doing something foolish. Life is too precious to waste it just like that. Its easy to blame god or whatsoever when things ain't going well for you. But there is no point engaging in self-pity. You need to pick yourself up, see where you have truly gone wrong and try to make things better from there. Remember, no matter what happens, your boyfriend and your parents are there for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Jan,<br><br>sorry to hear that you had a bad day &amp; generally a bad period of time, but hey get a grip on yourself. life isn't a game where there's a 'replay' button, killing yourself just because your grades aren't good enough, being scolded by your superior or boyfriend, having aborted your baby &amp; feeling miserable, these aren't good reasons enough, in fact they're pathetic. sorry to be harsh but the others treated you with kids' gloves, you don't seem to respond either.<br><br>sure, you've made mistakes, learn from them and avoid making the same mistakes in future, that's part of what life is about, learning from your mistakes so that you can avoid them like the plague, yeah I know that sometimes we make the same mistake again, give yourself another chance but seriously learn from it the second time.<br><br>you probably won't believe me but when this horrible period of your life is over and happier times beckon, you'll be so thankful that you didn't take your own life. if you're in Singapore &amp; feel the need to talk to someone, try calling the Samaritans of Singapore at 1800-221 4444. there're many helplines available but I only remember SOS &amp; thus can only find out this number for you.<br><br>please don't do anything rash &amp; stupid for not only are you hurting yourself, you'll hurt your family most. friends may mourn you for a while but eventually they'll forget for they will have their own lives to lead, but your parents will feel the loss of you most. enemies? they would feel justified in their lousy opinions of you for they'll feel that they were right all along by you ending your own life. why give them that satisfaction, Jan?<br><br>don't know if you've ever heard or read this:<br>the best revenge is to live well<br><br>Buck up, live well and let those who look down on you now turn green with envy. be patient, if you have the will, that day will come.<br><br>please treasure your life for none can do it for you except yourself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jan,<br>the only person who can help you is your own self. Others can give you loads of advices from now till the end of time but those advices will amount to nothing if you are not willing to help yourself.<br>There are so many people who take time and effort to help you by posting messages in this thread and yet you still reject their help. Granted, you thank them but those are only words, Jan. I'm sure they will appreciate action more than mere words.<br>At the moment, you may think that the whole world hate you and look down on you. You may find it scary to go out and face the world each and every day. But you see, all these are YOUR OWN THOUGHTS. You cannot read other people's mind so how do you know what they are thinking about?<br>Jan, you have my sympathy for going through this rough patch in your life but that doesn't mean that I'm going to sit here and listen to you whining about your problems all day long.<br>A good life will not fall from the sky, it has to be earned. So what if you fail? It's not the end of the world, you can always try again. You don't just stay on the floor when you fall down, do you? You get up and continue walking, don't you? Why don't you do the same thing with your life?<br>I got this quote a few years back :<br>"If you think you can, you can but if you think you can't, you're also right"<br>Anyway, killing yourself will only prove that you are indeed a loser.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dear Jan,<br><br>nobody is a loser in GodÂ’s eyes, remember that. i cannot explain why you keep failing in the things you attempt, but itÂ’s no biggie. youÂ’re still young, donÂ’t end your life before God calls you home. possible reasons you fail could be inexperience &amp; not getting enough encouragement. have you noticed that our society [SÂ’porean] isnÂ’t very forgiving on failures, but what the heck, itÂ’s your life, live it the way you want.<br><br>iÂ’ve been pretty blessed but i do have my shares of failures - iÂ’m hopeless at the dating game Â‘coz iÂ’m so very frank &amp; independent. i never stay with a firm long, in fact in all my years of working, i never stay in the same industry for very long - like a rolling stone gathering no moss, so my graduate friends say [iÂ’m a non-grad]. but hey, itÂ’s my life, i want to be happy so i want jobs that iÂ’m interested in.<br><br>when you say good enough, good enough for who? for yourself or your critics? Jan, we have so many critics out there that itÂ’s impossible to please them all, as long as you have tried your best &amp; you still fail, itÂ’s okay, at least you had the guts to try. some people talk &amp; talk &amp; talk about doing stuff but never do &amp; yet thereÂ’re those annoying people who succeed at everything they do, well, they wonÂ’t have the joy of tasting failure. sour grapes here. Jan, failures do build character especially if you can rise above them. donÂ’t let the devil make you believe otherwise, life is previous, treasure it.<br><br>well, i think to find out what youÂ’re good at, try your interests, usually we put more effort into things that interest us. start small &amp; slowly build on your successes. basically, i think you have a low opinion of yourself, could be the bad vibes from your enemies, donÂ’t let them fool you. be strong.<br><br>only too true, you canÂ’t live off your boyfriend forever, i donÂ’t know if you meant live with or live off. anyway, try to be independent, taking small little steps to build up your confidence first, come on you can do it. these are the things youÂ’ve to do for yourself. this is going to sound corny, but itÂ’s written somewhere in the bible that God grieves when one of His creation dies. thereÂ’s always a light at the end of the tunnel if you hang on long enough Jan, there is.<br><br>i canÂ’t say that iÂ’m going to miss you Â‘coz i donÂ’t know you but give yourself &amp; others a chance to find out. by the way, how old are you if you donÂ’t mind me asking.<br><br>the people at SOS are very well trained &amp; helpful, i've called them before many times in wee hours of the morning when i broke off with my boyfriend years ago, they won't look down on you, heck, they would even know who you're. SOS is there to prevent suicide which is what you're thinking now, i wasn't even thinking of killing myself then &amp; they still entertained me by talking to me. by the length of my posts, you can tell how long winded i can be sometimes.<br><br>i can still remember there were times i just wanted to have advice on non boy-girl relationships problems, i still called them &amp; chatted &amp; i only stopped when i felt bad that i may be hogging the line when some genuine person whoÂ’s feeling desparate waiting to get through.<br><br>if you really have no close friends to share your problems with, do give them a call, what have you got to lose? if you lose courage on the first call, cry &amp; stumble in your talk, call them again. Bug them, isnÂ’t it time you bug someone?</div>
