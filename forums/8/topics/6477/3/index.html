            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Jan,<br>have you realised that you seem to be finding things to stress yourself out ? Try to relax as much as possible, and basically, adopt a philosophy, that has been serving me relatively well in life.<br><br>"Quan Dao Qiao Tou, Zhi Ran Zi"<br>Literal Translation. "When the boat reaches the bridge, it will go straight."<br><br>How to apply ? That's the easy part.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Basically, the idea is to live life as <strong>YOU</strong> want it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If you can do it, you can do it, if not, oh well, its just a matter of time before you can do it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (That's what I keep telling myself whenever I screw up, and its true I tell you. You'll get it eventually.) Don't let the circumstances of life (e.g. getting scolded, insulted, undignified, etc etc.) dictate your reaction to life.<br><br>Why ? Because if you do, you're behaving outside of yourself ! Live life as you want it to be ! You don't have to be timid. You want to make friends, expand your social circle, be less dependent on people, be looked upon at work !! Its not like its impossible you know. You never know what you're gonna get, until you've tried.<br><br>Lets put it to the way I live it. I get looked down by my classmates (Well... mainly because I ALWAYS go to school in bermudas and shirt, whereas everyone else wears pants or jeans.), I'm thought of as a slacker, by both lecturers and classmates, because I look as if I'm boh chupz about <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Even my own girlfriend looks up at the sky sometimes, and asks out loud "WHY ??? Of all the people did I choose, did it have to be <strong>HIM</strong> ???" Now that you have an image of what a horrible person I am.....<br><br>Then one day, this lecturer of mine screwed me up in class. Basically, I disliked the way he taught me, and I said so in his face. (Bad move, I know.) He reciprocated the insult by saying that I probably can't catch up with the rest of the class anyway, and that I'm doom to fail, since I'm such a slack. (The conversation didn't really take place like this. I'm adjusting it to a polite level, just in case he reads this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>Well, I pointedly said to his face that I <strong>DISAGREE</strong> with his assumption, and that he's a stuckup, balding old fart to think so, since any idiot who even looks at the assignment answers that I gave him would know that I know my work. I went further on to say that I was disgusted by the fact that he's throwing around his "knowledge" (Extreme sacasm included.) of the subject in my face, when in actual fact, the subject wasn't even 2 semesters old.<br><br>To cut things short, things went downhill from there (Him trying his best to disgrace me in front of my classmates, and with me never giving him a chance to do so.). My classmates were like, "You shouldn't have done that.", and I'm like "So ? He's also a man what. A 45 ++ year old man, with balding hair, and is unmarried, much less have a gf, in my standards, he isn't that much of a man. So what if he has a doctorate ? He's still inferior."<br><br>To put things simply, we hate each other, since I hate his authority, and he hates my audacity, but he can't sack me, since he has no valid reasons to. (He did threaten to bar me from the exams, but I shot back that he has no reason to, and which we both know absolutely well, that I can bring this all the way up to the head, and we'll see WHO gets into trouble.)<br><br>The moral of the story ? Don't take crap if you don't deserve it. Shoot back. Fight dirty if need be. Face and Pride can't feed you, nor can it make you happy.<br><br>Erm.... I've deviated a bit. Sorry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hmm.... I think I'm not making any sense. (As usual.....) So I'll leave it up to here.<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jan, u sounds better but I do notice that the main problem with u is that u hv not find anything "challenging".<br><br>Life is bore at times esp for somebody like u who constraint yrself too much like hving ideas of guys friends makes yr bf unhappy, etc....  It is yr choice n I presume u know what the "payment" is.  It is not fair to expect yr bf to hv yr same mentality.<br><br>I did hv the same problem with my friends when my wife "clings" to me.  Don't blame yr bf.  It is really tiring n requires lot of patience fm him.  I cld understand cos I am in the same shoe.  But it is still a choice.<br><br>Cheer up.  Spend more time in CHIT CHAT.

            <div class='col-md body'>Rulakir, Rinoa, I was that naughty once. Unfortunately, it got me fired from my last job. The boss was a nasty old coop. He shouted at the staff all the time. He changed his mind as many times a day as he went to the toilet. He would order me to do something, change his mind, then scold me for not doing it the way he had just thought of 2 seconds ago. I couldn't take it and asked for a transfer. He insisted on knowing why and kept antagonizing me. I got so pissed I told him that I hated being shouted at and many of his previous staff bad mouthed him to me. Being the insecure person he was, he couldn't take it. He fired me and told all sorts of lies about me to other people. He's an asshole but I also learnt a lesson. If you hate your boss, quit, don't even bother to waste time in that job. I guess I don't have the confidence you guys have. Thanks for the encouragement anyway   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Timothy, it's not only becos of my bf that I dun dare to go out with other guy friends. I'm afriad that the other guys will get the wrong idea too. I once had a guy friend whom I was close to but he had to spoil everything by liking me. Sigh...<br><br>I'll love to come for an outing with you guys, but not as Jan. I don't want more pity. Maybe I'll come under a different nick?<br><br>Colette, I really appreciate your long postings. If there's one thing I do well, it's to get boyfriends   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Just joking. I've never known how to flirt around.<br><br>I don't know what I do well- really! I've only got a stupid beauty pageant title (dragged to participate because everybody else said no), and  a few medals for atheletics (again, I was dragged in at the last minute because nobody wanted to take part). They're flukes, I tell you. I only won because nobody else wanted to participate.<br><br>I wish my parents are there for me more often. My dad is NEVER around because of work. My mum is a protected housewife all her life and is terrible at handling arguments and other types of crisises. My siblings are incredibly self-centred. They think the world owes them a living because they have degrees. My brother and his wife earn about $8-10K a month but they have asked to be exempt from helping my parents pay household allowances because they have to upkeep their executive 5 room flat, brand new car, foreign maid, master degree blah blah blah. I AM EMBARASSED TO BE RELATED TO THEM! My other two siblings are just as bad, I could go on and on.<br><br>Somebody once told me that I expected too much of others and that's why I feel so disappointed with them. I don't know. Do I? Sigh....<br><br>Thanks for sharing your experiences. I could relate to them and it makes me feel better to know that I'm not alone. Right now, I'm smothered under a lot of work. Maybe that's good because I won't have time to feel sorry for myself   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I would also like to thank each and every other person who has encouraged me. Though I didn't mention your names, I appreciate what each and every one of you has done, I really do. I feel a bit better now. Thank you so so much for being there   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Jan (edited 09 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jan:<br><br>I have been reading these posts for sometime and I have been hesistating on replying to your thread...mainly because I know from experience (My work requires me such knowledge) that people who wants to commit suicide seldom tells the whole world about it, and they do not share their failures in public....it take a lot more courage to do that than die. So I thought that since you have the courage and wisdom to post the first post, I figured what you need are just consolation and a channel to let out steam. But I seriously apologise for such thoughts if you find them offensive and provoking. *offers handshake*<br><br>Well, so why am I posting now? simply put, I do not want you to go back into your cave, and just repeat the cycle, and I see that coming. How? Well, I took the cue when you said that you want to change a nick and join in our outings later, I am glad that you have trumiph over your depression, but the problems are not solved as yet. Just a reminder, so by denying yourself and putting the mask back on, you are just going back to where you started, where you hide everything to yourself, like I said it takes immerse courage to tell the world that you are a failure, now rather than throw this courage away, and lose the goodwill and support, of all those who have tried to help you, why not transfer this courage and strenght to solve your problem and face your problems head on? Like Nostradamus said, every life is different( hmmm...nost, did I tell you that?), but there is one common thing about man, and that is we all have problems. By hiding your true self from the truth does not help, but if you are able to face the world as what you are, no problem could defeat you, for you have already won against yourself. Be true to yourself and acknowledge such problems in your life just like the many strong individuals out there, and you will find peace. If you need to look for inspiration on such, go read Willa's Thread "<strong>Emotions (Part 2)</strong>" I am sure that you will fid many people in this forum have problems in life, but we fight them without hiding. I am one of them, and I am glad that another comarade is in our ranks.<br><br>Also, among the forumites, we do not sympathise, we empathise, we share our experinces, if you notice, many of the post in this thread refers to personal experiences, and did it not help you? And who are we to sympathise, when we too have our problems? But bother changing a nick, save that few seconds of thinking about a new nick, to energies for fighting everyday's life. You will find more worth in that. As for the outing, it does not matter if you come or not, but if you do, I would prefer that you come as yourself, for that would be the first step to facing your true self.<br><br>You know what? A thought just cross my mind. I might be writing all these just because I know that you have won a beauty pageant.*laffs* did you ever thought of that? *smiles* But at least I am facing my true self.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 09 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Jan,<br><br>Beware, Callan is one of those buayas I was referring to in my earlier post. And Callan, don't get on your high horse, I don't mean this remark in a malicious way, you've to admit though, you're quite the buaya with your exchanges with lex &amp; tet &amp; whoever else I missed out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Regarding your siblings, your can't change them, so don't expedite so much energy on them, sure it's fun to whine &amp; bitch about them sometimes but they're still our siblings, so you'll have to learn to live &amp; let live. I too have siblings from hell too, believe me everyone has one or two like that except for those annoying people who are more blessed than us.<br><br>Don't be put off by Callan's suggestion that you join their outings using your real nick, if you want to introduce yourself under a new nick, go ahead. I can understand how difficult it will be for you to face all of them when you do meet. However, I have to admit that there's merit to Callan's suggestion, if you introduce yourself as Jan at the outings, you can be your true self &amp; you won't have to pretend. Don't worry, I don't think they will look down on you.<br><br>I'm sure you would know by now that if you want opinions or simply chatting, oops, foruming, just post a topic, surely someone will respond.<br><br>Keep me posted of your progress via this forum or you can email me at colette@excite.com.<br><br>Be happy &amp; God bless.

            <div class='col-md body'>Callan, I appreciate your concern. But I've never been courageous. I was afraid to face life, that's why I wanted to go. But I was also afraid of death, that's why I didn't do anything. Yes, I'm telling my life story but I'm hiding behind a screen. You see, I've always been a coward......<br><br>Yes, I could try to be brave. But I want people to like me because of what I am now, now because of what I was- the Jan who faced up to her mistakes, the Jan who needs sympathy and support. It would build my confidence that I've made friends through my own efforts, rather than to have them come because they know I'm needy. Besides, there are just some things that I've brought up that are too private to share. Some wounds are still raw, i don't want them to be picked at, even if people meant well. Thanks for your concern anyway.<br><br></div>

U feel "proud" of yr beauty, sports achievement but it is nothing to brag off compare to yr siblings' achievment.  Practical world.  I guess yr environment created that.  Watch out.  It is not healthy even though u may know it.  Don't fall for it just to prove yrself.  My family is a "well to do" type except one of my sister.  She is probably worse than u ( Just a production supervisor ).  I cld understand the pressure.<br><br>Write to me timothy_lim@asia1.com if u hv anything personal to share but do not 1 2 do it at CHIT CHAT.  Don't hesitate.  I assure u I will not want to meet up with u.  Just a pesonnal penpal.  ( This is my thought ).<br><br>Take care &amp; don't try to excel in short time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Timothy, I know you are trying to make me feel better and I appreciate it. But to call me a 'beauty queen' is... really weird. I only got runner-up lah. And there are so many Hall Queens/ pageant girls in NTU every year. I'm one of those 'no big deal' types. I hate the way I look- my face is full of angles and planes, not inviting at all. I know... inferiority complex again. Well, it's hard to change overnight. Okie, wait for my mail....</div>

Jan, you are very brave to reveal all those things about yourself. Frankly, I admire your courage.<br><br>So Jan, you had died. And now reborn. Live your life from today onwards as a braver Jan. But don't forget your past mistakes. Cos every mistake you make fine tune you to success. Einstein failed hundreds of times before he finally invented the light bulb. Cos he believed that every failure teaches him the right way to do things and finally he did it right.<br><br>Well, I am one of those weird ones who keep all records of my failures. I have a thick file which keep all the rejection letters from companies etc etc. They are more precious to me than all my beautiful certificates. Cos without them, I won't be the person I am today, they are my source of motivation !<br><br>Your failures are just as important as your successes. Treasure them.<br><br>Don't live in other people's eyes. It's your life. There are always people out there who wants to bring you down. These people are just like some nasty passengers you meet on an MRT, very soon they will alight. And you move on ... to your destination. They are unimportant.<br><br>All the best  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
