            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Colette, Timothy,<br><br>thanks for your concern. I'm feeling a bit better but still a little depressed. Yup, my bf is back. I really really missed that boy. It was bliss for a few minutes.... then he reverted back to his annoying habits. Sigh....<br><br>My buddy who's studying overseas called. That stupid boy never reply e-mail or call for the last 3 months. Was happy to hear from him too. But he says he doesn't want to come back to Singapore.  I'm going to lose him. Sigh.... In a way, I already have. I'm one of the first people he calls as soon as he hits Singapore soil, but I only see him a handful of times a year. I miss having him around to poke fun at me when I'm feeling upset. I appreciate having somebody to laugh WITH about my follies and not to be laughed AT, thank you very much Atti and Bishamon.<br><br>Swamped with work now. Good because I have no time to think or feel sorry for myself. Until the next bust-up that is. All this will come back I know.....</div>

I learnt a thing or two from your postings.<br><br>I'm shocked to know that some people see my life as a soap opera, something to entertain themselves with. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, THIS IS A LIFE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT! Yes, you may be better than others at coping with what fate throws you. But not everybody is as strong as you are. You may not even understand what they are going through because you've never suffered the same things.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there... to serve some sort of purpose, share a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be but when you lock eyes with them, you know that every moment that they will affect your life in some profound way.<br><br>And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, will power or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless.<br><br>The people you meet affect your life. The successes and downfalls that you experience can create who you are, and the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones. If someone hurts you, betrays you or breaks your heart, forgive them because they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart to.<br><br>If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because they are teaching you to love and open your heart and eyes to little things. Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from it everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again.<br><br>Talk to people you have never talked to before, and actually listen. Let yourself fall in love, break free and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have every right to. Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if** you don't believe in yourself**, no one else will believe in you. Create your own life and then go out and live it.<br><br>------------------<br>Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they<br>were<br>to success when they gave up ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Jan<br><br>Hope you are feeling much much better.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Everyone gets down from time to time.  No one, not even Bill Gates, has a smooth pathway in life.  Its the downtime that makes us really treasure the happy times that we have and make them more meaningful.<br><br>Unfortunately, having to climb out of the 'pits' is so difficult.  Self-pity is a temptation that most, if not all, people fall for.  Its so much easier to say "i give up" and let go of everything then to clench your teeth and go on, facing seemingly unsurmountable obstaces.<br><br>This may sounds like a clinche but yes, there are people who are worse off than you.  Loads of people.  However, in our state of unhappiness, we often can't see through the midst and see this fact. We would always believe that we are the sorriest people in the world and all the most unfortunate things are happening to us.  No one is more unlucky than us, ever.<br><br>Do know that however, this is so untrue.  We are all blessed people.  We are physically healthy and we know that we have a place to stay in and food to eat tomorrow.  There are no tubes sticking into our body and we don't have to take our food through them.  We don't puke everytime we eat or get scared that we may bleed to death anytime.  Aren't all these blessings?  People are dying, literally, to have a healthy normal body and we are speaking of suicide here?  C'mon ger, treasure your health!  :p<br><br>Its true (oh, so true) that we encounter obstacles in our lives.  Too bad folks, but thats life. We have a choice everytime we face an obstacle: we can face it squarely, overcome it and continue living, or just let go and die.  Brutal truth, but that's the truth.<br><br>Sometimes, the obstacles in front of us seem impossible to pass.  Probably like what you are feeling right now.  Everything just seems so .... wrong.  Murphy's Law.<br><br>But look, i believe that you can overcome it.  You've admitted your troubles and I'm sure you can face them squarely in the eye and conquer them.  think about this: if little kids with leukaemia can struggle for their lives and face each day with new courage and determination, then you can face your obstacles too.  A few months, or even weeks later, you'll be saying "geez, i was worried about THAT??  whatever was i thinking???"   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>ok, this is a long enough posting now and I think I'd better end this.  Feel free to email me if you ever need to pour out your problems.  I can't help you solve your problems but i can probably help you nudge things into perspective.   :p<br><br>Take care &amp; good luck.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>p/s: This is something I came accross before and i find it makes a lot of sense:<br><br>Don't worry about things which you can do something about.<br><br>Don't worry about things which you can do nothing about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you can also learn these 4 Magic words and apply them into you life ... then success is yours in every sense of the word.<br><br>The 4 Magic Words are : " I CAN DO IT !"<br><br>The only thing that stands between you and what you want from life is simply your will to try it, and the faith to<br>believe that it is possible.<br><br>Your mind will amaze your body.<br><br>You must find the energy and determination to keep going. Keep telling yourself, you can do it, you can do it.<br>When you believe you can do something, you can do it.<br><br>In belief there is power. It opens your eyes, your opportunities become plain, and your vision becomes reality.<br><br>You will succeed when you believe that you can succeed.
