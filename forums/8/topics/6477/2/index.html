            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Jan,<br><br>I think most of the other people have put up all the reasons why you shouldn't go just like that already. But you must recognize that the process of change will not be fast. It didn't take just a few days for your problems to come up, so it cannot take just a few days for it to be solved.<br><br>Personally, I think help lines are good because you actually get to talk. They are really good at what they do. Just to repeat, you will remain anonymous, you don't have to say anything that you don't want, you don't have to talk (you can cry if you want). They offer unconditional help. But talking with somebody will help because from it you might find some perspective that you can't from just shutting yourself off from the world around you.<br><br>Like you said, you feel hopeless. But don't you think thats unfair considering that here is one of the things you can do, and you don't want to try it?<br><br>Hang around a bit longer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh, Colette, where can good English get you? My communication skills sure sucks as hell. I'm too reserved lah.<br><br>I do appreciate everbody for trying to hell. Yes, I may have the warped perspective that I'm a loser. But I can't erase my past failures. Or others' memories of them. It's very upsetting because just yesterday, somebody made fun of me. She was criticising me to her friends and she said it loud enough for me to hear. She said I have no friends and it hurts because it's true.<br>I acted as if I didn't hear it. She's jealous because I have a good relationship with a tutor who many people admire. (I'm studying part time) I have a good relationship with the tutor because I'm living a lie. I tell him industry news that I hear from others, but pretend that I had first-hand experience of. This is how pathetic I am.<br><br>I've called up not so close friends when I had problems before. I remember that the last time I did it, the person wasn't comfortable and she didn't know how to console me. It's a horrible experience I don't want to repeat.<br><br>I do appreciate all the inspirational advice. But I find them too abstract to apply to my life. Failure builds chaarcter but it makes me a person who's insecure about everything. I can't just wake up one morning and decide that I'm a confident person. How in the world do you build it? I've never felt good about myself since I was 12.<br><br>I'm thinking of calling a helpline. I don't think it helps though. I'm terrible at expressing myself emotionally.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Jan (edited 08 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jan, u lack the confidence in u but I'm sure u do hv one.  Probably, u r shy by person but u can really write n express.<br><br>My wife hv the same problem as u.  She narrow too much to me until she lost all her friends.  That may be good in yr opinion but I personnally feels that it is not healthy.  Good thing she quit her job n found more time to spend with her close friends.<br><br>Give up the idea just cos u felt u r a loser.  Socialise more n the sun will come out.  U don't hv to party every Friday night just to enjoy.  Do what u fel like doing.  Eg, reply CHIT CHAT.  It can be fun at times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jan:<br>I dunno how to console u but i would like 2 share with u my own experience.<br>I also tried to commit suicide b4 by swallowing panadols. I went to the pharmacy and bought a pack of panadols and mineral water to swallow those tablets. So I started swallowing one by one...<br>After popping a few in, I started to feel bloated coz I am not good at swallowing tablets so have to drink a few mouthfuls of water to swallow one tablet. At last I stopped at 8, coz i finished all the water (and by then i feel really bloated)!<br>My bf found out and was very angry and he brought me to the clinic. The doctor was very sympathetic but she gave me some carbon to wash away the panadol. (sorry lah my english not good dunno how to say, but in chinese they call it 'xi wei'). And the worst is not over yet...those carbon r larger than panadols and i had to take 10 each time! Gosh and they taste awful!!!<br>Anyway that incident does not make my bf love me more nor lessen our quarrels (luckily we r not together anymore). But I learnt to treasure my live more and I feel that u should feel the same way 2.<br>Anyway 4got to mention that the doctor says I am lucky coz if I swallowed more than 8, she will have to rush me 2 the hospital to do the real 'xi wei' liao. And I heard itz a terrible process!<br>Lastly I hope u would be able to overcome this terrible phase of your life. If u pass this obstacle, no obstacle would be too big in future!<br><br>------------------<br>Nothing is so strong as gentleness, and nothing so gentle as real strength.<br>~Francis De Sales</div>

I'm very touched  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Timothy, I know my relationship with my bf is not healthy but I dun have a choice. I'm too reserved to make new friends. Most of the people I'm friendly with are guys. They're easy to get along with and they're not as demanding or bitchy as some girls I've had the misfortune of befriending before. But I don't go out with them. And they'll probably won't know how to handle a crying girl. And I don't think my bf will like it.<br><br>I should probbaly make more female friends. But I've been bitten by a few betrayals and I'm tired of trying. One was particularly awful; she bad mouthed me so badly to the other colleagues that they avoided me.<br><br>I'm trying to cheer myself up, but my boyfriend is out of country and for once, I don't feel like shopping or watching a movie.<br><br>Don't worry, I'm probably going to call a helpline.

            <div class='col-md body'>Jan,<br><br>Let me share abit of my story.  I've been with my ex- for more than 3 years.  And throughout these years, I've always tried to give her more.  She's not being appreciative and instead, she's been posting her profiles in friend finder sites to flirt around.  I've devoted most of my time on her, so much that I spend &lt;8hrs at home (to sleep).  It has always been a one-way love.  My friends and colleages "abandoned" me, they will always say "he's not free lar, gotta keep girlfriend company" whenever they mention my name.  I did thought of ending my life, since my efforts will never gona pay off.  But I realised that to end one's life is easy, you just jump off, bang, and that's it.  But remember your loved ones must carry on with their life!  Imagine the pain and hurt you would cause them.  I've managed to "pick up" my life, thought I must confess that it was difficult, and there is a certain sense of emptiness in me right now.  But I believe its better to stop a mistake then to fall deeper into it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sorry to hear that, huggable. My bf probably feel this way though I've never flirted around. He thinks I cling. Sigh.... probably I do. I have no other life outside him. I can only count two people as buddies. One is overseas studying. The other has graduated but she's too busy for me. I consider her my best friend but I know she doesn't. Unlike me, she's a very outgoing and popular girl. Sometimes, she takes me for granted. But I don't mind. I don't have anyone else. I have no idea how to start socialising or meet other people.<br><br>My bf is away. It's my chance to be more independent. But I feel more lost and scared than anything else. I try to think positive but it's an uphill struggle. I try not to mind what other people may think of me but I do. Very very much. I yearn for acceptance and admiration because I don't know what they're like. Some guys only talk to me because I'm above average looking. These same people ignore me when I wear my glasses. So we all know what they want, don't we?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I know all of you mean well but you don't have to do anything. I need to let some things out. As you guys know by now, I can write but I can't talk about my emotions.<br><br>Right now, I'm trying to decide what I can do with my life. I don't want to be a writer or reporter. My life is depressing enough, I don't need to go to murder scenes and see bitter court battles every other day. And I know nothing about the arts or money or any other specialty. What else can I do? If you want to help me, please please help me think of something I can do. I'll appreciate that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Jan,<br><br>ItÂ’s great to see that youÂ’re happier today. See? By making the first move in reaching out, thereÂ’re so many strangers here taking the time &amp; effort to help you, life is indeed precious, please treasure it.<br><br>You asked me what good English can get you? My dear girl, lots of things - opportunities denied to those who canÂ’t speak or write well. Your command of it is above average, that would mean youÂ’re pretty intelligent too. So your communication skills sucks huh? Practice is all you need, youÂ’re not too reserved, you managed to have a boyfriend. Me? IÂ’m quite friendly, articulate &amp; average looking (above average with professional help - hahaha ... you know what I mean - Glamour Shots, Cover Looks, etc) &amp; still cannot find a boyfriend, how could you be reserved? Try not to attach too much importance to what others think of you, for me being a Christian, all I care is what God think of me, followed by my family members &amp; closest friends. As for those colleagues &amp; casual acquaintances, ainÂ’t got time for them.<br><br>Jan, if you try to live your life pleasing others, youÂ’ll only make yourself miserable, you owe it to yourself to make yourself happy but of course, you canÂ’t act selfishly if your actions will result in the misery for others. Do you know what I mean? Like now, you think you would feel happy ending your life, just because I wrote that you should think of yourself, it doesnÂ’t mean that you should kill yourself BECAUSE youÂ’ll be making a lot of people brokenhearted &amp; unhappy.<br><br>DonÂ’t be so hard on yourself, try to take life a little easier. If your colleague likes being a bitch, let her, it only reflects badly on her - her insensitivity, her immaturity &amp; her insecurity. So what if you have few friends? All you need are the few friends who truly cares for you. Jan, having lots of friends who abandon you when youÂ’re in trouble would be even more unbearable.<br><br>How do you build self-esteem, well, IÂ’m truly blessed in that I seldom have this problem but I think one way of building it is to do things you like &amp; when you do them well, your confidence level will go up, thatÂ’ll give courage to try more difficult things. Unless you can list for me the things you enjoy doing, I can't offer you any further suggestions.<br><br>This confidence building thing, it doesnÂ’t happen in one or two weeks, it can take months or even years. Loving yourself helps, I find that if you love yourself, you wonÂ’t be so critical of the mistakes you make. For example, because I tend to open my mouth before I think things through, IÂ’ve put my foot in my mouth countless times &amp; IÂ’ll feel really bad about it and when I was younger, I cannot let go of the stupid things I said &amp; did, now as I mellow, I tell myself to take note of the mistakes &amp; try to prevent them in future. Sometimes I make the same mistakes again &amp; again, but I donÂ’t beat myself up over them, I just make another concerted effort to learn from them &amp; not make them yet again.<br><br>Were you always put down by your parents as a child? In one of your posts, you mentioned that your mother had her 3 other children, arenÂ’t they your sisters &amp; brothers? Or are they your step-siblings? Jan, when you were young, you werenÂ’t mature enough to think things through, surely now that youÂ’re older &amp; armed with a good education, you can see that youÂ’re good at the things you do, maybe not everything you attempt but most of them?<br><br>I always believe that people who loves taunting or putting others down are people with huge inferiority complex. I went through a period when I was taunted &amp; put down pretty often just because nothing seems to upset me &amp; I was naturally lucky then. I was very upset by these off-colour remarks, but after a couple of weeks, I decided to ignore them for what good does it do me for me to lose sleep over these petty beings? That got me more taunts, thereby confirming my suspicion about these detractors. I guess I was able to do that because I've a good level of self-esteem.<br><br>Do give the helpline a call, lexelle has given you a wonderful list of helpline numbers, please do yourself a favour - call them. Even if you canÂ’t express yourself well on the phone (but youÂ’re doing good with the written word), the trained counsellors wonÂ’t belittle or make fun of you, sometimes if youÂ’re lucky, youÂ’ll get a gorgeous male voice counselling you.<br><br>As for making friends, take your time, friendships take time &amp; effort to maintain. I hope to read happier postings from you in future.<br></div>
