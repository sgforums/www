            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest allzzz......<br>I was truly distubed by what was going on these two days.  I was trying to do my revisions for my exams when I recieved several phone calls asking me weird questions.  A few of my friends called to ask if they have spoken to me on irc or rather whether that person they saw online was reallie me or not.<br><br>Apparently, someone used my REAL FULL NAME to go online.  Its o.k if that person's REAL FULL NAME happened to be exactly the same as mine.  However, that is not possible because my surname is very unique.  To have exactly the same name as mine is quite not quite possible.  I have also double confirmed that THAT person is reallie out to posed as me intentionally, judging by the things he or she said to my friends.  I will not elaborate on the details.  I have no idea what this person is trying to do.  He or she went to my school's channel too.  Since its a gal's name, surely many men msged this person.  Heard from friends that this person also went into Sgcafe and my channel.<br><br>He or she is hiding in the dark, so God knows how much damage he or she might has done to my reputation.  God knows what this person spoke to other ppl from my school about me.  This person might be<br><br>1) trying to dig out info about me<br>2) trying to dig out info using my name<br>3) out to ruin my reputation by doing toopid things using my name<br><br>I have no idea what this person is up to.  NOT alot of ppl know my REAL FULL NAME, my channel and my phone number (yes...this person knows my number!), the school I go to and the channels I frequent.  I do not wanna bother to 'die die' find out who this person is.  Coz....I am also scared that I will be disappointed when I find out the truth.<br><br>If this person reallie did toopid things while using my name, the worst scenario is some weirdos coming up to me in school to tell me they know who I am.  That'll be not so pleasant.<br><br>TO ALL PPL WHO KNOW ME:<br>Please please watch wat you say to suspicious characters who make you think they are 'me'.  Thank you to those who refused to recite my personal particulars and other stuff to that person in your encounters.  And for those who oredi accidentally said too much about me to this person, I understand your plight and so I will not be angry with you.  Make sure its me next time hor....<br><br>TO THE IMPOSER:<br>I somehow got this feeling that you might get to read this.  I hope you are just feeling bored and just wanna have some fun.  I hope you did not reallie do silly things which are detrimental to my reputation.  Onlie you knows what exactly you wanna get out of this.  If you want information, please try some other orthodox methods.  If you are reallie out to ruin my name, then I have onlie one thing to say to you: "God have mercy on your soul."  If you reallie don't mean any harm, pls come forward and admit to me.  I will understand.........<br><br>Whether you are doing this for good or for bad, I have to tell you that you have definitely succeeded in getting me into bad mood this whole day.  I can't reallie concentrate on my studies coz I am kept thinking of who did I offend recently.  I come to the conclusion that my answer to this question is: "NO! I didn't offend anyone.  I was having exams and I don't even have time to offend ppl." Why wld anyone wanna do this to me for? You have caused me to lose trust in ppl too.  Obviously, I trusted you to let you know my real full name......<br><br>I guess posting here is the onlie thing I can do as I dun who this person.  I can't possibly call everyone to tell them to be careful of who they are tokking to.  This is a warning to all:<br>"Think before you tok to someone you think you know."<br><br>And its also a notice to tell this person to stop using other ppl's REAL FULL NAME.  You better stop unless you want me to conduct a massive search and hunt you down one day.<br><br>Sorrie for making those who don't know me read through all this shit.  But don't you think this serves as a reminder for everyone to think before you put your trust on ppl?  Dun be too cynical though, coz not everyone goes around doing toopid things.  Just be more alert........<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Arghhhh....... meanwhile,<br>*TinDonGal goes back to studee.....*<br><br>[This message has been edited by TinDonGal (edited 30 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If someone is really being that mean and nasty, your best course of action may be to make a log of his actions, and send it to root at his system. You can find out his system by doing a /whois . If you see something like<br><br>jerk is lamer@dyn-25.biteme.com (i am mean)<br><br>he is probably on slip or PPP. In that case, chop off the first bit, and send mail to, in this case, root@biteme.com Basically, if you get an error when trying to send to root@(that person's address), try leaving the part from the character after the @ to the first . out, and sending again. If you get an IP address in the /whois info (something like 213.62.53.127), log it anyway, and talk to your sysadmin about it. You can probably get the guy banned from his IRC server, and then he will have to find a new server. If he does, and starts bugging you again, just report him again. His ISP may even disable his account if you can show them logs.<br><br></div>

TDG mentioned that this evildoer knows much of her particulars. Imagine, my dear friend, ur girlfriend is the intended target. She gets her name and particulars plastered in her school's irc channel as well the channel she frequented. Not only that, the reputation was sullied by the evildoer, inviting mischief from the guys in the net.<br>Big deal?!!?!?!<br>i think not.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

I realise that actually, if this person dare to do this kinda thing to me.  Then, he or she will naturally be doing things to other ppl around too.  Even if I let my matter rest, the rest may not.  So I believe that if this person is still doing other toopid stuff, the bubble will burst.  Others will take their revenge or expose him or her.  Then when the time comes, these revengers will sort of 'screw' that person for me leow.
