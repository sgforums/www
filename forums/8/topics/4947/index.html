            <div class='col-md body'>If I knew the world is going to end in 7 days, I'll probably do the same thing as Enigma. Go make others feel happy, and spend the rest of the time with my loved ones. For once I won't be sad because I know they will be alot of people dying together with me.<br><br>...Sick thought..but yea..whatever.<br><br>And to what DangerGuy said, I rather choose not to believe it because there is still so much to learn and so much to do that I haven't done. But yes, its scary if what you said about the bible is the herbrew from the old testament which consists of 6 chapters or 6 books, mainly the prophecy readings came from the "The Law" which consists of  Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. It is said that when the 7th angel arrives it will blow the 7th trumpet which will cause armageddon, may not be true but the 6th angel as what I read, causes plague and disease. Remeber the pig virus, mad cow, ebola and such?<br>I'm not a christian, these are just information I picked up along the way all these years they may not be true so dont flame me if they aren't</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly guys, I admit I'd be more than a little selfish if I had 7 days left to live.<br><br>First things first, I would go and TELL all the girls I've liked before that I like them and I've always wanted to terll them but never dared to. Believe me so far I have not told a girl I liked her yet...and sometimes the burden of keeping it to yourself is enough to kill....<br><br>Next I'd hope to do stuff I'd never dream of doing if I had more life left to live, like Bungee Jump, Skydive etc....just for the experience.<br><br>Sounds funny ?

I guess it be the same thing if the doctor told you'd have 7 days to live too. The only difference is that when the world ends, everyone else goes. Its a sad thought but you'd never know.<br><br>More over the report I read about US military institutions covering up their Y2K ineffciencies really isn't putting my mind at ease too.<br><br>Imagine if the end of the world was triggered by the a computer bug launching its entire nuclear arsenal?<br><br>Big wipeout man!<br></div>
