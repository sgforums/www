            <div class='col-md body'>by Kway Png<br><br>After US First Lady Laura Bush was honoured by having an orchid named after her, a Singaporean man has taken it upon himself to name a bush after US President George Bush.<br><br>The problem is, itÂ’s his own bush.<br><br>Â“I thought it was a bit the not fair leh, Â“ said the 42 year old man, <strong>Mr. Lum Par Mor </strong>of Bukit Gorblok Street 69. Â“How come his wife get something named after her, and he donÂ’tch have anything? Did PM Goh even give him an orchid shirt or merlion-shaped chocolates? How can like that?Â”<br><br>Mr. Lum admits to a great admiration for Mr. Bush, whom he sees as having a sharper mind than people give him credit for. Â“Look at his foreign policy. Because the 9/11 attacks came out of nowhere, he believes this entitles him to invade everywhere! Lateral thinking, mah! I also admire him for his strength to do what he wants, even when people try to restrict him. The American people dinÂ’ch vote for him, but he still go ahead and run the country. The UN all dinÂ’ch support his Iraq invasion, but he also go and whack. This is the kind of people I admire.Â”<br><br>Mr. Lum did not explain the basis for his admiration, although this became very clear once he received a cellphone call from his mother, to which he responded with a litany of Â“yes, ma,Â” Â“okay, maÂ” and Â“I promise, ma.Â”<br><br>Mr. Lum has now decided to take it upon himself to restore the balance of justice by naming some local piece of horticulture after Dubya.<br><br>Â“I thought for a long while about what might be appropriate,Â” said Mr. Lum. Â“Flowers oreddy taken. So should it be a tree? Or maybe a shrub? Then I hit my forehead with excitement Â– a bush, lah! Arbuthen?Â”<br><br>He then approached the Botanic Gardens and the Parks and Trees Department, but Â“they were all si beh unhelpful one.Â”<br><br>Mrs. Hor Ler Huay, a spokesperson for the Botanic Gardens, explained. Â“The Mokara Laura Bush is a specially-engineered hybrid, with clear examples of biological distinction. ItÂ’s not so simple to do that with shrubs.Â”<br><br>However, Mr. Lum said this was just an excuse. Â“No need to go and make a special bush for him. Why not just choose some bush in the garden and name it after him?Â”<br><br>Mrs. Hor tried to explain why established plants could not be renamed in such a simple fashion, but Mr. Lum stormed off, citing her as an example of the Â“liberal Muslim democratic conspiracy thatÂ’s running the worldÂ”.<br><br>Left with few options, Mr. Lum has decided to rename the one bush in his possession the Â“George WÂ” Bush, or the pubis George Dubyensis.<br><br>Â“In many senses itÂ’s like a real plant,Â” he said, combing its, er, fronds. <strong>Â“With the right handling, its stalk can stand as nice and as tall as an orchid. It also has a distinctive fragrance which attracts insects.Â”</strong><br><br>Mr. Lum says he will be pruning the Â“shrubberyÂ” and also getting rid of Â“the parasitesÂ”.<br><br>Meanwhile, his attempts to present the Â“George WÂ” Bush to officials at the US Embassy have met with failure.<br><br><strong>Â“They think I just want to come over and talk cock,Â” </strong>he sighed.<br><br>TalkingCockÂ’s White House sources have informed us that President Bush has come to hear of Mr. LumÂ’s tribute and is appreciative of the sentiment, although he was also heard to have said, <strong>Â“But it kinda sounds more suitable for Dick Cheney.Â”</strong><br><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.
