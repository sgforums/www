            <div class='col-md body'>true... some choose it because it's noble... so enter nursing because they can't qualify for other courses. But that's not the point. The point is that our nurses are willing to upgrade and upgrade but it doesn't pay. At the end of the day, these nurses still have to bring back money to feed their families.<br><br>Are foreign nurses really friendly? I beg to differ. I have yearly stays in the hospital and I can tell you that our nurses (on a whole) are better. The foreigners might seem more friendly cos we pay them bout 2 to 3x their pay back from where they come from. But this discusssion is not about foreign nurses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it depends on the nature of the job. like my friend who is working in a support function with a high flying fund management. She has a diploma, worked for 6 yrs in about the same environment, in top banks. She is getting $2.5-3k. Will she get $4k? yes, eventually, by her 12th or 13th year, but if she had been a fund manager, she will probably get that in her first year.<br><br>nursing is a professional job -- yes, but if u r working in a hospital, in a team of many many nurses, not likely to get too high a pay, no matter how qualified u r. bcos it is a support function, probably with little supervisory duties. unless she is so specialised, she can strike it out on her own to take care of very rich patients.<br><br>key question to ask for any job is: cost centre or revenue centre? high level of specialisation or low value-add?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it really differs from industry to industry and even within the same industry, job scope difference can also bring about a huge gap in pay.<br><br>i think another factor is also when in that 5~10 yrs the person got her degree. if she got her degree only in the 9th year, then $3~4k is actually pretty reasonable, no?<br><br>not sure about the nursing industry but i thought there's a shortage of nurses - that's why they're bringing in all those philippine/indonesian/etc nurses, no? and that because of this, there's been adjustments done to nurses pay and such? also heard that nurses get paid their school fees retrospectively, which could amount to a substantial sum... .<br><br>like i said, if not happy, change job lo...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
