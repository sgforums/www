How did he prepare for such a life? Where did his inspiration come from? What has he been doing since 1827? How important was his contribution to the development of western musical tradition?  <br> <br>Hilarion: This being of course, has been very important; breaking with old traditions, bringing in new possibilities, but most importantly, connecting strongly at the emotional body level in a way that had not been done before, and is continuing to be done even now.  <br> <br>Now some might think that this being has reincarnated as a musician, but this is actually not the case. Many times when a being goes through many levels of evolution, coming to a pinnacle, or a manifestation in which a very high and important energy has then been known to the soul, it has learned enough from that path. It starts then on a new path, on one investigating in this case, the opportunity for healing.  <br> <br>In this way, this individual has incarnated a few times, looking into areas of the human ear, working eventually in areas of the healing capacity of a physician, a doctor, and then manifesting as a little child now, who will grow eventually into a healer using hands on healing; using more esoteric and subtler methods.  <br> <br>This sequence of lifetimes, because of the tremendous power of this soul, will probably end with the manifestation of powerful healing energies that will have a profound effect on planet Earth. Be teachable, utilizable, and will of course be those which can connect easily with sound, music, and other areas, because that is the other thing that also happens.  <br> <br>As the soul moves through these levels of development, towards that pinnacle lifetime it inevitably connects with many other attributes. Part of the whole idea of drawing in from the karmic level the aspect of losing one's hearing, particularly later in life, was at the positive level to concentrate on the inner music. But, also for the purpose of destroying much in the way of karma; getting rid of some of the aspects that were plaguing and difficult, burning them up so to speak.  <br> <br>This was specifically for Beethoven around the judgments that he made in a much earlier lifetime on other people that were spoken out loud, that were seen as very harmful and difficult and these could then be cleansed and cleared from his soul. Understanding these matters is important but when you understand them in an inner way you begin to see them in a little different way; how you are the one choosing these life patterns. How you can welcome and know these energies.  <br> <br>In many ways, the great shift in music to that which would encompass the emotional body might be very powerfully connecting many emotions, in one musical piece is a tradition that has been carried on in more modern music. This however, seems to have been far less and less the case with what is termed classical musical forms; those moving not so much into the emotional area, as to those experimenting with unusual patterns and new tonalities, and new energies. This has its place of course, but in the sense of Beethoven's soul, how it has continued to influence and work with the energies in music, this would seem more to be in modern music with that which would very strongly generate emotion.  <br> <br>However, those energies of his soul that do not manifest in the physical, generally about a tenth of you manifests at the physical level and the other ninety percent is available to assist on many levels. These energies continue now in a new area of music. Influencing the powerful ways in which emotion can be of a positive and helpful, uplifting nature through the words and the music simultaneously.  <br> <br>There are many names for this sort of music, positive music or new thought music and other names. This will emerge more as a genre in the future, and we can see Beethoven's influence here, not so much in the specific arenas, as to the specific words, and the specific tunes, but the general influence that this would be a continuing awakening for humanity.</p></div>
