            <div class='col-md body'>I believe this guy really like the gal hence he went the extra mile to help her....and i believe such a story too because in overseas, sometimes as a student, you cannot afford a car or maybe do not know how to drive.  Another thing, in other countries, travelling just to town can take you up to a few hours. Not like singapore...take MRT can reach orchard in half an hour.  Some countries also very ulu, hence when you travel you can have difficulty moving around.</div>

I mean you don't really know the gal,even if she's very pretty,will you do such things for someone you just got to know recently? So asking for handphone numbers will still have to come first...Agree?</div>
