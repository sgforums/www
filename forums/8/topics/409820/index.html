              <p>I realized that sometimes I can speak confidently with people, about 10% of the time only, and is usually 1 to 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of the time, I cannot connect with topics people talk, particularly in group and I feel abit awkward in group also because there is a pressure to speak and not be seen as overly quiet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hmm.... i wonder how should i see my problem. What about you guys?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think that the reason why I am quiet and feel awkward is because I do not dare to present my true beliefs. say what i really believe. That is why I am quiet. To be more chatty, i need to just say what i really think so, but of course run the daanger of offending people.</p>

              <p>You can look at it 2 ways....</p>
              <p>the 10% are precious words......you only say what needs to be said.  90% garbage.</p>
              <p>The other aspect is that you need to learn how to articulate the 10% and make it 90% respondents.</p>
              <p>So when you attend social function....observe how people interact. How they reach out, facial expression, verbal response. Hand gesture.....</p>
              <p>Go home Than visualize yourself practice......</p>
              <p>Read topics of social discussion such as current gossip news, special interest such as sport,</p>
              <p>Got that.....</p>

              <p>ha....sorry....</p>
              <p>why don't you start off by attending social gathering with folks that you know you share common interest such as travel,...movies, gossip....whatever books.... politics.</p>
              <p>The key is not to be negative.....you don't have to say yes....agree all the way. but it must be positive and friendly.</p>
              <p>Stay Focus in the conversation focus your eyes contact .  since it is your topics of interest you must have an opinon and understanding of the subject point of entry would be easier...start from there and move to stranger and listen and talk about it.</p>
              <p>this is particularly good if you are in networking session.</p>

              <p>Hey January,</p>
              <p>Don't think you should be too bothered about what people think as in thinking that way, you'll only make your life miserable... you can't please the crowd all the time.</p>
              <p>Being shy isn't an issue... realising that you're shy is the first step forward and work on being more open is the next step...</p>
              <p>Be yourself most of the time (why only "most" is that in formal social events you aren't expected to be overly "open")... don't stress out.</p>
              <p>I used to be quite shy as well but my job required me to give talks and lectures and that forced me break out of the shy mold... after a while, you'll realise that talking with others isn't a big deal as long as you're yourself... pretending to act confident and being someone you're not will only exhaust you.</p>
              <p>Everyone's different, being a little shy and introverted isn't a flaw and can be an asset as you're probably a much better listener than many others who talk too much.</p>

              <p>I realized that sometimes I can speak confidently with people,
              about 10% of the time only, and is usually 1 to 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of the time, I cannot connect with topics people talk,
              particularly in group and I feel abit awkward in group also because
              there is a pressure to speak and not be seen as overly quiet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hmm.... i wonder how should i see my problem. What about you
              guys?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think that the reason why I am quiet and feel awkward is
              because I do not dare to present my true beliefs. say what i really
              believe. That is why I am quiet. To be more chatty, i need to just
              say what i really think so, but of course run the daanger of
              offending people.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the replies.</p>
              <p>I am abit curious, why is that there is 2 me. the 10% more confident me , can talk and joke creatively.</p>
              <p>but 90% me, just could not do it, is like a different personality. For me is mostly depends on who I am with. As time passes, the habit in both cases persist so it sort of become more and more distinct.</p>
              <p>I think I feel stress when I am quiet in social setting because My inner conscious is asking me to open up and realize my conscious thinking is cork up. THat is why i experience the stress. It like the 2 of them are pushing each other.</p>

              <p>not being able to speak your mind means there is fear ... of appearing stupid, of saying wrong thing, etc.  so you need to become more fearless.  however becoming fearless is a maturity and growth of character through experience which helps you drop the illusion that people are so scary and powerful that we don't dare to offend them.  you see, everyone is about the same. probably, other people are also afraid of how you look at them so everyone is just as scared of everyone else.</p>
              <p>when this truth sinks inside you, you will become more fearless hence speaking your mind will be less of a problem</p>
