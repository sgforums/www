In no where in the bible it says the LORD created other human beings other than Adam and Eve. Also not forgetting they used to live  hundreds of years and as recorded in Genesis out of Adam and Eve there were other children that sprung forth. It is not impossible that one of these descentants or groups of them might be the cause of Cain's fear. Also Romans 5 recorded that thru Adam, the first man, sin came and all of died but thru Jesus the last adam, we received salvation. It has in other portions of Roman said pretty clearly descendants of Adam will receive salvation thru acceptance Christ. It also means if other humans are created which you have assumed, salvation for their descendants cannot be attained for them.<br><br>[This message has been edited by rubberduckie (edited 08 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by rubberduckie (edited 08 February 2002).]</div></blockquote>duckie,<br>the first, need not mean the only.<br>adam was the first, and VERY representative.<br>note that adam and eve only had cain and abel in the point of time when cain expressed his fear of other men.<br>seth was the third born.<br>note Cain's wife was in the land of Nod, he had to wander there to find his wife.<br>adam and eve were together, their family didnt live in NOD!!!!<br>just some points for u to think abt.</div>
