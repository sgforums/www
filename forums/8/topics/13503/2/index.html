            <div class='col-md body'>That God created other man is simply your own assumption based on the theory of Cain's fear. In no where in the bible it says the LORD created other human beings other than Adam and Eve. Also not forgetting they used to live  hundreds of years and as recorded in Genesis out of Adam and Eve there were other children that sprung forth. It is not impossible that one of these descentants or groups of them might be the cause of Cain's fear. Also Romans 5 recorded that thru Adam, the first man, sin came and all of died but thru Jesus the last adam, we received salvation. It has in other portions of Roman said pretty clearly descendants of Adam will receive salvation thru acceptance Christ. It also means if other humans are created which you have assumed, salvation for their descendants cannot be attained for them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fishersprice:</div><div class="quote_body"> adam and eve were the first to be made on the sixth day.<br>but there DEFINITELY were others made as well, before God rested on the seventh day.<br>adam and eve were the first, and the leaders.<br>becos in Genesis 4:14, Cain (after killing Abel and being banished by God) says "Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."<br>Now Cain's fear would be unjustified if no one else existed on earth.<br>but he is afraid of being killed by others, becos God DID MAKE other men and women on the sixth day!<br><br>And in Noah's Flood, Genesis 7:23, it says: "Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; men and animals and the creatures that move along the groun and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left and those with him in the ark."<br>WHO WAS IN THE ARK?<br>Genesis 6:18:<br>"I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark, - you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.."</div></blockquote>[This message has been edited by rubberduckie (edited 08 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by rubberduckie (edited 08 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. I'm new here so pardon me if I offend any of you. I just want to say that, since this is a singapore forum, what happened to the lessons about respect for each other's religions?<br><br>One should not condemn another religion. You know what sort of christians I admire and abhor? I admire those christians who believe in their faith, and yet knows when and where to talk about them. I look down on those who force their opinions on others, thinking themselves more superior because to them, they have found a way to eternal paradise.<br><br>I'm a buddhist and I like my religion cos it doesn't require me to convert everyone I meet in my path. It is more a teaching on life's shoulds and should-nots. I believe everyone should have a choice on which God they want to believe and follow. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.</div>
