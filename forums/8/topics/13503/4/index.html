            <div class='col-md body'>Son, there is only one universal truth. All are destined to die. I don't know if the Christian God is true, given the prophesy spoken and fulfilled, the statistical impossibilities to happen by chance, I have reservation calling him a dog. And your act is childish and you are simply lack of wisdom. If you are a free thinker you are a sucker. You believe in yourself, you are a sucker. Who are you to stop a 100 kmh car running against you? Your mere mortal body splash like spider under this impact. May your Designer/ Artistic Painter paint you a full red Chinese New Year.<br><br>Now son, your days are numbered, just as mine. Beware of the consequences that you have blespheme against someone's God whom you and I have no idea about. If one day, you have to face up with your Maker, please remember to repeat these to him. You die never mind. But beware the curses of a thousands generations upon your family line! And curses are real for blesphemy!<br><br>You think is fun... then continue to have fun. Indeed you have just written your own destiny.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Wes Brown:</div><div class="quote_body">There must be a DOG<br>Bcos the Big Bang and evolution cannot possible have created the intricate design of human bodies and of this world for example.<br>Look at the way veins are constructed and mapped out throughout the body and the nerves as well.<br>Some design.<br>A Designer must exist.<br>Dog must exist.<br>And there must be but only One DOG,<br>Becos otherwise, there will be war in the heavens.<br>A multitude of dogs cannot be a possibility becos such a system cannot function without one supreme, sovereign dog.<br>And if dogs were subjected to one another, then they wouldnt be dogs at all by definition.<br>So there is but ONE DOG.<br><br>Now this one Dog, MUST be the Christian Dog.<br>Becos theologically, as someone said before, there are but two groups of religions in this world.<br>One that purports that salvation can come from works. And another group that states that salvation can only come from Dog;s grace.<br>There is but one religion in the second group, and everything else does indeed, fall into the first group that believes in works.<br>The one religion that is different is Christianity.<br><br>As it is said, "There is but One Dog.<br>And Jesus Christ is the Son of Dog."<br><br>AMEN.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
