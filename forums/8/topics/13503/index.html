            <div class='col-md body'>fisherprice, i think the way you post about God here you are making people hate christians more.<br>instead of solving problems, you are more likely to stir-up conflicts.  Not that you are wrong, but you can't just force people to accept things that they persistently reject.<br>i think you have done enough already and it's time for you to stop all these.<br>Should preach those who wants to hear and not those who persistently harden his heart.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 07 February 2002).]</div>
