He's the one who has to decide all of this in the end and i'm just glad it's not me, you know?<br>read Romans 3. it talks about this somewhat... my guess is that people get judged by what they know, so... i don't know. is God so strict that a child, an unbaptised child, will be denied a place in heaven? i can't answer that, i'm not God. it might have to depend on why they're not baptised and what baptism specifically is. some churches baptise their children soon after they're born, so it becomes more like the decision of the parent than the child. define the baptism you talk about? the decision of the person who gets baptised to get baptised, or the decision of authority figures in a child's life?</div></blockquote>Hi Nony, are you saying that the Original Sin does not apply to everyone?</div>
