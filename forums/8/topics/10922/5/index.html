It irritates me a lot a lot, as if I dun have a bible or I never read it before.<br><br>Yes, read ur own bible, it's good for u. But keep it to yourself. The Bible is holy, thus, dun anyhow blurt it out as if you are talking about the weather. Are u sure you interprete the Word correctly? Are u trying to show off that u know a lot? Are u trying to show how godly a person u are? Are u trying to show u are important in God's eye?<br>Then why anyhow suka suka throw Bible verses at people? Use the Word only to edify and not manipulate it for own's purpose.<br><br>Somemore, whoever tells me to memorise bible verses will gonna drive me crazy!<br><br>Sherv:<br><br>back to u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I've some friendly advice if u want to buy a Bible.<br><br>There's so many kind of Bible that u be at a lost at which one to buy. Ranging from reading bible(telephone book size) to pocket size ones. Choose one that fits ur budget and use. (cheapest-$17 more ex are those leather-bound type)<br><br>And there's also NIV, KJV etc. versions of Bible. Most people I know have NIV- New International Version.<br>But GN - Good News is easier to read.<br>Browse and see which one u prefer.<br><br>As for me, because I carry ard mine often, so I got a small size version, the paper used are so thin that I've to be extra careful while flipping.<br><br>If u just one for reading, then I recommend u get the medium size version. Less strain on ur eyes, and less expensive than those thin-paper Bible. The that cost $17 is good enuf.<br><br>A little bit of advertisement...

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by watashimakemashitawa:</div><div class="quote_body">An atheist claims to know that there is no God, but not claim that religion is Â‘createdÂ’ by man</div></blockquote>Hey, as an atheist, I deny the existence of god. It is only logical that I reason religion to be a creation of man. After all, if I deny god, then who created religion?? ahhh.... simple common sense, u see.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Miracles - what r they? Aren't they events that just so happen to be rare and coincidentally able to influence some outcome drastically?<br><br>I tell you what they are - they are extremely low probability events that just happened! And there are so many things that humans do not, or are unable to, comprehend. When those things happen, you say miracles have occured. Really?<br><br>A person recovers from cancer, a HIV-positive man lives for 20 years and still goes strong, an asteroid hasn't hit the Earth, a pilot plunges 20,000 ft into snow and doesn't die, a person becomes the sole survivor of a plane crash, a boy falls down 10 storeys with minor scratches, etc, etc<br><br>Miracles? Only because they don't happen everyday. Do you consider your birth a miracle? Considering that you are 1 out of 64 billion possible combination from the fusion of your parent's DNA. Or maybe you striking the S$10million toto. Why aren't these miracles? Because you don't feel that they have any special significance! Miracles? It is just as miraculous that there had been no periods in the history of man without such 'miracles'.<br><br>So you choose to say that miracles happened because of god. I say that is one of the lamest explanation around! "God" is not the answer to everything!!! Start thinking, and get a grip on yourself! Stop running away from reality.<br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 29 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>chch:<br>Congrats on being posting the 100th post!<br><br>Well, agree totally with your first few paragraph... EXACTLY !!! I have frens who like to sustain a conversation by quoting verses from the bible... basically, i dun bother about them when they do this... but it's really irritating... I'm not exactly farmiliar with the bible, 'cos my bible education is limited to the sessions that I heard during assemblies when I was in primary school...<br><br>I dun like it when people quote verses because it feels as if they are challenging you to quote something more powerful to slash back at them, and if you can't, they make you feel as if you dunno your bible well enough, not as pious as them.<br><br>As for the bible, I dun think I will bring it around... me not taking exam for believing in God... and when I want to seek solace, I rather listen to music... I'm just thinking of getting it for light reading... Can still remember the time when various teachers in my school tell us stories about David, Jonathon,  Joseph, etc... such farmiliar feelings...<br><br>But, I dun think I would dare to walk into those Life bookstore alone... too intimidating... frankly speaking, it puts me off and make me feel unwelcome... Yeah... I wouldn't know what kind of bible to get... I tried borrowing one from my primary school library, but I can't remember if i borrowed the correct one... If I get one, prob be a medium-size one, like what you recommended...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am amazed at how chain mails get propagated so rapidly over the internet. All the chain-mails start with a story: of this so &amp; so who struck lottery and the next so &amp; so found a gold nugget under the bed, and the next so &amp; so found a good man and got married. (U can write ur wish list here) All of them did the same thing, that is to send this chain mail to at least 10 person. But of cos the more the merrier.<br><br>The tone of the mail change abruptly. This so &amp; so got knock down and pinned under a 10ton truck. The very next so &amp; so's father got lung cancer and died painfully.( U can write the composition " The day when everything went wrong" here) Why? Because they decided to delete the chain mail.<br><br>They end with the line:<br><br><strong>The choice is yours.</strong><br><br>Yup, obviously the choice is yours. But if you choose not to send, will the imminent misfortunes harbour in your mind? So shaken by the misfortunes that in the end, like most people, u send them out anyway. Dun send die, send get good things. Is this a choice? A Hobson's choice.<br><br>I believe chain mail is an intelligent way to capture the hearts and minds of people. I see social engineering skill at it's very best.<br><br>We fear the unknown. We fear Fear. If someone claim that if u do a simple thing and u be freed from all the fearful consequences, they will do it. Somemore, u get rewarded for it. Good deal eh?<br><br>Well... think again. Is this scenario played in a larger scale elsewhere?<br><br>iori :<br>wake up ur idea! I am a GUY!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>u have a lot of questions. But I hope u will pick up "conversation" book. Will give u  insights on creation of the universe.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>sherv:<br>hai... still can't get over the shock that someone fall in love with me with just those alphabets I type in here.<br><br>I am learning to type programming language... maybe computers will start to fall in love with me   :p Hope a blue Imac will soon knock on my door.<br><br>old testaments: Judaism/Islam<br><br>old+new testaments: all denomination of Christianity<br><br>Old testaments dated abt 4000 BC(i'm not very sure)<br><br>New testaments are written after the birth of Jesus. Contains the stories of Jesus( Matthew, John, Luke etc). That who Christianity is based on - Christ Jesus.<br><br>The NIV, KJV are different translation. The original is written in Hebrew &amp; Greek. They get translated in many languages and version<br>for different readers. Accounting for the wide range of Bible. Basically they are all the same.<br><br>--<br>God love you.<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 30 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I read the Bible, esp the old testaments, i found quite a lot of things not applicable to our present day.I've keep in mind that the old testaments were written some thousands of years ago. What apply then, may not apply to us now. Why can't we use a simple gift that God has given to us --discernment.<br><br>And does the validity of Adam and Eve, or the Noah Ark has any consequential effect on us human today? Does proving the existence of Noah Ark gonna help the destitudes around the world? Is the on-going heated debate of the validity of the Bible a show of love? All these are the crazy things that people do. Instead od trying to bring peace to the world, they use the Bible to create more argument.<br><br>so what if other people dun believe, so be it. why need to force ideas into them?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Those who truly understand what the Bible is all about will not talk about it. For they have understand what it's all about. They've processed not the words, but the true meaning behind them.<br><br>It's those who think they understand it fully, then they start to discuss openly. It's revolting to me. And they start to say God is an angry and jealous God. ya... and makes me feel so sick.<br><br>When asked why u believe in something which has no logic, they will say, because we are God's creation, we will never understand what's in God's mind. Then who created Logic? Everything is created bt God. Why can't they use a little bit of their brain to discern. Are'nt u bemused by some who just bilindy follow what the Bible says.<br><br>Din they Bible says those who have stolen should amputate their hands. Those who's eyes have lust should gorged out ur eyes. Well, go ahead. Why are so many Bible believing people standing with arms and eyes?<br><br>All these are hyperboles word. Dun take them literally!! Read the Bible with an open and inquiring mind. If in doubt ask someone who can help. Ever heard blind leads the blind, both fall into the ditch? yah...that I believe is happening.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>{Hey, as an atheist, I deny the existence of god. It is only logical that I reason religion to be a creation of man. After all, if I deny god, then who created religion?? ahhh.... simple common sense, u see. }<br><br>I already mentioned why God exists. So if God exists, by default, it becomes unnecessary to question the validity of religion in that context. ItÂ’s common sense, like you said.<br><br>{Miracles - what r they? Aren't they events that just so happen to be rare and coincidentally able to influence some outcome drastically?<br>I tell you what they are - they are extremely low probability events that just happened! And there are so many things that humans do not, or are unable to, comprehend. When those things happen, you say miracles have occured. Really?<br>A person recovers from cancer, a HIV-positive man lives for 20 years and still goes strong, an asteroid hasn't hit the Earth, a pilot plunges 20,000 ft into snow and doesn't die, a person becomes the sole survivor of a plane crash, a boy falls down 10 storeys with minor scratches, etc, etc}<br><br>Fire consumes when it burns, pregnancy only happens when male sperm unite with the female ova, and the dead stay dead. All these all obey natural laws and can be explained by natural forces. Natural laws are understood to be the normal, the regular way the world operates. But a miracle occurs as an unusual, irregular, and specific act of God. This does not mean miracles are violations of natural law or even opposed to them. Miracles donÂ’t violate the regular laws of cause and effect, they simply have a cause that transcends nature.<br>Natural laws donÂ’t tell us what must happen, but only describe what usually does happen. They are statistical probabilities, not unchangeable facts.<br><br>{Miracles? Only because they don't happen everyday. Do you consider your birth a miracle? Considering that you are 1 out of 64 billion possible combination from the fusion of your parent's DNA. Or maybe you striking the S$10million toto. Why aren't these miracles? Because you don't feel that they have any special significance! Miracles? It is just as miraculous that there had been no periods in the history of man without such 'miracles'.}<br><br>We donÂ’t deny supernormal events (not the same as supernatural) that take place, but we deny that they fit the definition of a miracle. Three basic elements of a miracle: power, sign, and wonder. The power of miracles comes from a God who is beyond the universe. The nature of miracles is that they are wonders, which inspire awe in those who see them, because they are astonishing. Â‘SignÂ’ tell us the purpose of miracles: they confirm GodÂ’s message and His messenger. Morally, because God is good, miracles only produce and/ or promote good. Miracles are never performed for entertainment, but have the distinct purpose of glorifying God and directing men to Him.<br><br>Miracles belong to the class of events with an intelligent cause. God doesnÂ’t intervene just to play around and confuse us. He has a purpose and communicates something with each miracle. So when an event occurs which is purposeful, the scientific method tells us not to look for natural causes, but for an intelligent cause.<br><br>{Stop running away from reality.}<br><br>Well, creation is the greatest miracle.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everybody ,<br>i am new here , just cant resist replying to this subject becoz its so close to heart.<br>yeah i am a christian but not formally baptised yet.<br>i went thru all the little little doubts u experienced , chch.<br>all these started with my search for god in yr 2 uni. or maybe its god who came to look for me. one of those so called cult grp approached me on the road and started talking. soon i was hooked. but their hardliner approach - Christ is the only way blah blah plus their social activities tat excludes non christians ( u know  u have to be a christian if u wanna join their grp for sports etc etc ) really puts me off.<br>on old JC fren intro me to another church - traditional anglican one where everyone is close to another.it was comfy like close frens but then i felt the grp existed because of frenship not god. couldnt sense holy spirit there and CG was quite sad. i felt they has many burdens but god din seem to answer them. WHY? Guess it was too regimented to allow spontaneous flow of His ways. they had review sessions on how to make CG better but when i told them to control less and let it all flow, they simply cannot accept it. all attendance is marked, including sunday service for 3 mths b4 u are accepted into e church. Its the HEART that matters not these petty admin work<br>to tell who is walking with god or not. In the CG i could sense who is backsliding by the way they worship, the desire isnt there but they have to come for attendance which makes it so routine u know , like its sat , lets go n sing blah blah end.<br>what made it worse was my fren who is really into Jesus. at that time i was really down and in need of help.  i asked her for more guidance and she offered to start new life kit for me. Soon she repeatedly reminded me to take a stand and join in ( previously i was on visitor status) otherwise she is not gonna care anymore abt me because she has to take care of other new converts.<br>There i was , in pain and desperately seeking advice , God  so much that i couldnt wait for each New life Kit session to start.<br>Maybe she was afraid or too busy<br>Disillusioned, i went to another church in east coast and really felt attached thereby god's spririt . the funny thing is i can sense God working down there.  there are too many coincidences to happen since i was there for 1 yr.<br>1stly  we had a worship session @ marina city park. sitting in the open air , singing workshiping when suddenly one pointed to the sky . its dark but there was a kind of halo forming directly above us , like a lighted circle ,corresponding with our position. we felt so reverent and serene....<br>2nd - He always seems to bring pple to me . one night i prayed hard on my problems and the next morning, an old contact called me and offered me a job. Praise God!<br><br>i havent been down for youth service for a long long time due to some reason. all this while He has been calling me to come thru the many little events. Although i dun have a close relationship with many pple in the church, still its God that pulls me there.<br><br>after  reading all the idealogy blah blah ( oh yes i read the conversation bk - my ex cell ldr said its new age , dun touch it,)<br>all i shall say is - just focus on understanding him and HE will make ur paths straight. all the questions on blah blah - just leave it to HIM .  we cant control other pple's attitude , only ours so i try to love HIM and my neighbour.<br>As for my Jc fren, her walk with god has been a struggle. pray that she will understad e peace and joy of the Holy spirit.<br></div>
