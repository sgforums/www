            <div class='col-md body'>Well, quite easy to guess from my nick... me gal...<br><br>Okay, the previous posting is quite crappy...<br><br>I respect God too... whoever he is, I know he's there to watch over all of us... sometime he is simply too busy to show personal attention to all of us... so we must watch out for ourselves also...<br><br>Now, I have a friend who is touring Egypt and later going to Isreal for student exchange... I'm very worried about him, and so I have decided to pray to God everyday and ask God to watch over him and keep him safe... And I intend to pray everyday for the safety of my fren until he returns safely to Singapore abt 7 mths later. What makes me want to pray to God everyday? I'm not a Christian or Catholic or whatever... I'm a Buddhist by birth and my fren is a catholic. But in a way, this is an act of faith... that's what I think...<br><br>As a human, I try to behave by what I think is acceptable to God. I do make mistakes, but  I'm sure that God will forgive me for any mistakes that I make, but I'll try not to make too many...<br><br>what am I typing?

I get very irritated when I'm waylaid by Christians trying to spread their belief. Hey! Other religions dun do that so openly! Do you really seriously think  getting someone to come to church is the path to salvation? There's still a thing call "respect"... respect for other culture, other religion, other races,etc...<br><br>chch:<br>I really like this song by Frank Sinatra "My Way"... I have no idea why I have this thought, but I want to play it at my funeral,  that is, if I live to a ripe old age. To live my life the way I want it, not having many regrets and any guilty conscious...<br><br>Sometimes in life, you will be faced with many difficulties. Having frens who are christians who are very devoted, I can slightly understand your confusion... just do the thing which you think God will smile at  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>What I feel about the whole issue regarding religions and their beliefs is nothing but a whole bunch of crap.<br><br>Basically, religion like christianity, eg chrismatic church, are becoming more like cult and thus are imposing ridiculous ideas into the minds of their members, especially those innocent youths. Example, like a chrismatic church near lion city hotel(If you know what I mean).<br><br>For example, if the members don't meet the amount of money required by the pastor for the donation of church funds (they are moving to a new church), then the pastor will typically say that he is disappointed with them and will speak loads of rubbish to make them feel gulity, eg like not glorifying God's name, and so on. Not only that, the different groups of members, adults and youths are required to meet certain amount per month. Worst till, this church funds not only last for one period (one period is a few months), there are second, third period for the church funds donation. Besides this church funds, there are others offerings for church services and cell groups. Though they don't force you to donate, but the people there are damn good in persuading you in donating willingly, as their key to success is the ulimate word, SIN and "Sow and you will Harvest"!<br><br>And there is this issue of "Second Coming of God", this is a whole bunch of crap. Do you think that God will come back. How can you be so sure that he really resurrected?! Personally, I don't believe in all this crap.<br>Even if you can find Jesus Christ's body, all those fundalmentalist christians will object to it. They will deny that the body belongs to Jesus Christ. Reason being that if they do not deny, then the whole primary issue about christianity will ease to exist and the whole religion will collapse!<br><br>Even if we know the possible locations of the body, we will be deny by the country authorities as this will lead to political and religion unrest and conflict in that country.<br><br>As for the church that I mention above in Singapore, the pastor once said that Jesus Christ will probably return in 2028 AD. This is a bunch of bull shit! By that time, he will say that GOD will return in later time!? Bull Shit!<br><br>Basically, their ideology is based on whatever is with God is good, and whatever that is not with God is SATAN! What a stupid ideology?!<br><br>Damn, I hate those christians, hope they will be wiped for the surface of this earth one day!<br><br>Ever though, that the calender is based on the birth of Jesus Christ...it does not mean that Christianity is the ultimate religion and the truth! For it is during the industial revolution in the 18th century, that the western countries wrestled for control of the asia/africa countries as colonies that in the end, all (most)countries abide to the geogarian calender.<br><br>As we entered the 3rd millennium(or whatever), I forseen that as science and technology advances, the future religion will be based on ethic rather than faith, whether we like it or not. There will be genetic engineered humans for the benefit of human race, and we can them proclaim ourselves as "GODS" of the new millennium.<br><br>And if we are to create hybrids beings. Then our creations will proclaim us as "GODS".<br><br>This in turn will lead you to think.... are we,humans, created the same way!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ande Tan (edited 18 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>shervon:<br><br>ok, I'm back, using my lunch time in sch comp lab to write in here.<br><br>lemme quote an example that happen just yesterday during my cell group. I dun care whoever is going to read this...<br><br>During the cell meeting (for those who dun know it's a small gathering for christians)<br>my cell leader was repeating what the pastors<br>had told us. That yr 2001 is a year of harvest(of non-christians). Therefore we must put our best foot forward into it. Place it as the most impt thing above sch work family etc. Personally, i dun feel anything wrong with spreading the good news to people. I am willing to sacrifice some of my time to tell the world that God is love.<br>But I felt strongly I've being manipulated.<br><br>1) Everyone in the cell is made to say : "I will commit myself to this outreaching program" in front of the whole cell. So even if u dun feel like doing it, u are expected to say those words or else, eyes will turn and look at u in different light. So what if u dun like doing it, u are made to declared ur promise, and u have to do it cos so many ears have hear you saying so.<br>But I'm not stupid... i din promise anything, i just say I take one step at a time.<br><br>If this is not manipulative enuf...read on...<br><br>2) The cell leader was saying " If anyone in the cell who can't participate in the outreaching program, the whole cell will slow down for that one person. We win together, we lose together." Come on...what's this ? using peer pressure to force us to do things? Even if I dun like to do the outreaching program, but so many people will have to stop and thus will put all the blame on me... it's thus so easy to give in to such ways of subtle manipulation of the human mind.<br><br>of cos all these dun come from the cell leader. they are taught beforehand by the pastor what to tell to their cell member during the meeting. I'm not surprise if one day they call me demon-possessed for saying such thing that go strongly against the church. the forte of the church is calling someone possessed and they will win all arguments.<br><br>The basis of Christianity is doing things out from the heart and not expect to get anything back.<br><br>Now the church is telling me I've to do these cos God says so. If u dun know what's social engineering, the church is the best place to learn.<br><br>They instil fear:<br>God will be angry and will have bestow misfortune onto me if I do not follow suit.<br><br>They brainwash u:<br>Dun let Satan put false ideas into ur head. Do it with all ur heart.<br><br>The immunise u to all opinions:<br>You may face objections and persecution from ur parents/friends/public etc. But do not lose heart for this is a war against the evil one.<br><br>But I must say...If faced objection from so many people... something must be wrong with ur behaviour and we need to sit down and reflect. And not blind in carrying out our actions becaues the pastors say so.<br><br>So basically, u are just one tool to get more Christians, and these new Christian will in turn be brainwash later to get more Christians. Sort of like a pyramid scheme. They care less whether u are doing the right thing or not..cos they say God will always forgive sinners. God is a jealous God, He will not tolerate other relgion. We must convert the whole Singapore to Christians.<br>I know I'm a bit extreme in saying this... but this is a fact. This is also crap.<br><br>Sorry, if I offended fundamentalist Christian out there. I am not trying to be self-righteous over here. But that's how I see things running in my church. If u see anything wrong with me, pls pray for me and for Singapore that we will see this whole outreaching program in God's greatest glory.<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 18 January 2001).]</div>

I've seen it happened among cliques before, but the power is stronger in cell groups.<br><br>By the way, are we from the same sch? I think so... Anyway, since you're in it, it's hard to get out of it. Just imagine... if you dun turn up for your cell groups, they will call you, look for you, stalk you, etc... That's their tatic. Dun you find it similar to the Communist way? That's just an idea that just pop up. I was thinking of the communist activity that happened in Singapore long long ago, before the PAP era... the way they infiltrate into the student population and get everyone to go along with them.

But, this is the last option of cos.<br><br>Do u know that everytime I go to cg/church/discipleship, my attendance is taken? Some more in standard print-outs prepared by the church. The cg leader later has to report his/her activities to the church pastors. I feel I'm being controlled in some ways. Like I need to report to some people whether I attend the service or not. I'm not a like pri sch kid who refuses to go to sch. Everytime I went church/cg, I'm so willing and happy to go, even if my sch work is piling high. I do it out of love for God.<br><br>I brought up this attendance-taking thing to my cg leader. The reply was unsatisfactory to me. It was because the pastor has to account for me. They want to make sure I'm walking right with God.<br><br>I've feel I'm very distant from the pastor for I've never got a chance to talk to them. Let alone to entrust them to take over responsibility of overseeing all my needs! I only spend 2 hours in front of my cell, the rest of the 22 hours, they do not know. Who can stop me from committing crimes outside these hours. Am I not mature enuf to take care of myself? To discern what's right &amp; what's wrong? I'm independent. I dun need a nanny now! So what difference does it make for them to know if I've attended the church service or cg? Does it mean that if I dun go to church or cg, I'm bad or have backslided?<br>This is absurd! I've concluded myself that they church just want to exercise control over the members. More of fear from losing them, than of sincere care.<br><br>Dun talk abt my church anymore and spoil my day...<br><br>Sherv, there's 2 common problems that a student can have. Studies &amp; Relationship. Since the sem just started, I guess it's the latter. Of cos it's best to solve ur own problems, but if u are confused, do confide with someone u can relate with and share ur problems with her.Just dun let the problem drag u down.
