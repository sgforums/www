            <div class='col-md body'>hey sherv, u sounded so ke lian.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> dun fret.  *sai yang*<br><br>i used to vent my frustration on my keyboard... typing away furiosly with no recipient in mind. then after I finish typing. I save them for future reference. sort of like a diary. sometimes I send them out in emails to the person of concern(with some editing of cos!) but if no party is of concerned... u can see it here.<br><br>Who says guys dun go bitching ard? I do! Who says guys dun cry when they are hurt. I do! Does that shows I'm sissy? No! I heard statistics shows more guys committing suicide than woman, cos woman express their feelings more openly than guys. It's most dangerous when someone is extremely quiet abt their problems.<br><br>sherv, if u need someone to confide with, uncle aggie is at ur service. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>jelly:<br><br>it's just a difference in the terminology I use. when I say "church" I mean the pastors<br>high up there. as for cg, I call them as my "friends". and friends do sincerely care for one another right? but then the church will sure to influence the cg. so that's where I start to draw a border<br><br>I admit I've prejudices against the church and have stop going to service recently. (Look at the time of this postings)I made my wish known to my cg and let them know my reasons for doing so. They din showed any disapproval, and were diplomatic by respecting my decision.<br><br>And u see, for most of the time in my cg, I'm very quiet. But when I decide to pour out my grieviences that day. I think they never expect me to be capable of speaking so much. I tried not to show much emotions already, but still I exude tinge of my great displeasure.<br><br>There's a lot more I can tell them why I dun like the church. But I dun want to show disrespect to the church body as a whole. And people will say I'm ignorant to see only the superficial and forgo the deeper reasons(which I can't find) for them to do the things they are doing now.<br><br>I'm in fact happier now. I no longer need to filter out thing the pastors told me. So long I can continue to my live my life without guilt, who's there to say I'm sinner. Even if I make mistake, I'll learn and carry on. I do not wish to be told by pastors what I should do or what I should not do. They are mere humans. But some are so arrogant even to use God's name to condemn people. I despise anyone who use God's name for unwholesome purpose. Much more if it's from a pastor.<br><br>Last point, I'm dun wish to be secretly labelled by anyone here. If u wish to correct me, pls do so. I'll be very glad to listen to u.<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 20 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>chch:<br>Yeah...agree with jelly-baby that you should find a church which you are uncomfortable with. I have this fren who is previously not a Christian until he went NS... then he found Christianity, and he started looking around for a church. Through frens, he went to different church services and he really found a church which he was uncomfortable with. When he explained his feeling about finding the right church, I can really understand the  "at home" feeling he must have felt when he stepped into the church he is going to... Dun let someone prevent you from going to church, and it is not neccessary to go to the church your family or relatives go... find one which you really feel close to God...<br><br>Me very ke lian... I also dunno...<br>I cried today... so sad... had to make a decision to choose between keeping my bf who's out from camp or to attend my ECA's planning weekend. My bf wanted me to spend time with him, and as for my ECA, it was more of being responsible, attending the meeting. To me, it was a difficult decision, choosing to fulfill my obligation as a gf or to fulfill my responsibility as a leader.<br><br>When the thoughts were going through my mind, I was really torn. All along, I have been balancing the different aspects of my life, being sensible and logical, prioritizing, etc... So far, I felt that I have been doing the right things, being responsible, setting an example, etc... But like I say, this year has starting off really bad....<br><br>I felt really bad disappointing my frens for not turning up at the planning weekend. How I wish I can clone myself so that I can satisfy both my bf and ECA... or just tear myself into two. I asked my bf which side of me does he want: left or right...<br><br>Thinking of this make me feel so pathetic. I'm only a human being who have only 24hrs a day. Everyone wants a part of me... what about myself? I have to account to everyone about something... if I'm to account to myself, I think I've been treating myself real bad. I dun think I'm very self-centered when I thinking of myself.. what do you  think? In a way, I'm quite unhappy... here I am, 21st-BD coming, and my life is in a mess... so sad...<br><br>I feel like just letting go... running away from everything... btw, that's one of my weakness...running away... but I know Mister God will frown. Somehow, I wish I can develop a 40++ degree fever overnite and check myself into a hospital. That way, I'll have a valid reason not to go for the planning weekend on Sunday... But I think I'm unable to let go... I dun want to disappoint my frens.But it's so hard to live up to an image I've built...<br><br>I've that book "Mister God, this is Anna..."... you want I can lend it to you... I dun really have time to read it this few months... yeah...I think we click online... wonder if we'll have that much things to talk abt real life...</div>

I think you type salah liao...... why you ask chch to find a church he's uncomfortable with???? got use meh??? hehe.....<br><br>And I'm just being a busybody here ah.....<br><br>Why dun you let your bf know that you really want to go for the planning thing? He should understand and let you go....on the other hand, you shouldn't really bother how ppl see you, like what others here have taught me. If you really can't go for the planning, and want to fulfill your duties as a leader, then find out more about the planning, contribute beforehand and get someone who's attending to represent you lor. Just my suggestion lah.....at the end of it, it's just you who should choose who you prefer to spend your time with. Dun cry over it lor.<br><br></div>

Neither do I want to spend the weekend with my bf, though I know he needs me a lot, 'cos by right, I'm supposed to be at the meeting and it's not fair if I'm to forsake my frens to be with my bf... it's part of my responsibility...<br><br>I chose to spend my Saturday with my bf... I dunno if I'll regret it... Likewise, I have decided to spend Sunday with my ECA frens, not letting my bf's persuasion get the better of me... my ECA frens put in their entire weekend to make next year plan, and I can understand if they feel that I've deserted them. But it's just so sad to not get their understanding after working together for quite a long time.<br><br>Either way, I dun like my choice... I rather have this weekend to myself, catching up on my spring-cleaning, wash clothes, tidy room, send out greeting cards, return library books and doing my homework... I haven't had time to myself for a long long time... actually not that long... for 2 entire weeks only...<br></div>

But I'm more concern of ur well-being after witnessing u writing so incoherently. I dun know u, but it certainly saddens me to hear the situation u are in.<br><br>I've this friend who had a similar problem as u. She confided me her problems, and thru it, she found her own answers to her problems and now she got out of the estranged situation and bring it to a greater height.<br><br>Rachel(pseudo name) is a uni student, in a faculty which requires her to spend much time both on academic and faculty activities. Her bf is now in the army, and gets to come out of camp frequently. Thus, her bf often wanted to spend time with Rachel, but Rachel was worried stiff with her sch work and busy with faculty activities. Rachel rejected to go out with bf many times. Bf did not seem to understand her tight schedule and the urgency of  sch work she had and took her rejections negatively. He spend time with his mahjong kakis and pick up smoking. Her bf is also too possessive, frequently asking what kind of clothes she wore to sch or did she went out with other guys.<br><br>Despite all these, Rachel still loves her bf a lot a lot. She's often put in a<br>dilemma. Sch or Bf? More often than often, Rachel initiated a break-up. She couldn't bear to leave her bf, but she's just can't continue with this tormenting relationship for she has only 1 chance in the uni. But few days after each proposal of a break off, the bf will come back crying to her. Rachel's heart melts immediately at the sight of the crying bf and naturally agrees for a patch-up. But the problem still persists and the cycle repeats. For once, the argument was so bad that she even contemplated committing suicide. Thank God, she's willing to confide her problems and though I din do much to help, she picked herself up. I'm glad that Rachel's relationship with her bf is doing fine now.<br><br>Love encapsulated all emotions, even hatred, anger, jealousy. Every couple is going to go thru all these trials. Imagine, if a couple can't resolve mundane conflicts like these, how will then their marriage works when in-laws, kids, housing loans problems set in?<br><br>Sherv, take heart, and hope u see the unhappiness and ill-feelings u have now for u bf in a different perspective. I'm sure he still loves u a lot even if u dun go out with him. He wun need to be angry whatsoever if he doesn't want to be with u. right? NS can be quite stressful and aren't u glad u are the one he first looks for ? Learn to resolve conflicts. Find a quiet place sit down and tell him nicely, I'm sure he'll listen. Then thru all these u will strengthen the bond between u and your beloved bf.<br><br>With love.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've ask the below questions to some christians I know, but guess what. Instead of getting answers, I got retorted.<br><br><blockquote><br>Dear God,<br><br>I've some questions for u. could u answer them?<br><br>God, why are there so many religions if there's only one You. Why did u<br>allow all these religions when u only approved of one.<br><br>God, I dun see any other bad things done by other religions. So God why<br>do u want to put non-christians to hell?<br><br>God, if somone prays to his "Creator of Everything" and give his own<br>name of God, any name but Jesus, will the prayers comes to u? Will u<br>still listen and answer the prayer?<br><br>Why do u create Satan to bring evil to this world? Wouldn't you love to<br>destroy Satan? Why do u still allow Satan to wreak havoc on ur<br>creations? God do u create Satan to tempt us so that later u can punish<br>humans. God, I think u hate us by not destroying Satan.<br><br>Why do u create Hell to punish helpless humans just because they dun<br>believe in Jesus? Do u not love non-christians? Are they not the sons<br>and daughters of u? Then why do tell Christians to condemn people of<br>other religions?<br><br>God, u gave us free-will. Yet those who dun obey what u instruct in the<br>Bible will be punished. God are u a hypocrite?<br><br>God why do I need to worship u? Are u an egomaniac? I love u and I want<br>u to be my friend. I dun want to worship my friend.<br><br>God if u want us to be Christians, why dun u programmed everyone to do<br>so? Then on, nobody will ever go to Hell. Yes, God u let us choose, but<br>when we choose the wrong one, u throw us to Hell. How can I accept u as<br>a benovelent Father?<br><br>God why do u create Hell to punish humans? Are u a masochist? God, u<br>create every soul. Why allow them to go thru the agony? God, u will be<br>most merciful even to destroy them rather than allowing them to suffer.<br><br>God, what if I told u I dun need salvation? My love for u is<br>unconditional -- even if u throw me to Hell. I'll still love u. Will u<br>still accept me after I rejected ur gift?<br><br>God, will u give ur love to those who dun believe in u and spare them<br>from Hell?<br><br></blockquote>one of the reply was<br><br><blockquote><br>it is either you believe God for all that He is, or you don't. But please don't not disrespect or judge Him. It is difficult to think and feel logically or calmly when you are going thru some difficult phase.<br><br>All i can say is He is God, and we are simply His creation,our minds are unable to fully understand His thoughts. That is where the foundation of our belief come is, you must have child-like faith to believe that<br>God is all He says He is.<br><br>May the Grace of God be upon your life.<br></blockquote>my reply was...<br><br><blockquote><br>If things are not logical and we all attribute to the fact that we can't use our finite mind to understand the Infinite. Then certainly, a lot of things can be said/done with no reasons. Do u not see religious war happening ard the world? They fight<br>in the name of their God, but din God says to love one another.<br><br>Do u not see people using God's name to commit crime? Like what u heard in Japan's Sarin gas incident.<br><br>Of cos, I'm not trying to put cult together with Christianity. What I'm trying to say is, we must be clear of what we are doing. Things do get illogical, so if it does, can't I question? So how can I then differentiate a cult and a from a religion if i dun question.<br><br>Do I have to blindly follow what<br>pastors says, just because they say God says so?  Does not following what pastors say makes me a sinner? I believe in what my heart tells me. If I am wrong, I ask God to<br>correct me.<br><br>Pls, if any religion in the world can claim<br>that we humans cannot understand what the God has told us. This world will be in chaos. Because religion will tend to put down other religion and there will be no<br>end to this conflict.<br><br>Why will God withhold the ability to let us understand Him fully? I feel God has given us everything we can need of to know Him, we just are not using our body,mind and soul<br>fully to do it. Doesn't God create us in His image? It does imply we can understand Him, isn't it?<br><br>If u dun see eye to eye with my point, pls<br>dun say because I'm going thru some rough patch in life. I'm not, and even if i am going thru some problems now,<br>does that makes me unable to think coherently?<br><br>Yes, I did come to know God with a child-like faith but my definition of child is not "naive". Did u see children often asking their parents the darnest questions?<br>And some parent can't even answer them, and brush them aside by saying... u will understand when u grow up. Come on, now I'm the like the child asking question but now being put down and called "disrespectful and judging God" because "my mind will never understand His thoughts". It hurts<br>me badly, much more, when it come from a friend.<br><br>I be really grateful if u can correct me, in kind, of where my thinking is wrong.<br></blockquote>---<br><br>Jelly-baby, hope u can give ur comments as a Christians on this matter. Cos so many people are against my ideas, I dunno where am I wrong at.<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 22 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hehe... I believe in God for one of the reason that God loves all of us. I believe in Buddhism 'cos of one of the teaching that we should mercy to all. I believe in that aspect of Islam where you can have 4 wives.  :p<br><br>Besides, the term "freethinker", simply refers to a person who keeps an open mind about everything, yet, not limiting him/herself to any one set of "limits". Freethinkers doesn't always refer to people who don't believe in god you know.<br><br>Actually it doesn't matter praying or not praying to God. Usually, people has a bad habit of praying to God in order to ask for something... Like right now, I'm praying everyday to God to ask Him to keep my fren who is travelling in the middle East, after which, studying in Isreal safe... So far, for the past 2 weeks, I've successfully remembered to pray everyday... gosh... I think I still have 6.5 mths more to continue my ritual... hope I dun forget anyday... But the point is: what does God want for me to do in return? I dun think he would want me to do anything for him in particular, 'cos what would he want???<br><br>Gosh, what crap am I typing?<br><br>Ok...I remembered... otherwise, I dun ask God for anything... I dun pray to Him... I prefer to see it as Chatting with Him... isn't that nicer? Why must I talk to God only when I want something from Him? I know there's no point asking for something if he thinks it's not right for him... therefore, no point praying seriously, thanking him in advance before asking something from him, then blame Him if it doesn't come true...<br><br>I also hope that my fren who is going for exchange in Isreal will be safe and sound... therefore, I hope that by praying everyday to God, my sincerity will move him and I will see my fren back in Singapore safe and sound...<br><br>Okay... today's the eve...

But it makes total sense to me.<br><br>People think their way of seeing God is the only way. Thus, they reject whatever people tries to tell them because their religion wun allow. Read the bk with an open mind, and u find that God is infinitely more than all the religions combined. ( I think i committed a sin in regard by some Christians by grouping Christianity with other religion. Christians will say Christianity is not a religion, it a relationship with God. yada yada, just a play with wordings.)<br><br>Sherv:<br>U dun really need to have a religion. Follow ur heart, that's where God resides. U dun need to believe in God.(sounds blesphemy?)<br>We are in God. God is in Us. We are never separated from God. Do u have to believe in yourself to know that u exist? Same thing, we dun have to believe in God, cos we exist.<br><br>I've finished book2 already.(yeah!) Bk2 is more on global issues. interesting, but not as much I enjoyed from reading bk1.<br><br>Happy Snake Year!<br>(yah..christians will say, the snake/serpant is Satan... where he deceived Adam into taking the apple. so we should try to discourage people from displaying snake as<br>decorations. Some are that extreme... well, I dun give a hoot, or rather pssssssss.)<br><br>Disclaimer: Pls correct me in kind where I am wrong. I be glad to listen to u.<br></div>

Like Sher, I m a free thinker too. And many of those Qns, I asked them myself. Still I couldn't find any answers. Still I hope someone can answer them and show light.<br><br>The most important barrier between me and christainity is their denouncement of other religions. That christainity is the only way to heaven. I respect other religions and the freedom of people who believe in them. I m a person who see things for himself and make decisions on my own accord with my understanding. I do not just listen to others. I follow my heart and often ask Qns before I m convinced of what is being told to me.<br><br>As of now, there's stills lots of Qns on christainity in my mind. Hope to find out more from this thread.

It was through fear that churches gained, and controlled, their membership.<br>One church even insisted that God would punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday. Not going to church was declared a sin.<br>And not just any church. One had to attend one particular church. If you went to a church of a different denomination, that, too, was a sin.

So they accepted the teaching of many churches to "fear the terrible vengeance of the Lord."<br><strong>It was as if people couldn't trust themselves to be good, to act appropriately, on their own, for their built-in reasons.</strong> So they had to create a religion that taught the doctrine of an angry God in order to keep themselves in line.<br></blockquote></div>
