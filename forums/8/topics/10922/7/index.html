Isn't it pure arrogance to assume you are right that God does not exist and hence you are right. 'scuse that rather incensed reply.<br><br>But for the record are you a free-thinker or a secualr humanist ? Just for my reference<br><br>but in reply to your messsage, i haven't had time to read thorugh your arguement about why God does not exist. But there are alot of reasons on both sides of the arguement.<br><br>Let us say that God dies not exist. Since most religions define God to be good, and hence define the line between good and evil, if there was no God, who is to defnie what is wrong or right ? Man ???? And who says that one person's morale standard is as good as another. If there is no God, Hitler's only mistake was tha he lsot the war. If he had won it, everything he did would have been right.<br><br>The existence of God, has been a restraining influence on people. You tell people, don't do this, otherwise God will send you to hell, and they don't. If you say don't do this because i say so, no ones really going to care. Yes this is taking it to an extreme and i'm exaggerating very badly. But hopefully you'll catch my drift.<br><br>I'll be back again to dump more on this.<br><br></div>
