            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, I'm still in my festive mood, but I rather write when I've the time. I've a lot of catching up to be done for my tutorials and revision. I'm not targeting for Dean's list of course! But it's my responsibility as a son and citizen of S'pore to do well academically. My school fees are afterall paid by my parents &amp; tax-payers. Whoever is reading this now, you have every right to tell me to go and study!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>End of my crap.<br><br>*serious*<br><br>I shall give my comment on the mouse and elephant story:<br><br>Start with an introductionÂ…<br>To most Christians, God is very real to them. Not that Christians could see, hear, touch or smell God physically, but rather God is an integral part of their life. They see themselves as the spiritual sons &amp; daughters of Jesus Christ. Christians have submitted their lives to Jesus whom is also their Lord. Jesus is Son of God but Christians regard Jesus no less than God Himself, so when you say the word "God", instinctively, Christians will put it as though you are referring to Jesus Christ. Nothing wrong with this belief. For Jesus is indeed Man made God.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What's your idea of a Christian?</span> Someone who goes to church every Sunday? Someone who reads the Bible everyday? Someone who can speaks in tongues? Or simply someone who owns an Identity Card which reads "Christian" for his/her religion? Personally, having these are not the necessary criteria to be called a Christian. It's the unbeatable attitude in life, a heart of compassion, a selfless character that is shown in Jesus' life that then awards you the title of a Christian. If judging by the same criteria I set by myself, I'm also still far from it.<br>Well well, I am not a salesman selling Christianity, but u will understand later as to why I've need to say all these nowÂ…<br>It was recorded in the Bible, Jesus as the Messiah who came down on Earth. All that you need to commit in mind about Christianity is Jesus came down on Earth as a bridge between God &amp; humans. Indeed, Jesus never once said man were sinners. Jesus just want to be an ambassador for God, to tell man that God is love. Jesus' disciples and followers in the spirit of good-will spread the good news to all parts of the world. Indeed Christianity is brought to all part of the world, Singapore included.<br><br>Now, churches in Singapore, in the same spirit of good-will to spread the good news to Singaporean, came working together. <strong>Love Singapore</strong>  is going to be a household name this year. They are going to tell Singapore that God is love.<br>It's excellent. I'm excited!<br><br>But I see a big irony in this entire thing. Christians are systematically taught byt their church to how to share the good news. After so many drillings under the direction of the church, it's all at the back of my mind. All churches are basically doing the same style, called  "John 3:16".<br><br>Ask the pre-believer what he/she thinks of God.<br>Tell them in a bit of the Genesis. God created Human. They have eternal life and were sinless. The serpent(Satan) tricked Adam &amp; Eve into taking the forbidden fruit. Human have sinned against God and was thus separated from God. The eventual outcome of the fallen nature of man will be Hell.<br><br>For eons, man has thus tried many ways to get back to God. E.g doing good deeds. Quote from the Bible(mine is NIV)Â…<br><br>Romans 3:23 "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."<br><br>Romans 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord"<br><br>John 3:16<br>For God loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believe in him shall not perish but have eternal life.<br><br>You are now at this junction of your life(towards Hell), but thru Jesus you can have eternal life. Do u wish to receive Christ as your personal savior?<br><br>Guide pre- believer into sinners prayerÂ…<br><br>Yep, this is how we are systematically taughtÂ…<br>But I wish to offer my opinion on it. The use fear of hellish fire to frighten people into Christianity is unwholesome. Am I wrong to say that some people become Christians because they fear that after they die, they will go to hell? What is Christianity all about? It's all about Love and not fear. Are we losing our direction?<br><br>OkayÂ…write so much already still haven't touch on the mouse and elephant storyÂ….<br><br>From a Christian acquaintance, who give her views on sharing of the good news...<br><blockquote><br>But i do think that sometimes when people get overzealous and caught up with enthusiasm, they do neglect the fact that once upon a time, they were in that persons shoes too, feeling revolted by the bigotry and self righteousness, or by the in your face style.<br><br>Many agreed that they didn't like the way we did not respect other pp's religions, how we tell them that we are right, and they are wrong. Many actually expressed repulsion. Especially with street evangelism because of the insincerity, and its similarity to hustling salespeople. Many in general just expressed being harrassed by christians...especially since most of them act superior and all self righteous with the "I'm gonna Heaven and you are going to Hell" attitude.<br></blockquote>That's why I said when u are walking with God, God will be so real in your life that<br>it's hard to humble yourself. If u can feel what it's like to call the President of USA your friend, you know how some Christians feel. Christians are behaving like the mouse.<br><br>These mice sincerely do wish to become the ambassador for the elephant, to tell the world how the elephant is really like. However, it's those very mice that gave the wrong impression of what the elephant is really like.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It may be necessary to proceed ahead and fast forwardÂ…<br><br>4) Questions About Evil<br><br>a) What is evil?<br>A lack of something that should be there in the relationship between good things.<br><br>b) Where did evil come from?<br>God made everything perfect. One of the perfect things God made was free creature. Free will is the cause of evil. So, imperfection (evil) can arise from perfection (not directly, but indirectly through freedom)<br><br>c) Why canÂ’t evil be stopped?<br>Evil canÂ’t be destroyed without destroying freedom. Free beings are the cause of evil, and freedom was given to us so that we could love. Love is the greatest good for all free creatures, but love is impossible without freedom. Hence, to destroy evil would actually be evil. If evil is to be overcome, we need to talk about it being defeated, not destroyed.<br><br>d) What is the purpose of evil?<br>We need to make a distinction: there is a difference between our knowing the purpose for evil and God having a purpose for it. We canÂ’t assume that there is no good purpose for something just because we donÂ’t know what it could be.<br><br>For instance, God sometimes uses evil to warn us of greater evils, keeping us from self-destruction (the gift of pain). While it may seem a high price to pay, some evil helps to bring about greater good. Finally, permitting some evil actually helps defeat evil. In some sense, we need pain so that we are not overcome by the evil that we would choose were it painless. God alerts us to the fact that there are better things than misery.<br><br>e) Does there have to be so much evil?<br>The extent of evil poses a problem. Surely there doesnÂ’t have to be this much evil to fulfil GodÂ’s purposes. This can even be taken to the extreme case: What about hell? WouldnÂ’t it be better to have one less person in hell?<br><br>1. The greatest good is to save all men.<br>2. Even one person in hell would be less than the greatest good.<br>3. Therefore, God cannot send anyone to hell.<br><br>To answer this objection, we go back to the subject of free will. It is true God desires all men to be saved (2 Peter 3:9), but that means that they have to choose to love Him and believe in Him. Now, God canÂ’t force anyone to love Him. Forced love is a contraction in terms. Love must be free: it is a free choice. All who go to hell do so because of their free choice. They may not want to go to hell (who would?), but they do will it.<br>They make the decision to reject God, even though they donÂ’t desire punishment. People donÂ’t go to hell because god sends them; they choose it and God respects their freedom.<br><br>Now if that is how eternal destiny is decided, then it is not person in hell that is evil; it is one more than is really necessary (i.e. one who did choose God but was sent to hell anyway). Granted, a world in which some men go to hell is not the best of all conceivable worlds, but it may be the best of all achievable worlds if free will is to be maintained. Likewise, the world might be made better by one less crime, but it must be left to the would-be criminal to make that choice.<br><br>f) CouldnÂ’t God make a world without evil?<br><br>g) Then why did God choose this world?<br><br>Later<br></div>

God is so good, and gracious and loving to me and i just simply want to share it with others! of cos good things must share..and if i really love my family and frens, i wouldnt want then to miss out this chance of experiencing God's love rgt?<br><br>well, u may not agree with me, just as i did not understand the mentality of christians last time. i just have to say that ..it is only when u have personally experienced that relationship with God, will u understand why christians preach and catholic don't.  (actually, the catholic church is encouraging envamgelism (preaching of gospel) already, cos the church feels that catholics are not evangelising enough)..<br><br>will continue later...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a lil puzzled, what's so mythical bout the bible?<br>The all time bestseller has been the foundation for Judaism, Islam and Christianity for thousands of years. There are alot of scholars and other folks trying to refute its claims in theological, geographical and historical aspects. So far, the Word still stands.<br>I remember Christianity is suppose to be an experience, sorta like having a friend except He's divine. You'll havta to try to find out for yaself.<br><br>It's been years since I stepped back into church.<br><br>------------------<br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Am I not merciful!</span>"<br>- Commodus<br><strong>Victuros te Saluto</strong><br>------------------</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>4b) Where did evil come from?<br><br>One of the things that makes men (and angels) morally perfect is freedom. We have a real choice about what we do. God makes us that way so that we could be like Him and could love freely (forced love is not love at all, is it?). But in making us that way, He also allowed the possibility of evil. To be free we had to have not the only opportunity to choose good, but also the ability to choose evil. That was the risk God knowingly took. That doesnÂ’t make Him responsible for evil:<br><br>He created the fact of freedom; we perform the acts of freedom.<br>He made evil possible, man made evil actual.<br><br>Imperfection came through the abuse of our moral perfection. As for the snake, the same answer applies. God made Satan the most beautiful of all creatures with the perfection of free will. Satan rebelled against God, and that became the first sin and the pattern for all sin that followed. You might ask, Â“What made Satan sin?Â” That is like asking what caused the first cause; nothing outside his own free will caused him to sin. Satan was the first cause of his sin and you canÂ’t go back any farther than that. When we sin, ultimately we (by our wills) are the cause of the evil we do.<br><br>Â“Why believe all this?Â”<br>While the above arguments donÂ’t rely on the Bible (the Word of God), they are guided by it. They take the path of reason to reach these conclusions, but they are directed by the revelation from God. Without the Bible, there is no guarantee that anyone would ever reach these conclusions. Even if they did, there might not be many who found them, and there is no telling how long it would take or how much error might be included along the way. Moreover, reason can take us only one step farther. That step leads us to the Scriptures as GodÂ’s Word.<br><br>But just how trustworthy is the Bible? Is the Bible really a revelation from God? Can the Bible be wrong?<br><br>Later<br></div>

Okie, this is not to flame chch, or anyone else.<br><br>IMHO, religion was created unconsciously by people who do not want to take full responsibility for their lives and actions. Religion is a figment of people's weakness... the inability to accept the fact they are the ultimate power in controlling themselves. They want the privilege of being able to hope for a higher being intervening with miracles; of being able to say 'the Devil made me do it'. Ha! The Devil never made anyone do anything he/she did not want to do!<br><br>But look - religion as a manifestation of our hopes and fears has become so powerful a force! From something intangible arises the tangible signs of strength. The crusades that leveled cities and killed countless people, waged on the word of a Pope. The grand cathedrals and temples that seemed impossible to build in their times. Joan of Arc rallying the broken French army against the English. The Russian orthodox church keeping disgruntled peasants from revolting with the mere mention of 'Hell'. And look around you in Singapore - people congregating in churches, donating generously into funds with millions of dollars! What other proof do we need to show that one of our greatest weaknesses has become one of our greatest strengths!<br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 28 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An atheist claims to know that there is no God, but not claim that religion is Â‘createdÂ’ by man: the belief and worship to a divine and supernatural power. Religion exists because of manÂ’s realization of his naked imperfection and the countless miracles laced around, and then exercising his free will to listen and obey that Â‘divine forceÂ’.<br><br>Some of the events mentioned are evil and the rest are miracles. A miracle is like a divine intervention into, or interruption of, the regular course of the world that produces a purposeful but unusual event that would not have occurred otherwise. The naturalistic attitude toward miracles goes against simple common sense.<br></div>
