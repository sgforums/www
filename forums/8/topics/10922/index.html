            <div class='col-md body'>The time I spend at home is to eat/sleep/study/read. Recently my additional fav pasttime is to come to sgforums and leave some creative thoughts(to me it is).<br><br>In a mood of sharing with u all a little of the centrestage of my life at this moment. Here it goes...<br><br>Currently I'm reading "Conversations with God" (book1) by Neale Donald Walsch.<br><br>Taken from the backcover of the book.<br>---------------------------------------------<br>Suppose you could ask God the most puzzling questions about existence- questions about love and faith, life and death, good and evil.<br><br>Suppose God provided clear, understandable answers. It happened to Neale Walsh.<br><br>It can happen to you.<br><br>You are about to have a conversation...<br><br>Walsch was experiencing a low point in his life when he decided to write a letter to God, venting his frustrations. What he did not expect was a response. As he finished his letter, he was moved to continue writing - and out came these extraordinary anwers to his questions.<br><br>They will amaze you with complex paradoxes that make perfect sense, profound logic, and astounding beliefs and traditions. Here are answers that will change you, your life, and the way you view other beings.<br><br>For those with an open mind, a limitless curiosity, and sincere desire to seek the truth, this book is stunning.<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>My comments: Truly inspiring. Though the authour is a Christian, he rebukes many common Christians' ideology. e.g ideas that man are sinners is created by man himself. If God sees us as sinners, doesn't God has the ability to put sinners in hell right this very moment? Also the common saying saying that Christianity as the only path to God/heaven is created by man's fear in losing to other religion.<br><br>If i could sum up the whole book in a few sentence, this would be it. God is a loving God. God would never create anything God doesn't like. Nothing is absolute. Everything is perfect.<br><br>Everything is explained in uncanny simple ways that after reading I need to say to myself. Why din i thought of it earlier? I'm always feeling this way for a very long time, but somehow people has been teling me that contradicts to this feeling. Now some one feels the same way as me and it's not wrong!<br><br>Before u even try to reply to me (in a flaming manner) Pls read the book first.<br><br>I've some enjoyable time devouring the contents. Who says you have to be religious to read a book abt God? I urge u to read it.<br><br>Love to everyone.<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 06 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Waiting for a reply?<br><br>Yeah...read the book (1st quarter of the bk) before... actually enjoyed reading it... IT actually dispelled all those belief that Christians have about God... interesting ideas here and there, but didn't manage to finish the whole book... I know the author continued writing a few sequels to that book. You might like to try reading "Mister God, This Is Anna"...and equally interesting book with interesting ideas about God that is different from general beliefs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Because I'm reading Conversation, so when I saw the title, "Mister God, This is Anna", I got a feeling it's something like the one I'm reading now. Get it after I finish the 3 books(it's a trilogy)<br><br>So have u read "Mister"? Can give a brief outline?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, that book "Mister God, this is Anna" is about this little girl called Anna. Well, the author said it's a real life story, and just in brief, the author found Anna on the streets, brought her home and after that took care of Anna. Anna was just a little girl, and she amazed the author with her thots of God.<br><br>Well, it's only a thin book but the ideas mentioned by Anna is amazing yet logical. The things that brought abt the result of Anna's thinking is even more fascinating. Kinda like the way the author narrated the story in first-person. Once you pick up the book, you won't want to put it down 'cos everything just flows.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a taoist, no offence here but I'm not sure if I can handle myself reading about God. I dunno if I'm liberal enough to read it without disagreeing with most sentences, or possibly agree to it so much that I become guilty of "betraying" my religion.<br><br>However, chch, the reply you gave me in the thread which I think too much, I find it interesting. Is this book mainly on God and christianity? Or is it about life and ideas or patterns of human behaviour? If not, do you know of any such books to recommend?<br><br>Thanx.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before i go on replying to Hymen, I need to clarify, to prevent getting myself flamed from fundamentalist Christians.<br><br>Pls <strong>DO NOT READ</strong> if u think Christianity is the ONLY way to God and nothing will change ur mind abt it.<br><br>Hymen:<br><br>The book is mainly abt God, not a particular religion. But the author is a Christian himself, so the tendency is inclined towards his side, not much though. It does teaches the attitude we should have in life. It also crystallised a lot of my thoughts into a pure form. I'm totally inspired!<br><br>To all:<br><br>Below is what I always wanted to say...<br>-----<br>I'm a Christian, but I'll never ever condemn other religions -- as most Christians are doing now. I dun put blame on them, most Christians are the nicest people I've seen. However, they are brainwashed by their pastors into this belief that all other religion are created by the evil force aka Satan. If week after week u go to church and hear people telling u "You're a sinner, and all other religion are bad, we should convert the whole world to Christianity!"<br>Then wun it be natural that one day this idea will be ingrained into your mind? Even if u are not brain washed, the sheer numbers of people will influence u to do things to reflect this idea.<br><br>Christianity is a wholesome religion, I've seen many people have changed for the better. Drug addict get reformed. Handicapped gets a new life. Miracles, healing of the sick, u name it... God's work is seen in every case.<br>I love Christianity and proud to call myself a Christian. I will stood against those who blesphemies my God. But sometimes, I feel that my religion has it dark sides too.<br><br>1) God will always love His people - Christians &amp; non-Christians alike. God will not choose a religion and all else who dun follow will be send to hell.<br><br>quote from MayaJade<br><blockquote><br>as it is, i am a catholic who think that god's rules are made for us and not for god's self glorification.  I hope he'll correct me if I am wrong, but I believe he won't be petty enough to burn me just because I have an enquiring mind.  Yeah, I choose to see God as a good benevolent father who gave birth to us because he wanted us to enjoy being alive, much like why parents beget children.  I choose to see him as being sincere about it and not expecting us to praise him or joining a certain religion he favors most or even do anything for him/his glory.  Otherwise, if he's not that selfless, he doesn't worth being praised anyway.<br>Yeah, so I just want to win and make rules for myself.  Maybe.<br></blockquote>If God wants us to do anything, e.g worship. God could have programmed us like robots and do everything according to God's will and pleasure. God is no ego-maniac who wants us to worship Him every moment. God deserve all the praises and glory but we sing praises because we love God and not because church told us to. In fact, God doesn't require us to worship Him. God has everything. If He wants worship, he can create a colony of pre-programmed people. God's greatest gift to human is free will.<br><br>But then God also told us not to kill/steal etc. But if we choose to do sin, God will put us to hell? If u agree to this, this would make God a hypocrite. It's like God saying, dear people, u do whatever u want okay?<br>But then later turn ard and barked... I dun like the way u are doing, so I send u to hell. God is not sadistic either! He did not create humans just to give instructions to them to follow. And failure to abide to God's rule means burning in hell. Do u see any logic for God to do this? God can just throw us in hell without asking us to do so many things. But our God is not this kind. God is love.<br><br>Rather, all God's instructions are automatically fulfilled if we are close to God. We see things in different perspective.<br>Not just blindly follow what the Word says.<br>E.g. We shall not kill. We do not kill just because God says so? There will be no conviction in our heart. Rather, we see every plant/animal/human as God's creation, thus we do not kill for we love God and God's creation.<br><br>Same action, but different perspective. But it matters to God. For God can see our heart with piercing clarity. Are we truly kind to people because we love God or are we doing good deeds because we fear the wrath of God upon us?<br><br>2) There's no Satan. God created every single thing - seen and unseen, known and unknown.<br>Then if there's Satan, then God must have created Satan. Do u think God will ever create something to fight against God?<br>Or do u think God created Satan to wreak havoc on Earth, God love the people, will God do so to hurt us? Will God purposely make enemy? If there's a Satan, God will love to crush it even without us people saying so. God is Almighty, destroying Satan will be as easy as killing an ant. So why does the people still believe in Satan? They have to blame someone when something goes wrong. Satan is one poor thing which all man blames. Satan is created by man, born out of fear.<br><br>So if there's no Satan why is there still existence of evil on planet Earth?<br>Listen on....<br><br>quote: Tom Harpur, [The Thinking Person's Guide to God.]<br><blockquote><br>"But, would that be true freedom and would goodness itself truly exist when there was no alternative, no background, as it were against which its light could be seen? The truth is that our freedom to make choices<br>between good and evil is one of the qualities that defines us as human being. From time immemorial we humans have treasured our freedom as a supreme value and source of ultimate human happiness.....<br><br>We have this terrible yet eternally precious gift. It could lead us to destroy earth itself and every living thing through and ecological or a nuclear holocaust. We have that much choice. I am certain that God<br>intends us to work in synergy with the powers of the entire universe. But, he has restrained his omnipotence so that we might know the joy of true freedom and attain the maturity of true 'Children of God' "<br></blockquote>If u do evil, it's not because of the imaginary Satan, it's because man choose to do so. Agree?<br><br>3) Christianity as the only way?<br><br>quote from [The Thinking Person's Guide to God]<br><blockquote><br>"If you are a believer, you can use almost any spiritual tradition and find growth within it. Personally, I have learned from from a host of non-Anglican and non-Christian saints and sages, and sacred texts. I can<br>feel at home at the worship of any major faith. There is no right denomination, faith or sect for everyone. As noted already, the God who made not one kind of tree but thousands of different varieties and who<br>has made not one shade of green by myraid subtely differing shades has declared a love of multiplicity and of individuation that is cosmic in scale. So it makes no sense at all that there should be only one way to come to him to worship him, or to live in his service. Imagine yourself on Mars, looking back on the blue ball of Earth. From that perspective, the idea that some groups and individuals on this pink fragile planet<br>think that they alone know and hold the truth about ultimate reality is patently ludicrous. I have long been convinced that the idea that there is no salvation outside this or that religion or church was born more<br>out of fear and a lust for control over people's hearts, mind and bodies<br>than from any true understanding of the mind and will of the Creator. "<br></blockquote>P.S God is not a He or She. I used He cos God is usually refer as our Heavenly Father. God is our father, mother, mentor, sister, brother &amp; friend. God is everything.<br>---<br><br>That's all for today... I still got homework to do. To be continued...<br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 12 January 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can call Creator or Great Unseen. But no earthly words can conceptualise the whole idea. We give the the name God, so we can add new things to the never ending search and discovery of God. Did u know God is humorous?<br>Now u know. Everyday we learn new things.<br><br>So why are there so many religion proclaiming "different" Gods? The true God wants His children to see him in different angle, thru mulitiple facets. God never created religion,<br>it's people who thinks that their perception is the true way. God is always Love.<br><br>There will be no religion if everyone agrees with this. So religion has to protect themselves by condemning other religion.<br><br>I give a very good example from the book. The West never acknowledge Eastern medicine as scientific and orthordox. But Chinese themselves do know that herbs, acupuncture have cured millions of illness. So why is Western so against Eastern medicine? Cos if West were to accept Eastern ways of treatment, where would the angmoh doctors be?<br>So in fear, they have to reject Chinese ways of treating the sick. Agree?<br><br>Most of what I've written were from the book... but the book phrased everything more convincingly and flowingly.<br><br></div>

It's called faith. Whether issit blind faith or true faith, this is the basis of all religion. To believe in something we never see.<br><br>E.g If u have a gf, and how do u know she loves u? It's by spending time with her and u gradually gets to know the person better. Same thing goes for God.<br><br>Why God never answer ur prayer? God is no Santa Claus u see. If I pray I struck lottery today, will u still see me here typing away? I be in Hawaii drinking from a coconut right now. But if u pray to heal someone? Then the person never get cured? To the alive, the see death as misery,<br>but what if I tell u life is suffering and death bring end to all pain. Most thing are relative. It's how u see &amp; how u feel that. However is that how others perceive?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well iori, u got a point here.<br><br>but no religion is perfect in my eyes. God tells us to love our neighbours, but how many religious wars have u heard? I dunno the real reason behind, but fact is, it's against what their religion told them. Fancy knowing that, but contradicts with their actions.<br><br>I've been constantly filtering out things told to me by religious leaders. Whatever it is, the bottomline is I follow what my mind &amp; heart says.<br><br>So long I've not done anything against my conscience, why do need to fear God as most Christians are advocating. I respect God and naturally, I'll do thing accordingly. Simple as that.</div>
