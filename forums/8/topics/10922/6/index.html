Pardon me for saying this 'cos I know it's quite common for someone to hide behind another identity to maintain secrecy and privacy. I guess God doesn't mind, 'cos a name is just a name.<br><br>Well, I never tried going to church... Didn't want to get tied down to any one church becos, to me, loving God should be free (as compared to restricted). It doesn't matter which church I go, because loving God doesn't require a place... as long as I have a place in my heart for God...<br><br>There were times when I knew God was with me too... whenever I have problems, really tacky problems... well, initially, when I wasn't that certain of God's companionship and love, I would pray to him and ask him to show me the way... but I read somewhere that God is always with me... Sure enough, now, whenever I have problems, I know God is always there for me... just that sometimes, reaction time is not immediate 'cos I think he has his own reasons... well, in a way, I have developed patience. My problems will always work out eventually, and I often think that "yeah... luckily I didn't rush into solving the problem, else, things wouldn't have work out so well".<br><br>Well, haven't had that much fun replying to this topic...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

Anyway, even if I'm nuts about any religion, I dun think I will join those clubs and societies in school... what the societies do is to allow opportunities for people of the same thoughts to come together to make frens and do volunteer work, rather than study about the religion. In a way, there are good points about what these societies are doing, but other clubs and societies are even able to offer this even better, so I dun see why I should join these clubs and socities.<br><br>Dun really understand the last part you were saying...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a bit off the original topic..but i dun want to start another topic for it's just another one of my complaints...<br><br>my comp decided to blow up today!<br>the moment I switch on the power from the wall socket, i heard one loud "piak" and the house power tripped. Smoke came out from the back of the casing. Like cartoon show...<br><br>and I thought... oh goner. the comp i'm using is just 5 mth old. It's a diy and i spend much time and money fixing up. took me 1 week and $1200 to get it running.<br><br>for convenience sake, i send for repair in a nearby comp shop. I've got it back just now and I felt I got cheated for my money. The power supply unit got fried for unknown reason. The cost of the new unit is $35...and guess what, the service charge is $40!! even more than the component that's fixed! Total $75 when I bought the casing+power unit for just $82! darn! what's more I use my own pocket money to pay for it. Throw me with a brick and I think I would have felt less pain.<br><br>should have waited for the weekend and go down to Sim Lim to get a new power supply. What's more... I think it's under warranty, and I might get one for free...but then... what's done cannot be undone. I say again... i felt so cheated!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>{I already mentioned why God exists. So if God exists, by default, it becomes unnecessary to question the validity of religion in that context. ItÂ’s common sense, like you said.}<br><br>ohhh... by default eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Don't find your logic a bit disturbing? And I do admire how people can put so much faith into something they believe. Have you yourself seen a miracle? Have you yourself heard God 'really' speak to you? (Or was it your imagination/delusions speaking?)<br><br>{All these all obey natural laws and can be explained by natural forces. Natural laws are understood to be the normal, the regular way the world operates. But a miracle occurs as an unusual, irregular, and specific act of God. .... they simply have a cause that transcends nature.}<br><br>Notice that you you have already defined what is bound by natural forces, and what are not. Since when did you become so omniscient as to know what is the limit to 'natural laws'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Are you God? Or did you hear that from someone else who heard it from someone else who heard it from someone else... ad infinitum? And don't be amazed if I point out that all those 'someone else's are Christians... hehe...<br><br>{Natural laws donÂ’t tell us what must happen, but only describe what usually does happen. They are statistical probabilities, not unchangeable facts.}<br><br>Since when do statistics mix with unchangeable fact? What is unchangeable, and what is fact? Are you a philosopher who has a deep understanding into these concepts? Or did you read this in some christian book again? At that rate, Christians are the most perfect philosopher-cum-mathematician-scientist-cum-lawyer-cum-allknowers in the world. hehe! Still wanting to spread the 'Good News' eh?<br><br>{We donÂ’t deny supernormal events (not the same as supernatural) that take place, but we deny that they fit the definition of a miracle. Three basic elements of a miracle: power, sign, and wonder.}<br><br>Can you tell me what is supernatural and what is supernormal? If 'normal' means the way things usually are, and 'natural' means what normally exists in nature, don't you thing you people are splitting hairs?<br><br>{The power of miracles comes from a God who is beyond the universe. The nature of miracles is that they are wonders, which inspire awe in those who see them, because they are astonishing. Â‘SignÂ’ tell us the purpose of miracles: they confirm GodÂ’s message and His messenger. Morally, because God is good, miracles only produce and/ or promote good. Miracles are never performed for entertainment, but have the distinct purpose of glorifying God and directing men to Him.}<br><br>Hey, if the power of God is beyond the universe, then how come you know it? Did you cross the universe to see it? Or did you just feel that it is so? Or did you just hear this from someone who heard it from someone who heard it from someone... ad infinitum...<br><br>Oh yes, miracles for the glory of God... Haven't I heard that a million times before... You see a miracle, therefore that is God's doing. Hmmm... I think people need a bit more convincing than your one-sided arguments. Something wonderful happened... its got to be 'HIM'? Are you saying that natural laws cannot, once in a long while, provide for events that are 'good', 'powerful' and 'wonderous'? Remember that 'good', 'powerful' and 'wonderous' are simply terms and concepts invented by men. So how come mortal creations feature in such 'Divine' matters? So are you saying Divinity is within human beings' understanding? Or is it more attributions done by the human mind on things they find special?<br><br>{Miracles belong to the class of events with an intelligent cause. God doesnÂ’t intervene just to play around and confuse us. He has a purpose and communicates something with each miracle. So when an event occurs which is purposeful, the scientific method tells us not to look for natural causes, but for an intelligent cause.}<br><br>Are you sure you know what is the 'scientific method'? Please convince me you do by telling me what you know about the epistemology of the 'scientific method'. And as for 'intelligent' cause, don't you think you are again attributing features to an event? Given the bounded rationality of human beings, don't you think that our recognition of what is 'intelligent' may be seriously flawed? My point is - if there is indeed intelligence in the miracle, how are you sure that the limited human mind has not distorted it or failed to pick it up?<br><br>{Stop running away from reality.}<br><br>And what is reality? Yours? For all there is to know, you have as much created your reality as I have. Running away from your 'reality'? - I am merely staying in mine.<br><br>And I ask again - are you a philosopher? Why do you like to use big words like 'reality'? Are you so sure your limited, bounded perception of reality is better than my limited, bounded perception? I don't think so... unless you believe that Christianity makes people perfect beings capable of seeing the truth.<br><br>Huh, truth! I tell you truth is as people defines it!<br><br>{Well, creation is the greatest miracle.}<br>You bet... and Christianity is the world's greatest miracle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> heheh!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IF YOU PPLE DONT MIND PLS SPEND SOME TIME READING THIS OK? IT'S AN EXTRACT I READ FROM A BOOK MONTHS AGO. =)<br><br>While attending a business meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana, I heard about a revival that had "broken out" in the western part of Florida. Being a resident of Florida and active in the Lord's work, this news caused my spiritual antenna to go up immediately. I listened with rapt attention to the description of this reported revival that began on Father's, Day 1995. By its description, it sounded like a continuation or duplication of the widely acclaimed "Toronto Revival." It was reported that some school teachers and students were "falling to the floor" in their classrooms after attending this church in west Florida. People all over the community were being changed by the experience they received at this meeting. Thousands upon thousands -- in fact, it has been reported that over two hundred thousand people from all over the United States and foreign countries -- have attended this protracted meeting in Pensacola, Florida. Those who keep the records report that over fifteen thousand conversions have taken place.<br><br>After returning home to Jacksonville, Florida, I prayed about whether or not I should attend this meeting. Several days passed before I received a witness in my spirit that it was o.k. to go and visit. I also discussed my plans with Brother Thomas. His response was, "Go and see what it's all about. If God is indeed visiting that place, we'll all go and partake." God wants us to have an open mind and not judge or castigate something from a distance, but rather to seek God with all our heart and truly measure all things in the "light of God's word," and to also try the spirits. "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world." (I John 4:1).<br><br>Jesus sent the disciples out in two's, and the word says, "that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established." (Matt. 18:16). Realizing that there is wisdom in the multitude of counsel, I invited two of my Christian brothers to go with me.<br><br>One of my traveling companions was Brother Elmer Enlow, a man of four score years, with a wealth of experience under his belt. He has been an Army Chaplain, has pastored several churches, was a college professor, and is a scholarly man who has seen about everything in his lifetime. My other traveling companion was Brother Felton Wall, who has traveled all over the world and also possesses a wealth of experience.<br><br>Before our departure, I called the church in Pensacola to get directions and the schedule of their services. One of the assistant pastors took my call and was very cordial to me throughout the entire conversation. I had several questions for him -- they were as follows:<br><br>Answer: "No, this is something new the Lord has done in this area and is growing rapidly throughout the world."<br>2. Question: "Does a spirit of laughter overtake people during your services?"<br><br>Answer: "Some of the people laugh, however, it is not all consuming and is not a distraction to the service."<br><br>3. Question: "Do people fall to the floor after being prayed for?"<br><br>Answer: "Yes, several do, however; some do not. What you need to do is to come and experience this revival for yourself."<br><br>During this brief conversation I was told to come early or I would not get a seat. The special revival services are on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights beginning at seven o'clock.<br><br>Bright and early on Thursday morning, February 22, 1996, the three of us began our four hundred mile journey to Pensacola to witness for ourselves the reported revival and unusual phenomena that were taking place there. On the way we prayed together, asking God to give us His wisdom and keen discernment to know what was of God and what was of the flesh or the devil. Jesus said, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself." (John 7:17).<br><br>As Christians we do not have to be in the dark concerning such matters. Jesus also said, "My sheep follow me for they know my voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers." (John 10:4, 5). I can honestly say that all three of us were in agreement not to prejudge or come to any conclusion before we sat through the entire service with an open mind and honest heart.<br><br>After having a late lunch and refreshing ourselves at the motel, we were on our way to the church, prayerfully looking to God that He might have His way and to keep us in His perfect will during the entire evening. We arrived at the church at approximately five thirty p.m. on Thursday afternoon. Much to our surprise people were arriving in large numbers even at five thirty. I spoke to a young man in the parking lot and asked if he was a member of this church. He replied, "I feel like a member -- this is my thirty-fifth service since the revival began. However, I'm from Alabama." This response was not unusual as we soon learned that quite a few of the people had become regular attendants traveling several hundred miles every week. Surely something had an unusual power on these people for them to faithfully return time after time.<br><br>At last we were now in the church looking for a seat near the front so we could hear and see all that the Lord would reveal to us. After we found our seats, we took note of a steady stream of people pouring into the building. I asked Brother Elmer and Felton to hold my seat while I circulated throughout the sanctuary. I wanted to meet as many people as I could to find out where they were from and why they had come to this meeting. I must report to you that I met some very nice, kind, and sincere people from many states with a variety of religious backgrounds. Many of them had been to this revival more than once and some of them never before. I later learned that approximately one to two thousand visitors came to each of the four services every week. All without exception came for the same reason. They wanted to be "prayed for" and receive a supernatural experience so they could take it back to their family and to their church.<br><br>Song Service<br>At seven o'clock the service was called to order by one of the Elders and everyone was welcomed and made to feel at home. He asked all the visitors to raise their hands. There appeared to be several hundred if not a thousand visitors. Everyone was exhorted to give themselves to worship and to let God have His way in this service. As the musicians began to play and the singers began to sing I noticed a young woman going down the aisle and she took a seat about three pews in front of us. Just as soon as she greeted her friends she immediately began to shake her head left to right in a boisterous manner. I thought to myself, "Why is she doing that? Perhaps she has an infirmity, Parkinson's disease, or some type of palsy." Since I did not know a lot of the songs, I let my eyes scan over the congregation. I spotted quite a few people (men, women, and children) jerking their heads. Some would jerk backwards, some jerked side to side, and some jerked their shoulders as if they were frigid. I pondered, "Whatever this is, it seems to be spreading throughout the congregation." From time to time I could hear some laughter sprinkled here and there. However, it was not so loud as to disrupt the service.<br><br>The music gradually got louder and louder and the singing likewise grew louder. The musicians and singers were extremely talented and were dancing in a tasteful way as they performed flawlessly for us all. When I say "performed" I mean as in a professional group that puts on a show for the audience. However, I must hasten to add that I believe that they were very sincere in what they were doing. The truth is, there was "no anointing" on it. I believe that the entire song service was for the most part an exercise in the flesh. On one occasion, one of the ministers interrupted the song service to exhort the congregation to "let themselves go" ... "do not think about what you are doing" ... "just give yourselves completely to the spirit." My Bible says that we are to "sing with the spirit and with the understanding also." (I Cor. 14:15).<br><br>On another occasion the visiting evangelist stopped the song service to say this: "The devil is here tonight and wants to hinder this service. Well, I've got news for him -- he has to go. He" (the devil) "has analyzers here tonight." During the song service this young evangelist glanced at Elmer, Felton, and myself on more than one occasion. I am sure we were sticking out like sore thumbs, since we were obviously not taking part in the "wild frenzy" called worship. He (the evangelist) went on to say, "If you must analyze, then look at me, look at the musicians and singers, look at the congregation, look at the person to the left of you and to the right of you, and just analyze, analyze, analyze -- get it out of your system. Now let yourselves go: don't even think about what you are doing, forget about those around you and what they are doing. Release your mind -- release your spirit -- and let the mighty river of 'The Holy Ghost' take you wherever He wants you to go." I thought to myself, "Sir, I didn't just fall off a turnip truck, and although I'm not a genius, I wasn't born last week either." I certainly wasn't going to open my spirit up to this "wild, anything goes atmosphere." Jesus said, "Ye worship ye know not what . . . But the hour cometh, and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship him." (John 4:22-23).<br><br>Intermission<br>The worship service, or shall I say the "wild fire service," lasted about one hour and then we were given liberty to stretch our legs, go the bathroom, and visit with our neighbors in the congregation. On my way to the bathroom, in the foyer area, I noticed several tables full of audio and video tapes for sale. What a coincidence -- all these tapes appearing just in time for the intermission. Commerce is alive and well in many churches today.<br><br>During the intermission I engaged one of the elders in a conversation concerning the purported revival. I asked if anyone in the church had visited the acclaimed "Toronto Revival." He replied, "Yes, the pastor's wife has visited there." I asked if her visit was before or after the Pensacola revival began. He replied, "Oh, she visited several months before our revival began." Do you remember the question I asked the assistant pastor concerning the Pensacola revival? I asked him if this revival was similar to or related to the "Toronto Revival." His reply was, "No, that this was new and not related." What a coincidence! Could it be that the pastor's wife got the "blessing from Toronto" and brought it back to Pensacola?<br><br>I also asked this elder about the young woman who was shaking her head so boisterously. He assured me that this was the "power of God" upon this young woman's life. I asked if she did this only at church or if she continued to do this in her everyday life? He said, "She only does this at church." He also told me that several other young people had the same "gift" or "power" on their life and that it was a great honor to have it.<br><br>Pray tell me what glory would or could it bring to Christ to make someone shake their head violently until they became so dizzy they had to lie down on the pew? This poor girl got so dizzy she would literally fall down on the pew every fifteen to twenty minutes and continue to shake her body even while she laid there. Her friends covered her with a blanket so that she would not be exposed. After fifteen minutes of lying down she would get back up to start her shaking again. This cycle lasted for over four hours.<br><br>In every case in the Bible when it speaks of palsy (or uncontrollable shaking) it is either associated with a devil or an undesirable physical condition. In both cases Jesus and Peter would either cast the devil out or heal the person. "And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them." (Matt. 4:24). If those ministers had "the Power" or any "discernment" they would have either cast the devil out or healed this pitiful young woman. I must tell you that I had a strong desire to go and lay hands on her and resist the devil, however, I knew they would have thrown us out of the service, so I restrained myself.<br><br>Call To Order<br>After the intermission, I heard the song leader call everyone back into the sanctuary. The song service was continued for another fifteen minutes to get the people "back up to an emotional high" for something very important. It was time for one of the most (if not the most) important events of the night. It was time to take up "the offering." A huge six foot six two hundred fifty pound man came out and gave a very fervent appeal for a sizable offering. He said that the Lord had revealed to him that one person would give fifty thousand dollars, and another individual was to give one hundred thousand. He also said that the total offering should be in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.<br><br>I believe that the Lord can do anything, but I don't believe that God uses the "power of suggestion" or psychology to get into the wallets of God's people. The word says, "Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver." (II Cor. 9:7). It is a shame and a disgrace the way ministers beg and plead for money. You would think that God is poor and about ready to declare bankruptcy if we little humans don't come to his rescue. God is not poor. "He owns the cattle on a thousand hills" (Psalms 50:10). He owns everything.<br><br>Ministry Time<br>The evangelist came to the pulpit and read two verses of scripture. (Rev. 12:10, 11) He spoke for approximately forty five minutes. Every ten minutes or so he would say, "Don't leave me now ... just hang in there ... we'll get to the good stuff soon," ("good stuff" meaning prayer time, when everyone would come up front to receive the "power" and be slain in the spirit). Isn't that pathetic? What could be more important than the word of God? Jesus said, "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." (Matt. 4:4).<br><br>A true minister called and anointed by God should never have to make excuses or minimize the word of God. The apostle Paul preached until midnight on one occasion because the need was so great and the people were hungry. (Acts 20:7-11). There is a famine in the land -- not a famine of bread or of water but of hearing the word of God. (Amos 8:11).<br><br>This evangelist took most of his time explaining where he had been and the experiences that God had given him. He told of a great revival in England and a great man of God who had thousands coming to his meetings and people standing in lines for several city blocks waiting to get in. He told about walking over body after body (people who allegedly had been slain in the spirit) trying to get to the "great man of God" so that he too could be prayed for and receive the "power" and be slain in the spirit. Guess what? He got his wish. Now, God has called him to the United States to impart this great "power" and experience to all that come under the sound of his ministry -- so he says.<br><br>The speaker also spent a good deal of time comparing this revival to "The Great Awakening" during the time of Jonathan Edwards. He was preparing the congregation to receive an experience or some supernatural manifestation (more specifically the gift of "supernatural power" via being slain in the spirit). Could someone please show me in the scriptures where Christians are encouraged or instructed to seek an experience, power, or some supernatural manifestation? There is no such example in the entire Bible. "And ye shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart." (Jeremiah 29:13). We are to seek God not an experience. Jesus said, "An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas." (Matt. 12:39).<br><br>Altar Call<br>After the message (or shall I say, "the psychological conditioning and preparation"), he asked all of those who wanted to be saved to come to the altar. Only a handful came forward. This disturbed the minister, so he reached deeper into his bag of tricks and gimmicks. After thirty minutes of begging, pleading, and cajoling he had quite a few up front at the altar. He did not preach against sin nor did I discern any anointing upon his message.<br><br>The apostle Paul's preaching was quite different: "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in the power of God." (I Cor. 1:2,4) After the apostle Peter preached his sermon he did not beg or even give an altar call. "Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?" (Acts 2:37). Any preacher that God calls and anoints will have the same results as Paul and Peter. We shouldn't have to beg or use manmade methods, for it is certain that his word will not return void. (Isaiah 55:11).<br><br>Time For The Good Stuff<br>After the altar call, the minister began to give instructions to all the visitors who had come to receive "the power" and be slain in the spirit. He said that we shouldn't let anyone pray for us unless they were wearing a purple badge, which identified them as being a part of the official ministry team. There were approximately twenty-five "Tag Team Duo's," one to do the praying and one to catch the candidate (or shall I say the victim) before they hit the floor. We were reminded again and again that God was in that place in "mighty power" and thousands had already received this experience and we too should expect to receive it by releasing our mind, our spirit, and just simply letting go. I surveyed the congregation and I saw a "ripe and ready" group of people who were "straining at the leash," as it were, to run forward and receive what they all had been waiting for.<br><br>All the "prayer teams" were in place. The "wild and fast-paced" background music was setting the mood and stirring the emotions. There was only one thing left to do: on your mark, get set, get ready, GO!! When the minister gave the invitation to come forward, hundreds of people filled the front and every aisle instantly. This is when "chaos" and complete "pandemonium" broke out all over the place.<br><br>Can you imagine? Loud music playing, over two thousand people clamoring, prayer teams administering their "magical prayer," hundreds of people falling to the floor and flopping around like fish out of water, and those left standing were jerking their bodies in weird ways.<br><br>If you were to take away the audio and play only the video portion of this service to some stranger and ask them to describe what they were seeing, they would most likely say that it was a "rock concert" where people were doing the "jerk" (a style of dance) under the influence of LSD and other psychedelic drugs.<br><br>I saw one woman bend slightly over and put her hands on her hips and begin to flap her elbows up and down and move her head forward and backward like a chicken. I wasn't close enough to hear her, but it would not have surprised me if she had been cackling like a hen. Beloved, I don't believe the Holy Spirit would make people act like animals. I do, however, believe that an unholy spirit would.<br>I noticed one of the "catchers" that was behaving in a very strange manner. He lifted his shoulders up toward his neck and leaned forward, which made him look like the "hunchback of Notre Dame." As the candidates were falling he would ease them down to the floor and then he would jump up and down repeatedly looking to his left and then to his right with a diabolical smile on his face as if to say, "Oh Boy! Oh Boy! there goes another one."<br><br>I could go on and on about the strange behavior that we saw that night, but it isn't necessary. My Bible says, "Let all things be done decently and in order." (I Cor. 14:40). Elmer, Felton, and I left about twenty minutes before midnight and the service (or shall I say the "circus") was still going strong. Only God knows when they all went home.<br><br>On our way back to the motel, we discussed our experience and weighed all that we had seen and heard. "In the light of the scriptures" and we found it, to say the least, "wanting." I believe that many, if not most of the people that attended this meeting were very sincere in what they were doing. I might also add, "the road to hell is paved with sincerity." Religious man without Christ has a huge void that must be filled with something. There is something very wrong and very evil about seeking anything other than Christ our Lord. We shouldn't seek an experience, manifestation, or any type of phenomenon. Simon the "sorcerer" was rebuked by Peter for his evil desire for "the power" to do what Peter and the other apostles were doing. (Acts 8:18-21) The great preacher, Dr. A.B. Simpson said, "You don't need healing; you need the 'healer.' You don't need deliverance; you need the 'deliverer.' You don't need salvation; you need the 'saviour.'"<br><br>Summary<br>In closing, I would like you to consider the following scriptures: "For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." (Matt. 24:24).<br><br>"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." (II Thes. 2:10-12).<br><br>"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And I will profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity." (Matt. 7:22-23).<br><br>Beloved, I know that I will have to stand before God one day and give an account of what I have done and what I have said. I confess unto you that if God calls me home today that I will stand by what I have written in this account because of what the word of God teaches. I make no apology, but rather feel it to be my responsibility and duty before God to be honest and tell the truth. "If ye continue in my word," (not 'signs and wonders,' not seeking to be 'slain in the spirit,' not anything else) "then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." (John 8:31, 32).<br><br>Make up your own mind: -- does this eye witness account sound like "revival" or is it a "satanic counterfeit?" You be the judge.<br><br>[This message has been edited by noel (edited 06 March 2001).]</div>

Being a resident of Florida and active in the Lord's work, this news caused my spiritual antenna to go up immediately. I listened with rapt attention to the description of this reported revival that began on Father's, Day 1995. By its description, it sounded like a continuation or duplication of the widely acclaimed "Toronto Revival." It was reported that some school teachers and students were "falling to the floor" in their classrooms after attending this church in west Florida. People all over the community were being changed by the experience they received at this meeting. Thousands upon thousands -- in fact, it has been reported that over two hundred thousand people from all over the United States and foreign countries -- have attended this protracted meeting in Pensacola, Florida. Those who keep the records report that over fifteen thousand conversions have taken place.<br><br>After returning home to Jacksonville, Florida, I prayed about whether or not I should attend this meeting. Several days passed before I received a witness in my spirit that it was o.k. to go and visit. I also discussed my plans with Brother Thomas. His response was, "Go and see what it's all about. If God is indeed visiting that place, we'll all go and partake." God wants us to have an open mind and not judge or castigate something from a distance, but rather to seek God with all our heart and truly measure all things in the "light of God's word," and to also try the spirits. "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world." (I John 4:1).<br><br>Jesus sent the disciples out in two's, and the word says, "that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established." (Matt. 18:16). Realizing that there is wisdom in the multitude of counsel, I invited two of my Christian brothers to go with me.<br><br>One of my traveling companions was Brother Elmer Enlow, a man of four score years, with a wealth of experience under his belt. He has been an Army Chaplain, has pastored several churches, was a college professor, and is a scholarly man who has seen about everything in his lifetime. My other traveling companion was Brother Felton Wall, who has traveled all over the world and also possesses a wealth of experience.<br><br>Before our departure, I called the church in Pensacola to get directions and the schedule of their services. One of the assistant pastors took my call and was very cordial to me throughout the entire conversation. I had several questions for him -- they were as follows:<br><br>Answer: "No, this is something new the Lord has done in this area and is growing rapidly throughout the world."<br>2. Question: "Does a spirit of laughter overtake people during your services?"<br><br>Answer: "Some of the people laugh, however, it is not all consuming and is not a distraction to the service."<br><br>3. Question: "Do people fall to the floor after being prayed for?"<br><br>Answer: "Yes, several do, however; some do not. What you need to do is to come and experience this revival for yourself."<br><br>During this brief conversation I was told to come early or I would not get a seat. The special revival services are on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights beginning at seven o'clock.<br><br>Bright and early on Thursday morning, February 22, 1996, the three of us began our four hundred mile journey to Pensacola to witness for ourselves the reported revival and unusual phenomena that were taking place there. On the way we prayed together, asking God to give us His wisdom and keen discernment to know what was of God and what was of the flesh or the devil. Jesus said, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or whether I speak of myself." (John 7:17).<br><br>As Christians we do not have to be in the dark concerning such matters. Jesus also said, "My sheep follow me for they know my voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers." (John 10:4, 5). I can honestly say that all three of us were in agreement not to prejudge or come to any conclusion before we sat through the entire service with an open mind and honest heart.<br><br>After having a late lunch and refreshing ourselves at the motel, we were on our way to the church, prayerfully looking to God that He might have His way and to keep us in His perfect will during the entire evening. We arrived at the church at approximately five thirty p.m. on Thursday afternoon. Much to our surprise people were arriving in large numbers even at five thirty. I spoke to a young man in the parking lot and asked if he was a member of this church. He replied, "I feel like a member -- this is my thirty-fifth service since the revival began. However, I'm from Alabama." This response was not unusual as we soon learned that quite a few of the people had become regular attendants traveling several hundred miles every week. Surely something had an unusual power on these people for them to faithfully return time after time.<br><br>At last we were now in the church looking for a seat near the front so we could hear and see all that the Lord would reveal to us. After we found our seats, we took note of a steady stream of people pouring into the building. I asked Brother Elmer and Felton to hold my seat while I circulated throughout the sanctuary. I wanted to meet as many people as I could to find out where they were from and why they had come to this meeting. I must report to you that I met some very nice, kind, and sincere people from many states with a variety of religious backgrounds. Many of them had been to this revival more than once and some of them never before. I later learned that approximately one to two thousand visitors came to each of the four services every week. All without exception came for the same reason. They wanted to be "prayed for" and receive a supernatural experience so they could take it back to their family and to their church.<br><br>Song Service<br>At seven o'clock the service was called to order by one of the Elders and everyone was welcomed and made to feel at home. He asked all the visitors to raise their hands. There appeared to be several hundred if not a thousand visitors. Everyone was exhorted to give themselves to worship and to let God have His way in this service. As the musicians began to play and the singers began to sing I noticed a young woman going down the aisle and she took a seat about three pews in front of us. Just as soon as she greeted her friends she immediately began to shake her head left to right in a boisterous manner. I thought to myself, "Why is she doing that? Perhaps she has an infirmity, Parkinson's disease, or some type of palsy." Since I did not know a lot of the songs, I let my eyes scan over the congregation. I spotted quite a few people (men, women, and children) jerking their heads. Some would jerk backwards, some jerked side to side, and some jerked their shoulders as if they were frigid. I pondered, "Whatever this is, it seems to be spreading throughout the congregation." From time to time I could hear some laughter sprinkled here and there. However, it was not so loud as to disrupt the service.<br><br>The music gradually got louder and louder and the singing likewise grew louder. The musicians and singers were extremely talented and were dancing in a tasteful way as they performed flawlessly for us all. When I say "performed" I mean as in a professional group that puts on a show for the audience. However, I must hasten to add that I believe that they were very sincere in what they were doing. The truth is, there was "no anointing" on it. I believe that the entire song service was for the most part an exercise in the flesh. On one occasion, one of the ministers interrupted the song service to exhort the congregation to "let themselves go" ... "do not think about what you are doing" ... "just give yourselves completely to the spirit." My Bible says that we are to "sing with the spirit and with the understanding also." (I Cor. 14:15).<br><br>On another occasion the visiting evangelist stopped the song service to say this: "The devil is here tonight and wants to hinder this service. Well, I've got news for him -- he has to go. He" (the devil) "has analyzers here tonight." During the song service this young evangelist glanced at Elmer, Felton, and myself on more than one occasion. I am sure we were sticking out like sore thumbs, since we were obviously not taking part in the "wild frenzy" called worship. He (the evangelist) went on to say, "If you must analyze, then look at me, look at the musicians and singers, look at the congregation, look at the person to the left of you and to the right of you, and just analyze, analyze, analyze -- get it out of your system. Now let yourselves go: don't even think about what you are doing, forget about those around you and what they are doing. Release your mind -- release your spirit -- and let the mighty river of 'The Holy Ghost' take you wherever He wants you to go." I thought to myself, "Sir, I didn't just fall off a turnip truck, and although I'm not a genius, I wasn't born last week either." I certainly wasn't going to open my spirit up to this "wild, anything goes atmosphere." Jesus said, "Ye worship ye know not what . . . But the hour cometh, and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship him." (John 4:22-23).<br><br>Intermission<br>The worship service, or shall I say the "wild fire service," lasted about one hour and then we were given liberty to stretch our legs, go the bathroom, and visit with our neighbors in the congregation. On my way to the bathroom, in the foyer area, I noticed several tables full of audio and video tapes for sale. What a coincidence -- all these tapes appearing just in time for the intermission. Commerce is alive and well in many churches today.<br><br>During the intermission I engaged one of the elders in a conversation concerning the purported revival. I asked if anyone in the church had visited the acclaimed "Toronto Revival." He replied, "Yes, the pastor's wife has visited there." I asked if her visit was before or after the Pensacola revival began. He replied, "Oh, she visited several months before our revival began." Do you remember the question I asked the assistant pastor concerning the Pensacola revival? I asked him if this revival was similar to or related to the "Toronto Revival." His reply was, "No, that this was new and not related." What a coincidence! Could it be that the pastor's wife got the "blessing from Toronto" and brought it back to Pensacola?<br><br>I also asked this elder about the young woman who was shaking her head so boisterously. He assured me that this was the "power of God" upon this young woman's life. I asked if she did this only at church or if she continued to do this in her everyday life? He said, "She only does this at church." He also told me that several other young people had the same "gift" or "power" on their life and that it was a great honor to have it.<br><br>Pray tell me what glory would or could it bring to Christ to make someone shake their head violently until they became so dizzy they had to lie down on the pew? This poor girl got so dizzy she would literally fall down on the pew every fifteen to twenty minutes and continue to shake her body even while she laid there. Her friends covered her with a blanket so that she would not be exposed. After fifteen minutes of lying down she would get back up to start her shaking again. This cycle lasted for over four hours.<br><br>In every case in the Bible when it speaks of palsy (or uncontrollable shaking) it is either associated with a devil or an undesirable physical condition. In both cases Jesus and Peter would either cast the devil out or heal the person. "And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them." (Matt. 4:24). If those ministers had "the Power" or any "discernment" they would have either cast the devil out or healed this pitiful young woman. I must tell you that I had a strong desire to go and lay hands on her and resist the devil, however, I knew they would have thrown us out of the service, so I restrained myself.<br><br>Call To Order<br>After the intermission, I heard the song leader call everyone back into the sanctuary. The song service was continued for another fifteen minutes to get the people "back up to an emotional high" for something very important. It was time for one of the most (if not the most) important events of the night. It was time to take up "the offering." A huge six foot six two hundred fifty pound man came out and gave a very fervent appeal for a sizable offering. He said that the Lord had revealed to him that one person would give fifty thousand dollars, and another individual was to give one hundred thousand. He also said that the total offering should be in excess of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.<br><br>I believe that the Lord can do anything, but I don't believe that God uses the "power of suggestion" or psychology to get into the wallets of God's people. The word says, "Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver." (II Cor. 9:7). It is a shame and a disgrace the way ministers beg and plead for money. You would think that God is poor and about ready to declare bankruptcy if we little humans don't come to his rescue. God is not poor. "He owns the cattle on a thousand hills" (Psalms 50:10). He owns everything.<br><br>Ministry Time<br>The evangelist came to the pulpit and read two verses of scripture. (Rev. 12:10, 11) He spoke for approximately forty five minutes. Every ten minutes or so he would say, "Don't leave me now ... just hang in there ... we'll get to the good stuff soon," ("good stuff" meaning prayer time, when everyone would come up front to receive the "power" and be slain in the spirit). Isn't that pathetic? What could be more important than the word of God? Jesus said, "It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." (Matt. 4:4).<br><br>A true minister called and anointed by God should never have to make excuses or minimize the word of God. The apostle Paul preached until midnight on one occasion because the need was so great and the people were hungry. (Acts 20:7-11). There is a famine in the land -- not a famine of bread or of water but of hearing the word of God. (Amos 8:11).<br><br>This evangelist took most of his time explaining where he had been and the experiences that God had given him. He told of a great revival in England and a great man of God who had thousands coming to his meetings and people standing in lines for several city blocks waiting to get in. He told about walking over body after body (people who allegedly had been slain in the spirit) trying to get to the "great man of God" so that he too could be prayed for and receive the "power" and be slain in the spirit. Guess what? He got his wish. Now, God has called him to the United States to impart this great "power" and experience to all that come under the sound of his ministry -- so he says.<br><br>The speaker also spent a good deal of time comparing this revival to "The Great Awakening" during the time of Jonathan Edwards. He was preparing the congregation to receive an experience or some supernatural manifestation (more specifically the gift of "supernatural power" via being slain in the spirit). Could someone please show me in the scriptures where Christians are encouraged or instructed to seek an experience, power, or some supernatural manifestation? There is no such example in the entire Bible. "And ye shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart." (Jeremiah 29:13). We are to seek God not an experience. Jesus said, "An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas." (Matt. 12:39).<br><br>Altar Call<br>After the message (or shall I say, "the psychological conditioning and preparation"), he asked all of those who wanted to be saved to come to the altar. Only a handful came forward. This disturbed the minister, so he reached deeper into his bag of tricks and gimmicks. After thirty minutes of begging, pleading, and cajoling he had quite a few up front at the altar. He did not preach against sin nor did I discern any anointing upon his message.<br><br>The apostle Paul's preaching was quite different: "And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in the power of God." (I Cor. 1:2,4) After the apostle Peter preached his sermon he did not beg or even give an altar call. "Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?" (Acts 2:37). Any preacher that God calls and anoints will have the same results as Paul and Peter. We shouldn't have to beg or use manmade methods, for it is certain that his word will not return void. (Isaiah 55:11).<br><br>Time For The Good Stuff<br>After the altar call, the minister began to give instructions to all the visitors who had come to receive "the power" and be slain in the spirit. He said that we shouldn't let anyone pray for us unless they were wearing a purple badge, which identified them as being a part of the official ministry team. There were approximately twenty-five "Tag Team Duo's," one to do the praying and one to catch the candidate (or shall I say the victim) before they hit the floor. We were reminded again and again that God was in that place in "mighty power" and thousands had already received this experience and we too should expect to receive it by releasing our mind, our spirit, and just simply letting go. I surveyed the congregation and I saw a "ripe and ready" group of people who were "straining at the leash," as it were, to run forward and receive what they all had been waiting for.<br><br>All the "prayer teams" were in place. The "wild and fast-paced" background music was setting the mood and stirring the emotions. There was only one thing left to do: on your mark, get set, get ready, GO!! When the minister gave the invitation to come forward, hundreds of people filled the front and every aisle instantly. This is when "chaos" and complete "pandemonium" broke out all over the place.<br><br>Can you imagine? Loud music playing, over two thousand people clamoring, prayer teams administering their "magical prayer," hundreds of people falling to the floor and flopping around like fish out of water, and those left standing were jerking their bodies in weird ways.<br><br>If you were to take away the audio and play only the video portion of this service to some stranger and ask them to describe what they were seeing, they would most likely say that it was a "rock concert" where people were doing the "jerk" (a style of dance) under the influence of LSD and other psychedelic drugs.<br><br>I saw one woman bend slightly over and put her hands on her hips and begin to flap her elbows up and down and move her head forward and backward like a chicken. I wasn't close enough to hear her, but it would not have surprised me if she had been cackling like a hen. Beloved, I don't believe the Holy Spirit would make people act like animals. I do, however, believe that an unholy spirit would.<br>I noticed one of the "catchers" that was behaving in a very strange manner. He lifted his shoulders up toward his neck and leaned forward, which made him look like the "hunchback of Notre Dame." As the candidates were falling he would ease them down to the floor and then he would jump up and down repeatedly looking to his left and then to his right with a diabolical smile on his face as if to say, "Oh Boy! Oh Boy! there goes another one."<br><br>I could go on and on about the strange behavior that we saw that night, but it isn't necessary. My Bible says, "Let all things be done decently and in order." (I Cor. 14:40). Elmer, Felton, and I left about twenty minutes before midnight and the service (or shall I say the "circus") was still going strong. Only God knows when they all went home.<br><br>On our way back to the motel, we discussed our experience and weighed all that we had seen and heard. "In the light of the scriptures" and we found it, to say the least, "wanting." I believe that many, if not most of the people that attended this meeting were very sincere in what they were doing. I might also add, "the road to hell is paved with sincerity." Religious man without Christ has a huge void that must be filled with something. There is something very wrong and very evil about seeking anything other than Christ our Lord. We shouldn't seek an experience, manifestation, or any type of phenomenon. Simon the "sorcerer" was rebuked by Peter for his evil desire for "the power" to do what Peter and the other apostles were doing. (Acts 8:18-21) The great preacher, Dr. A.B. Simpson said, "You don't need healing; you need the 'healer.' You don't need deliverance; you need the 'deliverer.' You don't need salvation; you need the 'saviour.'"<br><br>Summary<br>In closing, I would like you to consider the following scriptures: "For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." (Matt. 24:24).<br><br>"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." (II Thes. 2:10-12).<br><br>"Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And I will profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity." (Matt. 7:22-23).<br><br>Beloved, I know that I will have to stand before God one day and give an account of what I have done and what I have said. I confess unto you that if God calls me home today that I will stand by what I have written in this account because of what the word of God teaches. I make no apology, but rather feel it to be my responsibility and duty before God to be honest and tell the truth. "If ye continue in my word," (not 'signs and wonders,' not seeking to be 'slain in the spirit,' not anything else) "then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." (John 8:31, 32).<br><br>Make up your own mind: -- does this eye witness account sound like "revival" or is it a "satanic counterfeit?" You be the judge.<br><br></div></blockquote>this version is in bold easier fer reading lah =)<br><br>[This message has been edited by noel (edited 06 March 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"My comments: Truly inspiring. Though the authour is a Christian, he rebukes many common Christians' ideology. e.g ideas that man are sinners is created by man himself. If God sees us as sinners, doesn't God has the ability to put sinners in hell right this very moment? Also the common saying saying that Christianity as the only path to God/heaven is created by man's fear in losing to other religion. "<br><br>The above quote was from the start of this discussion and i want to just highlight several things:<br><br>1) Christianity is based on teh Bible, everything that we say and believe should come from teh Bible and no where else. ANd teh Bible explicitly states, that we are sinners, and that Jesus Christ is "the way" to God. Anything deviating form this is not Christianity as you are already deviating from the Bible.<br><br>2) God is perfect. And he gave us the free will in creating us. Unfortunately, we decided to use that free will to disobey God. God being perfect is also just and fair, in keeping with the thought that He is perfect. Hence, he cannot tolerate evil. He is just. If wrong things are done, it must be punished, and in the case of everyone, it is death.<br><br>3) God does have teh ability to obliterate us all. But He is giving us the chance to repent now. 2 Peter 2:9 "He is patient, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance." 2 Peter 2:10 "But the day of the lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and teh earth and everything in it will be laid bare."<br><br>4) I acknowlage that you have mentioned that i should go off and read the book before i say anything, i still havent' really got time to go off and find it. But please take this word of caution 2 Timothy 4:3 " .... Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great numer of teachers who will say what their itching ears want to hear."<br><br>I've read a few of your other messages on this discussion. And i must say that whatever your church is doing i do not agree with it. My church here, in London (yes i'm really taht far away), has a good principle, if we preach anything that is wrong and not accoriding to the Bible, please bring it up to us.  Hence everything is centred around the God's word.<br><br>You orobably think i'm some soet of Christian Fundamentalist who stands around the corner of teh street shouting to everyone repent and believe. But no, i acutally just re0deiscovered my faith in the past year with teh previous 10 yrs, undergoing what you sound like going through now.<br><br>There is a stark difference between Christianity and most religiongs... give me a few days to dig up that materail .<br><br>Good Day till then.<br><br></div>

Little<br><br>There is, currently, in our shrinking modern world, a meeting of cultures, nations, races, and religions on a scale unprecedented in history. In this jet age we are no more than 24 hours away from any spot on the earth. Television brings into our living rooms the coronation of a pope, the burning of a Buddhist monk, and a Muslim ceremony conducted by a political leader.<br>Almost 100,000 students from more than 150 countries of the world come to the United States every year to study in more than 2,000 colleges and universities in every one of the 50 States. Brightly coloured saris on graceful Indian women and striking turbans on erect Sikhs are not unfamiliar sights in our metropolitan areas or small college towns. In addition, there are multiplied thousands of diplomatic, business, and tourist visitors ever year.<br>Many of these visitors find their way into Parent-Teacher Association meetings, service clubs, and churches to speak on their cultural and religious backgrounds. They are sincere, educated, and intelligent.<br>As one has contact with these friends from overseas and becomes aware of their religious beliefs, the question naturally arises as to whether or not Christianity is unique among world religions. Or is it only a variation on a basic theme running through all religions? To put it another way, "Does not the sincere Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, or Jew worship the same God as we do, but under a different name?" Or, quite bluntly, "Is Jesus Christ the only way to God?"<br>In answering this question, it is extremely important that we first empty it of its potentially explosive emotional content. When a Christian asserts that Jesus Christ is the only way to God, and that apart from him there is no salvation, he is not suggesting that he thinks he is, or that Christians in general think they are, better than anyone else. Some people erroneously view Christians as having formed a bigoted club, like a fraternity with a racial segregation clause. If only the fraternity and the Christians were less bigoted, such people think, they would vote to change their membership rules and, in the case of the Christians, let in anyone who believes in God. "Why bring Jesus Christ into it?" we are often asked. "Why can't we just agree on God?" And this brings us to the fundamental issue.<br>Christians assert that Jesus Christ is the only way to God because Scripture says, "And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). Christians believe this, not because they have made it their rule, but because Jesus Christ taught it: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). A Christian cannot be faithful to his Lord and affirm anything else. He is faced with the problem of truth. If Jesus Christ is who he claims to be, then we have the authoritative word of God himself on the subject. If he is God and there is no other Saviour, then obviously he is the only way to God. Christians could not change this fact by a vote or by anything else.<br>There are some laws the penalty for which is socially determined. There are other laws of which this is not true. For instance, the penalty for driving through a stop light is determined by society. It is not inherent in the act itself. The penalty could be set at $25 or at $5, or it could be abolished completely.<br>With the law of gravity, however, the penalty for violation is not socially determined. People could vote unanimously to suspend the law of gravity for an hour, but no one in his right mind would jump off the roof to test it! No, the penalty for violating that law is inherent in the act itself, and the person who violated it would be picked up with a blotter despite the unanimous resolution!<br>As there are inherent physical laws, so there are inherent spiritual laws. One of them is God's revelation of himself in Christ. Another is Christ's death as the only means of reconciling man to God.<br>In proclaiming the exclusiveness of Christ, a Christian has no right to assume a superior posture. He speaks as a sinner saved by grace. As D. T. Niles, of Ceylon, so beautifully put it, "Evangelism is just one beggar telling another beggar where to find food."<br>After defusing the emotional bomb, it is then important to move on to the important question of truth. Sincerely believing something does not make it true, as anyone will testify who has ever picked a wrong bottle out of a medicine cabinet in the dark. Faith is no more valid than the object in which it is placed, no matter how sincere or how intense the faith is. A nurse very sincerely put carbolic acid instead of silver nitrate in the eyes of a newborn baby. Her sincerity did not save the baby from blindness.<br>These same principles apply to things spiritual. Believing something doesn't make it true any more than failing to believe truth makes it false. Facts are facts, regardless of people's attitudes toward them. In religious matters, the basic question is always, Is it true?<br>Take, for instance, the fact of the deity, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christianity affirms these facts as the heart of its message. Islam, on the other hand, denies the deity, death, and resurrection of Christ. On this very crucial point, one of these mutually contradictory views is wrong. They can't simultaneously be true, no matter how sincerely both are believed by how many people.<br>A great deal is said about the similarity of world religions. Many people naÃ¯vely assume that other religions are basically the same, making the same claims and essentially doing what Christianity does, but in slightly different terms.<br>Though there are some similarities, the differences far outweigh, and are much greater than, the similarities.<br>One of the similarities is the essence of the Golden Rule, which is contained in almost every religion. From Confucius' time we have the statement, in various forms, that one should do unto others as he would have others do unto him. Many wrongly assume that this is the essence of Christianity. But if all Jesus Christ did was to give us the Sermon on the Mount and the Golden Rule, he actually increased our frustration. As we have already seen, man has had the Golden Rule since Confucius' time. Man's problem has never been not knowing what he should do. His problem, rather, has been that he lacks power to do what he knows he should.<br>Christ raised the ethical level and thereby made the requireÂ­ments higher. This by itself raises our frustration level. But that is not all Christ did, and this is a major difference between Christianity and other religions. Christ offers us his power to live as we should. He gives forgiveness, cleansing, and his own righteousness, all as a free gift. He reconciles us to God. He does something for us we cannot do for ourselves.<br>Every other religious system, however, is essentially a do-it-yourself proposition. Follow this way of life, they say, and you will gain favour with God and eventually achieve salvation. In a sense, other religious systems are sets of swimming instructions for a drowning man. Christianity is a life-preserver.<br>D. I. Niles has also observed that in other religions good works are an "in order to". In Christianity, they are a "therefore". In other religions, good works are the means by which one hopes to earn salvation. In Christianity, salvation is received as a free gift through the finished work of Christ; the "therefore" of good works becomes an imperative love of God. Or, as another has put it, other religions are "do"; Christianity is "done".<br>Christianity is what God has done for man in seeking him and reaching down to help him. Other religions are a matter of man seeking and struggling toward God.<br>Because of this profound difference, Christianity alone offers assurance of salvation. Because our salvation depends on what God has done for and given us, we can say with the same wonderful certainty of the Apostle Paul, "We are . . . willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord" (2 Corinthians 5:8, KJV).<br>In every "works" religion, however, it is impossible ever to have assurance. When do you know that you have done enough good works? You never know, and never can know. Fear persists because there is no assurance of salvation.<br>What salvation is, and what we are pointing toward, is quite different in the world's religions from what it is in Christianity.<br>In Buddhism, for instance, the ultimate goal is nirvana, or the extinction of desire. According to Buddha's teaching, all pain and suffering come from desire. If this desire can be overcome by following the Eightfold Path to Enlightenment, one can achieve nirvana, which is total nothingness. It is likened to the snuffing out of a candle. This is what is supposed to happen to life and consciousness when nirvana has been achieved.<br>In Hinduism the ultimate goal is also nirvana, but the term here has a different meaning. Nirvana is ultimate reunion with Brahm, the all-pervading force of the universe which is the Hindu's god. This experience is likened to the return of a drop of water to the ocean. Individuality is lost in the reunion with "God," but without the total self-annihilation of Buddhism. Nirvana, in Hinduism, is achieved through a continuous cycle of birth, life, death, and rebirth. As soon as any animal, insect, or human being dies, it or he is immediately reborn in another form. Whether one moves up or down the scale of life depends on the quality of moral life one has lived. If it has been a good life, one moves up the scale with more comfort and less suffering. If one has lived a bad life, he moves down the scale into suffering and poverty. If he has been bad enough he is not reborn as a human being at all, but as an animal or insect. This law of reaping in the next life, the harvest of one's present life, is called the law of Karma. It explains why Hindus will not kill even an insect, not to mention a sacred cow, though these inhibitions pose grave sanitation and public health problems. What seems strange, curious, and even ludicrous to us of the western world has a very clear rationale to the Hindu, and to us once we understand his thinking.<br>In Islam, heaven is a paradise of wine, women, and song. It is achieved by living a life in which, ironically, one abstains from the things one will be rewarded with in paradise. In addition to this abstention, one must follow the Five Pillars of Islam: repeating the creed, making a pilgrimage to Mecca, giving alms to the poor, praying five times daily, and keeping the fast of the month of Ramadan.<br>Again, there is no possibility of assurance. I have often asked Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists whether they would achieve nirvana or go to paradise when they died. I have not yet had one reply in the affirmative. Rather, they referred to the imperfection of their lives as being a barrier to this realization. There is no assurance in their religious systems because salvation depends on the individual's gaining enough merit.<br>Even the fundamental concept of God, on which there is a plea that we should agree, reveals wide divergences. To say that all who believe in God can unite, regardless of what this God is called, fails to recognize that the term God means nothing apart from the definition given it.<br>Buddha, contrary to popular belief, never claimed to be deity. In fact, he was agnostic about the whole question of whether God even existed. If God existed, the Buddha taught emphatically, he could not help an individual achieve enlightenment. Each person must work this out for himself.<br>Hindus are pantheistic. Pan means "all" and theistic means "God". Hindus believe that God and the universe are idenÂ­tical. The concept of "maya" is central to their thinking. Maya means that the material world is an illusion and that reality is spiritual and invisible. Brahm is the impersonal, all-pervading force of the universe, and the ultimate goal is for man to be reunited with this "God" in nirvana. Buddhism also teaches that the material world is an illusion. It is readily apparent why modern science came to birth through Christians, who believed in a personal God and an orderly universe, rather than in the context of Oriental philosophy. It is clear why most scientific progress has come from the West rather than the East. Why would one investigate what he believes is an illusion?<br>In Islam and Judaism we have a God much closer to the Christian concept. Here God is personal and transcendent, or separate from his creation. Surely, we are urged, we may get together with those who believe in God in personal terms.<br>But as we examine the Muslim concept of God - "Allah," as he is called in the Koran - we find he is not the God and Father of Jesus Christ, but rather, as in all other instances, a God of man's own imagination. Our knowledge of Allah comes from the Koran, which came through Mohammed. Mohammed, like Buddha and unlike Jesus Christ, did not claim deity. He taught that he was only the prophet of Allah. The picture of God which comes through to us in the pages of the Koran is of one who is totally removed from men, one who is capricious in all of his acts, responsible for evil as well as for good, and certainly not the God who "so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16). It is this totally distant concept of God that makes the idea of his becoming man utterly inconceivable to the Muslim. How could their god, so majestic and beyond reach, have contact with mortal man in sin and misery? The death of God the Son on the cross is likewise inconceivable to a Muslim, since this would mean God was defeated by his creatures - an impossiÂ­bility to the Muslim.<br>The Jewish concept of God is closest of all to the Christian. Isn't the God whom they worship the God of the Old Testament, which the Christian accepts? Surely they can get together on this!<br>Again, however, closer examination shows that the Jews would not admit their God was the Father of Jesus Christ. In fact, it was this very issue that precipitated such bitter controversy in Jesus' time. We accept God, they said to Christ, but we do not accept you because as a man you make yourself God, which is blasphemy.<br>In a conversation with the Jews, Christ discussed this quesÂ­tion. "God is our Father," they said. Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God . . . He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God" (John 8:42, 47). In even stronger words he says, "You are of your father the devil" (v. 44).<br>Christian missionary history has numerous examples of those who have been following other gods or an unknown god but who have responded when presented with the truth about Jesus Christ. They have immediately realized that he is the true God, whom they have been seeking.<br>Scripture is clear throughout the Old and New Testaments that worship of gods other than the true God originates with the devil. "They sacrificed to demons which were no gods" (Deuteronomy 32:17), and "No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God" (1 Corinthians 10:20).<br>In contrast to the great religious leaders of the world, Christ alone claims deity. It really doesn't matter what one thinks of Mohammed, Buddha, or Confucius as individuals. Their followers emphasize their teachings. No so with Christ. He made himself the focal point of his teaching. The central question he put to his listeners was, "Whom do you say that I am?" When asked what doing the works of God involved, Jesus replied, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent" (John 6:29).<br>On the question of who and what God is, the nature of salvation and how it is obtained, it is clear that Christianity differs radically from other world religions. We live in an age in which tolerance is a key word. Tolerance, however, must be clearly understood. (Truth, by its very nature, is intolerant of error.) If two plus two is four, the total cannot at the same time be 23. But one is not regarded as intolerant because he disagrees with this answer and maintains that the only correct answer is four.<br>The same principle applies in religious matters. One must be tolerant of other points of view and respect their right to be held and heard. He cannot, however, be forced in the name of tolerance to agree that all points of view, including those that are mutually contradictory, are equally valid. Such a position is nonsense.<br>It is not true that "it doesn't matter what you believe as long as you believe it". Hitler's slaughter of five million Jews was based on a sincere view of race supremacy, but he was desperately wrong. What we believe must be true in order to be real. Jesus said, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). There are many ways to Christ, but if we are to know the true and living God in personal experience, it must be through Jesus Christ, the only way to God.<br><br></div>
