            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah i think even if they really return all , i bet all the babies are already contaminated with human scent liao lor . If her friends know abt such precautions , they wun even accept it n should tell the giver that should keep for at least 2 - 3 months before giving away lor . So i think now even if you return all the babies , the mother wun be able to recognize liao , maybe even attack all the babies . Sigh alot of pple ony want to keep pets without proper knowledge on how to keep them lor . Some young gers even treat them as presents buy them to give as christmas presents where their reciever dun even like hamster but have no choice but to accept them first only to throw them somewhere then say oops i left them somewhere forgot to take .</div>

If her friends know abt such precautions , they wun even accept it n should tell the giver that should keep for at least 2 - 3 months before giving away lor . So i think now even if you return all the babies , the mother wun be able to recognize liao , maybe even attack all the babies . Sigh alot of pple ony want to keep pets without proper knowledge on how to keep them lor . Some young gers even treat them as presents buy them to give as christmas presents where their reciever dun even like hamster but have no choice but to accept them first only to throw them somewhere then say oops i left them somewhere forgot to take . </div></blockquote>omg just how much empathy people have lost in tis materialistic world</div>
