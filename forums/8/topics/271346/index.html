But he got his other buddy who is SUPER PRO and calls himself the 'brutaliser' Those Magneto , storm , sentinel, cable , ice man ,captain commando, characters.. he can just use Iron Man n Infinity combo your @ss to death.  He says he dun use those cheapo chip damage characters. He use the most odd and wierd characters. Like Juggernaut etc etc. Makes the fight more interesting...<br><br>but those characters in the hands of a pro... ur assist dies before your main char dies man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
