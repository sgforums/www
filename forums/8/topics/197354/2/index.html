Though he had not pressure her into the sales I do think he could have done more in his giving us an expert advice.<br><br>The bike she bought had a frame of 17". The top tube is slightly slanted towards the seat (and not totally horizontal) giving it a bit of a woman bike look. Still when she stands just above the top tube, she has to tip toe. There is no 1" clarence as mention by Wanda.<br><br>She went for it because she is pretty sure height will not be a problem for her. She has been riding bikes since a young age and has said that she even has no problem riding adult bike when she was in primary school. But that is on even tarmac. I just think she will have problem on a dirt  or hill track - which we hope to try out.<br><br>We bought the bike but it is not delivered yet. So I think there is still a possibility to change it. But the thing is there is not many other option.<br></div>
