            <div class='col-md body'>This weekend, i went out with my friend to city area to enjoy ourself.<br>I seldom take public transport as i have my own.<br>Really feel like missing out a lot of things. So many things to see no the MRT.<br>Saw some nice ones but i din approach any of them(pai sei or some say ham ji also can) *perhaps dun wanna throw my face*.<br>Many of these are going out single or with their female friends.<br><br>Q1)I wonder how many times are gers approached when they go out? And how many gers out there are waiting for a guy to shower their care and concern for them. Agree?<br><br>Then i went home and went into a so called friend search web site, i saw many singapore gers particate in it.<br>some of them are even not bad, quite nice looking ect.<br>But i notice a similarity, most of them are degree grads.<br><br>Q2)Is education really a problem when it comes to relationship? Personally i believe tat to a certain extend, it does matter as wooden door match wooden door, metal door match metal door. it is all due in the mentality thing. eg. u will notice that there is a difference when u tok to a grad and a O level holder(no offence). Why is it tat ppl goto go throught a third party to get to know their partner? Ego factor?<br><br>And lastly gers are much more focus compare to guys in terms of amcadamics.<br>they start work earlier(no ns)<br>they have special previlges(esp pretty ones but of cos some have barriers to promotion base on who is their boss)<br><br>So do u think this will lead to a social problem in the near future?<br>i got a strong feeling tat guys may in the end become househusband......<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
