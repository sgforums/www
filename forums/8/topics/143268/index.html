            <div class='col-md body'>Dog and Caique Parrot not getting along<br>I bought this wonderful Black Headed Caique, hand reared and incredibly tame a few weeks ago. It is very nice towards me and like to play on my shoulder and sit next to my PC. However, as soon as my dog comes by it gets very upset and protective and it has tried to fly in the face of it several times. An a couple of times my dog chased it too and it was nearly caught. Now I mostly keep him in the cage to avoid any potential accidents, but that is no good either. I have tried for a long time to let them get used to each other and at least tolerate one another, but to no help. I am soon giving up and considering to sell the little fellow. Anyone have had any similar experioences? or have any sugesstions on how to solve this dilemma?</div>

Your caique sees yur dog as a rival vying for your attention.<br><br>Not much u can do as its difficult to dote on both animals at the same time. Spending time with one will leave the other feeling lonely. Its never a good idea to have two possessive pets, you may have to consider giving one of them up.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My colleagues and friends (who own Parrots) tell me that parrots are territorial.  I don't think they like "intruders" or changes.  Your parrot will be very possessive so anyone or thing coming near you or between you both (you and parrot) will trigger some reaction from the parrot.  I was also told parrots can get depressed and suicidal.<br><br>Did you do some homework before buying it?  You may have to give one up.  I don't think they can/will get along.  Sorry to say that.</div>
