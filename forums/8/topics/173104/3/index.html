            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's a lousy exercise too.<br>Police and ambulance all stand by already loh. This exercise is more like telling people how efficient they can work on the spot. What about the time from explosion to the time of arrival of the police? So if next time really got terrorist attack, we can expect the police to be just at our dorrstep. Evacuation is quick: sure... with 50 of those volunteers and only 2~3 real passengers. Wait til the real thing happens.<br>Not being evil lah... but the news said got one lady really kanna shocked from the "bomb blast" right? THAT is good. It will actually allow the police and medic to really tend to a real casulty instead of those volunteers that are just instructed to lie down there and play dead.</div>

At least the can try out the SOPs.<br><br>perhaps the next exercise shd be held during peak period at orchard without having the police and such on standby. people involved must not leak out. and no bloody warning that it is going to happen in 15mins. wtf that was retarded.

            <div class='col-md body'>I find it funny that people keep complaining about the unrealistic scenario of the exercise. It is very unrealistic, the government even put up notices to warn about the exercise, terrorists of course don't give warnings as such.<br><br>Yes, it is so unrealistic. Look people, this is a freaking exercise, it's not real, get over it, if you have to make it so real, maybe suggest to the government to use some real bombs so real people die and then we have more realistic actions for everybody. By the way, make it so that the exercise last a few days, a realistic bombing of such scale on all the different stations could trigger alot of complications, maybe those who complain could make themselves useful and for making the exercise more realistic by doing something, such as burning down the MRT (partial or the entire station, up to you) instead of making noise that it's not realistic and a waste of tax payers money bla bla..<br><br>I guess people have no idea how tough it is to organise a national exercise of such scale, and how much planning was involved months before the exercise. Singaporeans, being typical singaporeans, hardly appreciate the efforts that others have put in. Overall, I do consider it to be a successful exercise, given the scale and complications that would be involved. I am happy about what they have done, to say the very least, some efforts to prepare for the worst to come, if any.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, have it ever cross anybody's mind that if it is a total surprise, of this scale, guess what might happen? The 999 police numbers will keep ringing, a few hundred people will be calling in to report on the scene. Those people that really needs to contact the police, the lines are jammed.<br><br>Some asmathic patient had a relapse and need to call hospital, but guess what? The crowd jammed the lines as the MRT has so many "casualties". That asmatic patient has to resign to fate and just die.<br><br>There may be a stampede, because alot of people will panic, ends up there might be a few very real deaths and injuries. Not only more people will be affected, the situation will be total chaotic, and the exercise being so realistic, is a total success with a few deaths. Maybe that's what people wanted.<br><br>It will cause a huge problem, a huge annoyance and total inconvience to the whole Singapore.  And those are the complications I have thought of, what about those that I have missed?<br><br>The exercise is well thought out, it allow the uniform groups to practise and have a feel of such a situation if it ever occurs, and at the same time, they minimize the disruptions on the public. They even chartered shuttle bus for the public so as to facilitate the transportation despite having such a major scale exercise.</div>
