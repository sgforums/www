              <p>In this day and age, do we still need section 55? It was used in the past to curb the rampant gang fights that took place all over Singapore. Is it still needed today?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In August 1958, the Ordinance was amended to provide for the <a title="Preventive detention" href="/wiki/Preventive_detention"><span style="color: #002bb8;">preventive detention</span></a> without trial of persons associated with criminal activities for up to six months.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup> During the Second Reading of the Amendment Bill, the Chief Secretary of the <a title="Legislative Assembly of Singapore" href="/wiki/Legislative_Assembly_of_Singapore"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Legislative Assembly of Singapore</span></a>, <a title="Edgeworth Beresford David" href="/wiki/Edgeworth_Beresford_David"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Edgeworth Beresford David</span></a>, said that such powers were needed to combat gang fights or other crimes committed by <a title="Secret society" href="/wiki/Secret_society"><span style="color: #002bb8;">secret society</span></a> members, particularly violent conflict between such societies. He noted that while in 1954 there had been 30 secret society gang fights, by 1957 the number had risen to 150, and in the first six months of 1958 there had already been 157 fights – double the rate for the previous year. Such fights were difficult for the police to detect and to prosecute, as eyewitnesses were too frightened of reprisals to furnish information leading to the arrests of gang members.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He said:</p>
              <blockquote class="templatequote">
              <div>It is in these circumstances that the Government has decided that more drastic steps must be taken to protect the public from the activities of these gangs, and that since, for the reasons I have given, it is not possible to achieve that protection through the normal judicial processes of the Courts, these safeguards, which are adequate in ordinary times, must, in the present abnormal crime-wave, be supplemented by executive action. It is not only the duty of the Government to do this in discharge of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and good order, but I believe that there is a wide public demand that such action should be taken and that it will meet with wholehearted support from all law-abiding members of the community.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></a></sup></div>

              <h3>1. Spirituality for dummies.</h3>
              <p>If you have the awareness level of a snail, and your thinking is mired in shame and guilt (with perhaps a twist of drug abuse or suicidal thinking), then subscribing to a religion can help you climb to a higher level of awareness. Your mindset, however, still remains incredibly dysfunctional; you’ve merely swapped one form of erroneous thinking for another.</p>
              <p>For reasonably intelligent people who aren’t suffering from major issues with low self-esteem, religion is ridiculously consciousness-lowering. While some religious beliefs can be empowering, on the whole the decision to formally participate in a religion will merely burden your mind with a hefty load of false notions.</p>
              <p>When you subscribe to a religion, you substitute nebulous group-think for focused, independent thought. Instead of learning to discern truth on your own, you’re told what to believe. This doesn’t accelerate your spiritual growth; on the contrary it puts the brakes on your continued conscious development. Religion is the off-switch of the human mind.</p>
              <p>Leave the mythology behind, and learn to think for yourself. Your intellect is a better instrument of spiritual growth than any religious teachings.</p>
              <h3>2. Loss of spiritual depth perception.</h3>
              <p>One of the worst mistakes you can make in life is to attach your identity to any particular religion or philosophy, such as by saying “I am a Christian” or “I am a Buddhist.” This forces your mind into a fixed perspective, robbing you of spiritual depth perception and savagely curtailing your ability to perceive reality accurately. If that sounds like a good idea to you, you’ll probably want to gouge out one of your eyeballs too. Surely you’ll be better off with a single, fixed perspective instead of having to consider two separate image streams… unless of course you’ve become attached to stereo vision.</p>
              <p>Religious “truths” are inherently rooted in a fixed perspective, but real truth is perspective-independent. When you substitute religious teachings for truth, you mistake shadows for light sources. Consequently, you doom yourself to stumble around in the dark, utterly confused. Clarity remains forever elusive, and the best answer you get is that life is one giant mystery. Religious mysteries, however, arise not from what is truly unknowable; they arise from the limitations of trying to understand reality from a fixed frame of reference.</p>
              <p>A more intelligent approach is to consider reality through a variety of different perspectives without trying to force your perceptions into an artificial religious framework.</p>
