            <div class='col-md body'>hey i ebay quite alot, yes its relatively safe..<br><br>if you're buying products, always check the selling history of the seller you're buying from...<br><br>make sure he has at least &gt;100 feedbacks with &gt;95% positive feedbacks, generally, you should also scan through his/her selling feedback history and read what readers have to say about him..<br><br>ironically, the thing about ebay is not whether we trust them but its rather whether "they trust us (buyers)"<br><br>some sellers do not ship overseas, as places like Brazil has a high record of fraud..<br><br>however, you're always strictly reminded <strong>NOT</strong> to buy virtual goods (eg: items from WoW// items from Diablo 2..etc etc)<br><br><strong>DO NOT</strong> mail money overseas as they can always pretend they never receive your money<br><br><strong>Ironically, you should never trust Singaporeans on www.ebay.com.sg</strong>: As i know of some idiots who put up their items just for fun and if the bid doesnt match their ideal price they'll just delete their account and f off.<br><br>Always email the seller regarding your queries before you actually bid<br><br>You should <strong>always only</strong> pay for your items using <a href="http://www.paypal.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.paypal.com</a> as it offers Buyer's Protection (ie, if you pay and that schmuck never ships) for non-virtual goods (ie, items that can be shipped).<br><br>The drawback of ebay is the shipping cost, especially with bulky goods.<br><br>You are reminded that a bid is a legally binding contract, so if you bid, and if you happen to win... you must pay!<br><br>Well, ebay is fun.. so have fun with it.. hope you find this helpful  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> <strong></strong></div>

But it really depends on what you are buying and the seller. Do take the seller's feedbacks seriously. Usually i only purchase from seller with not less than 98% positive feedback.<br>If you are buying Designer stuffs, make sure to recomfirm with seller if item is authentic. Check her selling history and see if she had sold similar items before and what are the buyers' remarks to it.<br><br>So far, i've only had two bad experience. One was for a T&amp;Co bracelet and the other was for American Eagle jeans. And both the sellers' feeback is below 97.5%.<br><br>Try not to send money. It is always better to use paypal or direct bank deposit. As for paypal, theres this buyer's claim thingy that could help you get your money back if the item you had paid for did not arrive.<br><br>Read through the item description before you place a bid.<br>I am sure you can get so much more stuffs from ebay.com than ebay.com.sg<br><br>If the US seller do not offer to ship to Singapore, You can always use Vpost!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
