            <div class='col-md body'>haha, are you sure you really wanna know? *grin*<br>well, for me, my "requirements" are pretty high.<br>1. he must be taller than me. i'm 1.68m, so the guy has definitely got to be at least 1.72... but i usually go for guys tt are abt 1.8++?<br>2. attractive. i'm not talking drop-dead gorgeous, but kan de shuang type; you get what i mean? which girl wld want a bf tt when she looks at him she feels totally zero physical attraction?<br>3. humourous. my guy definitely has to be able to make me laff and put up w my extreme mood swings. he's gotta be easy-going and relaxed, matured but not anal-retentive type.<br>4. he has to be a friend. he has to be someone i can talk to, not someone i'm only attracted to and interested in. he has to be the kind tt loves to talk cos i talk non-stop <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>5. he has to be acceptable to my frens and parents. i know this is very hypocritical and shallow, but i thk it's harder for the relationship to wk out if my frens hate my bf's guts, and near impossible if my parents dont like him.<br>6.most imptly, he has to love me. and i have to love him. in the end that's really all tt matters isnt it?<br><br>hmm, six lil pts... not all equally impt but these are basically what i want lor. what do the rest of you thk?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow!  Must be the most realistic answer yet on this board.  Not overly idealistic but "shallow" enough to be real.  Let's face it everyone has a bit of shallowness in them.  To some extents.<br><br>This is really unusual coming from a girl though because they aren't usuaslly so...realistic about their expectations.  And at least u admit these physical things that matter to u.<br><br>I was watching an episode of Payne and it hit up on the idea of relationship.  Why did these women marry who they married?  They actually didn't know, but the most important thing was that they felt something "wild" about each other.  basically they loved each other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm...it's interesting to note what girls look for in guys nowadays....frankly the "demands" seem to be getting more and more stringent.<br><br>Looking at Ataraxia's post about her requirements and her comments later, I have some of my own comments to add.....<br><br>1) You said you are 168, yet the guy should be like 180++ ??? Does that sound strange or what ? Does it mean you like to be kissing his neck or lower everytime ? Haha...For me I am only 166 for your info so obviously I am short of this requirement by nearly 14 cm....I could even buy a small RULER with the amount I am missing from 180 cm.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>2) Pleasing to the eye is subjective, but probably involves grooming as well. Personally I do take pains to look presentable, but hesitate to use gel/mousse/hairspray and other dandy things to spruce myself. Basically I just dress well and add a little cologne and then go out. But then again...the height thing is glaring isn't it ? So might as well "bo chap" because at this height no girl will notice me anyway (SARCASM INTENDED)...<br><br>3) Most guys are humourous...unless you meet a total blockhead who is bent on studying the latest development's in astrophysics....but the capacity to deal with girls' wild mood swings is totally beyond most guys ! Even friends who are attached tell me that....so don't keep your hopes up too high...<br><br>4) It's easy to be a friend sometimes, but hard to be a partner....as the saying goes..<br><br>5) Parental acceptance usually comes after the couple have gone steady and both parties have introduced their other half....so this isn't usually a glaring problem unless you've been keeping the relationship secret all this time.<br><br>6) Frankly, I could ignore the first 5 points and just concentrate on this one. Hey...you hit the nail on the head ataraxia ! Who cares about 1 to 5 as long as you both love each other ?? My point exactly !<br><br>I have had girls tell me this....that when they like a guy, they EXPECT the guy to know it, and EXPECT him to make the first move, even if they don't hint at all. If he assumes too much that they like him, he is in trouble because he cheapens the image of the girl; if he doesn't chase her then he's a wimp ! Wow....it's REALLY difficult to be a guy these days...ahem...<br><br>From this short little analysis, I conclude that if there are more girls like yourself looking for guys with such requirements, then I might as well seriously consider locking myself at home and brooding about becoming a surefire bachelor....no kidding....<br><br>NOTE: This is not a flame or an attack against Ataraxia, but merely using her post as a springboard to state my opinions. Any psychological distress caused is much regretted.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haha, relax, i thk i can safely say tt i wont have to seek counselling after reading your post.<br>well, abt your comments musicwhiz, i guess i gotta "defend" my conditions a little, cant go down w/o at least a lil ole fight can it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>1. firstly, the 1.8m thgie is somethg frm exp. usually, you'll find tt tt's the perfect ht.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> i guess you gotta exp it to know what i mean (no offence intended!)<br><br>2. what you said is true, in tt a guy who looks like tt hugo boss model or aniki jin but bathes on a monthly basis, has nv heard of oral hygience and thks tt all women shld stay pregnant and bound to the kitchen, wld not have many female admirers. in tt some way, a guy who's just slightly above average, or even below average can sometimes "transform" and look great with the help of some cologne and a great dress sense. perhaps i shld have said i wanted someone who was pleasing to the eye with "style"?<br><br>3. it's true tt most ppl are humourous, but honestly, how many guys show tt side in front of girls? sometimes their sense of humour is kinda off-key...... hmm, kinda hard to explain this pt. i guess the main pt is not whether he has a sense of humour but whether he can make me laff. having the former doesnt automatically imply being able to do the latter...<br>as for the mood swings, i know most guys dont understand it, but i guess it's a matter of tolerence? i dont want you to know exactly how menstrual cramps feel, or why i get irritated/POed just before my period, i just want you to be there for me, to put up with me and act as if everythg's fine. most of my male frens seem to be able to do tt quite well... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>4. heheh... nthg to say to this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> it's true lor... cos when you're attached you see more of your SO than you usually wld as a fren or as you wld like.<br><br>5. it's quite true tt parental acceptance usually only comes in when you guys are officially together but even then, it wld matter alot to me if my parents like him and accept him........<br><br>haha, i agree tt most gers are very demanding nowadays, but isnt it time for us to receive our dues? afterall, it's usually quite "obv" if you're trained to the signs and symptoms and know what to do to test it further... go read the topic abt how guys know if gers like them to know betta. most gers are surprisingly easy to read because they usually want you to know. kinda. be observant.... you'll only be labelled a wimp if it's glaringly obv tt she likes you and you like her but you dont do a thg. if you know tt she likes you but dont feel the same way, just act blur like a sotong. then the most is she'll say you're "stupid"... or just make it obv tt you see her as a fren but dont say tt you dont like her (practise some tact here guys!); how can she term you a wimp here? you dont like her mah, your fault meh?<br><br>all in all, these are basically qualities tt i wld LIKE in a guy, not hard and fast rules. afterall i did emphasise tt not all are equally impt but just tt it wld be sweet to have such a guy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> read my post abt SNAGS if you really wanna hear "unreasonable".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow ataraxia, quite high requirements leh, would you go after a guy if he meets your requirements?<br><br>I presume now you are probably still quite young(not that I am very old, but.....) so you can afford to chose the guys... Juz dun be too choosy and end up being unwanted when you are old(Just at which age is a woman considered old? 30? Hmmmmm)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I would like to touch on the humourous part because that is something I feel which is very important(Love of course being number 1)to the survival of a happy relationship.

            <div class='col-md body'>heheheh, honestly yes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> my last (and first) bf was one of the unfortunate victims of my attention. i guess in tt sense i'm very "liberal", and if i want anythg, i'll go all out to get it, whether it's an item, gd grades, or even a guy. *shrug* tt's me lor... bhb and thick-skinned.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>hmm, tt makes me wonder, what do you guys thk abt girls actively making the first move? i'm not tt obv abt it.... not all-out "attack" but more subtle, let him thk i'm juz being very "sweet", "nice" and tt he's slowly falling in love.... bwahahaha.. evil heh?<br>i guess some may find me very very fussy, which is true. i'm the kind of person, who if i dont get exactly what i want, i wont accept anythg else. but surprisingly, this doesnt extend to guys. :/ in "matters of the heart", i really let my heart decide, and my emotions take over. which is extremely stupid and naive if you thk abt it. which is why i have such requirements. i dont thk they're tt high, shld see my conditions for my ideal guy, haha.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> but, you guys have to realise, which most of my close guy frens also comment abt, tt no matter how many conditions or requirements i set, when i'm attracted to a guy and when i finally "fell in love"... haha. what a letdown. most are quite surprised when they see the guys i really like, a common comment wld be: "tt one ah? oh... thought he'll be more gd-looking." :/ i really wonder why this happens... maybe it's because i've always believed i wldnt meet the perfect guy, my soulmate, so i just "settle for 2nd best", in tt, all i care abt is whether he loves me and i "love" him. bad. and even worse, when i fall in love, i fall in love 100% after getting thru all my doubts and paranoia (as all true geminis shld exp...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) and become a total pushover. which was what happened w my ex and i was really very badly hurt. sigh. i guess i sound as if i'm still wallowing in self-pity eh? but i guess it's this built-in defense mechanism, "once bitten, twice shy" and i did a reality chk w my requirements. which is why i ended up w the condensed and "improved" version.<br></div>

I think so, just never really always  have the chance to be funny.<br>4.I'm everyones friend!<br>5.Your acceptable would mean, health wise and  respect for your friends and parents?<br>6.Whoa this one, love ah, well, I don't know,  nowadays, I'm afraid to give away love in    fear the other side is only 'acting' 'using'  me etc, but I think if I know I'm getting    real love, lots of love is what u get   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>edit-I've always managed to avoid being  bitten, at least cut the damage, all the  time, It's not hard to see it coming, I just  close the case immediatly, I've seen all my  poor guy friends, bitten so badly, I'm glad  I saw it coming and other shit like that.<br><br>so do you think we should date?!?! haha dont worry, the possibilities of it happening is P(&gt;0.0001) cause I'm out of reach, it's all talk, so dont be oppressed, just play along   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>oh btw, I find your fussyness very much like mine, and some other small similarities (of course they're small), so I wonder if a geek post back somewhere in the board, from slashdot, talking about how geeks shouldnt be looking for smart girls or girls like them etc, instead should look for bimbos etc holds true, I dont know, I've never tried dating a girl who is similar to me, I wonder what kind of fireworks it would hold :p, oh btw, what i can forsee is that, the fact that both of us are exploding with confidence typing shit like these, the prime way to hurt each other is if/ever we get hold of each others pictures, both/one side call the other ugly/unattractive whatever, well, thats the bomb (^_^)<br><br>For me, what I look for in  a girl?<br>1. at least 5'4, but if my calc arent wrong,  you're 5'6   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>2.attractive? oh yes, gotta have the curves  too. (see, you're not shallow, I'm much more  shallow, deep deep stuff), but no, not so  shallow to compromise intelligence for that,  I find dumb bimbos a COMPLETE TOTAL ULTRA  TURNOFF! naturally, not because it sounds  right. I mean, really, I feel sick around  people with no sign of intelligence.<br>3.finds life easy, and always finding    everything funny. positive outlook on    everything that is.<br>4.I think all girls are friends, so nvm bout  that.<br>5.It dont matter if she's acceptable to my  friends or parents, she's probably all that  matters.<br><br>basicly, when I fall/look for one, everything balances out, I never compromise for anything over another, imbalance sucks. they gotta come together, smarts, beauty, wits.<br><br>BUT BUT, i guess like everyother posts out there have said, if you're looking for one with such high requirements, chances are that she's taken or will be, she's chased by many many other guys etc, many guys better than u etc...I get that, understand it, will take the risk.<br><br>I guess it's either, I strike first and hold tight, or fate/luck, or mabye I'm the one. I'm willing to take all those chances, afterall, whats the rush...and yeah, a lot of times, like someone said<br><br>"with your kind of requirement, your ideal bf can get almost any kind of gf he wants, know what i mean? " I've met the situation where the girl can get any guy she wants, but lucky for me, I saw it coming, and manage to avoid being bitten, which put me back to step.1 like someone said<br>"you'll now have much more competitors and perhaps you'll be back at square one again?"<br><br>But hey hey, to improve all odds, I've always planned to have assets of $10mil, yeah baby, I'm working on it, dont even bother about any desires, as they come if you have the $, simple, sick, immoral, but it really works that way...I mean, imagine, cool condo, SEXY car, money never a problem, wow!, who can resist? (see, I'm really much shallower)<br><br>talking bout acting blur, sotong etc, sometimes it's just not enough! sometimes have to totally avoid eye contact, just so she starts forgetting about you...I mean, isnt the eyes the part that generates all that electricity? no electricity rice cooker dont work! :p<br><br>what? first and last? some case, I've also had a first and last, actually, there I was the bastard, poor her, now I think of it, I know I suck, but anyway, it's a lesson learnt, like avoid it at all costs...<br><br>actually, with such close similarities, I believe, if we ever were together, either side, if ever one side, critics the other, one is going to get real hurt, can we say BIG FAT OVERCONFIDENT ego? guess so.<br><br>but, as friends, specially of different sex, ie:no competition over mates, I think we can have a lot of fun being friends, ie, understanding each other, sharing views, etc...<br><br>[This message has been edited by greygoon (edited 01 November 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>after reading all the other posts, i reread my post to see if i said anythg wrongly. i kinda did... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>actually, the pt i was trying to emphasise in my 2nd (or was it my 3rd) post, before i started rambling again, was tt regardlss of my conditions, at the end, when push comes to shove, i'll still only follow my heart. tt's all i care abt... tt's the only thg tt rules me during a relationship. which is why i'm setting such "high" standards. i didnt higher my standards, i lowered them. it's all part of my BIGGG masterplan to become more practical. yup. i'm thking longgggg-term here. not tt i'll actually do it, but who wld know? console myself abit lah...<br><br>okok, let's try to summarise everythg to make it clearer. i guess, the reason why my conditions are set so "high" is because in the end i know when the relationship starts, all practicality flies out the window. so it's kinda to "balance" everythg out.<br><br>a common perception abt me it seems, is tt i'm confident. :/ erm... IMHO i'm not lor. very insecure and... hahaa. paranoid maybe? but most ppl who dont know me say i'm dao, bitchy, arrogant, etc. hmm, maybe i'm a really gd actress? dunno.<br><br>greygoon:<br>hmm, sounds intriguing......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> glad to meet up w a guy who's so similiar to me, perhaps when firewire sets the date for our nxt gathering??? anyway, quite true lor, two ppl who are too similiar usually make great frens and horrible partners.<br><br>i thk tt's abt it liao, feel like i'm hogging the "conversation" here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> 'til nxt time, hope to hear more POVs?<br><br>PS. ataraxia's the title of a song in Everclear's "latest" album, So Much For The Afterglow : my fave band!!!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, so many people think that ur requirements are really high....  I, and Greymoonwalker must be the only people here who think otherwise...then again, I think that greymoon was saying that it is kinda high, but he could live up to it...correct?   :-)<br><br>Again, in all honesty, I really believe that it is a reasonable request and, as with all requirements, usually fly out the window when u add how u feel into it.  Most times it's like this, but u still look for people with these requirements...Good to know that u don't *just* settle for people w ur requirements.<br><br>I always believed that as long as she's attractive(My GF *must* have style ...*must*), and I feel attracted to her, then everything can be worked out...unless there is a real fundamental difference in character.  But everything such as mood swings, bad temper, lousy fucks, bad attitude, etc... can be worked out...that's what the whole idea of a relationship is about.<br><br>Hmmm, but must have style.  Mainly becasue I have it and do care about it...wouldn't want a girlfriend who dress in pokka dotted hoola skirts like back in the 80's with ripped pantyhose and 5 meter high hair, and gum chewing spitter walking alongside me.  The differences would be just too glaring. :-)  Shallow?  Definately...Realistic? Yes.<br><br>The only thing that I have a problem with is my height.  I have always felt and known that because of my height (1.72), many girls have passed me over...shame, but I can't change that...:-)<br><br>As for Greymoon, I for one know when it's goona end.  I'm very observant and can read people and situations very well (it comes from a lifetime of introspection and watching people and behaviors because I wasn't popular enough to be with the group...different now tho).  All my relationships, I know when it's coming.  I don't do anything about it tho.  Usually I just let the thing run it's course and I let the girl break off...only once I broke off...now I regret, but it was for the best because she was seeing (fucking) someone else.  Now that I think about it, I didn't really mmind that much anyway...as long as she was happy...doens't make me a pushover tho...try having a girl get me angry..which is very, very hard to do in the first place...If I do, see wether the girl can stand....:-) (No I won't puch them!!! Not that type lah!) I prefer psychological toture best as I got tons(literally0 of patience and bo chap-ness.  Doesn't mean I don't care, just that I've had to spend most of my life as a geek nerd hiding my emotions and feelings from people...now it comes in handy..HA HA HA !!!! Who says nice guys don't have sadistic sides to them.<br><br>Ultimately i feel that it doesn't matter who breaks it off, but I could never bring myself to hurt the person that I cared about...Which is why I would prefer never to break it off first...unless I knew it had to be done...:-)Not stupid eh....<br><br>he he, seems I finally know someone in singapiore who is a guy that is vain.  Same here man.  My friends always complain...Every time must wait for me to shower and get dressed...Go to the beach also must look nice..Go market also must do hair....<br><br>From girls:  Wah, ur shower and preparations take longer than mine do...What the hell do u do every morning?<br><br>Heh heh...Just paranoid of ever falling back to where I used to be...geek, dork..etc...Really dressed like shit back then...would love to show u people a picture of my then picture.  :-)  Evrytime I go to a relatives house, I see that picture hanging on the wall, I just wanna shrivel up and die.<br><br>ha ha.   And When I set up a meeting again, u two better be there man...hmm, feel like going to Funkytown next time...hmm.:-)<br><br>BTW: go to my website to see me.  I'm 25, but don't look like....no wonder I don't feel like it.  I still really don't feel 25.<br>It's not finished yet, but my foto section is up so go and see...but the srever is a bit slow...and wait for the page to load completely first before clicking..or else all my hard work designing all the graphics goes to waste....<br><a href="http://firewire.4mg.com" rel="nofollow">http://firewire.4mg.com</a><br><br>cheers people..and remember...It's not the high expectation that will be ur undoing, but ultimately what ur feelings can accept or not accept.</div>
