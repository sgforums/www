            <div class='col-md body'>Hm... let's see I don't think that I require so much outta my guy.<br><br>Erm.. in terms of height:<br>Well, firstly I'm quite short (157cm around there), so it would be <strong>IDEAL</strong> if my guy is not past 175cm).<br>*hint to a certain somebody: 170 is perfect*<br><br>Next, which is highly important:<br>his <strong>CHARACTER</strong><br>What is a man without character? He's gotta be able to make decisions wisely, have a back bone of his own, etc.<br>Another important factor is that he must have a sense of humor. Imagine me trying my best to tell a joke and he looking at me stoned faced.. it's very humiliating.<br>Hm.. oh and we must be able to <strong>COMMUNICATE</strong>. I mean if we can't communicate, as in we can't understand each other..there is no point in having a relationship, as it will end in no time. I want a partner whom I can share my joys and sorrows with, and I'm sure it is the same with all of you.<br>Last but not least, he must love me for who I am.. and what I am.. not how I look, how I dress, etc. In turn, I will love and accept him for himself.<br><br>Hm.. this may sound stupid, but last time when I was ultra borred, I came up with an "Ideal Guy" list and showed it to my guy friends. One of em did the test and flunked it, and both of us agreed that he didn't fit the list at all, but he told me that when the right guy comes along, the list wouldn't matter at all.. and he's right.. cos I think that he may be my ideal guy after all!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>~Peiyi<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i find ataraxia's requirement very realistic what. Not high. Especially the part about "frens and parents accepting him" i think this is very important if you want the relationship to be a long term one. This is very important for guys as well ... cos the ger most probably will live with your parents after marriage .... i think a bit far i know but i just dun want to go out with a person who i will not consider to be a spouse.<br><br>You know your parents well(should be right ?), hence you'll know if they will accept this person or not even before they meet him/her. Don't you think so ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow. completely shocked when i saw this topic again, didn't we finish this last year??!! well, looking back, this really brings back great memories of the forum like it used to be.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> but what really struck me when i looked through it, was how seriously some people actually took these "requirements", and how silly it was for me to even set them.<br><br>when you do fall in love, when you eventually meet the guy you like, the checklist you use to gauge him wouldn't be the one you've written down, but the one that's been locked up within your heart. no one can ever be sure what will and can attract someone to you, sometimes not even you yourself. i think the general idea i was trying to convey was that these were basically just general guidelines, stuff i find common, or essential in order for me to even have a "working" (i.e. i can actually spend 5 minutes with him without blowing up!) relationship with someone. i just hope that those of you who also possess such a "checklist" for your ideal SO [significant other], will maintain an open mind, while keeping this list at the back of your mind. in relationships, try to follow your heart, not your mind. after you've settled the practical concerns (no, he's not a drug addict. no, he's not in jail. no, he's not 3 times my age with a record for sexually abusing young children...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">) then listen to your heart. even if he does "fulfill" all your requirements, the main thing is... mutual love.<br><br>good luck to all those still searching!!<br><br>----------------<br>MsSuess:<br>you still out there grrl??!! haven't seen you around in a longggg time, just checking on ya to make sure you're doing fine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The ageless question strikes again... as if girls require a certain level to be met (think Hercules types fighting their asses off for the princess on the throne) before they are swept off their dainty little feet! Judging from the status of present society, I don't think we're talking precious girls waiting to be deflowered the night of their wedding etc etc... so what's there to prize themselves so highly?<br><br>I think more often than not, guys are hurt in relationships more often than girls, becoz of their apparent 'weaker' status, thus protecting themselves and not allowing the stronger gender to bully them... It is definitely difficult (almost to the point of impossible) for a guy of this age to pander to the whims and fancies of the women of the twenty-first century... (think PMS, the need for the sense of independence and individuality, equality status, etc) what about the guy's needs?? who'll then take care of them?<br><br>Pardon me for my temporary agitation at this seemingly strange topic that girls respond to. After trying and testing enough relationships for both male and female to come seek for relational advice, I have come to realise that should you even have a guy that exceeds (not only meet) the qualities you already have in your head / heart, how ready is the girl to commit her life, heart, mind &amp; soul to improving the quality of the relationship? Seems like the world is revolving the other way around. With girls having their dimmed lightbulb in their heads suddenly brightened up (with regard to not being polygamised by men anymore and GIRL POWER) I feel they are taking a little too far by testing the relationship/guy and then scooting off at the first sign of trouble. That sucks.<br><br>But then again, there's always the other side to the story - the guy's weird. Unconventionally unexpected. And only to find out after the relationship takes off and there's no way out - that sucks too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  So girls, in order not to damage anymore good guys left, please be clear in your intentions. Better not to try, don't like, and RUN. That's not a nice thing to do, however much the reasons you give (some actually don't) are politically correct - such as my cat died, I'm too busy scratching my ass and thus can't hold your hand...<br><br>If the friendship's good, give it a shot, see if the quality of the friendship improves. If the relationship is to jeopardize the friendship, abandon the r/s to save the f/s. If you do cherish him as a friend.<br><br>That's all my 2ct's worth... Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Don't know why, just get hungry at this hour...must be the little food I had for dinner.<br><br>Anyway, I just have one thing to say. Most often than not, you may not be with the one you truly love. Sure, you love who you marry, but it may not be your ideal love. I guess what I want to say is that the benchmark that we set for ourselves are just some hopeful figures. We may compromise or tweek the figures as we travel down the journey of life.<br><br>As for thinking with your heart and not with your mind, that may bring great sorrow and problems if you're not careful.<br><br>One last thing I want to ask you, you seem to be contradicting yourself. You say to follow your heart, but then you mention about mutual love. So, what if there's a guy whom you love very much, but who just want to be friends? What will you do? Will you follow your heart, or think with your mind?<br><br>I think you will fare just as well as flipping the coin and decide, because no one knows for sure what will be the outcome if you decide to go for him or not.</div>
