            <div class='col-md body'>My boss dropped his wedding ring a few months ago.  It wasn't really his fault, I know.  Cuz he has lost some weight and his fingers become thinner and I noticed that his wedding ring looked a bit loose on his finger.<br><br>One day, after lunch, he gan cheong, searched hi and lo for the ring.  How to find?  The place so big, the ring so small.  Plus the cleaner super hardworking, always vacuum floor one.  Should go bye bye one.<br><br>But recently, he and his wife got some quarrel.  Actually should be nothing one lah.  But when the wife realised that he lost the ring, she lagi more angry.  Now my boss looks very sian at work.  On top of that, my top management are arseholes, giving my boss lotsa pressure too.<br><br>I see him so sad, I also feel bad, cuz my dept don't really have fantastic performance in the last few weeks.<br><br>He's been very good to me.  I dunno how to work, he guide me.  When I really really too stupid to understand the work, he do for me.  He doesn't scold his staff cuz he believes everyone needs respect one.<br><br>Since he so nice, I want to do something for him.  I want to get a replacement ring for him.  I can remember how the ring looks, cuz it looks kinda unique and I used to stare at it when I discuss work with him.<br><br>I want to give it to him as a surprise to perk him up and hopefully help to reconcile he and his wife.<br><br>How should I start?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You need to get the wife's wedding ring, as a sample.<br>Then go visiting goldsmith shops and try your luck, to see if they have a similar ring. If there is, you must get the same size as the one he lost. Wives know immediately if the size is different from the original. Also you must make it age.<br>If your boss married a long time ago, getting a similar one would be impossible, but it may be possible to make a copy. It will cost you.  But engraving if any would be difficult to duplicate.<br><br>How are you going to get the wife's ring?<br><br>The easiest way out for your boss is to find the ring, failing which to admit to the wife that he has lost the ring.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agreed with honeymouse. Wedding ring is consider quite personal thing and especially now ur boss's wife already knew that ur boss lost the ring. She may suspect if she know now market dont have the same wedding ring anymore. It nice for you to think of helping your boss but this kind of thing better dont get urself involve. Why dont ask ur boss to bring his wife to the shop and get a couple ring instead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think if the wife (until today) is still angry with her husband for losing the ring, something is seriously wrong with the marriage.<br><br>The ring, afterall, is only just a symbol of your love for each other and it means nothing if there's no demonstration of love (one of them is forgiveness) in the marriage.  It only becomes a false security.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>It's rather easy for the ring to slip out of your finger especially when you have lost weight (in the case of Honeybunz's boss) and when your hand is cold.  My father-in-law has lost and replaced his ring several times now during his 30 years of marriage with my mother-in-law.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
