              <p><span id="intelliTXT">In a rare and shocking incident, Singapore's longstanding icon - the original Merlion statue was struck by lightning.<br> <br> According to Ms Swee Xueping, who was with 5 other friends at a cafe
              nearby, orange sparks flew when the lightning struck between 4 to 5pm
              near One Fullerton.<br> <br> Staff in the vicinity told 938LIVE that they were shocked when they
              heard a loud explosion, followed by a loud thud when the broken pieces
              fell to the ground.<br> <br> A cafe staff who wants to be known only as Mr Yap, said he saw some 30
              people dashing into the restaurant he worked in, after the explosion.<br> <br> He said the crowd had initially been under 3 shelters located infront
              of the restaurant, but they headed into the building for their safety.<br> <br> It's understood that no one was hurt in the incident.<br> <br> Still, the incident hasn't really dampened the mood of the visitors nearby.<br> <br> When 938LIVE got to the scene, many were still happily taking pictures of the Merlion.<br> <br> This statue is one of five Merlions in Singapore.<br> <br> The 8.6 metre tall statue was originally located at the mouth of the Singpaore River but was moved to Fullerton in 2002.</span></p>

              <div class="top_headline"><strong>Merlion damaged by lightning</strong></div>
              <div class="top_headline">The Sunday Times</div>
              <div class="top_headline">A lightning bolt struck the Merlion statue at about 4.30pm yesterday.
              <p>The national icon at One Fullerton facing the Singapore River</p>
              <p>lost part of its top left mane and is believed to have its right ear chipped.</p>
              <p>About 20 to 30 people nearby, including tourists, ran helter-skelter in the pouring rain when debris from the Merlion's head went flying.</p>
              <p>Some ran to safety in the nearby shops and cafes.</p>
              <p>The fragments fell onto the patio at One Fullerton and the Singapore River Cruise counter near the Merlion.</p>
              <p>Nobody was hurt.</p>
              <p>Eyewitness Ms Rina Toh, 17,</p>
              <p>a barista at The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf at One Fullerton, said: 'I saw a bright Z-shaped lightning bolt, and it was a lot bigger than usual.'</p>
              <p>She was standing at the counter and could see the Merlion.</p>
              <p>Debris also fell onto the wave form at the base of the Merlion, cracking it. The area has been cordoned off, and the Merlion is now closed.</p>
              <p>Ms Jess Toh, 23, who works at bistro Gelare there, said: 'Those who were there looked very scared, their faces were pale.'</p>
              <p>The rain stopped at about 6pm and the fragments were cleared</p>
              <p>by 7pm by the staff of One Fullerton.</p>
              <p>When The Sunday Times arrived at about 7pm, some tourists were seen taking pictures.</p>
              <p>The Merlion was spouting water as usual.</p>
              <p>'To prevent this from happening again, a lightning antenna should be put in place,' suggested salesman Jackson Sim, 46.</p>
