            <div class='col-md body'>Christian names are easier to remember. If u were to meet new friend, will it be easier for u to remember Gwen Tan or Tan Sook Ling? I personally feel that it is to remember the former.<br><br>It's all up to the individual. Getting a christian name does <strong>NOT</strong> mean that they've forgotten about their Chinese heritage or roots.<br><br>------------------<br>*** <span style="font-style: italic;">Nothing Lasts Forever</span> ***<br><br>[This message has been edited by oxygene (edited 17 August 2001).]</div>
