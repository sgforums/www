            <div class='col-md body'>Stupid Drivers<br><br>One day, two rich businessmen, living nearby, were chatting.<br>"I tell you ahh ... my driver very stupid wan ... you see la!" the first businessman said, before calling his driver, Ah Chong.<br><br>"Nah Ah Chong ... here's ten dollars ... go buy me a Mercedez Benz."<br><br>"Yes sir ... right away!" Ah Chong received the ten dollars and rushed straight away to the car showroom.<br><br>"See?" said the businessman.<br><br>The second businessman, not to be outdone, said "I'll show you what is real stupidity!"<br><br>He then called his driver, Ahmad and said "Ahmad, go home now and check to see if I'm home," to which Ahmad replied "Yes Sir, right away!" and ran home.<br><br>"See?! Ahmad can't even use his brains to see that I'm already here! Now that is real stupidity!" the second businessman said.<br><br>Later, the two drivers, who knew each other, met. Ah Chong said "Eh you know ahh ... my boss ahh ... real stupid wan. He gave me ten dollars to go buy him a Mercedes ... he didn't know today Sunday la ... all the showroom where got open!"<br><br>"Aiya ... my boss even worse ... he ask me go his house to check whether he's home or not. He oledi got handphone wat ... just call him at home and check la!!!"<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Job Interview<br><br>An Ah Beng went for a job interview wearing colourful attire. When the manager saw Ah Beng, he thought to himself "Not this man!!!". Nevertheless, he had to entertain Ah Beng. So, he said "I'll give you a chance at the job if you can make a sentence out of these words".<br>Looking at Ah Beng's clothes, the manager gave him the words green, pink, yellow, blue, white, purple and black.<br><br>Ah Beng thought for a while, then his face lit up as he gave his sentence:<br><br>"I heard the phone go green-green and then I pink up the phone and said "Yellow? Blue's that? What? Wrong number. Next time don't purplely disturb people and don't call black!"<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Ah Cheng Buoy Roti<br><br>Once upon a time,a group of Ah Bengs stepped into a lounge and wanted the DJ to play the song "Ah Cheng Buey Ro Ti" (In Hokkien meaning Ah Cheng buys bread). The DJ told them that they only have English songs and told them to select another song. The Ah Bengs were indignant and kicked up a big fuss, claiming that the DJ was insulting them. The manager had to intervene in order to calm them down. Finally, after many hours of talking, the manager managed to find out that the Ah Bengs were actually asking for the song Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Ah Lian<br><br>One day, two Ah Lians got into a lift from the 20th floor of a building and wanted to get down to the ground floor. As they looked at the buttons, they could see the number 20 down to number 2. It was then followed by a G. As they were not English-educated, they were puzzled and really had no idea what the letter G meant. Suddenly one of them exclaimed excitedly and hit G. When they finally reached the ground floor,the other Ah Lian was so impressed and asked the first Ah Lian, "Waa, how you know wan?" The first Ah Lian reply smugly, "Easy laa...G for Gelo mah..."<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Little Led Liding Hoot<br><br>Once upon a time hor, got one girl little led liding hoot.
