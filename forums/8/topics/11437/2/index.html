Has to write a lot of reports, justifications etc. So unless you sustain a very serious injury, it's very difficult to OOC, even if you had attitude problems. That's sad, but that's life. You CANNOT OOC even if you asked for it!!

Warrant office is a NON-commissioned officer. 2LT is a commissioned officer. They are 2 worlds apart. So even though a WO is the highest in the specialist ranks and a 2LT is the lowest in the officer ranks, technically the 2Lt is still higher in rank than the WO. But of course, in the army, there is also something known as appointment. So if a WO holds a higher appointment than a 2LT, he is supposedly higher. Last time in my airbase, the WO, hair also greyed liao still must salute me, a 2LT  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno how many of you guys are officers but from what I read, it seems that you guys are getting lots of kicks being saluted and stuff. What's the big deal being these kindda officers?<br><br>Good Officers are those who feel satisfied for their ability to lead and command the respect the fellow men. Those who are not afraid that their men are talking behind their backs while putting a false front. Those who can guarantee that their men will do work without a single threat of extra or confinement. AND those who will NOT crack under pressure in Ops order planning.<br><br>Technically a warrant officer may be smaller in rank but that's only becoz they are not commissioned. A junior officer, no matter how good they are, can never fight them in terms of experience. I think they oughta earn some respect even from junior officers. Yo hoho, I don't know your case but I hope that you given the WO some face even though he's in the wrong.  :p<br><br>Why most junior officers I don't salute is basically I think they cannot make it.( esp my 1st PC, my OCs, my unit MTO, MO and DYS1) Of course I do greet some who are worthy officers.(like my 2ND PC who is fair and willing to "chiong suah" with us all the way, my other platoon's 1st PC whose decision making skills and leading ability is unmatched, My 1st S2 who is strict but cared for us and my CO who's a model soldier and a good motivator)<br><br>I know being an officer is tough but who cares about what shiong training you get in OCS, people will still judge you by you current abilities (same goes for Specs). Especially if you are to go into a combat unit (GDS,SIR,SAR,CDO)  What I find lacking in junior officers (and Specs too) in the current SAF is the ability to make decisions quickly in a fair matter. Many either make terrible decisions (and not apologizing after that) or are indecisive (talk about "decisive force").<br><br>Well, the bottomline is this:<br><br>RANK is what you'll get....<br>RESPECT is what you must earn.....<br><br>You've got your rank, but have you got your respect?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Silenthunter (edited 15 April 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hacktic:</div><div class="quote_body">u damned yaya leh<br></div></blockquote>Wah...I think I must clarify this. I always make it a point to respect everybody in the army, even my men and the clerks. To me, everybody performs a job, and I don't really see the point of binding ourselves blindly to our ranks. But what I meant was that the respect must be reciprocated. I don't go around pulling rank or anything. And I most definitely don't go for cheap thrills of yearning for salutes. Even my own men don't salute me! Some even call me by my name. But I earned the respect by treating everybody fairly, and by fighting for their well-being. I made sure that whatever I request of them, I am able to do so myself. That is also why, when I went back for IPPT recently, I even had my men coming up to me, and say that they respect me. Similarly, if you try to climb onto my head, all respect flies out of the window. It does not matter if you are a WO, PTE or Major. There was once when I quarrelled very heatedly with my CO because he was being plain unreasonable on my men. In the end, I signed a few extras, but it's worth it. He backed off. A few days before I ORDed, he actually apologised to me and admitted his fault for that incident. I agree with what most people said, rank is bestowed, but respect must be earned. But a basic respect for the rank must still be there. Otherwise there would be chaos in the army.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Seifer (edited 16 April 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Silenthunter: I totally agree with you about the WOs' experiences. I want to say that I really give them the utmost respect for that. Regarding that WO whom I tiao, there's no way I can give him face for his uncouth behavior. He deserved that scolding from me.<br><br>Seifer: I have to say I agree with you for the fact that the basic respect for rank must be given.<br><br>Also, I think it's very true that: rank is what we get, but respect is to be earned.</div>
