But they are prone to DB and charge.<br><br>NCO can make a significant amount of friends. If you in mortar or scout, which have as many NCOs as men, you meet more friends. But there will be some friction with men and officer. NCO is basically the "meat" in a burger. Officer tell NCO to tell men, NCO kena scolded by men. Men lazy, NCO scolded too. Training no good, NCO held responsible. NCOs are the frontline to face the ugly side of times that go wrong. training, NCO also must help officer in preperation for training and is under some pressure too.<br><br>Officer can make only few friends who might backstab you at times of stealing glory. Officer will face extreme pressure from the OC and CO. If you don't do good, you will get condemn. Unless you are those "ah gah liao" officer who go chiong with the men/nco one lah. If you want to be officer, you cannot act "tao" or else you'll be very lonely and suffer in silence.</div>

But I am almost sure winning best COMPANY trainee will guarantee a shot at officerdom, provided you satisfy the remaining conditions. Telling ur PC helps too because it will make him notice you, maybe delegate more leadership roles to you so that you will be able to show ur mettle.

I know the OCS entrance criterias well cos it was then my turn to choose ppl to go OCS. Heehee...<br>Well, what some of the replies above are true. Especially the fact that you must be at least a diploma or A levels holder.<br>Okie... now for some tips to getting that much desired epaulette and the Sword of Command:<br>Performance in BMT DEFINITELY plays a big part. The PCs will choose potential cadets based on<br>1) Sit test. You have to be damn fuking on to be noticed by the sit test umpire. The answer you provide for your quest does not have to be the model answer. But more impt, you shd stay calm, composed and organised. Make sure you look into aspects like giving good commanding instructions, the safety of your team, the encouragement you give to your team to carry on, etc.... And remember: during sit test, volunteer, volunteer, volunteer!<br>2) Daily attitude during BMT. Make sure you win your platoonmates' trust and popularity by helping out the weaker ones, volunteering yourself for extra duties and fatiques, etc.... Bcos at the end of your BMT saga, peer appraisal will be a determining factor.<br>3) When your PC ask you if you want to go OCS. Say "Yes". It's not the time to be humble here.<br>4) Your training performance. Things like SOC, IPPT, field-training, marksmanship, should be taken seriously. No one wants an officer who can't shoot, run, or conceal, right? But don despair if you don do well, or even fail any of these. It's your training attitude that we platoon commanders look for the most. I had got OCS mates who went into OCS failing their IPPT or other stuff. But of course lar, they had a fuking hard time in OCS later on....<br>5) Field camp. One of the biggest event in BMT is the field camp. I've only got to say: Do fuking well. It's very important bcos the commanders will be on the lookout for those who can survive under outfield conditions, and under pressure.<br>6) Don get despaired by poor results. Like I said, it's your training attitude that commanders look for the most. Results are important, but secondary.<br>7) Don be a show-off. I had got really showy recruits who come in with NCC cadet-lt rank, or airborne badge, or whatever fuking knowledge prior to their enlistment to BMT. We don give a fuking damn. I am very against show-offs. I gave these show-offs a really hard time, and made sure they never get to go OCS. I mean, it's important that you display your knowledge if you have them. But do it a humble way. Trust me, we know who are the ones with 'stuff', and who not.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Don break the rules (well, at least don break it too often). Needs no explanation right?<br>9) To me, this is the most important. DON BE A CCB HYPOCRITE!!!!!!!!! We know it when you act wayang, or when you boot-lick, or when you show different attitudes in front, and at the back of the commaders.<br><br>Hmmm.... that's it for now. Will post more suggestions if I can think of any. Oh yar, don despair if you don't get any leadership appointment during BMT. I never got any oso.<br>But trust me, OCS is going to be one hell of hard time (well, at least during my time it was). Here's wishing you all the best!<br><br>[This message has been edited by hoho (edited 06 April 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does it really matters if you are an officer or you are a specialist in the army? Unless you are telling me you are going to make it your career or else why so "main qiang" to make it to OCS?<br><br>I am personally an officer but I always thought I could have been a better specialist. Be natural and yourself, sometimes it is not a bad thing to stay in the middle of the hierachy.<br><br>Whats the use of becoming an officer and then start to have specialists or even men under you speaking behind your back calling you "buai gan" or "fucked up" and things like that. If you can lead you will be in the OCS, if you can't, there is nothing wrong with that. Even you have real good qualities to become an officer but didn't get into OCS, there is a second chance at SISPEC. If you really that sway that you still didn't make then. Trust me. You will earn more respect from your colleagues than your officers; that is provided you are a REAL leader.<br><br>------------------<br>Where is Montgomery?

I know the OCS entrance criterias well cos it was then my turn to choose ppl to go OCS. Heehee...<br>Well, what some of the replies above are true. Especially the fact that you must be at least a diploma or A levels holder.<br>Okie... now for some tips to getting that much desired epaulette and the Sword of Command:<br>Performance in BMT DEFINITELY plays a big part. The PCs will choose potential cadets based on<br>1) Sit test. You have to be damn fuking on to be noticed by the sit test umpire. The answer you provide for your quest does not have to be the model answer. But more impt, you shd stay calm, composed and organised. Make sure you look into aspects like giving good commanding instructions, the safety of your team, the encouragement you give to your team to carry on, etc.... And remember: during sit test, volunteer, volunteer, volunteer!<br>2) Daily attitude during BMT. Make sure you win your platoonmates' trust and popularity by helping out the weaker ones, volunteering yourself for extra duties and fatiques, etc.... Bcos at the end of your BMT saga, peer appraisal will be a determining factor.<br>3) When your PC ask you if you want to go OCS. Say "Yes". It's not the time to be humble here.<br>4) Your training performance. Things like SOC, IPPT, field-training, marksmanship, should be taken seriously. No one wants an officer who can't shoot, run, or conceal, right? But don despair if you don do well, or even fail any of these. It's your training attitude that we platoon commanders look for the most. I had got OCS mates who went into OCS failing their IPPT or other stuff. But of course lar, they had a fuking hard time in OCS later on....<br>5) Field camp. One of the biggest event in BMT is the field camp. I've only got to say: Do fuking well. It's very important bcos the commanders will be on the lookout for those who can survive under outfield conditions, and under pressure.<br>6) Don get despaired by poor results. Like I said, it's your training attitude that commanders look for the most. Results are important, but secondary.<br>7) Don be a show-off. I had got really showy recruits who come in with NCC cadet-lt rank, or airborne badge, or whatever fuking knowledge prior to their enlistment to BMT. We don give a fuking damn. I am very against show-offs. I gave these show-offs a really hard time, and made sure they never get to go OCS. I mean, it's important that you display your knowledge if you have them. But do it a humble way. Trust me, we know who are the ones with 'stuff', and who not.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Don break the rules (well, at least don break it too often). Needs no explanation right?<br>9) To me, this is the most important. DON BE A CCB HYPOCRITE!!!!!!!!! We know it when you act wayang, or when you boot-lick, or when you show different attitudes in front, and at the back of the commaders.<br><br>Hmmm.... that's it for now. Will post more suggestions if I can think of any. Oh yar, don despair if you don't get any leadership appointment during BMT. I never got any oso.<br>But trust me, OCS is going to be one hell of hard time (well, at least during my time it was). Here's wishing you all the best!<br><br>[This message has been edited by hoho (edited 06 April 2001).]</div></blockquote>wah..thanks for the information man...or i mean sir ........hehehe......any way lor, u mean during sit test, u will be questioned by instructors individually izit???<br>n lor how many recruits r there in a platoon/company n how many can make it into ocs???<br>anyway lor, i heard from my seniors tat the intake counts izit?? eg: july intake more chances of going into ocs compared to hmm.....september??? is tat true????</div>

As far as I remember, the January BMT batch (i.e. enter OCS around April) will be huge bcos OCS will be taking in cadets for all three arms (i.e. Army, Airforce, Navy). What's more, they will be places for various vocations from all three arms, e.g. artillery, infantry, signallers, armor, commandos, ADO, ADAO, Pilot, etc etc. But the Mar/Apr batch is smaller in comparison bcos they mainly take in infantry officer cadets, plus a handful from Airforce and Navy. Thus it is natural that there will be less places then. The President will usually be at the January (BMT) commissioning parade bcos it is the largest and grandest of the yr.<br>As to your question regarding the sit test, it is actually called "situational test". It is a 3-day outfield camp, whereby recuits will face many quests and challenges thruout the 3 days. Each recruit will wear a number tag (for identification and grading purposes) and will be asked to complete some quests (such as "how to get the ammo box across the river with 2 poles?" kind of questions) as a team of 6 to 10. The leader of the team will be rotated at every station. Like I said in my earlier posts, sometimes you will not complete the mission. But the umpire will grade each individual based on their calmness, attitude, thinking, ideas, leadership ability, charisma, and overall performance. Also, at each station, the umpire doesn't only grade the 'leader', but each and every individual in the team.<br><br>[This message has been edited by hoho (edited 06 April 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, everything comes into consideration whether u go OCS or not. My PC told me that the aptitude test plays abt 20%, situational test takes abt 10%, field camp abt 10% and ur performance during ur IFC. The rest of the 100% will come from ur everyday routines. If ur platoon sergeant or PC ask 4 platoon IC, go ahead and volunteer 4 it. Be ultimate garang, but humble at the same time. Gain ur platoon mates' respect. One thing, volunteer 4 the Skills at Arms competition. It's the ultimate test of endurance, leadership and ability. In a simple phrase, GO FOR EVERYTHING GIVEN TO U!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh, it's not worth it to become a second lieutanent in the SAF, especially if you're NSF and not a regular. A regular sergeant can tiao a NSF second lieutanent anytime man, and then the second lieutanent lan lan also has to do the job himself if no one wants to listen to him. If he does it well, his CO takes the credit. If not, then of course he takes the shit lar. Second lieutanents in the other armies of the world, maybe they do command respect. Second lieutanents NSF in the SAF? Forget it.</div>

Some ppl work better behind the scenes, so being a PS is better..<br><br>As a NSF, yes..officers get the highest "allowance" but if that's the reason u wanna go there, then it's a lame excuse...<br><br>I say this bcoz i find the new generation of officers that pass out to be a lame, chao geng and frequently hopeless in the very skills they are supposed to be proficient in. They cannot navigate for nuts, dun respect the chain of command and are completely mercenary in their actions...<br><br>Dun be mistaken, not every officer that passes out qualifies in that aspect..some are really outstanding and selfless...these are qualities that will make ur men respect u next time in unit...<br><br>But nowadays, most products of OCS tok too much with little action...which is why bring a GS table into the field instaed of their rifle is better sometimes...by the time they finish their conference..the war's over..<br></div>
