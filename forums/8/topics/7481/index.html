            <div class='col-md body'>Acne is caused by the hormonal changes in your body throughout adolescence but sometimes it goes on much for a bit longer and some even have acne until they are 25!<br><br>I have suffered from it for the longest time. I think I was 10 when I first got acne, and I still do (although it is not as bad now).<br><br>Some advice:<br>1. Wash your face regularly with a gentle cleanser. Do not get a really strong soap and wash it once a day. It is even worse to get a strong soap and wash your face all the time. It will dry your face up and cause skin irritation (redness). Note that after a while you will have to change soaps as they will become ineffective after a while. It is not that you are beyond help when a soap ceases to work, but rather you face has gotten used to it. I recommend either Neutrogena, proactiv or something along that line.<br><br>2. Do not touch your face!!! I know it is hard but everytime you do, you are spreading bacteria and you will see new pimples coming up where you touched very soon.<br><br>3. Use blotters when you can. I know it is a bit sissy but who cares. Go to the toilet and blot lor. It is just to keep excessive oil off your face. It does wonders.<br><br>4. Try to cut down on oily food. This is subjective. Try it out and see if it helps. It does for me...<br><br>5. Wash your face after exercising, ASAP!!! Do not let bacteria build up...<br><br>If you are desperate and have a lot of $$$, try Roaccutane. I tried it about 7 years ago and it was about $500 for a treatment period of 4 months. It closes your oil glands and actually limits the amount of oil secreted on your face. Prepare to have chapped and bleeding lips and dry skin.<br>When I took it, it worked like a charm but after I finished the treatment, all the pimples came back again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I was then told that I would have to take another 4 month course of treatment. IT MAY WORK FOR YOU THOUGH...<br><br>Taking antibiotics and applying cream is the most effective for me and it is not very expensive. I am sure that you would rather spend a bit of money to save your face than look like a crater-face in the future, right? Dun say vain lah, but if it is really very bad, do something about it.<br><br>Take care man...<br><br>------------------<br>Let him that move the world, first move himself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If all else fails, try doxycycline (a kind of tetracycline).  It's effective against the bacteria which reside on your skin.  Oh yeah, drink lots of orange juice too (a friendly message from orange).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I went to the National Skin Centre and they were very helpful though expensive. I am sure that your family doctor can prescribe some antibiotics for you though. If you have never taken antibiotics before, try tetracycline. It is the cheapest and mildest. Then if it is not effective, maybe erythromycin, doxcycline, minocin or some others that I cannot remember. Take so many until I also cannot remember their names. hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
