You're the idiot measuring them against others and judging Singaporeans by the amount, consistently harping about some idiotic things like if Thailand was richer they would have donated same or more.

The worse thing is you measured using your narrowminded pea-sized brain the actions of others. Have you known every person that donated to make such a claim? Are you a worthy judge of another's action by assuming things like an idiot?
