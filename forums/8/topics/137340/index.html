            <div class='col-md body'>teenagers in 2000s are having much more fun nowadays... like better access to technologies.. internet..mp3.. music players etc.. but the biggest gainer is those business ppl selling stuffs to teenagers... by including 'sex..money and good looks' in music videos, movies or advertisements... For example is that last time is the era where music in MTV is filled with musicians, bands with good skills.. either in their voice or instruments.. like metallica, ledzeppelin, celine dion etc... Nowadays.. anyone from william hung until britney can get tons of money from teenagers in 2000s from goodlooks or gorgeous women in their videos... And for advertisements.. more n more celebrities like davidbeckham etc are included.. provocative, more response and business ppl suck more money from teenagers in 2000</div>
