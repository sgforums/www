            <div class='col-md body'>You guys know what's going to happen yeah?<br><br>This will be huge news in China; that is, huge comparatively. Even the least read tabloid there (much less, their online forums), has circulation/viewership many times our population.<br><br>Conclusion #1 - bad rep. of Singapore; poorer ties with China.<br><br>In my head, albeit less politically correct, still a likely possibility:<br><br>We will see an influx (or more accurately, a continuity) of Chinese into our tiny island, of which, based on past precedent, many would end up in questionable professions or be the source of public outcry (for whatever reason). The aforementioned incidents only gives them the right to raise this as a defence to their actions; or at least, justification.<br><br>Conclusion #2 - Hate brings hate.<br><br>Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if the men in question weren't Singaporeans. TBH, roxy square at least, is frequented by Malaysians; not that I am insinuating anything but I guess quite generally, it is fair to state that Singaporeans don't have the balls to commit something like that - not for such minor returns at least.<br><br>My 2 cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In response to some of the earlier posts, I don't think it is unfair to say that the Chinese have a tendency towards exaggeration. Generalization or not.<br><br>We have seen multiple instances in the media of Chinese nationals creating a mountain out of a molehill. Again, comparatively, similar incidents/accidents involving locals do not receive as much coverage, or at least, their plights are not portrayed as favourably.<br></div>
