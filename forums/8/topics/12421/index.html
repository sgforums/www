The terrorists may be islamic right wing driven, but Islam itself does not preach violence.<br><br>Extremists muslims ard the world are using it as a poor man's excuse to start something and unite the hard-liners. But even islamic countries like saudi arabia and Uae have pledged support for the anti-terrorist cause.<br><br>Uneducated preachers like PAS and Indonesian fundamentalists are just creating a nuisance of themselves..even journalists interviewing ppl who signed up as "holy fighters" if US should wage war on the taliban admitted that they are main reason was joblessness and money.<br><br>Certainly we s'poreans should not take for granted the lessons learnt during the racial disharmony years. We have come too far to let something like this tear us apart. Our community is close-knit, even if not fully accepted, there is tolerance.<br><br>Our country will remain strong as it will always be so long as no unforseen factors disrupt wat we have built and maintained for so long</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terrorism is a result of the environment, not religion. It is unfortunate that some leaders, especially in the Middle-East, turn such political fights into religious fights. I do agree with you that this is an abuse of power; a purely human fault that transcends all faiths and creeds. Take Adolf Hitler and Slobodan Milosevic for example. They needed something to unite the people to their cause, so they used religion to stir up the feelings of the population. Hitler, Milosevic, Chairman Mao (who used Communism, of course) and Osama share the same bed. They are masters of propoganda, and their trap is a vicious one that affects everybody. Create a divide between "US" and the "OTHER", and whip up the sentiments of "US" against the "OTHER"...and when "OTHER" retaliates, "US" will have fresh reasons to stay united and continue the bloodshed.<br><br>As Singaporeans, let us not fall into this trap. Don't alienate our fellow citizens because then, our national pledge will be a farce. "Pledge ourselves as one united people, regardless of race, language or religion..."<br><br>------------------<br>For a rollicking good time, come visit my homepage at: <a href="http://clik.to/pebble" rel="nofollow">http://clik.to/pebble</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by salivateforme (edited 29 September 2001).]</div>
