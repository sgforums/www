            <div class='col-md body'>for me its not to act cool or because my 'friends' do it.. in fact most of my current friends in my jc do not... i guess jc kids are like that. im one of the more open ppl in my sch... i smoke because i love the feeling when i take a puff from the cigarette and inhale the smoke. it is refreshing to me and it kills my stress when i feel lonely bored or angry usually i will buy 1 packet of cigs and smoke alone in the corridor of the flat opposite my grandmother's house so that way none of my family members can see me and after smoking i will usually go to her house for a sumptous meal.. she's a great cook. if u are wondering i am 17 this year and coming to 18.. i look mature so most shops do not ask for ic when i purchase cigs... now that cigs have become part of my life i think its starting to hurt my pocket as i love to club also it also requires a lot of money..... and shopping drains away my hard earnt money. all the money i earnt doing so many jobs during the first three months break have been all spent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
