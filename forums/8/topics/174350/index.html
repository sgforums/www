An example, the pregnancy kit there so cheap RM10 but then buay chun one cuz my wife use is negative but then later use spore polyclinic it says positive. Also her elder brother do admit the medicine in spore is using better quality than the msian gahmen medicine. The price difference is big but it is one cent money one cent goods lor.

Cos at the shopping mall near my place last time there is a branch of Watsons for instance, and this is a shop that appears in big cities oso. Residents in big cities also obtain their stuff from this store and never complain abt its qualities.<br><br>I have been to the government hospital in Malaysia before, and very funny, I usually recovered after eating their medicines  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
