            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... Inferno, out of interest, how old are you ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The rest of them pretty much have it right. Inferno, You can't forget her, or rather, you're not willing to let her go, since the reason for the breakup is very inadequate. There's no real point in finding out the real truth behind the matter. For all you know, it might even be more hurting than just getting dumped. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.<br><br>But I'm afraid you have to live with the fact that that is reality, and move on. Granted that its easier said than done, but you'll eventually figure out someway to handle it on your own. Most people do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Some go totally celibate, while others plunge into their hobbies, and others go all out to chase the opposite gender. You've probably heard all the stories, so I won't go into that.<br><br>CopperWing, basically, you've already survived the experience right ? Move on, and quit dwelling on the past.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Besides, from your own account, the current gal of your interest seems much much superior than your prior ungrateful one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> And you DO seem much happier.<br><br>Long story time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> (Oldsters of the forum, you can skip the rest.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)<br><br>Look at me. I'm a guy who got dumped <strong>BY THE SAME GIRL 3 TIMES</strong>. (And almost a fourth time too before I woke myself up.) Each time was more heartbreaking than the previous, and if Inferno follows a similar path as I did, it'll be even worse until you kinda wake yourself up to the fact that perhaps you're just not good enough in HER eyes.<br><br>Brutal, yes, but that is the way life goes. Your vindication will come in the end.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> For me, I recently saw the girl (my ex, if you will.) with her current boyfriend. He was a typical Ah beng, dyed hair, bad taste in the combination of branded clothes, loud mouth, and a total poser. Best of all, he was literally pawing her everywhere.<br><br>I stood there for nearly 3 whole minutes watching the scene. Man, it was sweet ! Why ? She had a nice guy, decent in most aspects, who was interested in her, but all she did was just "play" with my emotions. Now, look at who she ended up with. Someone who will probably use her in the worst possible way. *Evil Grin*<br><br>Okay, so I'm a vindicative person, but really.... wouldn't you be if the person that you gave your emotions to just plain used them for nothing more than the "value" you have as a tool ? a bargaining chip ?<br><br>I guess that you guys should be glad that they showed their tails early. No telling how much more of a mess you might have landed in.<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you can say I was naive, even idealistic then. And I was around your age too when it happened. Sigh.... what waste of such precious Teenage years.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I could have joined the school's Interact club, and gotten to know tons of gals that were better like those of my secondary schoolmates who did.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Oh well.....<br><br>Basically, There was this constant thought that "this time it would work out", or that "she actually likes me ! I've succeeded !!" or "Maybe she realizes that I'm true to her, compared to those other guys." etc etc. came to mind many many times.<br><br>Unfortunately, these hopes were dashed, and you just kinda plain refuse to see the bad side of things, that what she did to you can't possibly be true. That the person you're so crazy about can't possibly do things like that. You start to live in denial. For a while anyway.<br><br>Until you review everything that has been going on, the lies, the manipulation, the false smiles, your false pride in yourself, your futile hopes, everything. Then you sorta see it, and realise how dumb you were not to see it in the first place.<br><br>That's all to it actually.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Don't even think of hoping that she would come back to you. Its a hope, yes, but a painful one. One that you can probably afford to live without. And what sort of explaination do you expect her to give you ? Like I said, sometimes, ignorance is bliss. Maybe you're better off not knowing ?<br><br>Besides, can your pride take the fact that she's coming back to you only because she got dumped by the other guy ? And would you accept her back, just like that ? Lastly, can you take the fact that once she finds a better one, she'll get rid of you like last year's mouldy bread ?<br><br>Life isn't what love stories and TV shows depict. They only reflect an aspect of life. And to be honest, do you want to go thru what I went thru ???<br><br>Like everyone else here is saying, forget about her, she's not worth the gazillions of brain cells that die when you agonize about her, she's not worth the last coupla days of your life which you probably could have put to better use, she's not worth the tears and frustration, and she's definitely not worth the money that you would have spent trying to get her back.<br><br>Think about this way. You look out for Number One (That's you.) now, and not some lost, irretrievable person somewhere out there.<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>
