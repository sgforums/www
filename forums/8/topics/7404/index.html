            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys..<br>Just wondering, how do you feel and what will you do if your love isn't returned?<br>Would you just forget about her or continue to chase her?<br>I just broke up with my gal after 2 months and 5 days. Kinda short eh?<br>Anyway, she DUMPED me and i still could not accept the fact that she DUMPED me because of another boy. She said she never like me and it is useless to continue the relationship. Yes, I agree with this, but why she accepted me when I asked her to be my gf? I would rather be rejected than being DUMPED. For some of you who had been DUMPED by a gal because she had found a new boyfriend should have the feeling of slapping her in the face and that is the thing I am feeling right now. For two months, she had been toying with my feelings, and now, she requested a break-up.<br>The worst thing is, before i decided to break-up with her or not, she went around telling pple that we had broken-up. I mean this is ridiculous u know... It's like being so FUCKED UP!<br>What do you think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love is a painful pill to sorrow but yet most of us chose to take it. It's your choice whether to love someone or not, no one can force you to do it. If you chose to take it, you should be fully aware of what is going to be instore for you. Everyone life is full of ups and downs and now we are talking about 2 persons. Changes in either party is going to affect the other. The point is not about blaming each other in a failed relationship, but to learn to overcome it.<br><br>It seems like people expect a lot from their gf/ bf in a relationship, they want them to love them in one way, but such things are beyond our control. Instead of making someone change their way of doing things, why not let them change on their own if they chose to for you. I think it would means more to you if he/she is willing to change just for your sake, otherwise, just too bad, you will have to accept them for what they are. It's your choice to choose them, so you have to accept them.. if you can't then you should move on.<br><br>If you can convince yourself to not to expect anything from the other person, you will be able to love the person more. Another thing is you will also be happier, coz you are doing something you enjoy doing, and by not expecting anything, if the response is good, you will feel even better. Trust me.. I am experiencing it now.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>copperwings: wont you?<br><br>shit like this happens all the time. it doesnt make it right or acceptable, but it means you oughta stop whining and get on with your life. i may be a little harsh, but i really cannot tolerate it when people get so caught up in their own problems, and feeling victimised, then they lose all track of the current situation and their sole obsession is making sure "justice" is done.<br><br>if that girl's such a bitch, move on. pestering her definitely wouldnt do a thg. it'll only 1)convince her how pathetic a loser you are and you cant live without her, 2)make her happy you dumped you since you're such a pyscho.<br><br>im not endorsing such heartless behaviour. but responding childish/pyschotically wont do a thg. she might have been "the one" but what if you werent mr.right for her? people make mistakes... and you cant keep harping on her. in fact, i believe any girl will do what your ex-s did to avoid you guys (ie change no, get male relatives/closefrens to threaten y'all) if guys start pestering them non-stop. you may love them, but that doesnt mean they have to love you back. people make wrong decisions, they choose the wrong paths in life. most imptly, people change over time, and you cant force them to stick to a past choice if they've really changed their mind. especially if they didnt know it in the first place...<br><br>unrequited love might not be "fair" to you, but how fair is it to your obsession? did she/he even ask to be "loved"? you loving her doesnt mean she has to feel the same, and neither is she obliged to return your affection in any way at all.<br><br>[This message has been edited by xue (edited 18 May 2000).]</div>
