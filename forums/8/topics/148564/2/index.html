What's the military tribunal there for if not to handle such cases?  It's a court that specialises in military cases, and the key to that specialisation is that the members of the tribunal know and understand the context within which the cases are presented - to send the case to a civil court, which does not necessarily understand the full implications of the situation, is to do the case a disservice.  It's tantamount to sending a patient to a GP to have a brain tumour removed.  Sure, the guy's a doctor, but why send the patient to him if a specialist is available to do the job?<br><br>While it can't be fairly described as being completely accidental, I think it's a stretch to assume that the instructors intended to drown the trainees.  Knowing the consequences, they would have been mad to have done it with full intent, wouldn't they?</div></blockquote>You have missed the point.<br><br>If it were impossible for them not to have known that the actions to which they were subjecting their trainees were likely to result in their deaths, then, in subjecting their trainees to these actions, they must be said to have intentionally subjected the latter to actions that they knew would be likely to have resulted in their deaths.<br><br>It is true that they did not intend to kill the trainees; but that does not change the fact that they knew that what they were doing was likely to kill the trainees.<br><br>So the argument isn't 'knowing the consequences, they would have been mad to have done it with full intent'; but rather 'knowing whatever it is that we can be sure that they must have known, how can they not have done whatever it is that they did do, with the intent to subject the relevant persons to the risk of sustaining death or of serious injury (where this was not at all warranted from the point of view of the training that they were supposed to adminstering to these persons).<br><br>Given the putative character of what they did, these men did deserve to be tried before the bar of a universal law.<br><br>Moreover, while the judge you speak of, undoubtedly made 'superfluous remarks' and 'remarks which it was not within his competence to make', that does not change the fact that it was right that the case should have been tried before him (given the nature of the offence in question).</div>

Your arument has gone even further than the charges brought against the 4 men, because you have made the conceptual leap from an act that is dangerous, to one that is patently lethal.

If death was likely, the majority of the cohort in the course would be dead.  On the other hand, the likelihood of death was feasible, one dead trainee and another almost killed would be a result fitting the likelihood.  Now the difference between "likely" and "feasible" may seem  fine, but it makes all the difference between judging the instructors' actions as either dangerous or lethal, with according differences between the charges laid.<br><br>4) On the basis of the distinction between a dangerous and a lethal course of action, your Russian Roulette example is not appropriate.<br><br>Nonetheless, these are good points that you have raised, and in my view they serve to demonstrate the slippery slope through which Pandiaraj and Bala have been railroaded.</div>

This is not a case where civilians are doing something not out of the 'norm' expected in civilian life.  This is a case about military personnel going thru military training.<br><br>I'm not saying these things can't be prevented during training.  I'm saying it was a freak accident and the nature of such training has a nature of being hazardous.  I doubt the defendants acted with the intention to drown the victim.

In fact, I knew a friend who was at the same course that the incident happened.  He went through the same dunking excerise as everyone in the course.  If it wasn't an accident, we're looking at about 100 dead bodies (including my friend) instead of one.<br><br>Sure trainers and planners must look into ways to lessen such accidents but they can't "soften" their training just to appease the mob.

Yes.  Did they push their luck - Diva and Ng most certainly did.  Did any of them intend for their actions to cause Sgt Hu's (or anybody else's) death?  No - why would they deliberately jeopardise their careers?<br><br>Unless you can demonstrate that Diva and Ng, knowing full well the consequences of Sgt Hu's death on their careers and indeed their lives, decided nonetheless that they were going to kill him, it simply cannot be said that they intentionally engaged in an act that would <span style="font-style: italic;">kill</span> a trainee.<br><br>Where the Russian Roulette analogy fails is that, regardless of the one-in-six chance of the chanber containing a round, it that round went off in the soldier's temple, it would <span style="font-style: italic;">definitely</span> kill him.  Aspiration, on the other hand, occurs in degrees, a certain extent beyond which would kill a person, but the result is not as dichotomous as a bullet in the head.<br><br>Assuming that Diva and Ng had all intention of continuing their careers (which IMHO is a given), it cannot have been their intention to induce aspiration to the extent that it would kill Sgt Hu.<br><br>I'll agree that the risk was unnecessary, but the intent was to frighten and torment the living daylights out of the trainees.  I don't support that course of action, but what I am saying is that it's different from deliberately doing something to kill a trainee.<br><br>The issue of the trainee's will is a wide gray area IMHO.  After all, I understand that one of the tests for divers (both NS men and regulars) is to jump into a deep tank of water with their hands and feet tied.  That is obviously more dangerous than dunking, and for NS men assigned to the NDU, it is not a voluntary or willing task, is it?  What about taekwondo sparring?  Despite the safety gear and procedures, there's still a chance of fatal injury, and I've seen instructors allow a fair few grudge matches on the mat in my time.  Does any infantryman want to charge up a hill on a live-firing exercise, knowing that despite safety precautions, someone could trip and plant a stray round in them?  The fact is that it's not a safe job, and being a conscript army, it's more often the case than not that a soldeir is willingly doing something.  Just to be clear, I'm speaking strictly here about the issue of the soldier's will as a confounding factor.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MrBach:</div><div class="quote_body">I am prepared to concede that this is true but from what I have posted above,  it ought to be apparent to you that what would make the crucial difference is whether the person subjected to the act in question, can be said to have been in a position to will his exposure to all of the possible dangers that would have been associated with this act at every stage of its execution; and that is why a death that occurs as the result of a student's following a teacher's instructions concerning how he might execute a certain athletic routine, and a death that occurs when the teacher makes the routine in question more dangerous than it would otherwise need to be (and in a way that escapes the awareness of the student who has been asked to perform it) should not both be viewed in the same light.<br><br>In the former case, the teacher wasn't doing anything directly to amplify the dangers associated with performing the routine in question (by making the routine more dangerous than it would otherwise need to be); but in the latter case (if, for instance,  the teacher had deliberately removed the mat from the spot on the other side of the bar where the student might have been typically expected to land after completing his jump) then I think that what the teacher will have done in this regard would deserve to be viewed as criminal.<br><br>...<br><br>If the breach of the protocols in question was unintentional, then it is clear that the verdict should be misadventure; but where it can be established that there had been an intent on the part of the relevant persons to have these protocols removed (so that the routine should be rendered more dangerous than it would otherwise need to be), I would then think that there would be grounds for framing criminal charges against these persons.</div></blockquote>Removing the mat is not an apt comparison.  If the high-jump analogy were to be used, the charged men's actions would be closer to raising the bar beyond a reasonable point at which the student would land safely.<br><br>I, in turn, have to concede that Sgt Hu's death was the result of safety measures, in the forms of both the TSR and common sense, being intentionally breached.

"<br><br>Response:<br><br>Well then modify the analogy so that the bullet in the chamber is of such a character that it will not necessarily cause the death of the person into whose head it is fired; say, that the likelihood of its killing someone in the event it were to be fired into his head is indeterminate although obviously and significantly nonzero; and then what you will have is a scenario wherein it would still be the case that if an officer were to force one of his men to engage in a game of Russian Roulette, it would yet be impossible for him not to know that a significantly likely outcome of this game would be the death of the man in question.<br><br>It is therefore true that Â‘asphyxiation occurs in degreesÂ’ and a person asphyxiating someone else may not know the degree to which he would have to be asphyxiating this person before death could occur; but that does not change the fact that he cannot but know that by asphyxiating someone (particularly where he would also know himself to be doing this more strenuously than would be his usual custom) he would be subjecting the latter to a definite risk of death, if not of serious injury; and that is my point, and why also my analogy of the Russian Roulette is apt.<br><br>2) "Assuming that Diva and Ng had all intention of continuing their careers (which IMHO is a given), it cannot have been their intention to induce aspiration to the extent that it would kill Sgt Hu.

However, in practice, I think any soldier in any combat unit would know that the foundation of any military is obedience to commands, without which the military would simply cease to function.  When the platoon sargeant says charge, you charge, and then the Taekwondo instructor says fight, you fight - no two ways about it.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MrBach:</div><div class="quote_body">This line of reasoning is incorrect, as I have already demonstrated in my response above.<br><br>There is no reason to suppose that the specific actions performed upon the two trainees who died were replicated in the case of each of the other trainees and were therefore not more risky (and had not been intended to be more risky) than the other actions performed upon the other trainees.</div></blockquote>There isn't evidence to support that the trainers went out of their way to make it slightly riskier for the two.  It's their intent that makes it an accident or not.  What did they do that were out of the norm?  Or special in the case that led the death.<br><br><blockquote>In any case, it is never moral to perpetrate an injustice so as to achieve a good; this axiom is fundamental to Christianity.</blockquote>I don't see it as injustice when the persons involved were doing their duty which was to train. It's injustice in a normal situation to cause someone's death. Soldiers kill when they are at war that's nature and part of their jobs.  Jesus never condemned anyone from soldiers to taxcollectors and ask them to stop what they're doing.  Instead he told them to do what they're supposed to do but not do anything that was for their own selfish motives.  Clearly not shown in this case.<br><br>BTW I ,too, am a Christian.<br><br><blockquote>If our society tolerated such injustice in the name of its own self-preservation, would our society be worth preserving?</blockquote>Our society tolerates much worst and yes, in the name of its own self-preservation.  You decide whether it is worth preserving or not.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Train the soldiers as much as you want and be aware that the very nature of the vocation is hazardous; but do not unjustly send them to their deaths or otherwise cruelly treat them. </strong></blockquote>It would be unjust and cruel if they were sent driving off a cliff or running through a field of live landmines for no reason.  The defendants followed a procedure (even though it wasn't written in the manual) which they felt was neccessary for this excerise.  This isn't a first degree murder case, it's manslaughter because the death happened unintentionally.</div>
