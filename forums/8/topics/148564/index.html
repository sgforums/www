If the judge in question is assigned the task of ruling on the degree to which a solidier (however decorated he may have been in the past, and however incapable the judge may himself be of evaluating this particular soldier's past achievements) has been culpable for a certain misdeed, then it is only the facts of the circumstances surrounding the commission of this misdeed, that the judge in question would have to be competent enough as to evaluate.

By the same token, if a student kills another student in school, this sort of crime should not be handled by whatever internal system that the school in question may have put in place for dealing with the various misdemeanors that tend to disrupt the orderly functioning of the school as a whole, or harm the well-being of its individual students. The fact that the case was handled in the way that it was says nothing about the competence of military tribunals (considered as a feature of whatever internal system might have been put in place for the purposes of dealing with soldiers who infringe upon military laws, in one way or another); it says, however everything about the universality of the reach of the law and about the fact that certain crimes must in the nature of the case be punished (and be seen to be punished) by laws that apply across the board.<br><br>3) Nevertheless, I agree broadly (as I have already indicated) with what you have said about 'the lynch mob mentality' and am inclined to wonder whether the two soldiers who were not directly involved in the affair, were not punished too harshly.<br><br>Ben<br></div>

People do sometimes do things  out of character.  Eveyone seems to forget that a punishment is not revenge on the offender for what he/she has done instead it's meant to teach a lesson as well as prevention from future occurances.  That's why people are released from prison after serving their time.<br><br><blockquote><strong>2) The case should not merely be handled by a military tribunal because the taking of a life is ordinarily the sort of crime that would have to be seen as directed against the common good of teh society as a whole.

It happened in a camp during training.  It wasn't a case where the defandants committed a premeditated murder or assualt result in a death.  They were doing their job to train these soldiers.  No it wasn't written in the training manual but no way their supervisior had no idea what was going on.  What went on has been going on for years.  If he didn't know, he's not doing his job.<br><br>Can't compare to students killing students.  The principal has no authority to act on it.  Going to school is also not considered a hazardous "job".

If the judge in question is assigned the task of ruling on the degree to which a solidier (however decorated he may have been in the past, and however incapable the judge may himself be of evaluating this particular soldier's past achievements) has been culpable for a certain misdeed, then it is only the facts of the circumstances surrounding the commission of this misdeed, that the judge in question would have to be competent enough as to evaluate. My past achievements as a soldier are irrelevant to the question of whether or not I am culpable for the perpetration of some particular misdeed or other; and so a given judge can be competent enough as to determine whether or not I am culpable in this regard.</div></blockquote>True, MrBach, but the judge's job was to assess if the original judge's judgement stood - that's it.  For him to make those additional remarks was not only superfluous, but it was vicious and IMHO reflects the "I'm going to get you regardless" mentality that he carried into this case.</div>

WTF!</div></blockquote>It's not a case of covering up, caleb.  What's the military tribunal there for if not to handle such cases?  It's a court that specialises in military cases, and the key to that specialisation is that the members of the tribunal know and understand the context within which the cases are presented - to send the case to a civil court, which does not necessarily understand the full implications of the situation, is to do the case a disservice.  It's tantamount to sending a patient to a GP to have a brain tumour removed.  Sure, the guy's a doctor, but why send the patient to him if a specialist is available to do the job?<br><br>While it can't be fairly described as being completely accidental, I think it's a stretch to assume that the instructors intended to drown the trainees.  Knowing the consequences, they would have been mad to have done it with full intent, wouldn't they?</div>
