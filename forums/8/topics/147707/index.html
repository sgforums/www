            <div class='col-md body'>I come across this ghost story somewhere in the yahoo search, so i rip off from it and show it 2 u guys...<br><br>here it goes:<br>This is from a friend of mine who work in Plaza Singapure Golden Village. He said in cinema 7 and 10 there will always be a little girl sitting at the first 2 rows watching movie during the first and last show of the day. Everytime when my friend clears the cinema after the last show or the first show he will always find either a doll or a toy car, and he will these things on top of the exit sign, after that when the first show of the day starts again, both toys will go missing and end up at the same place again. Another case is my experience, i was watching movie at cinema 10 it was playing "The Unborn" (Thailand horror Movie) i wanted to go to the toilet and went out the door i saw a little girl holding a doll went in to the cinema i thought she just came back from the toilet so i didnt bothered but later i realised the show unborn is NC-16 what is a little girl doing in there then my friend who was working at that time came and told me the little girl is not inside the cinema 7 today.<br>Its the last show of the day a.k.a midnight show, cinema 10 little girl with a doll.<br>I remember during my younger days, i have ever heard people mentioned before that usually every cinema, even thought the show is having a full hose, it is actually not really full house because there's always a row of seats that are intentionally left empty for the "Special guests". I'm not sure if this "rule" still practice by cinema nowadays.</div>
