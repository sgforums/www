I remembered when I woke up I was damn sad and scared.. Here it goes..<br><br>I dreamt I was suppose to be part of a 7-man group that held 2 hostages.. Everyone in the group including the 2 hostages were people I knew..<br>The hostages were my friends, K and someone else can't remember.. Don't know why the hell the hostages my friends also wahha..<br>I remembered, the leader of the group, a friend of mine, W, told us to take up the machine guns and attack the SWAT team.. I was too frightened and knew there was no way we would win so I backstab my team and open door and rushed out unarmed and get away into safety. Then don't know what happen, it all looks like Vivocity the surrounding, I felt worried about all my friends including the 2 hostages so I came back and I saw the hostage, K, with his mom.. I approached him and was like crying my balls out, I don't know why lol. Then I asked him where is the rest and he was saying everyone was killed in the gun fight.. So I walked around and saw my friends lying dead on the floor and I felt terrible and guilty.. Among my friends were, S, M, Lester, and Seet who was the last man standing..<br>Then I realised something, that I was actually part of the terrorist group so don't know why all of a sudden I told my friend K, I was going to the police to own up.. Then I woke up..<br><br>K now I try my best to justify the dream..<br><br>- My friend K, was a friend I knew for a long time and we recently met for the past 2 Sundays to play soccer and all..<br><br>- I have been to Vivocity twice in 2 weeks and has made arrangements with my friends to go there again..<br><br>- I asked a friend of mine about W recently whom had gone to Langkawi for holiday, so I'm guessing the memories is still fresh in the mind.. Among all my friends, he is the most terrorist-looking guy so I'm guessing that's why he is the leader of the 7-man team in my dream haha..<br><br>- My friends S and M always hangs out with W, hence the "attached memory" is why they are included in my dream<br><br>- Who the hell is Lester and Seet right? Yesterday, can't remember who I was chatting with in SB about leetspeaking.. Leet became Lester, who coincidently was a new friend I made during soccer training yesterday. Leet also sounds like Seet, an army friend, maybe that's why he was the last man standing..<br><br>- The SWAT team was especially vivid in my dream probably because tuesday, I went to Bugis with my friend to look for a t shirt for bdae present and we saw a couple of nice singlets with army, commando terms and I was particularly attracted to the one with SWAT..<br><br>- Lastly, why all of a sudden I owned up to the police? On tuesday night, I realised my project grades were wrong. I should be getting lower, and I was contemplating whether to clarify with my prof. I decided to chose honesty and emailed my prof. He confirmed the mistake but he said he would adjust my other components accordingly to maintain my current overall grade on account of my honesty.<br><br>My mind played around with all these memories and conjure up a terrorist dream for me..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
