            <div class='col-md body'>dis person sud sud sia... but dunno who is it anyway... enjoy!<br><br>"I draw 1700 dollars a month with no increment for the last 3 years. My mum<br>draws 500 dollars a month. We have long working hours, and rarely get to<br>see each other. After CPF 20% cut and other taxes, we can barely make it<br>through the end of the month.<br><br>Yet we have a rude shock when we both found out we are the third highest<br>paid workers in the world. Our PAP Government has just told us that we<br>draw higher salaries than even Australia and USA! Our unemployment problem<br>is due to the Singapore Citizen's fault. Our Salaries are just too high!!<br><br>Well, just a few years ago, the PAP government says they were going to<br>resume CPF to 40%. Now, the tune has changed. We are paid too high. Cut<br>CPF. At the same time the signal is being sent that salaries should not be<br>paid too high. Remember? China and India much cheaper. Yes! But does the<br>cost of a car or a house the same as the cost in Singapore??<br><br>Next year, GST increases to 5% and everybody pays. This they keep mum. Our<br>ministers and MPs are the highest paid in the whole world. They get<br>millions a year. Each constituency have 3 or 4 MPs. PAP is a big party.<br>Singapore is very small island! Do we need so many MPs? So many civil<br>servants are redundant, overpaid and highly inefficient.<br><br>Here we have a government who thinks they know best and never consults the<br>citizen of any decision that's made. In these times of difficulties we<br>have a $650 million Esplanade splurge.<br><br>Plus:<br><br>We have a transport minister whose main priority isn't transport<br>efficiency but profits.<br><br>We have the first driverless system that cost the citizen's transport<br>extra and breaks down frequently since its 1st use. We were told the fully<br>automated system was developed to keep running cost down. Yet we're<br>required to pay a lot more for it. And it comes free value-added random<br>breakdown feature to 'attract' passengers!<br><br>We have a government who on one hand splurge on the Esplanade but scrimp<br>on HDB upgrades on the other. Who won't learn after repeated mistakes of<br>bankrupt contractors delaying the upgrading project time and again? It is<br>only after flare ups do they take attention to the issue. Have they gone<br>so fat in the middle that they have gone thick in the head??<br><br>PAP is entirely faultless, so they claimed.<br><br>I see now an increasingly bleak future for Singapore. The government has a<br>death gripe on the enterprises here and practices pseudo-deregulations and<br>privatizations. They have no directions. Despite top scholarly decisions<br>made, Singapore's economy is going down, down, down. And now, to top it<br>all, they have resorted to pointing fingers shifting blames. The lowest of<br>the low. Our salaries are higher than the US (what a joke) Now we can all<br>look forward to work till the end of our lives trying to pay up mortgage<br>and have an absolutely zero quality of life.<br><br>I can barely survive on my own, much less talk about getting married and<br>having children. I guess that option is reserved for the PRs and the<br>expats. I am in a country where Singaporeans and its government look down<br>on its own Singaporean citizens. Where they give all the key roles and<br>development to Angmoh expats and PRs.<br><br>Seems to me as the day goes by that the quitters are winners and losers<br>are stayers.<br><br>Ask yourself today, do you want a better quality of life? Will and can<br>Singapore gives you a better quality of life?<br><br>Make a decision today. You'll feel better after you know where to go. For<br>those who want a better quality of life? Make plans. The PAP has<br>shortchanged you and makes you slave to their system till the end of your<br>days. Only you can change your life.<br><br>Emigrate when the time is right."</div>
