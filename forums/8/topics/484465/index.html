            <div class='col-md body'>Is wearing long pants when you reach sec 3 a standard rule? It is getting super hot these days and it gets very stuffy and sweaty in class even when there is no PE. Worse on days with PE then we need to change back to our uniform which we have to wear long pants since sec 3. Many of my friends also agree. Will it be unreasonable if I wear back my lower sec shorts - I mean at least no need to keep rolling up your pants in class. Is it ok to ask the school to give us a choice. I mean it is unfair that boys at CHS get to wear shorts even at sec 4 and most of us in other schools can't.</div>

              <p>Yah,by right it shouldve been a choice.But dunno where along the way it became all boys change to longs,and anyone else who doesnt intend to do so gets pressurised to do it anyway,then it silently became a rule.We ought to bring back this freedom of choice.I for one support this</p>

              <p><br>This is most definitely a myth which must be debunked.What has short or long pants gotta do with maturity,and why should they feel awkward in shorts?To the contrary i feel many upper sec boys would still look good in shorts.</p>
              <p>We must prevent at all cost this final scenario which u are predicting.Who then would wear school shorts?Girls?Are we guys losing our rights to wear more and more of our own clothes?</p>

              <p>Well,i thought skirts are supposed to be quite airy and open enough.If its for equality,i guess nobody can say no,but be sure its actually the same,not the girls' shorts being shorter than the boys,like those hotpants that they suddenly are obsessed with nowadays.There's also alot to be done about dresscode equality at the workplace,but i guess thats another topic...</p>
              <p>There are boys who actually wear skirts in protest for being disallowed to wear shorts to school during hot days: <br><a href="http://www.care2.com/causes/boys-in-britain-try-to-stay-cool-by-wearing-skirts.html">http://www.care2.com/causes/boys-in-britain-try-to-stay-cool-by-wearing-skirts.html</a></p>

              <p>actually now many secondary schools are making boys wear pants
              from as early as secondary one. many years ago Pioneer Secondary
              School made this change. by 2016, Westwood Secondary School will
              also make this change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to <a title="WWSS" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.westwoodsec.moe.edu.sg/wbn/slot/u2958/doc/2014/Letter%20to%20Sec%201%20parents.pdf"> WWSS</a>, this change is "based on feedback by parents and students
              that boys are maturing a lot faster these days, and upon reaching
              puberty, they look and feel awkward in shorts".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think eventually, every boy in Singapore have to wear
              pants the moment they start secondary school.</p>

              <p>Well,i thought skirts are supposed to be quite airy and open
              enough.If its for equality,i guess nobody can say no,but be sure
              its actually the same,not the girls' shorts being shorter than the
              boys,like those hotpants that they suddenly are obsessed with
              nowadays.There's also alot to be done about dresscode equality at
              the workplace,but i guess thats another topic...</p>
              <p>There are boys who actually wear skirts in protest for being

              <p>mm... I think what Mr JurongWestresident meant is that both genders wear the same type (unisex) of shorts, with rules enforcing the length must cover the knee cap.</p>
              <p>personally, I do not think it is acceptable for boys to wear skirts. I mean, <em>horne</em>stly, when boys have an erection, won't it be awkward as the skirt is "lifted up"? well, if it is for protest, then still can. but if is for everyday wear, then a bit not correct.</p>

              <p>Neither do i,but it is done to prove a point.For those who claim a pseudo equality based on "males and females are both not allowed shorts",when females are allowed short skirts,which they take by default the males wont dare to touch.And im pretty sure normal people dont get so horny or lack of control to get erections as and when for no reason</p>

                                        <p>Maybe if enough boys wore shorts collectively,they'd understand
                                        and officially allow it to be worn instead of long pants</p>

              Hi Fabrizzo I like your idea. DO you mean that in the past upper sec boys were allowed the choice of wearing shorts?
              
              I admit when I was in sec2 I was looking forward to the time we an be in sec3 because of the long pants. It is like a sign that you have become a senior and seniors get more respect in the school and no one can tease you. I think it is the school culture that
              makes us feel this way and I think is the same in other schools also.
              
              But in the end once we get to wear long pants then we find it super uncomfortable and troublesome but it is too late. Many of us wish we can still wear shorts but I dont think anyone will do so as people will laugh if any upper sec guy is wearing shorts and maybe they thought he got retained or demoted. So envious of schools like CHS where the upper sec boys dont have long pants.
