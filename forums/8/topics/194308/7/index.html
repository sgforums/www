            <div class='col-md body'>Since we are on parenting topic and I will soon be one, I like to put forth my few cents worth of opinion. I subscribe to the old school thought of caning. Me and my siblings grew up from an era where caning is meted out as punishment at home and also at school when normal teachers are also given the rights to cane unlike now.<br><br>And now we are grown up, we believe caning do in fact play an important part in shaping us to the current day status. Obedience and respect for teachers and parents are it's end product. Looking at current crop of children, their respect are almost nil simple becuz no one believe in cane anymore. They believe teaching by love. I beg to differ. Only inflicted pain can make one remember their mistake for life.<br><br>If caning is not a good deterrent and tool, our Spore prison system would not have use cane as their punishment besides imprisonment. So in a way I think cane should not be abolished but instead be re-ignited and glorified to bring back to good old days of the past era.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>PS. I still remember the caning that teacher gave me hehehee.....<br></div>

I subscribe to the old school thought of caning. Me and my siblings grew up from an era where caning is meted out as punishment at home and also at school when normal teachers are also given the rights to cane unlike now.<br><br>And now we are grown up, we believe caning do in fact play an important part in shaping us to the current day status. Obedience and respect for teachers and parents are it's end product. Looking at current crop of children, their respect are almost nil simple becuz no one believe in cane anymore. They believe teaching by love. I beg to differ. Only inflicted pain can make one remember their mistake for life.<br><br>If caning is not a good deterrent and tool, our Spore prison system would not have use cane as their punishment besides imprisonment.

Its the lack of an instilling the basic ethos of not harming others that the parents are guilty of. Afterall, many of these parents were caned were they not? And what happens? They become terrible apathetic parents.

I got caned for not knowing my maths as a kid, now thanks to it, I hate maths to the core. Fear and pain made me a very disturbed individual for a long time. Resentment took a long time to cleanse out of me.<br><br>Even in NS they don't cane you. Its illegal for a superior to physically hurt a subordinate<br><br>Your so-called teaching tools are more likely to have the highest odds of failure as well. Nobody denies punishment is necessary as a last resort, but u're talking specifically about caning. The army doesn't cane as a punishment, why do u have to cane as a punishment? U can find other ways of punishing your kids. U talk about the prison system, but is that how you look at your kids? Convicted criminals? I pity them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sohguanh:</div><div class="quote_body">It is done in ancient times rite?

Btw u talk a lot about pain being a good teacher, but u'll probably be the 1st one to cry if its inflicted on you. I'm a sado-masochist and yet I do not believe in inflicting pain on children.<br><br>And talking about pain and fear as a means of maintain authority, don't u realise u are no better than Hitler, Stalin, Saddam, or any other tinpot dictators around the world? And don't u know the way the story ens? Fear does not breed obdience. It breeds sublimal resistance and resentment. And in the end, there is no happy ending for everyone involved, but there IS a just and painful end for the one who tried to use fear and pain as a means of maintain authority.</div>
