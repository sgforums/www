            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, anyone here stay in rented flats?<br><br>Im new to this and recently encountered quite an unreasonable reasoning from the LL.  Im Singaporean and rented whole flat and therefore Im the only one using and paying the monthly Singapore Power bills.  Last month government subsidised a certain amount for every household and my bill was subsidised $50.  But I was not supposed to be entitled to this privilege even thou im the one using and paying for all usage.  LL told me I jus pay watever i use and no discount applicable to me.  I have to pay the full amount without the subsidy and instead they got the privilege of the discount.<br><br>I felt this is really unfair to me as Im paying the full SP bills but im not entitled to the privilege tat the government give.  Moreover, i have been very accommodating in many aspects. eg. my rental is supposed to due on every 8th of the month but was asked to pay earlier like on the 1st of every month and I compromised.  But now they actually showed their true colour jus becoz of this $50.<br><br>I was thinking did anyone have the similar experience as me and hope can share some experience or tips with me so I will be smarter in dealing with other LL should I move on to the next house.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, ya i rented a 3-rm HDB flat (common room locked) for a yr lease (open contract) staying alone (LL NOT staying with me).  Im actually rather happy staying here as everything is working quite well for me until this issue, which was rather unexpected from the LL.  Im responsible for the utility but like dragg says the LL is being too calculative considering that i have been a very responsible and good tenant (not to brag but i really am!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).  they do not even compromise on letting me save on some money, as they dun lose out in anyway ultimately.<br><br>althou the contract did not state anything on the benefit, it also did not state that i will not be entitled to the benefit wat.  only mentioned the utility bill is separate from the rental fee.  so its like a yes or no situation and obviously the LL is pulling a fast one on me.<br><br>they even used contract to intimidate me and dig out things like they have to pay the tv licence, town council, rubbish and door tax etc, which are obviously included in the rental fee rite?<br><br>i have never expected them to behave like tat for $50 coz i have been talking to them very amicably on the phone but they slam my phone and do not wish to talk to me and started sms me sarcastic remarks like whether i wanna share the cost with them on the taxes and they are willing to let me "enjoy the benefit" of sharing with them and like i dun have to bother about other things, jus pay wat i spend on..<br><br>i could not comprehend how they can turn so nasty over a mere $50 when i only wan to discuss and hope they can be flexible to let me benefit from this $50 coz in layman terms, the $50 should be entitled to whoever is paying the utilities bill mar... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Landlord aren't suppose to rent out the whole unit of flats. Since you're paying the utilities in full, you should be reimbursed with that $50 rebate. But, I thought that $50 is being payout via deduction directly from the bill ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i heard tat if they are "approved" units by HDB, they could rent out the whole flat.<br><br>Regarding the $50, the bill is deducted directly from my LL's giro.  I will pay the full amount at every end of the month when the bill comes.  so i was not aware of this discount until the latest bill where the summary reflected SP only deduct the amount from their giro less $50. (e.g. last month bill is $100, SP only deduct $50 from LL's giro).<br><br>so i lose out in this point as i have already paid the full amount last month.  tats y i ask to offset $50 from this month's bill but was told off by LL tat im not entitled to it.<br><br>RIDICULOUS!!<br><br></div>
