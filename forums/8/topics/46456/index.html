            <div class='col-md body'><strong>If there is one thing women need to know about men, it is that play - from sports to toys to booze - is second nature to them</strong><br><br>IF THERE is a four-letter word which describes what men do best, it is 'play'.<br><br>It is a verb that captures what we are all about.<br><br>Men 'play' all our lives. We are serious about having fun. We love playing and we are addicted to it. We are also brilliant at making excuses for it.<br><br>It is something some of us will never outgrow, because it is second nature to us.<br><br>And when it comes to relationships, understanding a man's inherent need to 'play' is key to appreciating him, and vice versa.<br><br>Let me illustrate with the example I know best: myself.<br><br>As a child, I played with my food. I blew bubbles into my Coke, I flicked rice off my spoon and I bounced fishballs off the floor.<br><br>I played with candle fire during lantern festivals. I held my breath underwater. I even played while in the loo, fine-tuning the art of what NSmen refer to as 'zeroing', or aiming.<br><br>In school, I played truant. I also folded paper planes, shot rubber bands at classmates and scrawled with permanent markers all over my textbooks, and then my friends' textbooks.<br><br>Not surprisingly, I was no teacher's pet.<br><br>To get time off tutorials and lectures, I played badminton and, amazingly, even made it to the school team - which freed me up for even more playtime. I could visit other schools to play in national tournaments.<br><br>Throughout my school life, I was constantly warned by teachers not to 'play punk', 'play havoc' and, rather embarrassingly, 'play the fool'.<br><br>Alas, when I discovered girls, I had the tables turned and had my feelings played with.<br><br>Disgruntled, I returned the favour on a couple of them - though, admittedly, playing with their feelings was no fun.<br><br>But then, as I tell newly-dumped, freshly single friends: 'Don't hate the player, hate the game.'<br><br>The fun didn't stop even after I was hauled off to National Service.<br><br>I played with my standard issues - applying Kiwi boot-polish on my bunk mates' faces while they slept and flicking wet towels on their bare butts.<br><br>I was, of course, traumatised by like-minded colleagues, too.<br><br>Ridiculously, I even played with my life.<br><br>I stared down the barrel of a fully loaded M-16. I remember it was a strangely compelling sensation. Maybe Kurt Cobain had been too playful.<br><br>Now that I'm working, I have turned my bedroom into a playpen: There is a gaming-only computer, a TV set, an old Play station, an Xbox, a DVD player, a hi-fi set, an old basketball, three tennis rackets, mountains of CDs, a modest collection of DVDs, paperbacks and way too many magazines.<br><br>And don't forget the two electric guitars I have propped up for 'rock-troubadour' credibility, though one of them is for cranking out broken chords while the other is for aesthetic reasons.<br><br>When I reach for anything in my room, it is bound to give me a playful thrill.<br><br>I am truly king of my domain.<br><br>For without sports, video games and, yes, competitive alcohol consumption, grown men would be a miserable bunch.<br><br>After all, even producer extraordinaire Moby called his best-selling album Play.<br><br>Although they might not look it, grown-up, serious-looking men still play, although with different things.<br><br>If they are not playing with stocks and shares, they are playing with the property market, cars, ornamental fish or checkers at the kopitiam, or with their kids or women, or watching other men playing football, basketball and golf.<br><br>No matter how potentially hazardous to our health (sky-jumping, fast food) or pockets (Las Vegas, marriage), men can't help fueling their adrenaline.<br><br>So when it comes to relationships, women must understand that men are basically teens with disposable income - we earn to spend on play.<br><br>I read somewhere that while women look for a 'man' in a man, men look for a 'playmate' in their women.<br><br>No, not playmates you call Miss July or Miss October - although many guys I know won't mind - but women who are game, game for a beer, a pillow fight, a rock concert or a midnight skinny dip in Koh Samui.<br><br>If a woman is game enough to make herself a playmate, a man will definitely want to score brownie points with her.<br><br>So, if the maxim 'to know us is to love us' holds water, then ladies, it's time for a cold shower because men - whether we are 16 or 60 - will always be boys.<br><br>So, please, come out and play.</div>
