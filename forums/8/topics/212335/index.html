            <div class='col-md body'>I would advise your friend to report to the Police. Incessant telephone calls and sms of vulgarity is tantamount to harrassment. Moreover, it's an offence to be an illegal bookie. So your friend's not wanting to pay up to this bookie appears right. Let the bookie report you to the Police. He'll be in hotter soup than your friend will be as the money 'owed' to the bookie is not recoverable under the law since the bookie is illegal....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
