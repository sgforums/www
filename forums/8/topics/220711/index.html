            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Just last night I had to have dinner at my wife's grandmother's place. Believe me I never liked to go there.<br><br>Its inhabitants the grand pa and ma, and 50+ aunt that is not married ever, and a 40+ uncle. Going there makes me feel so old.<br><br>What ever it is I got in to a slight disagreement with the Aunt. As my Cousin-in-Law is getting married and "The Aunt" told me what I must address the Cousin-in-Law's wife as. And of course I said huh????? and WTF in my heart. And explain if the person is a generation above or older we should give them the respect and greet them the title they deserve like Aunt, Uncle and grandma and so on... So I would just call my cousin in law and his wife by name as we are in the same generation and its not needed and both of us would feel so awkward if i were to do so. So i rebark that their favorite boy the family my wife's younger brother (a brat and Spoilt brat by "the Aunt " and grandmother) also never call me by my title "Brother in Law" and do you know what they replied "he's still young"<br><br>Do you think 21 years old is still considered young, finish NS still need "the Aunt" and grandmother to scoop rice and other food for him during meals and wash his plates after that and also do his laundry for him weekly.<br><br>I think the older generation perception of respect is totally wrong and its subjective to their likings.<br><br>Whould you all agree with me? What "the Aunt" said is totally rubbish as she didn't ask my "young" bro-in-law to greet me with the title its not that I want it. Its that I don't like it when they say its a tradition that its a must. Almost felt like saying to "the Aunt" up yours you old hag. You should stay in the 70's it fits your mentallity perfectly.<br><br>On another occasion "the Aunt" complain that we must increase the household payment to them as I am going there to eat and its not enough.<br>Let me explain, my mother in law gives 300 to them and only the "Brat" goes there to eat everyday. Me and my wife gives 100 and I go there like once or twice per week. The reason why the money is not enough is because the grand mother would buy snowfish like a small piece for $18-$20 for the brat to eat. Where as me and my wife would always be the last to eat, therefore eat the left overs. Its totally stupid and nonsense for "the Aunt" to claim more from me.<br><br>Than it came down to the grandmother. Telling us we must give more Ang Pao to the Cousin-in-law for the wedding. Then I was thinking to myself WTF when I got married they never give a cent to me because they were not married and now I must give more.<br><br>That's why I'm so fed up of this place, these type of tradition shit is too much for me to handle there fore lucky me my application to migrate is approved and I'm getting the F**k out of this place in 3-4 months.<br><br>I hope you people are more lucky than me and your in-laws don't suck like them. Anyway Peace, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year in 1 months time.<br><br>Out<br></div>
