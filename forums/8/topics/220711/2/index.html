            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, to be truthful, i never like the tradtional Chinese interpretation of filial piety and respect. Respect must be earned and filial piety centres around love<br><br>Unfortunately, most often than not its more on ego, pride and status, and most importantly, mian zi. You were taught to be more respectful to elders not because you like them, or they are your close ones, or anything, but because probably your dad or someone wants his mian zi, to show he got 'teach his kids manners'.<br><br>I find this hypocritical, and if your parents are the traditional type, tell them this and you will be labelled 'unfilial'.

As my Cousin-in-Law is getting married and "The Aunt" told me what I must address the Cousin-in-Law's wife as. And of course I said huh????? and WTF in my heart. And explain if the person is a generation above or older we should give them the respect and greet them the title they deserve like Aunt, Uncle and grandma and so on... So I would just call my cousin in law and his wife by name as we are in the same generation and its not needed and both of us would feel so awkward if i were to do so. So i rebark that their favorite boy the family my wife's younger brother (a brat and Spoilt brat by "the Aunt " and grandmother) also never call me by my title "Brother in Law" and do you know what they replied "he's still young"<br><br>Do you think 21 years old is still considered young, finish NS still need "the Aunt" and grandmother to scoop rice and other food for him during meals and wash his plates after that and also do his laundry for him weekly.<br><br>I think the older generation perception of respect is totally wrong and its subjective to their likings.<br><br>Whould you all agree with me?

The reason why the money is not enough is because the grand mother would buy snowfish like a small piece for $18-$20 for the brat to eat.

If your father beat you, scold you for every small little thing you do, dont blame him, blame your grandpa. The reason your father is like that is bcos he was treated that way by your grandpa, i am not saying he's taking a revenage on you from your grandpa. But he thought it's how to "teach" kids, cos that's what your grandpa did to him. But if your father realize he shouldnt do that, he teach you with reasons, lecture you instead of scolding you. Punish you in more civilised ways other than beating you, then when you have kids, most likely you wont beat your kids like what your grandpa did. Becos your father made that change.<br><br>But my reminder on "one day you will get old too", that's different thing. What i really want to tell you is that, the world is always changing. You can put away all the traditional thinking, keep yourself as modern as you are now until you are 80yrs old. But you will never be as modern as the generations much younger than you. Bcos the culture background of your grandpa's time, your dad' time, your time, your son's time, your grandson's time are all different. Now you think you are very open minded already, but maybe when you get old, gay/lesbian has become legal, the young ppl are taking it as very common thing, but you may not be able to accpet. There will always be some new things that you cant accept.<br><br>Some good traditions, family values should be passed on to the lower generations. But some that couldn't match well with the mordern time, it's ok to change it.<br><br>And dont under estimate your influence on your kids, how you treat your parents will affect how your kids treat you in the future.<br><br>btw, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you too.</div>

Don't like them why you still go there few times a week?? Go there 2-3 times a week $100, can go eat out also what.<br><br>Tell you to address by title, up to you what, don't like don't do lah, complain for what.  Give angpow also want to complain, bugger when people give you when you got married, u think they don't feel the pinch ah, they still give what.<br><br>BTW are you sure you man ah? So damn petty for what, small things like this want to complain, wah liao eh I pity your wife lei.<br><br>No in-law perfect, just tolerate, give face to wife. One thing u must understand, beyond fillial piety is compassion. They are old and have nothing to look forward to in life and "Grandma" may soon die, what's wrong if she likes snowfish, not like you cant afford.<br><br>I agree, respect must be earned, but to live life without compassion will leave you a bitter person.

There will always be some new things that you cant accept.<br><br>Some good traditions, family values should be passed on to the lower generations. But some that couldn't match well with the mordern time, it's ok to change it.<br><br>And dont under estimate your influence on your kids, how you treat your parents will affect how your kids treat you in the future.<br><br>btw, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you too.</div></blockquote>True enough that's the reason I want to move away from here and bring up my kids (if I do have in the near future) I don't want my kids / future daughter or son in law to knee to me to present tea and stuff i rather they be nice to my children he/she is marrying. All the kneeling and stuff would be useless if he/she does not treat my children with respect, care and love.<br><br>Also away from my in-laws especially "the aunt" so she doesn't spoil my child like my brother in law.<br><br>I pretty sure me and my wife would be able to handle it as both of us are Psychology Grads although we did not specialise in Child Development ...lol but still basics of understanding a small one should be ok i guess.<br><br>Last not to bring along any of the bad chinese habits to the future generations like remember last time your mom have to kneel like few hours in front of her mother-in-law to listern to her lecture about her duties as a wife... daughter-in-law... guess what i went through that when i got married made me so mad even my own parents also never ask me to kneel and present tea...her parent... aunt... and grand mother gave me lecture man WTF...<br><br>but ignorance is blits still hahahaha</div>

Don't like them why you still go there few times a week?? Go there 2-3 times a week $100, can go eat out also what.<br><br>Tell you to address by title, up to you what, don't like don't do lah, complain for what.  Give angpow also want to complain, bugger when people give you when you got married, u think they don't feel the pinch ah, they still give what.<br><br>BTW are you sure you man ah? So damn petty for what, small things like this want to complain, wah liao eh I pity your wife lei.<br><br>No in-law perfect, just tolerate, give face to wife. One thing u must understand, beyond fillial piety is compassion. They are old and have nothing to look forward to in life and "Grandma" may soon die, what's wrong if she likes snowfish, not like you cant afford.<br><br>I agree, respect must be earned, but to live life without compassion will leave you a bitter person. Live and let live brother.<br><br></div></blockquote>I respect you views brother... true enough i don't wanna go but no choice my wife wants to see her grandmother i go only once now but still give....<br><br>lets tackle your comments objectively by clarifying them one by one.<br>I tried not to address by title but would you want to make a scene on the wedding day i guess no.<br><br>Give Ang pow I don't mind just people telling me how much to give is the irritating part.When i got married for your information the in-laws took almost 40% F..K I feel the pinch more than anyone that's why i give slightly more thatn enough to cover my share on the table when i attend the problem do you still think the problem is me?<br><br>I think you for your pity for my wife but i think you should rephrase as its her family that is treating her wrongly... oneside they tell her you are married out but on another side you have to give money leh come on i have my own parents to feed don't I? If you don't earn a lot, do you think you would be able to feed both sides?<br><br>please read carefully the snowfish is not for herself or us its for an ungrateful grandsone that she have that does not contribute to the family and sometimes when she cooks for him he doesn't even turn up for dinner and it goes to waste and for a 21 year old "idiot" i would call him he have to have his grandmother to wait for him by scooping rice into his bowl and washing up after him? would you be angry if you would in my shoe? Not to the people but their practice?<br><br>Hope this changes your view that I'm still the problem</div>
