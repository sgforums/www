              <p>These days the tax filing has changed abit, in the past used to be regardless of whether you need to pay tax you still need to file you income tax returns. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But these days, if you earn less than $22,000, there is no need for you to file, unless you want to claim tax deducted at source (being dividends paid to you from shares you own, they are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates, which could be higher than your personal marginal tax rate). Also, you need to file if IRAS has sent you any forms or pin number.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, if I have been evading taxes for the past few years, I would be very careful talking to those folks from IRAS, most of the time they will ask for your name and NRIC first. So becareful, else end up incriminating yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>You will need to file if you have received a paper form (Form B1/B/M) or a letter from IRAS inviting you to e-File.</em></p>
              <p><em>Did not receive anything?</em></p>
              <p><em>Even if you have not received any notification from IRAS to e-File, you need to file if:</em></p>

              <p>thanks a lot, all!</p>
              <p>regarding this:</p>
              <p><br>------------------------------</p>
              <p>your income for the previous year is <strong>$22,000 or
                                          more</strong>;</p>
              <p>-----------------------------</p>
              <p>they say you must file if income for previous year is $22000 or more, what about the previous-previous year?</p>
              <p>let say i worked total 2.5 years and earned total $30000 during these 2.5 years.</p>
              <p>never reported tax at all during these 2.5 years.</p>
              <p>so, like that means i overshot liao is it?</p>
              <p>anyway, i doubt i'll be eligible for any tax rebates, cos' my family is middle-income, i never donate / volunteer to any charity etc., i'm not handicapped....haiz.</p>

              <p>What they mean by previous year is the year before the year of assessment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because IRAS tax income based on previous year 2007(Jan-Dec), like this is Year of Assessment (YA) 2008.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So is your income last year more or less than $22,000?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then for YA 2007, is your income for 2006 Jan-Dec more or less than $22,000.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If all your yearly basis less than $22,000, then no problems lah.</p>

              <p>my income is basically:</p>
              <p>2006: $900</p>
              <p>2007: $14800</p>
              <p>2008: $9000 - $11000+-</p>
              <p>so, like that how? 3 years total is over $22000....</p>
              <p>do they judge it year by year?</p>
              <p>because my yearly salary total will always be less than $22000 (i earn $1450 per month, including CPF).....</p>
              <p>so, since i earn less than $22000 every year, no need to pay any tax is it? just report only?</p>

              <p>thanks maurizo,.....that means everyone whose annual salary is lesser than S$22000 no need to pay tax? like those low-earners like me, those toilet cleaners and newspaper sellers?</p>
              <p>because my 3 different employers these years have given me this company's IRAs form saying how much i earn for a certain period of time etc, although i don't remember getting any letter from IRAS itself.</p>
              <p>these forms for what one ah? to keep as personal filing for future tax reporting in case in future, i earn more than $22000 per year?</p>
