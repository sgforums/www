            <div class='col-md body'><br>I think the girl is brave and different from other girls. They will have a much easier time to find their prince charming as they make things happened instead of waiting for things to happen. They will also be able to CHOOSE a guy, as opposed to being chosen. Also, normally girls who make the first move are more open minded, and from my experience, they are more friendly and more out going, making friends easily and hence they are normally surrounded by alot of friends. They tend to lead happier lives than people who are more reserved and hide in their caves all the time.</div>

I have loads of guy-friends.<br><br>But then, I still feel sad coz' the one that I like didn't confess to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>Hey, if you all want to know who are your friends crushes, please go to this website http://crushcalculator.com<br>If I type the wrong one, I come back later to edit.<br>That is a website where you can register to be a member. Then they will sent you this link to sent to your friends. They simply just have to write their crushes name and their own name and click the, "Calculate." but then actually, it is a trick and THAT page will be sent to you and you know who are their crushes liao.<br>Unless, of course, they fell for this trick before. But don't sent that to any people who get angry easily as I sent this to one of my friend and she fell for it and she was so damn angry that she sent me hate mails and keep saying FU and go to hell la you biatch.<br><br>That are the risks!</div>
