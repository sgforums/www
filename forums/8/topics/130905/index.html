            <div class='col-md body'>Which type u belong to?<br><br>Did you know that your sleeping position says a lot about your personality?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Do you sleep on your tummy the entire night? </strong></span><br><br>While you are balanced and level headed, you tend to be slightly narrow minded. You have fixed ideas and are unlikely to accept another person's opinion easily. You force people to comply with your needs, and you rarely adjust to others. In spite of this, you are popular and have many friends.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In a foetal position </strong></span><br><br>If you sleep on your side with your knees curled up towards your stomach, in a foetal position, it shows that you are vulnerable and sensitive. You can get easily hurt, and get upset very easily. You also tend to be selfish, and put your needs ahead of others. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it will do you good to lighten up a bit. You have a short temper and are easily irritated.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On your side, with your knees slightly bent</strong></span><br><br>If you sleep on your side with your knees very slightly bent, it shows that you are a sincere and loving person. You are sensitive, polite and gentle. You would never hurt anyone intentionally - you're too nice a person. You have a good heart, and everyone is fond of you. You get along with most people, as you see the good in them and ignore the bad. This is a rare quality. However, at times you tend to be too harsh and critical of yourself. If you make a mistake, you will brood about it for hours - or even days.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On your back with your legs crossed </strong></span><br><br>If you sleep on your back with your legs crossed, it shows that you are slightly vain and self-obsessed. You find it difficult to accept change. You like things to stay the way you are, and are constantly looking back into your past. You are a solitary person, and you are also very tolerant and patient.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On your side, with your knees curled </span></strong><br><br>If you sleep on your side, without your knees bent but not totally curled in towards your tummy, it indicates that you are a confident person. You usually are successful in most of your undertakings. You are hardworking and dedicated. Your lack of success at anything is more due to your neglect and laidback attitude than incompetence. If you sleep on your right side, with your right arm stretched out under your head, power and fortune are not far from your grasp.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On your side, with one knee bent </strong></span><br><br>Do you sleep on your side, with one knee bent and the other straight? You are a quiet and introverted person. The saying 'Still waters run deep' seems to have been made for you, because though you don't talk much, you observe and listen. You talk less because you don't believe in indulging in unnecessary conversation. You are intelligent, and are of a balanced nature. Rarely will you lose control of yourself. You know what you are doing, and where you are going. However, you don't have too much patience with those who are less intelligent than you. Loosen up! You don't discuss your feelings, and are not a very emotional person. You are rational and think with your head, not with your heart.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On your back, with your arms crossed under your head </span></strong><br><br>If you sleep on your back with your arms crossed under your head, it shows that you are an intelligent person. You are not a chatterbox, but you are friendly, and have a few close friends - who are all you need. It takes you a while to get to like someone. Men who sleep like this make good providers, but they don't love easily. Too choosy perhaps.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>On your back with your arms and legs straight </strong></span><br><br>If you sleep on your back with your arms and legs spread out straight, it shows that you are a free spirit! You love your independence. And, you love to gossip! You also don't brood over things too much. You are laidback and don't get tense easily -which is a good thing. In addition, you enjoy the luxurious things in life,and are a spendthrift. But, thankfully, your optimistic attitude helps you along the career ladder, and you probably earn a lot as well. you definitely are capable of it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
