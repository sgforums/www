Still it is something that most of us have to face at one stage of our life.<br><br>What do you think is an ideal age for marriage, taking into consideration your ability to host the wedding and to start family. Let's see, there is the dinner, honeymoon, housing, renovation.<br><br>How long after wedding would you forsee a kid coming along? Would you rather spend a few years together alone, or have one little thingy tagging along as soon as possible?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Luf,<br><br>personally I think that 28 is a good age for guys and around 24 for girls...but definately varies by how ready the people feel.<br><br>There was a survey once that found out that marriages actually do more bad than good for marriages because of very obvious reasons...Everyone has this fairy tale idea of how they want to get married and spend a bomb on it...Rental of this and that, buying this and that...A lot of marriages and ceremony can easily hit $50,000-$100,000....and usually most people don't have this kind of money so they take in loans and what have u...Then the ring is another few grand...if not ten...:-(<br><br>And seeing as how the day is supposed to be so good, might as well get the best...so more money...<br><br>I was invited to a few weddigns here and back in the states before....and the overwhelmoing theme behind it all is that :<br><br>1. bride and groom r getting married.<br>2. bring money for them....<br><br>I feel that marriage has become all about money and face more than anything else...I really respect those people who quietly get married with only their closest family and friends there9just a few people)....or those who do it privately...so romantic and so personal...so meaningful when u compare it to the normal marriage...<br><br>I know the rationale behind having all ur family and friends there, because they want to share ur exciement and happiness(also must get  abit of money from them eh?:-)<br><br>But I think that it doesn't have to be a spectacle...i think that u can just go somewhere that u can call ur own and have a quiet marriage ...just u and ur wife/husband...and there is no pressure...no outside influence...no anything..just you, your future spouse, and your love for each other....It becomes a very personal vow that resonates in your soul...something more memorable than having the entire world being there...unlesss u like it...<br><br>A lot of married couples spend years and years trying to pay back their marriage debts...and so many times it puts a terrible toll on the new couple that isn't or shouldn't be necessary....How can young people bear so much burden...Love and marriage does not have to mean that u must suffer like hell for it...no...it is only when we bring in our fairy tale ideas and put the icing on our love that things start to get complicated...<br><br>When ur a newlywed...u should be wooried about each other...what u both are doing, and how much u love to be with each other...not where hte money is going to come from to9 pay for all these things..<br><br>it kind of makes marriage very commercialised...i yet don't know what I want to do for my marriage,...iof anyone even wants to mary me,...but These are just some thought sto consider before u put urself through hell...:-)<br><br>Have a happy marriage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting question, luf.<br>For guys there is always the bigger financial burden to consider despite the hype about equality of sexes. Of course the females are standing up now and are mostly independant but somehow or other in our society the burden is still on the guys. This would probably take at least a few years of work after graduation say somewhere around 26-28. It would probably depend on the expectation of marriage such as where to go for honeymoon etc and what you already have in the first place. Those with some kind of inheritance probably need not worry that much.<br>I'll not wait to own everything before I get married. Think it would be nice to work towards some bigger goals with a partner and support each other along the way.<br>As for kids, personally, I will not want a kid unless I can be sure I'll be able to provide well for the kid and is able to take good care of the increase in responsibilities that comes with raising a child.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think 26 for guys and 26 for girls. Getting married ought to be separate from the ability to hold a reception or have a huge ceremony. It should depend on the maturity of the two people involved as well as how much they love each other at that stage. Of course different people mature at different ages, but 26 would be the age that I expect me to be comfortably on the way.<br><br>As for kids, probably at least 3 or 4 years after marriage. Sooner if the couple are adapting to marriage life very nicely and are prepared to sacrifice some of the fun of coupledom for more committment and hardwork.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firewire: Though I would agree with you on the idea of holding quiet, personal weddings instead of flashy, expensive ones, it's sometimes really not up to the couple to decide what they want for themselves. Parental approval plays a huge role in marriage as well. If the couple in question have parents who are old-fashioned or traditional-minded, I don't think they can even hope for a quiet wedding. It's just that conventional idea of saving 'face'. And it can be real hard trying to change their mindsets.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with MySubterfuge and firewire.  A wedding day is supposed to be a day for the newly wed coupled to enjoy.  But most of the time, it turn out to be the most stressful day.  It turn out to be a day for the guests, not the newly wed couple.<br><br>If I were to spend $50k to $100k on a wedding, I would rather not get married.  The financial burden is just suicidal.  Moreover, I would rather spend that kind of money on a downpayment on house or start a business which gives me a better rate of return on investment.<br><br>I agree with firwire that some would rather have a very low cost, low profile wedding.  There will be no guest attending a glamorous dinner where they eat and go.<br><br>In fact, my future wife and I have agreed that we would have a low cost wedding - no big chinese thingy banguet with XO, shark fins soup and shits like these that cost an arm and a leg. Yes, each table with ten could cost anywhere from CAD$400 - CAD$700 before 7% GST tax and 15% tips. Imgaine if you have more than 100 guests.  Your parents would start inviting their friends and relatives(the face thing.)<br><br>Instead of spending the money on banquet, we would spend on the money on photography, video graphy, wedding dress and honeymoon.<br>Oopps, got to go!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I must agree with u there Sunterfuge....My idea is only an ideal situation...oft times it just ahs nothing to do with the couple at all and it's really waht the family wants to do to save face...But of course some families do want to make it a happy day for their "children", but most times it's about showing face...<br><br>As for children, I think that everyone here seems to agree that the couple should be adjusted to marriage before having them...It's a big responsibility..probably ur biggest responsibility in life...so being ready for it and being ready to sacrifice for it is really important...<br><br>Money and Power,<br><br>Hehe heh:-)  I used to try and get myself away from work as ofrten as I could also...if there was some kind of thing where I had to be anywhere other than my office, I would be the first to volunteer...(referring to ur seminar)...ha ha:-) I'm such a lazy Barstard...:-)<br><br>Also, most people could say that the guests are obligated to bring money (hong bao?) so each table basically can pay for itself and then some....buuuuuttt......I think that the whole thing (whether the table can pay for itself or not) should be less about saving face and more about the couple...<br><br>Then again, some people aspire to have these kinds of wedding so I guess noone can really say...but ideally it should be a private event...:-)<br><br>And as for using that money for investment or downpayment for house or business...(I agree with u totally here:-)...buuuut...most women would say that this is a typical man's attittude...always willing to use money for other things instead of using it for wedding (or her), or an excessively expensive ring...etc...just sad that a lot of women still have this fairy tale idea of it all and equate marriage with how much the guy is willing to spend for the wedding to show how much he cares...dohhh!!!....But when u look at it...that's another difference between the two sexes..:-)lucky not everyone is like this huh Money...then our asses would really be i a sling...:-)then 1 week later the loan shark starts coming around already...:-)<br><br>of cos i'm not trying to say everyone is like this, but I guess the general populace would think like this...juss my opinion...:-)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx guys for all the response. Seems like it's the guys who are responding.. guess most of the burden on wedding finances fall upon the guy side. Well, the gal would be affected too after the wedding is over of coz.<br><br>Firewire: Yeah, it would have been great to save all the money spent on the wedding by not hosting a dinner, but we are still asian and I doubt a lot of family would like that idea.<br><br>Say for an ideal asian style wedding.. there would be dinner which would set back about 10k or so after collecting back the ang paos, then the photography, gowns, car, honeymoon.. so without at least 50k, you can forget about getting married.<br><br>It had been a guy dream to own a car and a house.. how is he going to finance all these and wanna get married by say 28. If given a choice how would you prioritise your objective?? A car, house or wife would come first??<br><br>For me, I also feel that 28 would be a nice time to get settled down for a guy.. but it might not be possible to be fully financially stable.. so are you going to ask your parents to fork out the money for your wedding.. something seems wrong here. Anyway, I am also still far from getting married.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey firewire:<br><br>Ya! I was away on Friday again for my seminar.  This time it was a sweminar on tax consequences on buying and selling assets and shares.  I am one lazy bastard like you. I just can't stand that 8 hour a day in the office thing.  It's real shit when your don't have your own personal time.  Imagine if you own a company like my bosses.  These guys don't come in till 11:00am and sometimes they leave at 2:00pm.  I am like saying shit!  what the f..k am I doing here long hours working for peanuts.<br><br>Ya man! sometimes these women think that, say for example, if we decide to spend more money on a new car than on a wedding, they will think that we take the car in priority over them.  Of course not!  We are just trying to balance everything out.  Just like Luf said, how can we manage wedding, house and car all at once.  These is how we do it: balance through compromise.  But for some women (again some, not all), they must have these diamond rings (ouch!!!! bigger hole in pocket!) and stuff like these to prove that you really love them.  I don't understand man.<br><br>Also, Luf, you know my HEART says this how I should priortize:<br><br>1. a Mercedes (ohh lala! Bad investment but who cares)<br>2. a house (Sure! Since I am not getting married so soon, what's the hurry for a house)<br>3. a wife  (nah! a man is never too old to get a woman)<br><br>HAHAHA!  Hope my future wife doens't read this man!<br><br>But my BRAIN says this how I should priortize:<br><br>1. a house<br>2. a wife<br>3. a Mercedes (sob! sob! I am crying so badly that I am running out of tears b'cos I won't be getting my dream car so soon).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... seems like most of u here agree that financial stablity shld come b4 marriage. But let me refer u to a true case of a male colleague.<br><br>He got married young, straight after U at ard 23 yrs old! No, it wasn't a shotgun marriage (at least that's wat he told me!), and neither was it totally due to true love or anything like that. Actually, he got married young so as to concentrate on his career. He did not want to be bogged down by any more BGR problems as he thinks that its a waste of time (and $ too. i suppose), so when he found a suitable mate whom he think he can be with during the rest of his life, he juz exchange the marriage vows!<br><br>After the kids came, the wife stayed at home and become a full-time hsewife, so he need not be worried abt the kids at all. He is now nearing 40, owns a car, a condo, and neber had any regrets abt the early marriage.<br><br>Not a bad idea, rite?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before we continue, let me quote that one in five marriges end up in divroce.<br><br>Ok, so what I'm getting at here is, its not a question of how old or how financially secure or where you can honeymoon or how soon you want children. The real question here is, can you make this lifetime commitment? Are you really sure you want to love cherish and honour your partner as long as you shall live? If u ask me, that's quite a big promise and its a wonder how the other 4 out of 5 can stick to it. If divorce was not an option, would people want to get married at all??<br><br>There is no ideal age for marriage, and to all the questions you posed Luf, its a matter of personal tastes/preferences...<br><br>Weddings are all so fairy-tale like, almost surreal,the galactic costs incurred can't be ignored, and there is no guranteed happy ending, which is why, for now, I have decided that I just won't do this marriage thing. To reiterate a friend of my mom, who's a lawyer "Girl, don't let anyone force you into getting married, take it from a lawyer who has seen one too many divorce cases". Bleak eh? sorry I'm so cynical, marriage is actually an institution worth upholding, its just that people have turned it into a mockery, it no longer holds its sacred meaning... two people totally accepting and loving each other, no strings attached. If marriage was a race, there will be no finish line, and if it was a school, you'll never stop learning.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MsSeuss,<br>I do agree that wedding is just the starting of a lifetime commitment to the other person in your life. No matter how much the material cost incurred might be in hosting a wedding, there is no guarantee that it will work out for you. Marriages in our society are rarely forced, or so we do know. Usually it is out of our own will. It is also the responsibility of the two people involved in ensuring that the marriage work out.<br><br>As for your concern on whether marriage is for you, only you can convince yourself if you can make it work out for you, and lastly don't rush into one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gosh, speaking abt marriage.  for me, marriage now spells financial worries. when we were young, fairy tales often ended with "and they live happy ever after".  the current updated singapore version would have to be "and they start joining the queue for their HDB flat".<br><br>pure love is now deemed not a sufficient enough ingredient for a happy lasting marriage.  after 2 people decided to get married, first thing to worry abt?  where to get the money for getting married.  the wedding celebrations, the place to stay, the ceremony, the gowns, photography, ...  heck, the govt even made u PAY to get registered for marriage!  fairy tale?  hah!  dreams r over when u pay the biils my friend!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>especially for chinese, even a simple ceremony would cost quite a sum.  the dowry, the bride price, the ang baos ..... quite a princely sum.  hopefully, i can opt out of having a wedding dinner and just have a simple tea ceremony.  immediately costs would be reduced by a minimum of S$20K.<br><br>marriageable age for guys?  definitely after 25, when their careers are more settled and their savings are ++  instead of - - .   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  for girls?  well, personally, i would opt to get married after 25 too.  again, its coz of the financial woes.  i'm seriously wondering when i can actually afford to get married! ;Ãž<br><br>guess i'm sounding pretty mercenary here.  ;Ãž  but i'm trying to be practical and realistic here.  my bro just got married and woah,  i can't believe the amt spent!<br><br>but hey, like Msseuss said, the critical part of getting married is long-term commitment.  both sides should really want to spend the rest of their lives with each other before embarking on this next step.  divorce is one painful option tat i'm sure the majority of us are not willing to take.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Loz,<br><br>your wedding sounds like fun. I'm dreading the chinese wedding baquet. Sometimes I wonder if marriage is about the bride and groom or their parents. Of course, I try to please them in whichever way I can. But I don't believe in ostentacious displays or inviting relatives you haven't talked to in 7 years. It's all a matter of face and obligations. And a huge unnecessary waste of money that could be better spent elsewhere. I'll love to have a simple, intimate wedding but I don't think my parents will like it.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 30-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm.... I would think the main aim of the wedding banquet is to make your wedding a joyous and happy occasion... and not for u to burn a big hole in ur pocket and to be counting the money from the Ang Paos to see if its enough to cover the dinner when you should be copulating in the lover's nest  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers<br><br>------------------<br>Why?
