Jealous right, that is because your bf is worrying about you, and i am glad that he can tahan so long...<br><br>do something for your current bf, shake this guy off, ask your bf out together with him and right in front of him, tell him off that you really only want to be friend with him, and you love this man now. if he is a man, then he should try to be your friend and at least got a friend in return... if not then i think he is not even worthy of your friendship too, more less in BGR.<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost.</div>

Ignoring him might be a good idea to forget him, it just takes time. In a broken relationship, time is the greatest healer. Treasure your current boyfriend and don't look back at the past. You might end up losing both if you are not careful.</div>
