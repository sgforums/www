            <div class='col-md body'>I think the main problem most Australians have with this case is that the sentence is mandatory. It's hard to understand why that would be the case if Singapore truly wants to stop drug trafficking. Nguyen helped the police and pleaded guilty, and risked the safety of his family in doing so. But he was killed anyway.<br><br>Why would any future defendants ever do this?<br><br>Killing this kid will do precisely nothing to curb the flow of drugs through Changi airport, but dealing with him and future traffickers might at least go some way to getting to source of this evil drug.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>extracted from ST forum.<br><br>Nguyen pushed drugs despite twin's addiction<br><br>AS AN American who has accepted my country's use of the death penalty to punish murderers, I hope to offer a relatively objective view of the controversy over Singapore's execution of Australian heroin trafficker Nguyen Tuong Van.<br><br>I find the mandatory death sentence for the non-violent crime of drug trafficking to be incredibly harsh. I therefore would expect Australia to plead for clemency, and I support its efforts in doing so. Yet, I do not think that disputing the death penalty should devolve into attacks on Singapore.<br><br>Some Australian clemency sentiments have morphed into unfair and witless attacks on Singapore: Official calls for trade bans; threats of long-term resentment; a union's talk of refusing to service Singapore Airlines planes at Australian airports; and even the insulting characterisation of Singapore as a 'rogue Chinese port city'.<br><br>These attacks on Singapore lack the perspective of Nguyen's culpability and forget that Singapore did not instigate the present controversy - rather, Singapore is reacting to a crime with good-faith application of its long-established laws.<br><br>Have some Australians forgotten that Nguyen carried out an activity whose only possible outcome would be to harm the people of Australia? The country is his adopted homeland, it is the place that welcomed and supported his family fleeing Vietnam.<br><br>What makes his crime even more egregious is that he knew, first-hand, the harm that heroin can inflict on a family because his twin brother Khoa was an addict - yet he sought out the trafficking job, knowing full well that he would facilitate the pain of drugs he experienced upon other families.<br><br>Compare Nguyen's intended harm to Australia with Singapore's law enforcement: Looking at it with emotional detachment, Singapore's mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking, if anything, helps Australia.<br><br>By deterring traffickers from going through Singapore, a major transit point between heroin-growing regions and Australia, drug suppliers would have a much more difficult time distributing their poisons.<br><br>Singapore did not start the controversy, Nguyen did. Singapore has had its death penalty on the books for the past few decades. The country is enforcing the death penalty on Nguyen just as it had for hundreds of other criminals. This is nothing new.<br><br>Yet only now are some Australians attacking Singapore at a fever pitch-when the law is being enforced against an Australian.<br><br>Warren K.

Never, did we proclaim that the population here is drug-free. But certainly it's much better than in countries where drug related problems are viewed with a closed eye.<br><br>Would be interesting to see what the layperson of Australia thinks of the death sentence for drug offences. Would also be interesting to know their feelings if someone in their family was involved in drugs. How would they handle such situation?</div>

I am highly revolted by this piece of crap which you posted.<br><br>Poking fun at the execution of a person is not a joke, regardless of the fact that Nguyen is a drug trafficker.
