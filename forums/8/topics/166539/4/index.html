What I am asking of you is to be a little bit more sensitive when it comes to the issue of death. Maybe to you the death of someone you don't know is something which can be laughed at. Well, I can tell you that it isn't going to be funny when it hits closer to home.<br><br>I am not crying for the Somalis (it's 'Somalis' by the way, not 'Somalians'), but I am by no means poking fun of them either.<br><br>Enough said.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Nguyen was executed cos that's the law. Don't say this execution lacks compassion. Rules are rules. The law was designed deliberately without compassion for drug traffickers. It was intentional.<br><br>Should u craft a law which show compassion for drug traffickers? How would u answer this question? It is Singapore Gov's stand since long ago not to, but instead to be extra firm. Capital punishment.<br><br>This, in my opinion is what makes Singapore what it is today.<br><br>Australia on the other hand is different. Some think the death penalty is outdated no matter what the crime is. And some think individuals are responsible adults free to excercise their own choices including on drugs.<br><br>This is why their society is more permissive towards drugs. And why many are angry on this Nguyen getting the death penalty. Of course, firstly he is just a drug trafficker, a rather tolerated crime. Secondly he is punished with the barbaric outdated death penalty. The punishment didn't fit the crime. They are outraged. Plus of course he is punished in a foreign land and his mother is very saddened on TV all the time.<br><br>What they seem to forget, is that different societies install different laws. Who are they to judge that Nguyen is getting an excessive punishment? Are they the ones who install such rules? It's another society altogether! Different society with different values. Who are they to say it's barbaric and unfitting the crime? Who the hell are they?!<br><br>You come to my house, u obey my house rules. I come to your house, I obey your house rules. It's a simple principle observed everywhere by everyone in this world. You don't come to my house and break my rules and then say I am barbaric.<br><br>To have sympathy is good. But misplaced sympathy is not. If you have sympathy for Nguyen or his mum, don't let it distort your brain. The law must take its course. If not, might as well conduct trials in TV studios, not courtrooms, and let the public decide through SMS votes. Whoever has the most sorry looking Mum will get the lightest sentence.</div>

He just pleaded guilty if I'm not wrong. And if you look at the Misuse of Drugs Act, it's mainly based on presumptions. So there appears to be a reversal of the burden of proof.

There is a lot of coverage in the Australian press about the American death row. Not a lot of it is supportive and some is quite critical.
