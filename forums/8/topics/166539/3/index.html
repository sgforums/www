            <div class='col-md body'>The following paragraph references "Jean Tan", who was the First Secretary of the Singapore embassy in Washington D.C. This<br><br>The Singapore government's response again confirms the fact that the<br>government, through  the GIC and the Myanmar Fund, was doing business<br>with legendary drug trafficker Lo Hsing Han of Burma. Indeed, the rush<br>in August to shut down the Myanmar Fund--only one aspect of a<br>complicated web of investments with Lo and Burma's<br>narco-dictatorship--is a clear indication that something is very wrong.<br>(As we noted in our article, Lo and his company Asia World are under<br>investigation by narcotics officials in several countries.)<br><br>Beyond this, Jean Tan's specific criticisms do not address the<br>substance of our article. Nowhere did we say that the GIC?s use of<br>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. as a custodian was "sinister or secret."  The<br>newsworthy point is that a major U.S. financial institution had<br>business ties to a known heroin dealer.<br><br>Furthermore, Tan's assertion that the GIC was merely a "passive<br>investor" is belied by the fund?s own documents, one of which says that<br>the GIC is a "core shareholder" and as such has a representative on the<br>investment committee of the fund. "The committee will determine whether<br>investment proposals are viable and whether they should be approved for<br>investment by the Fund" says the 1994 document.   (As manager of the<br>GIC since 1991, Eddie Taw Cheng Kong was the GIC representative on the<br>fund investment committee until very recently.  Taw was sentenced in<br>May to nine years in jail and a $2.4 million fine for accepting bribes<br>from companies whose shares were purchased by the GIC.)<br><br>Tan's statement on Dr. Chee Soon Juan's  refusal to set up a commission<br>is misleading.  Dr. Chee was not a member of Parliament and thus would<br>have been excluded from the commission. His colleagues in Parliament<br>were afraid of lawsuits and other repercussions. Dr. Chee had already<br>been the target of a government defamation law suit  and was forced to<br>sell his house and borrow heavily to avoid bankruptcy.  Amnesty<br>International says that Singapore's leaders are systematically<br>?resorting to defamation suits as a politically-motivated tactic to<br>silence critical views and curb opposition activity."<br><br>Chee still had the courage to speak out, but his questions (in a<br>letter to the Prime Minister and The Straits Times) remain unanswered<br>by the ruling elite: Is Lo Hsing Han allowed to move freely in and out<br>of Singapore, for example? Has the government investigated the<br>background of Lo's son Steven Law, who has been denied a U.S. visa on<br>suspicion of drug  trafficking? Will the government state clearly that<br>Burma?s junta is not helping or turning a blind eye to drugtrafficking?<br><br>Although the Myanmar Fund is now undergoing  liquidation,  these<br>investments represented only a small part of Singapore's total<br>investment in Burma. The US government has reported that more than half<br>of Singapore's $1 billion-plus investment in Burma is tied to Lo Hsing<br>Han and his family.<br><br>Dennis Bernstein and Leslie Kean (they are Americans, not Australians)</div>
