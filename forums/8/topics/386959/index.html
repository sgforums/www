And if we ask them to leave, it's as if we are the bad people chasing out customers.... again, they each order one pot of tea and stay very long.<br><br>And I really dislike when ah lians come, I mean if you can't afford it, don't both... right? 4 of them come in, order 1 drink and all 4 of them share.... I rather they go macs which is just nearby, they can get 4 cokes for 4 bucks!!! Wish all these people see what we see....</p>

              <p>mmm I have no qualms doing a lot of irritating things, no matter how small since it's part of the jobscope. I just don't get why some people have to be mean about it. Cheapskate never mind, but if I am serving you, why must you shout back? This kind I also kena before sia. Sometimes we just trying to do our job and not within our power to do anything, then they still not happy insist they are right... when they are wrong.</p>
              <p>I find ang mohs got 2 extremes: The extremely nice kind who I think show us that we Singaporeans are perhaps too conservative. Or extremely arrogant fucked up ones who think they are better than asians.</p>

Maybe you are poor, that is why despite the rich, these are goldmine, please respect them, they paid you ok.</p>
              <p>To tackle the rich to spent more is simple, just compare them against each other, they will spent more to float their richness, just like Mr Tan ordered Beer, and Mr Benny order Chivas, you go cho cho Mr Tan that Mr Benny ordered Chivas, so grand and stylish, later Mr Tan will order Martel Blue. And I make money liao....UNDERSTAND!!!</p>
