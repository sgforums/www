            <div class='col-md body'>Generally Christains are more frenly but that could be due to their religious need to reach out to all fellow non-believers. They try to spread God's teachings to as many strangers as they can. Sinners are those who have come or know about God but still refuse to accept Him into your heart. Those who accept will receive God's forgiveness.<br><br>I know I'm one sinner.
