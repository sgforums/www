              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">Disclaimer, I have nothing against foreign talents and I am never known to be xenophobic among my peers. I have been known to tell off locals or people who are against foreigners or other races. The reason why I had specifically indicated the race here is due to my personal experiences with them and it is more related to the love/ relationship rather than their work performances or contribution to my country. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><strong>First Encounter was in May 2012</strong>. I was buying coffee at this underpass in Raffles Place (OUB Centre) and this Indian approached and strike a chit chat. He was working at ING in Republic Plaza and he wanted to be friend with him. He was from Delhi (India) and he had been in Singapore for more than 4 years. He stayed at Pasir Panjang. He walked me to my office and insisted on me saving his number in my phone and give him a missed call so that he could keep my number. I did not hear from him until a few days later when he asked me out for dinner. Initially we went to Subway at Golden Shoe Market but the selection he wanted was not available so we went to VivoCity Subway. Be known that the selection of food and venue were decided by him and he had never even asked me what I wanted to eat. I told him we could eat anything but he insisted on eating Subway and Vivocity is near his house -.-". We ordered our food and chit chatted a while. He told me about himself, saying he was single and we chatted about his education and his travels and his working experiences in other countries. It was indeed impressive and eye opening for me because he was only 28 years then. Still, I found it uneasy in his presence because he was constantly staring at me. We ended the night early because I had a meeting the next day. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">Subsequently we chat now and then as both of us were busy with our work. In July 2012, I asked him if he wanted to drink as I was pretty stressed out at work. He agreed and we met at the coffee shop in Clementi. He ordered 3 bottles of beers, two for him and one for me. We chatted about his family in India and how he would be going back to India for Diwali. Truth be told, I have always been fascinated about the culture of India. Hence our conversation ran through the night. Then he brought up the topic, asking me if I was keen to get hitched with a foreigner. I told him I had no intention to get hitched. He brought up his proposal. He mentioned he had been in Singapore for awhile and wanted to apply for Permanent Resident (PR) and he wanted to increase his application to be approved by marrying a local girl. I had told him that was too unfair and preposterous. He had disagreed and said that it was a win0 win situation as during the marriage, he would take care of the girl for a year and the girl could enjoy his money as he earns SGD$14000 per month. I was not impressed. I had told him that most of the girls married because of love, not of money. In addition, what would happen to the girl after a year? He answered with a stoic face that they would divorce with the terms that the girl could not get anything out of him. I was disgusted and told him to change the topic. We chatted awhile, and he was back to his staring at me and this time, his stare was on my hem line. Eventually we went back to our respective homes. Over the next few weeks, he had asked me out to Clark Quay which I had rejected him as I was busy with stuff. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">Then in September 2012, we had decided to meet up for a late night drink at Holland Village. It was packed everywhere. Hence we had decided to bring the drinks to his house and we chatted at the balcony. Throughout the chilling and chatting on the balcony, both of us were at ease. I guess I had drunk a lot and we were intimate. Subsequently, he had booked a cab and told me to leave the house. I was shocked. I guess I was still in a daze over this non- chivalry that I had tried to contact his two mobile numbers over the next few days and he would not reply or answer my calls or messages. Eventually after approximately 1 week later, he told me he was busy with work. And by then, I did not want to have anything more to do with him. I did not lose my heart to him but I was disappointed over this display of realism from a foreigner who obviously just want to get laid and decided to discard the local girl after not being able to convince her to his grand plan. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">P/s: The next time I happened to see him was in June 2013 at Clark Quay. He saw me in the Pump Room with my friend and as usual when he walked past, he stopped and stared at me.. He had kept walking and then I had turned my head away. When I was on the dance floor a few minutes later, I saw him walking to the dance floor and he was staring at me at the edge of the dance floor. I gave him a glare and he went away. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">=================================================================</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><strong>Second encounter was in January 2013. </strong>I had known VV through the social chatting application Skout. Initially I did not pay much heed to him but he was indeed witty and cheesy at the same time. Gradually I had chatted with him more often and on 22 March 2013, I had asked him out for supper. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">Yes, I am unable to let go of what we had, let go of the memories... I am unable to forget him. The past 9 months were indeed wondrous. I had felt his love for me consistently over this period. Over this period, He had been telling me how his wife lied to him that she was raped by the policemen in India and had to abort the baby and made him guilty that he had to marry her at a young age at 24 and only 4 years later he realized she had lied. Since then he had focused his love of his son. He said he had been torn over his son and me, and that there was no more love for his wife and it would be easier for him to make the decision if it is just between me and his wife. I understand his predicament. I really do. However my love for him has grown to the extent it was unbearable for me to see him going back to his wife every night. Because of his work in an UK Investment Bank , he had many conference calls and meetings and gradually our Meetups had reduced. It had become more unbearable. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">The final call was when I realized he had lied to me and I had called his wife on 20 December 2013. He had chosen to be with his family. He told me he regretted me and he should not have cheated on his wife. And frankly speaking, even if you guys said I am in denial, how can you consistently show love and attention to a person over 9 months and after sleeping with the person if just sex is what you want? I don't think anyone will be that consistent. I do believe he loves me. However the love is not strong, as compared to his love for his son. And I do understand why his wife put him under duress, corner him and he had to swear that he will strike me off his life and focus on his family. What I do not like is that she had pretended to be understanding and said as a woman, she understood the pain I had gone through and told me to be strong and move on yet the moment she ended the call, she called Vineet that I was hassling her. In addition, in the past I had tried to meet her by asking her to give me yoga lesson. She told me she would prefer a group session and in a condominium, not in HDB area. It is like she is so upscale and yet she only lives in the HDB area. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">VV had always sang praises of Singapore and how he would like to have his son grow up here and he had applied for Permanent Resident (PR) - pending for approval, and buy private housings just as what his friends did, enjoying the perks which Singapore is giving him. He would at times tell me about the not-so-good stuff of India and that he would prefer to stay in Singapore. Of course, he would also add to that it is also because I am here. To tell the truth, there are times which I would ask myself I should keep quiet and not call his wife and just enjoy the process of loving him and him loving me, that I had acted on impulse by calling his wife because I had missed him a lot. Yet I feel that with the increasing love I have for him, it is difficult to be just contented being the third party. I want more. I had even told him before that I am willing to take care of his son Suryansh. However his focus is on his son and he had even said if his wife decided to go back to India, he will follow suit just to have his son back. So what is the love of me, what about us? </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">Ever since he had made the oath, he did not answer to my emails, messages or calls. He had told his friend about me and he had pretended not to know me when I texted him. Both his friend and wife had blocked me on whatsapp. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><br></span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">Are local girls the passports to the foreigners getting their PRs? Why are words given out so easily? Where are the sincerity and truthfulness? As much I am intrigued by Indian Culture, I am amazed by their 'roti- prata' of handling people and saying things... </span></p>

              The next time I happened to see him was in June 2013 at Clark Quay.
              He saw me in the Pump Room with my friend and as usual when he
              walked past, he stopped and stared at me.. He had kept walking and
              then I had turned my head away. When I was on the dance floor a few
              minutes later, I saw him walking to the dance floor and he was
              staring at me at the edge of the dance floor. I gave him a glare
              and he went away. </span></p>

              through the social chatting application Skout. Initially I did not
              pay much heed to him but he was indeed witty and cheesy at the same
              time. Gradually I had chatted with him more often and on 22 March
              2013, I had asked him out for supper. </span></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">Yes,
              I am unable to let go of what we had, let go of the memories... I
              am unable to forget him. The past 9 months were indeed wondrous. I
              had felt his love for me consistently over this period. Over this
              period, He had been telling me how his wife lied to him that she
              was raped by the policemen in India and had to abort the baby and
              made him guilty that he had to marry her at a young age at 24 and
              only 4 years later he realized she had lied. Since then he had
              focused his love of his son. He said he had been torn over his son
              and me, and that there was no more love for his wife and it would
              be easier for him to make the decision if it is just between me and
              his wife. I understand his predicament. I really do. However my
              love for him has grown to the extent it was unbearable for me to
              see him going back to his wife every night. Because of his work in
              an UK Investment Bank , he had many conference calls and meetings
              and gradually our Meetups had reduced. It had become more
              unbearable. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;"><br> </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; color: #800080;">The
              final call was when I realized he had lied to me and I had
              called his wife on 20 December 2013. He had chosen to be with his
              family. He told me he regretted me and he should not have cheated
              on his wife. And frankly speaking, even if you guys said I am in
              denial, how can you consistently show love and attention to a
              person over 9 months and after sleeping with the person if just sex
              is what you want? I don't think anyone will be that
              consistent. I do believe he loves me. However the love is not
              strong, as compared to his love for his son. And I do understand
              why his wife put him under duress, corner him and he had
              to swear that he will strike me off his life and focus on his
              family. What I do not like is that she had pretended to be
              understanding and said as a woman, she understood the pain I had
              gone through and told me to be strong and move on yet the moment
              she ended the call, she called Vineet that I was hassling her.
              In addition, in the past I had tried to meet her by asking her to
              give me yoga lesson. She told me she would prefer a group session
              and in a condominium, not in HDB area. It is like she is so upscale
              and yet she only lives in the HDB area. </span></p>

              had always sang praises of Singapore and how he would like to have
              his son grow up here and he had applied for Permanent Resident (PR)
              - pending for approval, and buy private housings just as what his
              friends did, enjoying the perks which Singapore is giving him. He
              would at times tell me about the not-so-good stuff of India and
              that he would prefer to stay in Singapore. Of course, he would also
              add to that it is also because I am here. To tell the truth, there
              are times which I would ask myself I should keep quiet and not call
              his wife and just enjoy the process of loving him and him loving
              me, that I had acted on impulse by calling his wife because I had
              missed him a lot. Yet I feel that with the increasing love I have
              for him, it is difficult to be just contented being the third
              party. I want more. I had even told him before that I am willing to
              take care of his son Suryansh. However his focus is on his son and
              he had even said if his wife decided to go back to India, he will
              follow suit just to have his son back. So what is the love of me,
              what about us? </span></p>

              since he had made the oath, he did not answer to my emails,
              messages or calls. He had told his friend about me and he had
              pretended not to know me when I texted him. Both his friend and
              wife had blocked me on whatsapp. </span></p>

              local girls the passports to the foreigners getting their PRs? Why
              are words given out so easily? Where are the sincerity and
              truthfulness? As much I am intrigued by Indian Culture, I am amazed
              by their 'roti- prata' of handling people and saying
              things... </span></p>

              I sympathise with your plight.
              
              However I will also have to say that you have been used, not for the PR status though. If he is indeed earning 14k a mth there is no need for it.
              
              I guess its natural to be attracted to "successful" people... especially the young and affluent. However at the end of the day it boils down to morals &amp; discipline. And sadly being well groomed or "polished" is not a good indicator. We are afterall human. Only time &amp; patience will tell.
