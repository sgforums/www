            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporean says:<br>"I'm sorry"<br>Or confession of a timeshare salesman in Soc.culture.society. Aug 8, 2004<br><br>Posted by George<br>I have been in this industry for many years working for two of the most well known companies along Orchard Road. I deeply regret and feel a sense of remorse for all those people who have bought these memberships through me.<br><br>I have realised that what i have sold on behalf of the company is not what buyers actually want but how we can make money out of the poor unsuspecting clients who are lured to the company.<br><br>This is why :<br><br>a.. You are lured to visit the presentation with a promise of a free gift either by a telephone call or picked up from the streets responding to a street survey.<br><br>b.. You are told that the presentation will last you only 60 - 90 mins but end up sitting for a few hours until you are drained.<br><br>The programme takes the following sequence - An introduction by the consultant and welcome to the round table. Offer of drinks, tidbits. Introduction to the Manager. Get to Know You session<br><br>(A survey sheet - to size up your finances, holiday habits and motivations which will be used against you later towards the end of the presentation); the pencil pitch presentation showing how the membership works and how you can go for an exchange holiday.<br><br>And before you are taken on a walk to watch a gallery and TV/Video presentation you are conditioned with the list price of the membership which will awe you. This will be subjected to a bargaining session at the end so that clients feel that they got a good bargain.<br><br>And when you get back to the table after all the presentation that's where the real battle starts. The battle is between your greedy and impulsive nature versus the price quoted for the membership!<br><br>Once you succumb you are taken to the contracts officer who will explain about the membership and advice you on the terms and conditions.<br><br>By the time you sign on the dotted line you have been drained of your energy and alertness and don't read the fine lines of the contract.<br><br>It is only when you get out of the company or get home that the reality of the situation sinks in. Remorse. And you review what you have been told<br><br>c.. Timeshare membership (depending on what size units u take up - Studio, 1-Bed; 2-Bed units) will cost you from S$10K - S$30K or more and that you can pay by interest free instalments. (the prices are bargainable and not fixed).<br><br>d.. You were shown beautiful pictures of the best hotels and resorts that you can go to with your family which mask the cost to you over the years.<br><br>e.. If you are tired of going to the same resort (which your membership entitles you to) you can exchange for another by joining a holiday exchange company which charges you $150 per year in membership. You have to fork out another $200 to $400 for a week of exchange.<br><br>f.. You have to pay S$300+-S$500+ for Maintenance Fees for your timeshare membership (after paying for your membership of S$10K - S$30K) every year for the rest of your life or the term of your membership.<br><br>This is so that, you are told, that proper maintenance can done to ensure that your resort (which you do not own) is well taken care of. (You are not told that the Maintenance Fees are subjected to inflationary pressures and may go up gradually but never down).<br><br>g.. The membership can be sold and you belief that it could be a hedge against inflation but in reality it is extremely difficult to resell your membership once bought at any given price (i have been waiting to sell my timeshare membership since 1990).<br><br>The companies i worked for even cheated me of my commissions. Life as a timeshare salesman is a dog's life. You spent long hours from mid-afternoon to late in the night waiting and entertaining UPs (unit potential) in small round tables in the DECK (room where presentations are made).<br><br>You are bullied, threatened with dismissal, taken advantage of, fined for the silliest of reasons, mocked at for being a weakling Singaporean (when u report sick and come with an MC - this by ANGMOHs who think they are naturally superior than us).<br><br>There is also a fine system within the company where the poor timeshare consultant is<br>penalised for trivial reasons and one wonders where all the money collected in fines go to.<br>Soc.culture.Singapore<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>problem is... nobody really research into timeshare until they face the situation where they are actually asked to join... i think thats why timeshare scams is still surviving these days... lucky some lamers like me are too stubborn to join  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v517/kei_ko/chrismas_tree.gif"> <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v517/kei_ko/catdance2.gif"> <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v517/kei_ko/chrismas_box.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You've Won?<br>Winning - as players and punters alike in the World Cup know too well - is not easy. You need knowledge, talent, skills, hard work and lots more. Or luck.<br><br>Why, if you can answer 15 questions correctly on a TV show, you stand to win a million dollars. So far, no Singaporean has been knowledgeable or lucky enough.<br><br>If you are desperate to win something, however, it has now become very easy. Just go down to Orchard Road, or some other crowded place, and wait to be approached by a "surveyor" who will ask you five very simple questions: Are you a Singaporean? What is your name? Address? Contact? Favourite travel destination?<br><br>Then, viola! A few days later, you will receive a telephone call informing you that you have "won" a holiday for two at some fancy resort. Or, you may be given a "scratch and win" card and you can bet a million dollars that you will win that dream holiday, instantly!<br><br>You may not even have to take part in any so-called surveys. Out of the blue, someone might just call to say you've been lucky.<br><br>There's a catch, of course.<br><br>You will have to sit through a 90-minute sales presentation during which you might be influenced to buy a $26,000 resort time-share programme that you later realise is not worth a quarter that money.<br><br>Of course, you will be assured that you need not buy anything. Just sit through the 90 minutes to claim your prize which, you will then realise, is a dud. Sorry, there is no holiday resort waiting for you. You have just lost 90 minutes of your time.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Not cheated?<br><br>You feel cheated. But are you?<br><br>Apparently not. People who are cheated can make police reports and have the cheats arrested and thrown into jail. Those who fall for these fake "wins" can only walk away feeling foolish. Companies engaged in such practices have been operating for years already, apparently without running foul of the law.<br><br>They are not the only companies that use falsehood and deception lure potential customers.<br><br>These past few days, my home has been visited several times by people offering to install a "free" home protection system. They tell the same story: Recently, there was a break-in in the neighbourhood. The equipment is free. It will activate an alarm in the event of break-ins and fires.<br><br>Free? Yes. Absolutely free. Shall we install it right away?<br><br>These people appear so altruistic that, the first time they came by, my sister thought they were offering a free service provided by the Housing and Development Board. In fact, the company's logo resembles the HDB's.<br><br>What they did not tell my sister was that, once the equipment has been installed, we would have to pay a monthly fee of $36. That's $432 per year, $4,320 in 10 years!<br><br>The people had not technically lied. But they had concealed vital information in order to try and sell a product and a service. In essence, this is the same as lying.<br><br>Then, there are the multi-level marketing companies. They invite people to attend "health seminars" where about 90 percent of the time is spent talking about wealth - how to earn tremendous amounts of money by recruiting friends and relatives to sell health supplements.<br><br>In these presentations, people are told how EASY it is to be earning more than $10,000 per month within six months. The reality is quite different. Few earn anything close to that. The majority manage, at most, a few hundred dollars per month.<br><br>What do we make of people who paint a scenario that is theoretically possible but never happens in practice? Are they lying? Cheating? Breaking the law?<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Magic stones!<br><br>Is it a crime to tell a person that he has won a prize when there is actually no element of winning involved? To send out fake cheques supposedly worth tens of thousands of dollars?<br><br>In essence, these acts are no different from selling "magic stones" with claimed supernatural powers. But while the people who sell magic stones risk getting thrown in jail, those who adopt more sophisticated forms of deception operate freely and openly.<br><br>On the one hand, we say let the buyer beware. Let those who pay $26,000 for time-share resorts think carefully before they sign the dotted line. Yes. Let consumers learn - the hard way - that nothing is for free.<br><br>On the other hand, why should the law treat one group of tricksters differently from another? If the law decides that it is criminal to deceive others, then the method of deception should not matter.<br><br>It should not matter whether a person says: "This magic stone will bring you good fortune" or "Congratulations! You've won a luxurious weekend vacation." The intention is the same - to deceive.<br><br>A lie is a lie. A cheat is a cheat.<br><br>Published in TODAY, 25 June 2002<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Timeshare Scam!! Anyone of you in it too?<br><br>Hi guys, thought I ask around every possible places I can come across. Anyway what happened is summarized in the story below. What I really want now is to END this sh*t once and for all. Wondering if anyone of you is in this same sh*t as me?<br><br>Here it is....<br><br>MY TIMESHARE EXPERIENCE WITH ERI (THE SCAM)<br><br>It was a fine day that my phone rang out of no reason from a caller I don't even know, " Hello Sir, firstly I want to congratulate you for being a lucky winner of 7 rolls or film and a pair of exclusive watch, but you have to come down personally to collect it over at our office at Orchard, but you have to sit down and listen to us for about an hour." I asked how did you managed to get my number? The caller claim that under the Mobile operators in Singapore, that they did some survey and got my number, I was like" What?? You mean M1, Starhub and Singtel can give number out like that? Anyway then I thought why not going down listen to some presentation wouldn't hurt and further more I have free gifts.<br><br>So I went down with my girlfriend, went to the reception, check my name, and a friendly lady came out and greet us, talk to us in a very professional ways, in no time she was like a friend to us! She told us to enter the room but reminded us to switch off our phones. Sited down she introduce someone to us, I think it was her boss. Anyway tidbits and drinks were served to us, making us feel comfortable. So there she go, sharing with us all the holidays resort that they deals with, it was easily a 4 or 5 hours session that we had to sit through. Her boss joined us and talked to us too. Anyway they put it in a way that was so good. They were very persuasive. I wanted to leave but they kept holding us back. Promised us that this thing can even be an investment that it will NOT depreciate in value that I could sell it away when I wanted and make monies from it. It was a long day, we were very tired, we thought okay, we might be interested if the price is good. But it was $19,000!! We were shocked!! Then they told us payment can be very affordable, that they could work out an installment plan for us that we can easily afford!! But They we were have to put a deposit $3000, But we said we could not come out that much, but the lady said, let me check with my boss, she went away for a while and returned and said, you guys are very lucky!! For you we can take just $1000 as deposit!! I told them I needed time to consider this. But they kept holding us back and said, its only for today that we can offer you this, not even tomorrow! Tomorrow will be a different price and I can tell you it would be higher!! After being in the office for a long 5 hours or so, our minds was like Okay. Since that we signed,13th of April 2002. That was the time I know things were all wrong.<br><br>How stupid was my then girlfriend and myself to actually sign on the dotted line and that stupid bell rang!! Gosh I must have been so stupid then!!<br><br>Anyway we realized this is nothing but a scam, we called them up and wanted to cancel the so called membership, but they said we can't as stated in the contract!! I was like what!?? I can't?? Is there such a clause in the contract!?? We were not even aware of that! When we bought that thing, we thought we could sell it off!! That was what we were told!! But on the phone, he said only when you paid up in FULL. I was so pissed off!! I even told them we were willing to for-go all that we had paid!! But he said, you must understand, what you are paying was only 20% of the whole ownership, we had to source out the other 80% for you from investors. If you were to give up! what happen to the 80% upfront paid for you!??Anyway lastly he said that its in BLACK &amp; WHITE as signed by us in the contract. Sigh....Anyway we didn't want to let this be a burden to us, so we actually lower the installment from $300 a month to $150 a month. We knew it was going no where but we were so helpless. So we continued to pay the $150 a month till somewhere we decided that was it!! We do not want to carry on anymore, especially after reading so many bad publicity towards this timeshare scam. Enough is enough. we are not going to let our hard earned money be wasted into something that we don't even use! Or I put it CAN'T even use. So we defaulted the payments from 03rd July 2002 onwards.<br><br>On the15th August 2003, we received a letter from ERI stated that if we do not make the payments within 7 days, they would pass this case to their legal department and we would be deal with in accordance with the contractual terms. We choose to ignored.<br><br>On the 28th September 2004, we received another letter from ERI stating that " Please be informed that you have been in arrears of $16,200 being the total outstanding amount due for the purchase of the said agreement." And that if we do not pay in FULL or PARTIAL payment from us, they would not hesitate to instruct their Legal Department to institute the legal proceeding against us to recover the monies due to them.<br><br>I really want to put an END to all these nightmare, I can choose it ignore it once again, but I know that someday it will still be resurface. Thus I am desperately seeking help to end this nightmare, furthermore I am no longer with my partner whom I signed this agreement with.<br><br>And I heard that CASE cannot do much regarding this issue although there had been countless complaints against Timeshare companies.<br><br>Please do help me and end this once and for all.<br><br>Thank You.<br>Steven</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup. same situation happened to me about 4 to 5 years back when I and my wife walking along orchard road, in front of Taka, and a young fresh grad came and approach me, asked me to strike a ticket, after doing do, he was so happy that, I won the first prize from that lucky draw ticket. He said I brought him luck, and he will earn S$100 dollar for that as commision, and I'm the first who strike that for the past one week.?!<br><br>ok. As usual, he asked us to go to the office to collect the 1st prize, Free 2 way air tickets to somewhere (forgot already) for 2 person. I said I don't want that, and no money for the oversea expenses, then the young boy keep begging me, just help him out, go collect the gift then only he can claim the S$100 bucks commision, no obligation just listen the talk for 40min, and hints me, insists to get out and claim the gift. Then my wife was ok with me, just to help the boy out for the S$100 bucks commision.<br><br>Once enter the reception area, another lady approached us, show us a short tour along the "hall of frame" about all the resorts around the world! And then asked us, was the boy telling us anything about the talk? did he tell us to left after 40min talk? do we aware of any time-sharing thing? then we answered nope. Wow,.. the lady every happy and her story starts...<br><br>After almost 2 hours talk... really time pass very quick.. a loud bell rang (someone proudly announce Mr. so and so are the no# join for that day,..all clap hands),... me and my wife like sudden wake-up, it has been almost 2 hours sitting down there,.. looking at her drafts, financial plan, which destination to go,.. and finally, we said no money for the moment.. from S$500 down to not even S$100 a month :p<br><br>The lady face turned 180 degree, voice rise, body language out... then she go and bring a senior to see us.

            <div class='col-md body'>yup. same situation happened to me about 4 to 5 years back when I and my wife walking along orchard road, in front of Taka, and a young fresh grad came and approach me, asked me to strike a ticket, after doing do, he was so happy that, I won the first prize from that lucky draw ticket. He said I brought him luck, and he will earn S$100 dollar for that as commision, and I'm the first who strike that for the past one week.?!<br><br>ok. As usual, he asked us to go to the office to collect the 1st prize, Free 2 way air tickets to somewhere (forgot already) for 2 person. I said I don't want that, and no money for the oversea expenses, then the young boy keep begging me, just help him out, go collect the gift then only he can claim the S$100 bucks commision, no obligation just listen the talk for 40min, and hints me, insists to get out and claim the gift. Then my wife was ok with me, just to help the boy out for the S$100 bucks commision.<br><br>Once enter the reception area, another lady approached us, show us a short tour along the "hall of frame" about all the resorts around the world! And then asked us, was the boy telling us anything about the talk? did he tell us to left after 40min talk? do we aware of any time-sharing thing? then we answered nope. Wow,.. the lady every happy and her story starts...<br><br>After almost 2 hours talk... really time pass very quick.. a loud bell rang (someone proudly announce Mr. so and so are the no# join for that day,..all clap hands),... me and my wife like sudden wake-up, it has been almost 2 hours sitting down there,.. looking at her drafts, financial plan, which destination to go,.. and finally, we said no money for the moment.. from S$500 down to not even S$100 a month :p<br><br>The lady face turned 180 degree, voice rise, body language out... then she go and bring a senior to see us. Very straight forward, the manager asked us, how much is our affordable installment, he can work out anything as long as we say yes. Luckily, we said, sorry...not interested anymore.

            <div class='col-md body'>My mum and dad also got conned in 1999. They refused to pay on the spot but they did sign the contract after 4 solid hours of torture lectures and presentations.<br><br>After reading the fine print and considering things like ' are we EVEN going to Costa Rica or Jamaica for a vacation anytime soon???' they decided not to join.<br><br>The company sent letters from their so called leagal department threatening to sue. My dad contacted his lawyer and counter sued twice the amount for selling under duress.<br><br>After a few more threatening letters from their legal department till 2001, it seemed that my parents' 'debt' was sold off to another time share company! And they continued to chase for payment. It ended late 2002 after we simply ignored all their letters (on advise of my dad's lawyer) and ended finally after my dad's lawyer proceeded to sue the timeshare firm for harrasment.<br><br>Never heard from them again since.<br><br>Best of luck, dont pay and counter sue them! Their letter are just that.....letters from legal department.....it doesnt mean that they are right and you are wrong.<br><br>My dad's lawyer said that they either cannot afford legal counsel OR more likely, NO REGISTERED LICENSED LAW FIRM wants to represent them for fear of being censured or disciplined by the Law Society.<br><br>Nowadays there IS a law that allows a 'cooling off' period for people who still get coerced to sign on the dotted line and put in a deposit....this allows people a reasonable period of time to get their heads screwed back on properly and decide within a couple of weeks if they actually want to or NOT want to join the scheme</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I seriously doubt these people got our numbers from any lucky draw thingy, in which we had so-called "implicitly granted them permission to contact us to claim the prize which we had signed up for."<br><br>I for one, can be such a hermit and pessimist that I have not entered into ANY lucky draw or contest whatsoever in no less than 5 years. Basically too lazy to fill up any form since I never thought I would be lucky enough to win anything.<br>While I have nothing to do with CASE, suffice it to say in my line of work, I do come across numerous such complains of hard selling tactics that begins with the temptation of a free gift.<br><br>So one fine day about a year ago, I myself received a call from one so and so company (can't remember the name anymore), with the usual congratulatory speech and prize I've won and asking when I wanted to collect the prize. Knowing that it was a scam, and also knowing very well that I did not partake in ANY contest, never filled in ANY entry forms, I questioned the caller exactly which contest I took part to win the prize. He replied saying "remember those times you filled in those lucky draw entries blah blah blah", to which I bluntly replied I never did. He was stumped and subsequently claimed that the company he is representing is contracted by the lucky draw contest organiser to contact the winners and that he does not know the exact details.<br><br>By making us feel that we ourselves actually did actively do something (ie. fill in those contest forms) to earn the prize, and by leading us on to deceive ourselves into thinking that we are somehow the ONLY lucky, special, one and only in the universe to have won this once-in-a-lifetime exclusive only-made-for-special-ME prize, we are no longer simply tempted to claim it. In fact, we feel obligated and even a certain pride in claiming the prize that only 'I' could have won.<br><br>To Siron, I can only say that you have fallen once for their mind tricks and their tactic of exploiting human frailties of temptation, greed and inferiority, and even a natural desire to please and not to disappoint the 'helpful salesperson who spent so many hours painstakingly explaining his product to you' The least you can do is help him out and buy his product right? WRONG. It is such natural human reaction to reciprocate that these hardsellers are specifically exploiting.<br><br>Now this company is targeting another one of our human weaknesses, that of instilling fear and a sense of loss and uncertainty. By sending out these lawyer letters, these companies are now harping on your fears to make you 'willingly' fork out your hard earned money to them. Where they had once achieved 2 years ago by exploiting your desires, they are trying to do the same again with threat to induce the fear of reprisal.<br><br>Suddenly the nightmare that started 2 years ago is back to haunt you again. You do not know what will happen if you were really brought to court for breach of contract and you start to fear it affecting your job or even causing you to lose your job. All this because of what you did wrong by not fulfilling the terms of the contract which you never really agreed to willingly? WRONG! It is their tactic to do a wrong to you and yet turn around and make it look like they are the ones who were wronged. Don't fall for their psychological tricks again!<br><br>Do you think that the nightmare will end simply by paying up obediently? They will merely tempt you with what is rightly yours (ie.The benefit of not having to pay annual maintenance fees. Hell, you never had to pay maintenance fees if you did not sign up in the first place!), on the condition that you fork out another 12K?? How can one contemplate paying that astronomical sum of money for a right that is yours to begin with? Ask yourself what have you gained from 'selling off' that right in the first place, and then again ask yourself is it worth to 'buy it back' with yet another 12k??<br><br>The least you can do now is to stand up to them and show them you're not a mindless weakling. Why were there no legal action against you when they sent you the lawyer letter in 2003? Why wait another year before sending another lawyer letter in 2004? As far as you are concerned, you have not been formally sued in court. No matter how many letters you receive are only empty threats. For all you know, these lawyer letters are really to them, 'subscription reminders'.<br><br>Anyway take heart and good luck! What you lost cannot be recovered, but don't be victimised any further in both monetary and psychological terms. Finally I apologise for any harsh words that I may have said above, but really don't want to see more people fall prey to these necessary evils of capitalism that abuse psychological knowledge for unethical economic gain.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Get rich quick<br>MALCOLM LIM used to earn over $3,000 per month when he was a teenager, by selling health products to his friends through multi-level marketing (MLM). Now in his mid-20s, he has quit the business for good because, in his words, "I don't want to be a legal conman."<br><br>Malcolm (not his real name) is among the thousands of Singaporeans who had been lured to join these schemes in the hope of getting rich quick. He made - but also lost - lots of money. Now he wants to "expose MLM's dirty tactics."<br><br>Malcolm reckons there are about 10 big MLM companies here, plus another 50 to 80 smaller firms.<br><br>Because of the recession, many people have joined these schemes - from clerks and secretaries to doctors, bankers and stock brokers.<br><br>What, exactly, is MLM?<br><br>Also called Network Marketing, it is a system of selling products - usually health supplements or beauty care products - through friends and relatives.<br><br>The emphasis is on building a large network. If you get 10 people to join, and each of them get another 10, you will have 100 people selling the products under you.<br><br>If each of the 100 recruits another 10, you will have 1,000. They are your "downlines". The commissions you earn from their sales can be substantial.<br><br>MLM companies commonly claim that a person could EASILY be earning $10,000 per month within six months.<br><br>"That's in a perfect scenario," Malcolm says. "It never happens in the real world."<br><br>They further claim that the products are sold at reasonable prices because shop rentals, advertising and other high costs have been removed.<br><br>Malcolm reveals that the typical profit margin is at least 500 to 1000 percent. The bulk of the profits go to the MLM bosses. Only about a quarter is distributed as commissions.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Pyramid selling<br><br>MLM is similar to "pyramid selling", which is banned in Singapore. But most have been modified to operate within the law and the Singapore government is now reviewing the ban, to avoid penalising companies that are legitimate.<br><br>Malcolm argues that the government should impose stricter controls instead. "Even if the companies operate legally," he says, "they cannot control what their members do."<br><br>Malcolm joined his first MLM programme when he was at the Polytechnic. "The response was fantastic," he recalls. "Young people are not interested in health products, but when you tell them they can make money, they all join.<br><br>"In three months, I had more than 1,000 downlines. I was a money-making machine for them.<br><br>"But as I rose up the ranks, I began to discover things that I did not know before. For example, the 'consultant' who made the presentation.... his big house and big cars, they are all sponsored by the MLM boss. It's a false front, to give the impression that he is successful.<br><br>"Once, I was aiming to reach the manager level. They told me I needed 8,000 points. I was doing so well that I could achieve 80,000 points. But if I did that, the extra 72,000 points would go to the person above me.<br><br>"So I slowed down my activity. Then, just before the month was up, they said there was a computer error and actually I needed 20,000 points. They use dirty tactics like this to prevent you from moving up."<br><br>Then there is a monthly maintenance. "Every month, you have to buy $200 to $300 worth of products. If you are in a higher level, you may have to buy more than $1000 worth.<br><br>"You either keep recruiting new people, or you keep buying. Otherwise, they forfeit your commissions."<br><br>Malcolm left the company and joined another. After attending more than 10 presentations, he thought he picked the best. It turned out to be even worse.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Ran away with money<br><br>"They cooked up a story that one of the shareholders had run away with the money. So they withheld about $30,000 worth of commissions and bonuses from me."<br><br>Is he sure the story was cooked up? Perhaps someone did run away with the money?<br><br>"I had friends in secret societies," he reveals. "They managed to catch this guy and he admitted that he took some money. But not all of it. About $2 million was missing, but he took only $500,000. The other shareholders must have taken the rest.<br><br>"To succeed in this business, you need to have absolutely no conscience," Malcolm says. "Do you seriously think they sell health products on the concept of health? Everytime I tell my customers how good the product is, my conscience keeps telling me what an asshole I am.<br><br>"I decided to quit. When my children go to school, I don't want their friends to say, 'Wah... your father is a legal conman!"<br><br>Published version in TODAY<br>was edited and cut by about half<br><br></div>
