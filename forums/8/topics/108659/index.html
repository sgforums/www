            <div class='col-md body'>A few months back, I received a call from this company called Universal Privilege. The caller told me I won a free trip to somewhere in Thailand (presumably Phuket). She spoke like a machine gun rattling non stop...then told me if I can go to her company to collect the free trip ticket, I will get a free watch...but the condition is I need to sit through a 60 minute presentation...and she also added I will get unlimited film rolls...<br>I asked if this was a timeshare company and she replied nope...her company is just an advertising company that's helping a cruise company...<br><br>I told myself what have I got to lose, so I went down to this company in International Building. Then the receptionist asked me to fill my particulars...after that I waited for a while then this girl came out and invited me to enter their office room...there were alot of chairs &amp; tables which you find in swimming pools....<br><br>The girl looked so fake with her two color contact lens..anyway she looked very anorexic...machiam like skeleton...she proceeded to inform me I need to sit through for a 60 minute presentation...then she started to ask me questions like my spending &amp; travelling habits...she also asked me my hobbies and when I mentioned I attended church...she sounded so fake &amp; said she also attended that church before...it was like she was trying to find out more about me...<br><br>When I started to question her and asked her what's the relevance of asking so many questions, her boss suddenly walked towards her &amp; she introduced her boss to me...I asked her boss directly, "Is this a timeshare company?"  He said nope &amp; said the same advertising company crap. Deep down I knew it was a time share company...<br><br>Her boss looked at the form she was filling when she was asking me the questions &amp; signed...after that he left the table but was nearby her...she took out a piece of paper &amp; started to sell her company's plan to me but before she could even start, I interrupted her &amp; asked her where's the company's brochures...or marketing phamplets...she said there wasn't and she couldn't show it to me...<br><br>After that she said it was time for me to receive the free watch...so I went over to the counter &amp; got the free watch which was a crappy watch as I couldn't even wear it &amp; the watch strap could not be attached properly...<br><br>I left that place feeling I had wasted my evening &amp; to anyone who receive such time sharing phone calls, I would advise you to hang up &amp; don't entertain them at all.</div>
