            <div class='col-md body'>I was assigned the task of picking out prospective candidates for two IT engineers that my company was trying to hire.<br><br>The first was for a software engineer position, the second, for a system/network engineer.<br><br>Based on the response and applications, here are my thoughts<br><br>1) Locals prefer a non-programming/development IT job. Applications for the software engineers from Indian/Malaysian/Indonesians outdo local applications 4 to 1.<br><br>2) In the economic situation, foreigners continue to hope to obtain a work permit to work and stay in Singapore.<br><br>3) Given a choice of email and phone call, Indian national usually calls you on the phone. It gets irritating after a while.<br><br>4) China nationals follow up the interview by emailing a thank you note. I find this welcoming, and if done right, gives the interviewer a really good impression that the interviewee is sincere and interested.<br><br>5) Malaysians try very hard. Technical skills aside, they would impress you with their to-die-for attitude.<br><br>6) Nobody really reads the resumes. The interview merely skims through it and look for familiar words, then scroll down to the bottom to check what the expected salary is. If it isn't obvious that you are a fresh grad, put down your expected salary. It saves both your time and the interviewer's. If you were once a manager but are willing to take a 50% pay cut just to get the job, state it or else the company will skip over your application thinking that you are too good for them.<br><br>7) Out of more than a hundred resumes, I read 3 completely. 2 were from likely candidates. The other was a PDF file from an applicant who decorated his application with orange border and colored logos from the certifications he got. He wasn't shortlisted because his expected salary does not align with what we can pay. (See 6)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Too many MCSE/MCSD/CCNA already. Personally I don't bother. But it might just be me only.<br><br>9) A first year PR pays 5% CPF. A local pays 32%, 12% comes from the company. A local has to take time off for around 2 weeks each year for reservist. Intuitively, the local must convince the company why they should hire him in favour of the PR. His adaptability to local culture, eloquence, and ability to relate to co-workers and clients is a big plus.<br><br>10) Younger local applicants generally still hopes to land a well paying job with minimal stress. The older folks are coming to terms with the employment problem. Many had spent their days between jobs studying for certifications.<br><br>11) Locals takes a longer time to send resumes. The first batch of resumes are usually from foreigners. The locals begin to send in resumes after 2 days and don't stop until the 4th or 5th day. For companies who read resumes as and when they arrive in the mail box, this puts the locals at a severe disadvantage.<br><br>12) Tailor your resume to what you think the company is searching for. Don't tell the company about your 10 years experience in Linux if the company is looking for a Windows 2000 engineer.<br><br>That's all for now. Hope it helps the job seekers. =)</div>
