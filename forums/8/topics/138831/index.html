Though i hardly think Hitler fits the bill, the atrocities attributed to him will only dawn on these youngsters when they come of age. I seriously doubt if they have read any autobiography on him or the henious crimes against humanity which he committed (of course he had his henchmen to take part blame in this madness)<br><br>One thing i do agree was that Hitler was charismatic, an opportunitist, a bold and very convincing speaker coupled with a strategical brilliance despite his lack of military qualifications.<br><br>Few will realise that the german concept of Blitzkrieg was brought forward by generals like erwin rommel, albert kessering and erich von manstein but was scoffed by various chief of staffs including alfred jodl and wilhelm keitel. Only Hitler had the vision to recognise such concepts as the new winning strategy and bring forth new doctrines and combat tactics based on such theories. Speed, efficiency and aggressiveness became the new trademarks of a modern german war machine.<br><br>Only the madness within reflected his sociopathic belligerence against the jews, gypsies and others he considered sub-human and offensive to a reich which he considered the new world order; a decendent of the aryan race he believed was the destiny of the german people.<br><br>Misguided yes, but brilliant as well. Kids must know what to look up to and not mistakenly take the whole pie and eat it.<br><br>Or maybe these kids simply lack one testicle?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what is wrong with idolising hitler.. or even satan.. its still idolise.. can you define what is right and what is wrong? right and wrong is indefinite. it is up to you to choose what is right and what is wrong.. in the first place.. is there right and wrong? right and wrong has been derived by humans.. and humans are not perfect. how do you know the god that the christians speak of are the righteous god. how do you even know there is a god. there are so many questions that cannot be answered.. in this is possibly another one of them. i dont think we can stop the people from idolising who they idolise</div>
