            <div class='col-md body'>Heard this dance track over WKRZ913 some time back but haven't been able to find out the title and artiste.... if anyone knows could you please tell me?  The chorus, sung by a female vocalist, goes something like....<br><br>"I love you till the sun falls down... I love you till I can't feel anything, anything at all... And even if you're not around... I love you till the sun falls down."</div>
