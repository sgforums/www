              <p>I mentioned about creating a new account just to post that is becoz, there are many clone accounts out there, which are just created for the sake of posting one or two posts. I am gratified that this is not the case here.</p>

              <p>I believe that Jason had removed the defamation threads and all he did is to alert the users of the forums that actions of the said organisation/coy had taken some action against the user.</p>
              <p>By reposting and quoting actual news clip about the origins of the events does not account to defamation as it falls under the section of fair comments and the links are the proofs such events had happened and reported. That is comments made based on facts and that do not account as defamation.</p>
              <p>Anyway, there are forums apart from here that is invaded by that user and posting the same comments. I wonder if the other forums had the same letter or maybe sgf is sue becos it is popular?</p>
