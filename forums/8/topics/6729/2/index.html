            <div class='col-md body'>Enigma<br><br>A scenerio. An imaginary online book store (let's call it EBook) was developed with ASP and Site Server. 1 year after EBook go live, the owner realized that NT has been crashing on him, and Site Server has become inadequete to serve his customer.<br><br>He now face a big problem. NT was never meant to take the amount of load and hits that his website is currently generating. He can't port his website over to a cluster of UNIX machine and have it up and running. ASP needs Site Server. Site Server needs NT. He is stuck.<br><br>Dependence on high level ecommerce enabling technologies is a common move now because many companies want their business 'live' on the net fast. 4GL tools like this faces a common problem of scalability. Then of course , the 'carpet' issue. It is the responsibility of the developer to explain this issues to his client. By going with the flow and developing systems that runs only in the near future, it puts the business at risk.<br><br>Its scary.. because this is the direction our ecommerce sector is heading.<br><br>Illegal Operation agrees that it will be silly to reinvent the wheel by creating a technology that is already in place. Developers should strike a balance between inhouse development and the use of 3rd party enabling software.<br><br>Illegal Operation was over emotional when he mentioned that :<br><br>"Until Singapore's dot.coms are really able to come up with _REAL_ ecommerce enabling technologies, ecommerce is doomed to fail here."<br><br>What it should have been is that ecommerce is doomed to fail here if developers are overdependent on existing high level Ecommerce enabling technologies. Just one factor. Enigma has mentioned the other factors which are as true too.<br><br>Just the technical aspect... and an idealistic view. The real fact is that developers do not care. Most just want to churn out the application fast enough to be the first in the market. This is because being the first makes you the most glamourous. The most glamourous usually gets the most funding by the venture capitalists and angel investors. The most glamourous also gets to IPO the fastest. Stock prices shoots up the sky, developers sells their stakes in the company and retires.<br><br>Scalability and reliability is no longer an issue to developers anymore. We could be heading this way.<br></div>
