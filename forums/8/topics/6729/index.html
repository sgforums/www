            <div class='col-md body'>To go back to the basics, the basis of economics is such that to have a successful online business, or any other business in that respects.. you need to make PROFITS.<br><br>Sadly, the valuation of dot.coms are judged in REVENUE instead... to cut the story short it goes something like this<br><br>Step 1. Have a wonderful idea<br>Step 2. Approace a Venture Capitalist<br>Step 3. Have your VC pump in millions in you.<br>Step 4. Go IPO and hope that sentiments will<br>drive your stocks up the sky...<br><br>It has already been a well known fact that even giants like Amazon hasn't reported an annual profit since it started.. and of course, the list goes on... CDNOW, BUY, ETOYS just to name a few.<br><br>I believe dot.coms like these ones will drop and die one after another ... the one that VCs pumped the most money into will drop last..<br><br>So the nutshell is, if you are going to leave your job now to join a dot.com startup "for the stock options are great", its time to think again...if you think the whole world has been buying their grocery online coz its cool and convinent, think again too...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Illegal Operation (edited 01 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Illegal Operation:</div><div class="quote_body">Online retailing will have no place in cyberspace...<br></div></blockquote>Not true, online retailing is a totally new method of retailling whose potential is waiting to be unleashed. Please allow me to explain.<br><br>Reach is about access connection. It means how many customers a business can connect with and how many products it can offer to those customers. Reach is the most visible difference between electronic and physical businesses and it has been the primary competitive differentiator for e-commerce so far.<br><br>Richness is the depth and detail of information that the business can give the customer. Richness holds enormous potential for building relationship with customers in a future dominated by e-commerce.<br><br>Traditional businesses (physical businesses) have always had to make a trade-off between richness and reach. Doing both - getting highly detailed, customised information to and from a massive audience - was prohibitively expensive. E-commerce businesses can exploit the dramatic displacement of the trade-off permitted by electronic connectivity and information standards.<br><br>With little money, the e-commerce can provide a wide base of customer (reach) and access to a wide range of products (also reach) and detailed information about each product (richness) It can also collect huge amounts of info about each customer (richness again) and use it to sell more products and services.<br><br>In e-commerce, or electronic retailing, we are no longer selling products or services, we are selling *information* This is something which the physical business can't accomplish at a low cost.<br><br>E-retailors with navigational functions are shifting their affliation towards customers. When i say "affliation" i mean whose interests the business represents. It's a natural progression for pure navigators to affliate with customers. And traditional manufacturers and retailors must find ways to fight or imitate their e-commerce competitors' affliation strategies.<br><br>So I say, e-commerce is here to stay and so is e-retailing. And their potential is not to be underestimated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Littleman I agree with your analysis.<br>E-retailing is here to stay.<br><br>One further factor which I might add, on-line retailing has the potential of far lower costs compared to traditional bricks-and-mortar outfits.  Look at Amazon.com, how do you think they can undercut the book retailers?  Furthermore we're seeing the development of many online shops in UK and USA selling everything from CDs, to books, to household equipment etc.  Many low-cost airlines in Europe for example encourage you to buy directly to them through the net as well, saving them the commission paid to travel agents.<br><br>What is more worrying is the potential job losses in the intermediary services sector.  If I can buy my ticket from the airline through the web, travel agents will lose commission.  If I can buy my car through the web (this is available in USA and UK), car dealers will lose their commissions.  In the near future, if I can bank through the net, less bank tellers will be needed.  Why would i want to bank with an internet bank?  Simply because they can offer better interest rates!</div>

You got to hop around. This is even encouraged by the government. (read Career Guide 2000) We must learn to go to places where our talents can be put to good use. Once this company does not need me anymore, i will have to hop to another company, this benefits both the company and the individual.<br><br>However, there are drawbacks in E-Commerce. A particular one is information overload. Some people do not have the time to read through all the details of a product or service before considering purchasing it, hence we still need a human to explain.<br><br>And information is dead but human is alive. Human will add value to raw information, and that is what most people are looking for. Don't believe ? Just throw all the raw informations to your boss without analysing them, see if you get fired.<br><br>And people are important sources and integrators of information, any maps or model of information should include people. Hence i do not think we should worry about those pple losing their job. But they have to learn to do their job in a different way, their job scope or responsibilities will definitely be very different now.<br><br>People who do not realise that will just die out. This is just natural selection, where the fittest survive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personalization, as what littleman has mentioned, are what online retailers use to lure users to buy more than they actually wish to.... or for the fact, buy at all.<br><br>It shoves the product info and contents in your face.. "are you interested in books on dogs? Let me show you this other book on puppies, animals.. etc.. and let me show you how the other buyers rate the books"<br><br>Seems like a great idea!! Don't you wish that the next time you visit your favourite resturant, the waiter will show you your favourite seat, and bring your favourite wine too? Now, that's personalization in real life...<br><br>But Hey!! Why isn't this great idea of personalization driving commerce on the NET????<br><br>I compare Personalization, and Online retailing to communism.. both are ideas made in heaven, but both are going to fail terribly on earh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Why driving online retail by providing information and content, or for that matter, driving online retail with anything else will not work.<br><br>1) Online payment via credit card is not to be trusted. Encryption's great.. 40,128 bit SSL is almost uncrackable , and that more or less made packet spoofing impossible.. but hey.. if your crap sys admin. is not going to patch that security bug in your web server that microsoft released 2 year ago. (incidentally, that's what happened recently with the "bill gates credit card is stolen" case).. simply put. If your sys admin. sucks, no amount of technology can stop the hackers..<br><br>2)Political, cultural etc.. barriers across country. Do you think your programmer can develop an all purpose payment system that will work across all countries? Bear in mind that taxations between countries(even states) are different. Or if your orders are repudiated, how are you going to sue the buyer? Are you going to ship this guy to be trial in the State because he refuse to admit that he bought that $20 Dog book? Did he break a law in Africa or the States?<br><br>3) MOST important reason... I WANT TO TOUCH THE THING BEFORE I BUY IT!! Do you want to part with your cash for that car you see online without even test driving it?<br>How do I buy my groceries without hand picking the apples first...why do I buy a spectacle without even testing my eyes first?<br><br>Simply, online retail has not worked since it started, and it will never work in the future... internet stocks will continue to fall to when it should have been, and the money which has gone to the wrong pockets will return to rightful owners.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The online retail scene in Singapore is seriously pathetic. Many Singapore based online store sells less than 10 products per category... and nobody actually bother to act new products into the store. Log in 3 months after and you will still see the same thing.<br><br>Illegal Operation sees this as a monkey see monkey do attitude. Every business just wish to be wired. Many dot.coms startups here have no business model, no solution and no technology, but mention the word "Stock Option" , "Angel" , "IPO" and you see the glitter in their eyes.<br><br>On a technical point of view, many of our online applications are developed and sits on top of existing ecommerce technologies. We do not create our own. To put an analogy across, we are sitting on sombody else's carpet.

There are many dumb E-commerce sites out there which makes one really wonder "How on earth do they manage to make enough to survive?"<br><br>However, I find his point that, and I quote "Until Singapore's dot.coms are really able to come up with _REAL_ ecommerce enabling technologies, ecommerce is doomed to fail here.", is wrong.<br><br>It's easy to say such things, but what exactly should a REAL ecommerce enabling technology be?<br><br>For me, E-Commerce will fail, unless people come up with real feasible ideas and services.<br><br>I quote from Illegal Operation again, "The internet will be an online community, perhaps a media where businesses<br>will use as an infrastructure to create a supply chain(between business)...and probably a platform for application services.."<br><br>This sentence is very true, however I beg to differ from his next line "Online retailing will have no place in cyberspace... " An online storefront by itself will have no value, a place where you see catalogues click, submit CC number etc..<br><br>However, when packaged with certain customer services or special features which are unique and attractive, that site can be a hit.<br><br>For example, if IKEA or COURTS were to allow you to create a "virtual home", ie you scan in a photo of your room, and you can select the furniture you wish to buy, click and drag onto the photo and see if it fits..etc..<br>then I believe that site will be a hit for the following reasons:<br><br>1) no more headaches about whether the colour clashes or if the furniture will stick out like a sore thumb<br><br>2) no need to worry about quality especially when purchasing from a famous brand like IKEA or COURTS<br><br>3) if dimensioning is enabled, then there's no need to walk around IKEA with a measuring tape to see if the furniture will fit<br><br>4) you get to picture the room with different combinations of furniture<br><br>Creativity in problem solving to produce a solution that will entice everyone is the key to E-Commerce success and not trying to figure out what products to sell online.<br><br></div>

Each has its pros and cons. ColdFusion produces ecommerce systems on the fly, but is unscalable (incidently, its what our first online bank runs on)<br><br>Site Server insist on NT and IIS. &lt;NT.. shudders..&gt;<br><br>"Carpets" like this come and go.. what most of our dot.coms are doing is sitting on these carpet. Dependence on 3rd party might not be a bad idea if you are just aiming for IPO... but if a company has a real solution to offer, Illegal Operation feels that they should look elsewhere. A dot.com that creates a solution by leeching on another's software will always be running behind. And once the carpet is pull, all is gone.<br><br>Agree on the IKEA example. It is sad that Illegal Operation is pessimistic towards the direction the local ecommerce industry is heading. It seem to be going all the wrong way. Anyone notice the splat of E-Shop that provide ONLY cash on delivery?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never expected you to say that.. I mean.. If I could come up with a better software than coldfusion, jasmine, oracle, or maybe better the macromedia line of products I won't be doing E-Commerce! I'll be selling my software! : P<br><br>Suppose you want to create a better E-commerce engine, what would you use to write it? PERL? ASP? PHP? VBScript? Ultimately you will still be depending on a third party software or utility.<br><br>However, if you use things like Macromedia drumbeat or MivaMerchant to set up your store front and manage your database, I'll agree with you that that is not the way to really set up store (no pun intended).<br><br>I'd rather that I write a fantastic script to handle the transactions and features while making use of Jasmine or coldfusion to handle my database than spend all my time trying to produce another software.</div>

But for the majority, is there really a need for them to go online? Or is this just another business trend?<br><br>Some things are better left unchanged.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys...sorry to intrudes. But..really..you guys are well read. I'm nuts in computer stuff. Illegal Operation..kudos to you for being sensible in your explanation of E-commerce. Same goes to the rest..eg Enigma.<br><br>I'm starting a web site soon for my Company. No transaction is being done on the web site. It only contains information like...what the Company provides..and telephone and pager no. e-mail address (company) etc. Is that E-commerce too?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Tommy (edited 10 May 2000).]</div>
