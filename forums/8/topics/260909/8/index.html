It is their prerogative to be promiscuous, and why do you bother judging and condemning them? Are you trying to change them? What does condemning them do? Why are you judging? Do you feel you are "superior" because you don't sleep around? Or are you too ugly to sleep around? What gives you the higher moral authority in this matter? Just because your parents say it is wrong, does it mean they are always right? If they judge, does it mean you should follow in their footsteps? Are your parents infallible? No man is perfect, and you should open your mind to other points of view, rather than follow your parents' point of view. If your parents were right all the time, does it mean you have never argued with them? Always remember, that age is just a number, and it is never an indication of moral authority, and of course, never of who is always right. Your typical Asian mentality of parent-is-always-right will never get you far in life, and if young people were like you in general, this society is doomed.
