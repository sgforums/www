            <div class='col-md body'>Conclusion : ONS, everyone has their stand, u want to say , say it out. Dun force your idea on other ppl. When you say out something, definitely some ppl going to rebuke you, u can choose to rebuke back or remain silent.<br><br>Those never had ONS, cannot comment on ONS, how can you say the grape is sour even before tasting it ? If you think you want something, ppl dun agree with you, please keep it to yourself.<br><br>You want virgin, it is your own business. If you think you need to consult your parents, teachers, it is your own business also. I juz think you cannot make decision by yourself, i wun respect you.<br><br>If you make decision to please others, i can only say you are people-pleasers. This is wad i think of you, you can choose to be angry or simply ignor me, none of my business regardless how you react.<br><br>To me, some people needs to grow up and see things from other people's point of view. Simply forcing your ideas on other ppl it a form of immaturity. Growing up is painful, but not growing up is even more painful.<br><br>If the idea of ONS has hurt you before, I hope you can forget about the whole incident and forgive the person involve. They juz have their own freedom and see thing differently from you.<br><br>If you still choose to see things in your own way, it is your business</div>
