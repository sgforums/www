            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I do not think all girls who indulge in ONS are s.luts. Some of them might be cheated into a one night stand. So it depends on what is your definition of ONS. Because for me, ONS is you spend one night with someone, have sex with him or her, then pack your bag and leave in the morning. But doesn't mean there is no feeling involved. The girl might have ONS wif the guy because she loves her and decides to give her body to him, but the guy just treats her as a fling.<br><br>Not that I approve of such action, but of cos some people have their own reasons for doing it (for love, money, etc). Some girls think by having sex with a guy the guy will fall in love with her. It is the wrong mindset to have in the first place, but does that make the girl s.lutty?<br><br>And there are girls who are quite open and liberal towards sex, they think that guys can go around to find someone to satisfy their needs without being labelled as cheap, why couldn't they do the same thing? Girls have needs too because we are human as well. It is more like the society way of viewing things, esp in the Asian culture. If a guy has an ONS he can brag about it with his friends, but when a girl has it and tells others about the incident, she is termed as cheap and s.lutty. Is this fair?<br><br>Of course different guys have different preferences. Some prefer their girls to have more experience in sex, some prefer their girls to be conservative and innocent. You will seek what you want, and not criticize others' choices when they are different from yours, because different people have different taste <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
