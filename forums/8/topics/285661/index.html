            <div class='col-md body'>was in some 5 star modern hotel nr mohd sultan with my gf to celebrate 2yrs anniversary ytd.<br><br>after breakfast this morning, we went back to hotel rm and fall aslp soon. my gf was hugging me on my left side. the tv was on and its the motogp programme on ch24...<br><br>i know im half sleeping as i can still hear and listen to the commentator of the motogp.. halfway thru the slp, i pull the blanket over my head, as i was cold and the sunlight is very glaring(i'm facing window, window face east, curtains not pulled). and shortly after that, i thk i encountered the "dirty" thing..<br><br>bcos of the glaring sunlight, even if the blanket was thick, the fact that its white means that i can still see some shadow if its cast on the blanket itself. i notice a black shadow coming from my right side.. (right side of me is toilet etc.) i thought my gf already wake up and was walking back to my left side. then i felt something just felt on top of me. like my gf jump on me.. (and i thought so too) but, i notice that my gf is still sleeping on my left. her nose and mouth is quite closee to my ear, i can hear her slight snore. moreover, the thing that jumped on me got some very funny sound(female sound btw).. i dont know how to describe this funny sound. but its definitely not my gf's snoring or the tv sound in the background.<br><br>i tried and struggle to wake myself up. i tried to shout "darling!" but like no effect. but after a very short while, i was able to move my body and I sat up immediately. my gf was like quite shocked o fmy sudden movement. i told her to check out immed, anyway, it was abt 1110am then. we have intended to check out at abt 12 sharp. my gf was puzzled. but i just told her that i dont want to stay anymore longer..<br><br>another thing that puzzled me too is the fact that "somebody" had pulled the curtains when we are not around ytd night. we went out at 5+ for dinner and back at 10+ at night. 100% sure the curtains was opened before we left, cos we were still looking out of it to decide where we want to go. it cant be room service, they dont check the rooms around those times, even if it was room service, instead of just pulling the curtains, they would have tidied the bed and the bathroom (it was still messy and the same state before we went out)..<br><br>could it be that i really encountered something dirty? or just me being over-sensitive? i have never encountered these things before yet...</div>
