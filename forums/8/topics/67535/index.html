I got so pro once I could actually shoot off their heads, which is pretty disturbing, because the heads are very loosely fixed onto the body and seem to come off real easy, just hit high up the thorax.<br><br>Rubber bands work well on cockroaches as well, they are easier to hit due to their large profile and tend to be stunned when hit and do stupid things like go belly up or run in circles while a dragonfly or lizard that survived a hit tends to run/fly away. But usually a good, solid hit on the case of the body just above the wings will knock out the cockroach and nearly cut it into two. It splatters real bad thou, so you gotta get ready to cleanup. I prefer using soap on cockroaches, it's a cleaner kill heh heh...</div></blockquote></div>
