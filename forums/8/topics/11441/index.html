            <div class='col-md body'>5 years into my job as a system analyst, I realized that I spent most my time climbing the coporate ladder, helping my boss make his millions, and then billions. My returns are the monthly salary, annual holidays and a gimpse of hope each time a promotion exercise comes. During the 4th year of my career, my application for a resale flat came through. Then my first baby came.<br><br>The nation was just hit by the economic crisis then. Facing chance of a possible retrenchment, I worked much harder, tried to prove myself my boss. As a result, I neglected the family. My wife had to work too. Ah Boy's first words were "Maria". Maria was my wife's mother's maid.<br><br>And that was enough. I was faced with a choice. Do I live my life to make my boss rich in exchange for handouts to let me live hand to mouth? Or do I get out of this rat-race and own my career for once.<br><br>And the decision was made. I am now a proud owner of Bukit Batok's finest laksa store. The work is tough, but strangely, life is more enjoyable. I never knew what responsibility really meant until I became resposibility for myself. For once.</div>

Yes, the opposition party in singapore is  weak in my opinion. why? partly due to the restriction and pressure that the government put on them. No freedom of speech etc. As i said, how to convey their message? However, in my mind, i think JBJ, Dr Chee Soon Juan etc are credible in the sense that they dare to challenge the all mighty PAP on the behalf of singaporean although they are not doing that well in other fields.<br><br>Extracted from <a href="http://www.gn.apc.org/sfd/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Ds/250301.html" rel="nofollow">rebuke mainly of p.a.p's making</a><br>"The greatest examples of idealism this country has are brave people like JB Jeyaretnam and Dr. Chee Soon Juan.  When JB Jeyaretnam fights for what he passionately believes in and loses everything because of it, what message does that send to our youth regarding idealism?  When Dr. Chee lost everything for joining the opposition, what message does that send the youth?"<br><br>Yup, you did not mention anything about wanting to be politician nor did I. So that's fair and hence we will end this stupid challenge since not everyone will have the quality to be an MP. Even those with quality might not consider joining MP in singapore.

Well congrat then for having such a bright career in SAF.</div></blockquote>Well,i have been here for about 1 year,maybe that's why i have 1000 posts.Well,Mr LKY also faced possible prosecution from the British Special Branch in the 50s and 60s,something like our ISD,but still managed to gain independence for Singapore.So the pressure by the PAP is not a valid reason.Maybe it's the calibre of our opposition politicians that is the question.In my opinion,only a few opposition politicians are credible and Mr Chiam See Tong is 1 of them.<br><br>As for your gripe about no freedom of speech?Freedom of speech must be companied with responsibility and proof of what you say.If you go out into the streets and tell passer by Mr So-and-so is a faggot.You will have your freedom of speech,but also get sued in court if your allegations are false.So i think there is freedom of speech,but allegations must be backed up by concrete evidence or you will risk facing a slander lawsuit.JBJ and Dr Chee lost everything because of some careless remarks they made.I don't see Mr Chiam See Tong and other opposition politicians losing everything as they know that what they say must be based on evidence,not heresay.<br><br>You constantly gripe about Singapore's policies and politicians,yet have no desire to do something to change it,so why gripe unless you intend to be a NATO?Politics is a dirty game and you must be politically savvy to survive,so i think not only good men don't join PAP,good men don't even join politics.<br><br>SAF to me is not a career as i don't intend to stay there for long,for your information,i am just a NCO,not an officer,heehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
