So what are you doing now?  In your profile, you stated you age as 25 and are a manager....this, I don't believe.  I see the way you have written and your feelings clearly show - you're trying hard to protect youth or teenagers, aren't you?

He clearly said he was STANDING on the bus.  Yet, with your seemingly inability to read simple English, you jumped in and started accusing him of not giving up his seat....even went so far as to bravely chase for answers.  So now, its our turn to chase for answers from you.  Why did you ask him why he didn't give up his seat?  Why did you accuse him of not giving up his seat?<br></div><div class="quote_body">[quote]Those pro-feminist ask for equality yet those woman bearing a baby still demand they get a seat,hypocrisy</div></blockquote>Nobody said that pregnant women demanded a seat.  In fact, nobody said pregnant women demanded anything at all.  It is the observers who were commenting that some people don't give up seats for pregnant women.<br><br>And in this case, the observer (Glen999) didn't say that the kids who didn't give up their seats were guys.  He said "students" and "young girls".  So why did you jump in and mention feminism?<br><br>When you asked questions, you insisted on getting answers.  Now, show us that you're a responsible adult and answer my questions, please.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>overall, i think no one shld take responsibility for another's action. y do the parents or the sch have to be blamed when it's obviously the student's fault? seriously speaking, does the teaching of parents and teachers help to make one better? no, i'll say. if it's true, the whole world will be a better place. i believe almost every singaporeans child has been taught the right morals over and over and over again. but do they really practise it even they know of the right morals?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on guys, if you're unhappy about the behaviour of some students, just target the behaviour of those students, not all students as a whole.
