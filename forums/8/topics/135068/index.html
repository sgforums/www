Otherwise, with the ignorance of singapore education system, i may get tortuned when i'm old.... because singapore education never teaches my sons how to respect elder.<br><br>*******school is not the only responsible***********<br>Parents, in my opinion, are like CEO. they are the ones who ultimately responsible. But I think schools (like middle management) play an important roles as well especially peer pressure in the school. (my mom always told me that "i just have to see your school friends and I will know whether you will be good or bad"Wink.<br><br>if all your school friends don't give up seat to needy people, you will tend to do the same. If your school friends give seats and are polite, you will be one of them as well.<br><br>*********************************************<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my theory is if you want a seat then you will ask for it llor(nicely, i got see one idiot indian old man ask pple to give up seat rudely nvm one guy get up le he still wanna ask the guy next to him to get up so he can put his bird  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> ), thats for empty seats on the inside, if no other seats then must guage if the person can stand if i think the person no prob i also wont auto unless asked. giving up seats to pple who need it more is good but but also must judge for yourself not see older or pregnant women only give up</div>
