            <div class='col-md body'>Some years ago, I was at LAX (Los Angeles Airport) on the way home.<br><br>I was at the airlines lounge and as usual, went to the loo before boarding.  All the cubicles at that lounge level were fitted out for the handicapped.  And I mean ALL....which meant that both normal and handicapped people could use any cubicle.<br><br>Happily, I stepped into the last available one.  While I was in there, I heard this guy knocking on my door, thumping something on the ground to get my attention.  I just ignored him.<br><br>When I finally emerged, I saw this Singaporean guy standing outside supported by his crutches (I know he was Singaporean because he flew back on the same flight as I....and spoke Singlish).  I smiled at him as I walked past, but he gave me a very dirty look and stared at me.  He must have felt that I had to rush out with my pants down, just because he was handicapped.  Or maybe he thought that the toilet was only for the handicapped.<br><br>Anyway, I just ignored him and walked away.  But that was one of the times when I felt no pity for a handicapped person.  Even wished I could fuck his face up as good as I can.<br><br>But you know what?  In the future, if I have to give up something (eg. my seat) for someone who needs it more than I, I will still gladly do it.  Its because I do it to clear my own conscience....not because I love them or anything (geee, I don't even know them).  It won't be my first time doing this kinda good deed anyway.<br><br>To me, its not about being considerate, holy, etc.....its about avoiding any guilty feelings myself (yes, its selfish, but it works).<br><br>Hmmmm....now after writing this I'm wondering.....if I don't care about being considerate towards others, then why should I feel guilty about not being considerate to them?  What I'm saying is like LPPL leh....hey, maybe I do love them after all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
