              <p>Hey all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Newbie needing a little help. I'm a singaporean and my girlfriend is a south-korean who's been wokring in Singapore for the past 2.5 years in one of our financial institutions. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She applied for PR about a year ago and was rejected, with reasons given being that she has not worked in singapore long enough and secondly that her salary isnt high enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Considering that after trawling through the forums, I know of people that have had their PR applications approved after 6 months, and I know for a fact that her salary is higher than average, I'm a bit puzzled as to the reasons given to her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there a point for her to apply for PR again? and if so, how long after a failed application should she wait before trying to apply again?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this question =)</p>

              <p>my suggestion to you as follows:</p>
              <p>1. married her. it will be easier after that to get PR.</p>
              <p>2. wrong timing. your gf should apply 2 years ago not now. election are around the corner,from what i knw, SIR had make PR application more difficult because i think they had a quota this time. dont bother to ask SIR why they dont approve. coz they never tell you.</p>
              <p>3. her profile. I am not sure why they say salary not enough. If she is currently employ under EP, it should not be a salary issue. i suspect your gf is under SP. SP more difficult to get PR.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Where got people ask their own mother / wife or gfs to work as cleaners or such low class job one, where only at the wits end then do such job leh? (Although, cleaners and such are important, and I think they should deserve a higher salary, since it is better than commit suicide or go rob / steal etc)</p>

              <p>bro rockstar,</p>
              <p>few pt to note..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.if your spouse never come into singapore for work before ( but have tertiary education) it is very easy to get PR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If your spouse ever work in singapore but under WP, SP. it is difficult to get approval( coz the above 2 work passes are consider lower grade, ie, non tertiary education). however i think immigration will erase the record if u leave singapore more than 3mths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Once get PR, that where the time clock start clicking. PR normally renew every 5years. within 5 years, the PR had to stay in singapore 2/5 or 3/5 years to justify renewal.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>1.must hold a permanent job. not just 1mth or 2mth hor. ( justify, you can support her and yourself)never change job if u gona apply PR for her. change job after application approve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. CPF got money( so that u can apply for flats)</p>

              <p>1. tertiary education faster. if no tertiary education and you not meet above critieria, the SIR will only issue married visa. but she must left singapore every 3mth.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Maybe after election, and also after her job promotion or a career switch.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, even without any changes, I think staying longer in Singapore would give her some advantages. So just wait loh.</p>

              <p>bro rockstar,</p>
              <p>few pt to note..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.if your spouse never come into singapore for work before ( but
              have tertiary education) it is very easy to get PR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. If your spouse ever work in singapore but under WP, SP. it is
              difficult to get approval( coz the above 2 work passes are consider
              lower grade, ie, non tertiary education). however i think
              immigration will erase the record if u leave singapore more than
              3mths.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Once get PR, that where the time clock start clicking. PR
              normally renew every 5years. within 5 years, the PR had to stay in
              singapore 2/5 or 3/5 years to justify renewal.</p>
