Through all the screaming and shouting from three family members, the thick smoke and the flames that were gutting the inside of his terrace house along East Coast Road.<br><br>By the time firemen broke down the door to his locked bedroom on the top level of the house, the 31-year-old Chinese physician was unconscious on his bed.<br><br>The firemen rushed him to Changi General Hospital, but it was too late. He died about two hours later, of smoke inhalation.<br><br>Yesterday's tragedy began unfolding at about 6am, when a short circuit caused an electrical socket in the bedroom of Mr Yap's sister, Diana, to burst into flames.<br><br>Jolted awake by the heat, which singed her hair, she tried to smother the flames with a wet towel.<br><br>Ms Yap, 25, who returned only a few days ago from China, where she is studying traditional Chinese medicine at Nanjing University, said: 'I tried to control the fire, but it turned into a big fireball suddenly and I had to run out.'<br><br>She suffered burns to her arms and feet, and was treated at Singapore General Hospital.<br><br>Her mother, Madam Annie Tiang, 60, smelt smoke and rushed out in her pyjamas.<br><br>Mr Yap's brother, Joseph, 29, was woken by their screams, and charged out of his bedroom.<br><br>His sleep-heavy eyes were cleared up instantly by what he saw and heard: Fierce flames and thick smoke billowing out of his sister's room, and the sound of windowpanes shattering in the heat.<br><br>All three shouted for his brother, but he did not respond, and Mr Joseph Yap swung straight into action. After getting his mother and sister to safety, he returned for his brother, using a T-shirt as protection from the choking fumes.<br><br>But the blistering heat and thick smoke forced him back.<br><br>The younger Mr Yap, also a Chinese physician, said his brother was still breathing when he was loaded into the ambulance.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Between coughs, he criticised the Singapore Civil Defence Force for not heeding his plea to get his brother to East Shore Hospital, which he said is only a minute's drive away, instead of Changi General, about five minutes away.</span><br><br>But the SCDF said it was policy to take emergency cases to the nearest government hospital's A&amp;E department, which has a 'full range of specialist doctors and facilities available immediately on hand'. East Shore is a private hospital.<br><br>Yesterday, a grieving Madam Tiang choked back tears as she spoke of her son.<br><br>Mr Daniel Yap was to be married soon, to a Chinese physician from Taiwan, whom he became engaged to six months ago.<br><br>She is now in Australia and has not been told of the grim news.<br><br>There will be no sinseh clinic either.<br><br>'He told me that his aim one day was to open his own clinic. But now...</blockquote>Seems to me they should revise this policy.<br><br>How about, depending on level of emergency and seriousness, hence the type of medical attention required to treat the patient in the shortest time possible?<br><br>I'm no doctor.. But I guess East Shore Hospital should have the ability to cope with smoke inhalation cases?<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
