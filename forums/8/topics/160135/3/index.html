Perhaps the "mandatory" behind the death sentence for drugs smuggling above certain weight will be removed. It might set people thinking, set law makers thinking and discusing. Maybe the law can't be changed overnight, but it can be changed. As someone once said, "Since it can't be changed overnight, what are we waiting for?

But abolish the mandatoryness of a death sentence. Every case has to be considered as unique, and looked at with more consideration.</div>
