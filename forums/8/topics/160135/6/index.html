            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">the point u raised about Kingpins. That is exactly the problem with society! A drug kingpin can use a good legal defence team to get off! Why? People choose to go by and only by the book, down to the last letter. Even though say both the aussie guy and a drug kingpin ended up in court, the aussie will die while the Kingpin will live. Why? because we don't use our humanity. If we used our humanity, the Kingpin will get death! Why? because we will look into their motivations and circumstances! The aussie guy is motivated by concern for his brother. The Kingpin by Greed. Based on that alone, I think its so much clearer who should die and who should be jailed. But because we've sold our humanity, because we can only say the runner was caught with drugs while the Kingpin was caught(probably for tax evasion or for money laundering), the runner will die while the Kingpin will either get off, or continue to run his business in jail like u said. U might not have realised it, but the scenario u've tried to tack to what u think will happen if we do not sell our humanity, is actually what's happening now BECAUSE we've already sold so much of our humanity. Anyone who's humane and thinks deep will know who really deserves to die, and from there, decides who gets it.</div></blockquote>Going by the book is what the legal system in any civilised nation is meant to do. Not doing so will guarantee the following senarios:<br><br>1) There will be double standards. Two criminals with similar cases may be judged differently.<br><br>2) Judging will be biased and mistakes can be made. True criminals might be acquited while innocents convicted.<br><br>3) The credibility of the legal system will be diminished because the people will perceive that it is no longer fair.<br><br>4) Citizens will longer trust the laws to govern the nation fairly. At this point, the nation will most surely be thrust into chaos.<br><br>You've missed the point I was trying to make in my earlier post. Perhaps I wasnt clear enough.<br><br>Because the judge was not at the crime scene, there are certain cases where it will be difficult for him to say for sure who is the mastermind and who is the runner. It will be even more difficult for him to judge that are the actual motivation behind the crimes. Looking into motivations is not as simple as it may seem to you and me. In fact, judging anything that has to do with human emotions is never easy. A judge, therefore, has to use hard evidence as a guage for every case he handles.<br><br>I am not saying that the legal system in Singapore does not factor in human considerations. In other crimes, human motivations do play a role in deciding the severity of the punishment to be awarded to the criminal. Criminals have the option of using examplary behaviour in the past, the fact that they are first timers etc to appeal for a lesser sentence.<br><br>However, drug trafficking is a crime that once done, warrants the death penalty regardless of the original motivation. The trafficker may be doing it to help one sibling, but the result of his actions is the destruction of the lives of many others. He could have helped his sibling via other ways but instead had to choose a way that would harm others.</div>

Individuals untrained in legal matters could be swayed by external influences(e.g. media). Then, there would be the danger that the judgement is wrong. Lawyers in nations where there is a jury system are known to use the media to their advantage in order to win the jury over. They also employ tactics in court that appeal too much to the emotional side of the jury.<br></div>

Two criminals with similar cases may be judged differently. </div></blockquote>That should be the way. The 2 criminal may have similiar cases but not similiar circumstances. U're saying they should all be viewed the same regardless of their motivation?<br><br>B4 UK abolished the death sentence altogether, they decided that for capital crimes like murder, it was mandatory to consider the motivation.<br><br>For eg. A woman who had been subject to many years of abuse from her cheating, drunkard of a husband, who finally snaps and kills him in a moment of rage. During the killing she is aware that she is committing a crime. But she does so because she can't take it anymore, and she feels she has no option left. The law was changed such that it was considered unethical to sentence this woman to death just because she committed murder.<br><br>And for goodness sake, do not start the, "she should die because she could have seek help from social group" argument. That is irrelevant, because she was suffering and that suffering was the motivation behind the killing.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by acotis:</div><div class="quote_body">He could have helped his sibling via other ways but instead had to choose a way that would harm others.</div></blockquote>U know that for sure? That the Triads didn't tell him "If u do not do this for us we WILL kill your brother" or something?<br><br>U know for sure, 100% sure, that he had other ways of helping his sibling? If u don't how can u say it is justified that he dies? He didn't commit a crime out of personal greed. That counts for a lot as far as I can see.<br><br>Seriously from all of your thinking here, u must be the kind of people who watch Robin Hood movies and think "he should be excecuted for being a serial robber and career criminal."</div>

The mother is very nice woman. She is a single mum and very hard working. It was really hard for her to bring up her sons. She worked from Mon to Sun for two shops as a hair dresser  to support the family. The kids were born when they escaped from VN war. Coming to Australia as refugees, life wasnt easy at all. Being single mother and working hard like this, it was probably didnt have  enough time to keep an eye on the kids since the early days,  but she could convey the love among the family members.
