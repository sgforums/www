            <div class='col-md body'>Before anyone start campaigning on an issue, you need to understand the consequences of your actions should your campaign be a success.<br><br>I have lived in Australia for the last 15 years and I can tell you that the majority of OZs would welcome the return of the death penalty for crimes such as murder and drug trafficking.<br><br>The biggest mistake the western world committed was to do away with the death penalty. As a result, the family of murder victims now suffer more than the scumbags that commit the crimes.<br><br>17 years ago, a 13 year old girl was raped and then brutally murdered. Her body was thrown in a drain near her home. The body was found by her father. One can only begin to imagine the anguish he went through at that moment and the torment he has been suffering from that day on.<br><br>Fortunately, the rapist/murderer was caught and charged. He was sentenced to 20 years jail with the opportunity for parole after 15 years!!!<br><br>2 years ago, the murderer was released on parole despite the violent objections of the victim's father. It was argued that he deserved a second chance and that parole was his "right" as he had been well behaved while serving his sentence.<br><br>The father then stated on TV that he would personally deal with the scumbag once he was released. Guess what!... instead of taking the father's emotional turmoil into consideration, the police charged him for using threatening language... a typical example of a justice system gone mad!!! where one constantly hears about the rights of criminals and absolutely nothing is said about the rights of the victims and their families!!!<br><br>The death penalty is harsh but when it comes to certain categories of crime, it is the only way to go. The victims and their loved ones need to be considered too. The death penalty brings closure for them. It is final. They can then get on with rebuilding their shattered lives.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am for the death sentence for drug traffickers.<br><br>Firstly, in nguyen's case, it is impossible to get the courts to pardon him at this point in time. He committed a crime in Singapore and he must be punished according to the law of Singapore. That he is an Australian or even if the Queen intercedes on his behalf makes no difference. If foreign nations were to see Singapore make an exception for nguyen, it could be potentially disastrous for Singapore. Singapore could be seen as a weak nation ready to buckle under pressure. In the global political arena, foreign nations would use this weakness to push Singapore around to obtain benefit for themselves.<br><br>I understand the Australians' reaction towards Nguyen. It is natural for one to stand up for one's own countrymen, especially since Australia does not have the death sentence. However, they too have to understand that since Nguyen broke a law in Singapore, he cannot be pardoned because he is one of them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:<br></div><div class="quote_body">What IF U WERE HIM?</div></blockquote>HENG@ is right to point out that we have to view the matter from the perspective of the offender. However, there is also the perspective of society.<br><br>From the perspective of the offender:<br><br><ul>To Nguyen, death as a punishment is probably too harsh. But then again no one will accept death as a punishment. He might claim to feel remorse. But in reality, he probably just regrets trying to smuggle drugs into Singapore.</ul><br><ul>Nguyen might wonder why is he being punished for trying to help his brother and for being 'forced' into this by the drug bosses. But what of the lives he might ruin? He could, with his 400g of drugs, ruin the life of yet another (and maybe more). The drugs, if not found, would ruin the life of more youths like him. They might even enter a life of crime to support their expensive addiction.</ul><br><br>From the perspective of the Society:<br><br><ul>Drug peddlers should be kept as far away as possible. Every one of them has the potential to contribute to the deaths of many more. I think that this is undisputable.</ul><br><ul>If the death of a few traffickers, who have knowingly committed an act that will potentially destroy members of society, can send a message to others not to try, the death sentence is justified. Since the traffickers have been warned, and since they continue to traffic drugs, they have chosen death themselves.</ul><br><ul>It is not fair to allow a potentially destructive element of soceity back where he can wreak more havoc just because he does not want to adhere to the rules set by the soceity.</ul><br><br>The death penalty is a good deterent against drug trafficking. It may not be the case in other nations, but it is in Singapore. There are statistics to prove it.<br><br>A drug trafficker who is released could very well find himself in the same circumstances that forced him to traffic drugs in the first place. He might be an addict once and might become an addict again. he could still have the same financial difficulties that forced him to turn to a life of crime. Being known to the drug lords means that they could still find him and force him into being a drug mule again.<br><br>I believe we should not put our society at risk for a person who has violated our laws in full knowledge of the consequences of being caught and the destruction he could bring to society.</div>

U get rid of 1, get rid of 10, get rid of 100 smugglers, there will always be more people who can and will be exploited by unsavoury people into committing crimes against their will.<br><br>U all want to talk big about society, maybe u should think about how society is cheaping its collective soul and humanity for a futile effort that leads to no conclusion of a problem. Otherwise, dun come n talk rubbish to me about 'better for society' because, unless u want to make me laugh, do u really think hanging smugglers will do society any good? More like, the triads give u small fish so they can send large shipments thru safely. It not the intercepted drug shipments im worried about. Its the ones which didn't get intercepted. Did u ever think about this maybe? Or nobody is willing to consider that the triads might be using misdirection? Sure u can say the govt and authorities how smart how smart but they're only human, they can get fooled as well too. meanwhile a man who used while trying to save his brother, has to die.<br><br>so come on. don't come talk rubbish to me.</div>

He committed a crime in Singapore and he must be punished according to the law of Singapore. That he is an Australian or even if the Queen intercedes on his behalf makes no difference. If foreign nations were to see Singapore make an exception for nguyen, it could be potentially disastrous for Singapore. Singapore could be seen as a weak nation ready to buckle under pressure. In the global political arena, foreign nations would use this weakness to push Singapore around to obtain benefit for themselves.<br><br>I understand the Australians' reaction towards Nguyen. It is natural for one to stand up for one's own countrymen, especially since Australia does not have the death sentence. However, they too have to understand that since Nguyen broke a law in Singapore, he cannot be pardoned because he is one of them.<br><br>HENG@ is right to point out that we have to view the matter from the perspective of the offender.

            <div class='col-md body'>heng, when i quoted you, i was just using that particular question you asked to bring up the point we should be looking at society's point of view as well. I've read your posts and I know what stand you take. When I wrote my post, i wasnt talking about your comments in particular.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">As a society, is it worth selling our humanity under the pretext of protecting ourselves? When what we should really be combating is 'demand' because there is NEVER supply without demand. No one want to buy, who want to do a money lossing business? Targetting supply solves nothing, is futile, and ultimately, i sure as hell ain't comfortable about society selling its humanity and soul for nothing.</div></blockquote>May i know what do you define as "selling our humanity"? We do not sell our humanity by sentencing criminals to death. On the other hand, criminals sold their humanity committing acts that they know full well will bring harm to society.<br><br>We do target demand as well as supply. We do have anti-drug campaigns. Our schools teach our youth the dangers of drugs. We have counsellors. We have rehab centers to help addicts kick their habit. What we are doing here is also to target both demand and supply. Reducing the amount of drugs there are on the streets will lower the chances of our youth getting in contact with them. Remember, the moment someone takes his first pill, he becomes addicted. In other words, to him the drug is no longer a "want" but a "need". He will then be locked in a cycle of addiction, rehab, addiction, rehab....<br><br>We cannot take our chances by allowing drugs into society. Trying to solve the problem by tackling the demand alone is not viable. Doing so would mean killing off more of our youth while we wait for our strategy to take effect. Besides, the addicted would create a constant demand for the drugs. Being drug users themselves, they could influence others into taking drugs. That would seem like we are protecting a few drug smugglers at the cost of the lives of a large number of own. Would that be a more platable option?</div>
