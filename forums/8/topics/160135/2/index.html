As illustrated by former replies, if we let one foreign criminal go scot-free after breaking the law here, then others will do the same until we become a Paradise for foreigners to commit crime here.<br><br>The reply of the Singapore Government is clear that all criminals who commit crime in Singapore will be dealt with by her OWN LAWS. A previous example is the US boy who vandalised the CJ's car, even after appeal he still "tio rotan". So even a superpower like USA back that fella he still "tio rotan", *insert country here*'s government can do wat?<br><br>lets end this with this anecdote, if a Singaporean killed *insert country here*'s PM and Singapore's government (i know this wont happen, but i'm illustrating the response of *insert country here*in this case) will beg the government to let him go. (And if the appeal succede) he is sent back to Singapore but he was not charged in Singapore's law.

I mean if he is really siao and dun know what he is doing, is it fair that he dies just because he has the misfortune of suffering from a mental illness that causes him to be unaware of his actions?<br><br>Besides, if u consider 2 cases, one where a robber breaks into the home of an elderly lady to rob it, is discovered by her and beats her to death. The other case, where a wife is constantly abused physically and mentally by her lousy cheating drunkard of a husband, until one day she snaps n kills him in a rage. Are u going to say both the robber and the wife are the same criminal and excecute them both? Thats why I say all cases have to be gone thru case by case. Its pure laziness on the part of lawmakers to have a mandatory death sentence.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>and u know what? I BET that australian was used by the triads as a decoy. Its not unknown for those drug syndicates, to use people like him forced by circumstances to work for them, as decoys, meaning they are ratted out to the police so that another smuggler with a much bigger and valuable shipment gets thru unharressed. Anyone remember the movie gone in 60 seconds? Nicholas Cage's character. If u were him, what will u do? Let your brother die? Kill the mob boss and risk your mother being killed? Risk your family? Or what?<br><br>The thing is Singaporeans have grown lazy. They just don't want to consider all these factors anymore. Someone smuggle drugs surely = working purely out of greed = evil so must hang. This logic applies to ALL persons caught with drugs. Right? Such laziness to think. spend 10 bloody years or more (13 at least, if u go to uni) and all we get are lazy bums who refuse to use their bloody brains? WHAT has singapore turned into? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Like that I should be lazy and say ALL singaporeans are just lazy n bad and sould all go and die la. same logic wad. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

He was trying to save his brother.<br>Trust me, what causes our own country to fall and crumble won't be people like him, but the ungraciousness and unwillingness to think of the people of singapore society. Singapore is already crumbling and falling more than u think right in front of your very eyes.<br><br>Anyways no one has answered me yet. If it were u, and u were forced into doing something illegal thu threats against u or your family, would u think u deserved to die? Or would u sacrifice say, your own mother or grandmother just so u won't have to risk breaking the law? Nobody got the guts to answer? or too lazy to think?</div>
