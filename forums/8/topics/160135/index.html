            <div class='col-md body'>To get rid of drugs - hang the smuggler. What else could be simpler?<br><br>Take the case of Nguyen Tuong Van, everyone in Australia is so worked up because Singapore is about to hang him. This Austrailian Vietnamese was forced by the triads to smuggle drugs to help his twin brother who is in debt.<br><br>If he is a Singaporean nobody would have cared, time is just too precious to fight for a criminal, Singaporeans has many other more important things to do like shopping, tours and karaoke.<br><br>Something is really wrong with Australians, why bother with Singapore hanging one of their citizens, they have 20 million people more than us. They should understand Singapore is helping them to get rid of one of their criminals - they should thank us, for their nation is now safer.<br><br>Nguyen Tuong Van will obviously endangered the lives of people by his crime, why else would a "rational country" like Singapore want to hang him? These Australians and human rights group are acting so emotionally and irrationally over this.<br><br>We singaporeans are really lucky that we have such a unique and wonderful system in place. However, not many ang moh countries appreciate the beauty behind our beloved PAP Logic.<br><br></div>

Even the politicians know very well there is close to no chance asking for a pardon.  Just look at how many australians are in trouble with the law over drug smuggling in bali now.  They're affectionately named the Bali Nine.  They make an appearance in every channel's news telecast every single night without fail. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  If singapore is going to pardon every drug trafficker's fate just because their loved ones ask for it, then what the hell is the singapore law in place for?  Go ahead and smuggle in, I'll just ask for a pardon, it worked for them, it should work for you too, go right ahead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

She suffers intensely.<br><br>"She's an intensely loving mother. She looks like her heart is breaking."<br><br>Nguyen's lawyers believe the execution, if it goes ahead, will not take place for several weeks. Executions are usually carried out at 6am on Fridays.<br><br>In other developments:<br><br>Melbourne lawyer Lex Lasry, QC, confirmed that he would meet the Singapore high commissioner, Joseph Koh, in Canberra at 3.30pm tomorrow to plead Nguyen's case. Mr Koh said last week Singapore would not back down on plans to execute Nguyen. Mr Lasry also hopes to meet Prime Minister John Howard and Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer to discuss the case.<br><br>Students from secondary schools, community groups and religious leaders will light 3000 candles today for Nguyen and his family in Brisbane.<br><br>Nguyen, 25, a sales executive from Glen Waverley, has been on death row since March last year when given a mandatory death sentence after being caught carrying 396.2g of heroin.<br><br>Nguyen, who had no previous criminal convictions, had been acting as a drug mule to help pay off his twin brother Khoa's legal debts after being pressured by loan sharks.<br><br>Khoa, a convicted heroin trafficker, is living in Western Australia and has not been to visit his brother since his arrest in Singapore.<br><br>A prayer service will be held at St Patrick's Cathedral at 2.30pm next Sunday to pray that Nguyen's life be spared.</div>
