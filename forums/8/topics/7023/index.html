            <div class='col-md body'>What is the reason behind digesting all the erotic and sexual images? Satisfying one's visual needs becos guys are stimulated visually? Needs...everyone has them. I thought pornorgraphy mags in Singapore is illegal? If all the guys were have to have sexual needs and needs to release and don't opt for the 'civlised'way of releasing themselves(masturbation) but to rape an innocent gal at sight, is it justifiable?<br><br>I am not tagetting the fact that looking for pornography is a bad thing. It is a form of sex education in a sense as well. Knowing for the very fact that there is no sex education in Singapore, the curiousity of sex anatomy is thus raise to a question os curiosity. As men, some can control their needs and understand the values of doing the right thing. Some just do what they think but not thinking of the consequences<br><br>I for one have stumbled across a few porno sites before and so what if I am a gal? I browse it thru and I dun see the point of continuing further..Now now, if I dun get in, how would I know I would be disgusted?<br><br>Are guys disturbed if gals visits porno sites to ogle at guys anatonomy and sexy part of their bod?<br><br>If my the other half were to look at it, as liberal as the country I am born, I am still conservative. But instead of roaring at him. maybe I will just tell him that I dun like it and hope that they will be no next time. Give a chance to respect u and u can learn to respect him.

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh please, don't give me that line about porn being good because it teaches you about sex. I've been exposed (in other words, I didn't deliberately go and find) porno mags and movies. Sometimes I get really disgusted, other times, I get a good laugh. In both cases, the same reason applies- porn is largely catered to the male market, the stuff they show just don't appeal to women.<br><br>Porn treats women as OBJECTS to use and abuse. It makes stupid assumptions that women are gratified by the sight of huge penises when this ONLY serves to pump up guys' inflated egos.<br><br>If men were to learn the same attitudes from these mags, they aren't going to have good relationships with their partners. Worse still, they could be under delusions of what women enjoy and force/coerce/taunt them into what they don't want to do.<br><br>BTW, I read somewhere that the correlation between porn and rape is higher than the correlation between smoking and cancer. I can guess why- the ultimate end to that fantasy is tha act itself. The more you see, the more you want because you have not been satisfied. Thus I really question whether porn is a civilised way to release themselves.<br><br>Trinity, this is not meant to be an attack on you. I just cannot see any benefits to porn.<br><br>I think I will be very jealous if I know my bf desires somebody sexually even though he has me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bleu<br>I have never said that it is beneficial. It fact, I dun understand the whole rationality of spending money to buy porn mags anyway. Be it Japanese and whatever...and yes it is a humiliation to woman but guys do not see it this way. To them,it is a form of trade. They pay for the mags and they get the visual pleasure. But have you wondered why porn in Japan is so popular? There is a cause for demand, but the funny thing is the rape cases in Japan are correlated to be lesser compared to India which pornography is illegal, and their rape cases are so high?<br><br>You have the right to be angry but just dun get hysterical with your bf.

            <div class='col-md body'>Trinity, it's not me lah! It's my friend who argued with her boyfriend. Is it a non-issue? I'm trying to find out myself.<br><br>What is popular is not necessarily good. I think porn is not as harmless as "trade"- an exchange between willing purveyor and buyer. It has sociological impact through the perceptions it shapes. In fact, the very word "trade" connotes an object- women- to be sold. Sometimes I also wonder if women are being forced into porn. But that's disgressing from the topic I suppose.<br><br>I'm not sure whether Japan is a typical case. Japan has strong conformist pressure. Role, status and community are very important there. Any deviance like rape would cause a person to be outcast, and that's an unthinkable punishment for them. Perhaps that's why they are less likely to commit such crimes even though porn is more freely available?<br><br>BTW, there are two Es in my name. I'm female.<br><br>CyberAhmad, if a guy does not respect his girlfriend and her wishes, a porn mag would probably not discourage him from rape. Your nick is funcky. Did you get ut from McLuhan and all is talk about global village?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess there is always 2 side to a coin.  Freedom comes with maturity and needs to be earn.  It is just like a kid who plays with knife and a adult who uses a knife.  Both situation indicate a maturity to handle it.<br>Coming back to the real topic; Pornography can be both harmful and yet harmless.  In todays' society, coming from a oriental culture, we are far more conservative than the westerns.  If out to proper use, it can be appreciated but yet misuse, can be trouble.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bleue:  you said<br>"Porn treats women as OBJECTS to use and abuse. It makes stupid assumptions that women are gratified by the sight of huge penises when this ONLY serves to pump up guys' inflated egos."<br><br>i think sight of such huge penises may deflate ego as opposed to inflating it.  How many men are there, especially here, who are built like a horse?<br><br>there are many kinds of porn, those that involve humiliation and kids are not portraying good images of the subjects but what about lesser porn?  If guys can enjoy it because it's visually stimulating, why can't we?<br><br>and speaking of bad image, the women in porn industry are actually stronger than the males.  They decide who the male actors are going to be and the actresses got paid much higher, too.<br><br>------------------<br>The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are<br>always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.<br>--Bertrand  Russell</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup,i read an article about that and it seems that the girls call the shots in the porn industry as let's face it,the porn industry mostly caters to guys and therefore the girls who do such work are treated as so called 'stars' as they are the people that guys pay $$ to see,I agree with Ben that porn is just like a tool and how good or bad it is depends on its usage and who is the person using it,hehee  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maya Jade, Moose,<br><br>as in most cases, only the cream of the crop get to dictate terms and get high pay. That would account for like 5 to 10 percent of the actresses? Most of them just plod along. Same thing applies to high class hookers and those at Desker road (whom I'm told by a friend doing a socio project, earn like $20-$30 for each session).<br><br>Turtle is right. We are digressing from the topic. We're not here to discuss the pros and cons of porno. I suppose what I was looking for is a gut instinct on whether it would be considered a betrayal of the relationship, trust etc. Thanks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As of my view to this is that as long as the person knows what he is doing is good enough. If you are a teenager you would be eager to know everything regardless good/bad. that's where ppl make mistakes. It'd not their fault. As they grow and attain maturity they would realise the facts of everything.</div>
