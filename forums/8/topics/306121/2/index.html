              <p>Nothing to be jealous. Engineering field market rate is around this range. ;-). But i say if you have engineering degree, its better to work for DSTA, you can command a pay very close to 3K. Of cz, i don't think curryman can make it there in DSTA. Haha</p>

              <p>Because i cannot stand the deliberate tone of curryman i.e. he seems to start this thread to show off that he is good; he merely wanted to prove that he getting 2.7K is reflective of what FTs(on SG government scholarships) can command. He is also implying that given his slack results, he already can command 2.7K. If he worked harder, he can surpass and command a higher pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For God sake, he already knows he is getting the market rate salary for engineering. (2.7K is comparable to what Keppel Land offers). He just want to taunt us and seek pleasure in us expressing our envy for his salary. &lt;Yawn&gt;.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like i say, given he did not serve NS, he shd be pretty darn YOUNG and immature. So, he shd have kept his mouth shut.</p>

              <p><br>Oh Curryman is indeed Malaysian. Im saying that he is a Malaysian Asean Scholar in SG, thats why employer is willing to pay him that amount. If he is just an ordinary Malaysian who completed his degree in M'sia, he probably. will only get peanuts. So, there is nothing proud about Curryman ;-)</p>

              <p>Nothing to be jealous. Engineering field market rate is around this range. ;-). But i say if you have engineering degree, its better to work for DSTA, you can command a pay very close to 3K. Of cz, i don't think curryman can make it there in DSTA. Haha</p>

              Yeah my reply was fierce because i cannot stand the deliberate tone
              of curryman i.e. he seems to start this thread to show off that he
              is good; he merely wanted to prove that he getting 2.7K is
              reflective of what FTs(on SG government scholarships) can command.
              He is also implying that given his slack results, he already can
              command 2.7K. If he worked harder, he can surpass and command a
              higher pay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For God sake, he already knows he is getting the market rate
              salary for engineering. (2.7K is comparable to what Keppel Land
              offers). He just want to taunt us and seek pleasure in us
              expressing our envy for his salary. &lt;Yawn&gt;.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like i say, given he did not serve NS, he shd be pretty darn
              YOUNG and immature. So, he shd have kept his mouth shut.</p>
