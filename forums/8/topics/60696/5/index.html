When everything is rosy and nice, anything that tries to break those nice feelings up seemed to be nasty. It actually shows only one thing and that is what is most important to the heart. For where their heart is, there their treasure will be also.<br><br>However as much as such relationship are not advisable, it does not mean that it's not impossible. As much as there are believers who backslide, the opposite also happens when the other partner becomes a Christian. To prevent further heart break, it is important to teach Christian to love God first with all their heart. If they are living in faith, they will do the right thing.<br><br>"Not my will, but thine be done"<br></div>

You want answers you must get it from the horses' mouth. No one can answer you if the question that you ask is not directed at the person, not even ppl from CHC.<br><br>Go look for HYS and the husband. Not impossible to look for them. Make an appointment. If they don't want to see you, maybe then you can assume they can't answer your question.<br><br>No point going about explaining all the "rebukes" and arguments. Oh...by the way, bring a recorder along and tape their answer so that no one can accuse you of misrepresenting them.<br><br>God Bless</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Sorry, I've been away...<br>joeljuls is very correct, go straight to the horses' mouth. Unfortunately, in a situation such as this, a public act begs a public explanation. Most of the answers were already given by Ms and Rev Kong, either through the spokespeople or by an interview with the press. There questions, herein, are not for Mr and Mrs Kong, the questions are for CHC members, themselves, must think deep and see if my questions are valid. For example, how comfortable are they with honorofic titles and who in their midst hold such titles. Or how do they feel about the adulation of an individual by placing such an individual in the church general website. Or how do they think the Biblical teaching about decent dressing mean to them.<br>My intention is two-fold, first of which is as stated above: how do CHC members react in face of the Biblical quotations. the second, is to allow non-Christians to understand, beyond, the press reports, the teachings of Scripture.<br>It is entirely possible that all CHC members have no issue with the verses I've quoted. If this is to be the case, then perhaps,<br>1. CHC members can now go to church with skimpy attires without fear of rebuke by their church elders seeing that their leadership has now redefined the term "decency and proprietary".<br>2. If anyone works hard enough in church, they can be called Pastors in no time, no formal training is necessary. Also preaching is not required, one may also be an Usher Pastor, Lightings Pastor, Counselling Pastor. This is in line with the trend that although in the Bible, there is no such thing as Music Pastor, CHC can choose to confer any titles they wish.<br>3. Any prominent business people can apply to have a link in the church website, seeing that any business can also be a testimony to the Lord. Why stop at having a HYS link?<br><br></div>
