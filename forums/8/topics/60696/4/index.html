One, the clergy: people who are the spiritual leaders, who had gone through a recognised course in spiritual matters, leading to, eg, doctor in divinity. Such an individual will be holding pastoral positions and may hold the title of Reverend. The second, the laity, non-theologically trained leaders who holds administrative or executive positions with the church. eg, music director.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> It is not really about splitting hairs on titles. It's about the credentials of such titles. For example, if I was sick and needed a doctor. I will assume that the person who runs the nearby clinic is medically trained. His credentials are for all to see when they pass by his clinic. If I am spiritual unwell, and go to a pastor for counselling, I will assume that this pastor is theologically trained and hence not one who was conferred the title through the whims and wishes of the church concern. It is clear in through the Scripture that it is God who gives such clergical titles:<br>Ephesians 4:11<br>It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> As I last check, no record company should be giving the title of "yin-yue mu-shi" to anyone, as claimed by HYS in the early newspaper report.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by love-psychedelico</div><div class="quote_body">hmmm.... juz wondering are u "helping" or "reminding" God to judge her???? maybe God is too old &amp; need reminder huh?? hmmm... wat's the intention of this forum abt??? creating disunity among christians in this nation????<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I am in no position to remind God to judge HYS.

You're misinterpreting what people are saying just like how you're misinterpreting the bible. No one is sowing hatred, disunity or anti-Christ sentiments here! I really don't know where you're getting that from! This is an open discussion about HYS and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span> misuse of religion/authority in the pursue of her career. This is not a discussion about God!<br><br><blockquote><strong>you guys can say all you want. my focus is on God and if you're a<br>believer, do likewise and think abt all the time you can spend more wisely on other things than to blar over here.</strong></blockquote>I understand where you're coming from. You just want to show your support for your fellow churchmate and somehow, being blind and deaf to criticism seems to work for you. I don't know if you come from a mission school but when you don't do well in school and your teacher writes in your report book 'Can pay more attention in class'...is she showing disrespect to God for not praising His child? Praise and criticism is part and parcel of life. If you do well, people will naturally agree with you and praise you. If you're at fault, then you should accept the criticisms and learn from your mistakes...not insist on carrying on the mistake and justifying it. People judge all the time-- I'm not saying it's right, but it's human. If you can learn from it and become a better person, why not?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>if you think HYS will stop in anyway, then it is not going to happen..</strong></blockquote>Well, then let's pray she becomes a better person through this. Most importantly if she intends to remain as a popstar, let's pray she becomes a better singer and gain the credibility she claims.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>check all your heart....the condition of your heart is not right and certainly there is a thin line between good and evil in the end times.<br></strong></blockquote>Likewise to you.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>still pst sun is a pst and has been appointed by God to be one. you've openly challenged one of God's servant in this manner...<br></strong></blockquote>Sigh...now she's a pastor again? My, so easy to become pastor? From my knowledge it takes years of studies to become a pastor, but she seems to uptake and offtake her duties with the snap of her fingers...<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>if you're out to sow discord among the Christian faith in singapore, let it be known that my God will fight this battle for us.  i for one believe that no weapon formed will be against us for God will be for us.</strong></blockquote>You got that right! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>i will endeavour to grow my church stronger and bigger till His kingdom come. let it be known that God is faithful if we're faithful to His calling.<br></strong></blockquote>If you do it the right way, AMEN!</div>

Repentence should be between you and God.

If a lay-person takes on spiritual responsibility within a church, the structure like CHC can call this individual a pastor, regardless on whether this individual has done any theological study. However if a person carries the title of Reverend (in which case, HYS has one), the pastor title is more or less cast in stone. Problem here, as I'd mentioned previously, is the origin of her theological background. Nowhere in the CHC websites mentions her credentials. Rev Kong has a long list, much like a CV in his personal page. HYS? ZELO, NADA, ZILCH!</div>

If Ms Ho doesn't preach, that obviously disproves the point of her being ordained by God for being a mouthpiece cos if she was, she'd be spreading His word now according to His will. And if she didn't go for any theological studies either which seems pretty apparent from the lack of her credentials, then what's she doing with the Pastor tag in the first place?<br><br>As for the matter about the dress, nobody can force you to wear what you don't want to wear.
