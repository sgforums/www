I'm not sure if you're a CHC member but the way you talk is quite blesphemous...like why is 'God Bless You' considered using God's name in vain? 'God rebukes you' is definitely using God's name in vain coz' who are you to speak for God!? I'm sure at some time or other, you've lied to someone...should the pastor say to you 'Orr God rebukes you!' or maybe when you were a kid, you stole a candy and your mother goes 'God Rebukes You!' Is this right? Nooo...rather you ask for God's forgiveness!<br><br>I knew 2 CHC members and the way they used the bible out of context was rather strange...like during exam time, they will send prayer messages out asking God to give them A++ or pray 'God will definitely get us on the Dean's list coz' we are His children'....these are all wrong ways of asking...you don't ever tell God to give you what you want! You ask God to give you what He wants! That's why I'm rather skeptical about CHC's teachings coz' these 2 people are very active members in the church!<br><br>Anyway, religion aside...people are not criticising HYS so much because she's a Christian so you don't have to keep quoting the bible. Michael W. Smith is a well-known gospel singer. He even had a couple of songs on the Bilboard Charts! But no one criticises him...why? Coz' he sings well and has the good songs to match it! That's why everyone feels that he deserves it! In HYS' case, no one knows her songs, no one knows her voice, no one knows her face(before the dress incident)..yet she can suddenly become the top selling artiste (even winning Jay Chow!) and suddenly claim that she's gonna be a lead actress in some Hollywood blockbuster...people are skeptical about her claim to success...people do not feel that it is done through the appropriate channels, hence the criticism! Think Juno Mak in the recent Universal HK case...</div>

She is singing and selling albums, but it doesn't mean she is doing us proud either. Does the fact tat she is local means she cannot be discussed and disliked, and all singaporean must suppoort her ?

Within the Christian circle, there are those who supports her, mostly people from CHC and others who don't, Christians from other churches and former CHC members.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> It is interesting to note that existing CHC members have nothing by adulation for CHC. If I may post a couple of questions to any CHC members who may be following this thread:<br><br>1. How do you feel about having a link in your church home page to a secular site where one can download wallpaper and view snippets of a church member (who may or may not be a pastor)?<br>2. Seeing that HYS holds at least 3 major appointments within the church, how or what is she paid?<br>3. In relation to question 2, above, shouldn't she or the church decide to remove HYS from the various heavy responsibility that she is purported to be holding, now that she is having a singing career?<br>4. If she is deemed to have an honorific title of Pastor, are the other "pastors" in the leadership of the church, honorific too?<br>5. Is her title of "Reverend" honorific too? If it is, then it is a great insult to the number of Christian leaders who had put in many years of studies to attain this status. If it is not, then she will be, by default a pastor.<br>6. Do you know your scripture enough to know when a error is committed? Or are you relying on your church leaders to intepret the Word for you, giving you any excuses that they may think out to justify their cause.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> To those who think that HYS bashing is becoming a long drawn, useless ramble, I hope you all understand that it is not about the individual, it is about the challenge of bring out truth from an organisation that is attempting to justify their actions through inept excuses.
