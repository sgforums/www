It's always better to find a spouse who have the same spiritual beliefs so that they will "move" in the same direction. In context of the bible verse where this concept is taken from, it was warning the believes not to mingle with people who do not follow God and thus causing the believer to stumble. </div></blockquote>I think more often than not, the christian spouse is the picky one. I think many non-christians do not mind going to church and attend a service, after all if they're tolerant of other religions. But ask a christian accompany the spouse go temple pray pray, the christian will refuse this refuse that, say cannot pray to idol, not good to hold joss stick, not good to donate to another religion etc. Then at home the christian will be evangelist and try to convert the spouse. Then the "threat" that the spouse will go hell if not a christian pop out .. blah blah And if I'm not wrong, Catholics "require" that the non-christian spouse be converted before the marriage right?</div>

Back to reality, the fact that you're not wrong doesn't make you right either. Most people do not have the necessary theological background to make the judgement. More often than not, people just don't bother to find out more about the opposing camp of thought.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok I'm here to leave my 2 cents worth.<br>First of all,I must clarify that I am a Christian, not a staunch Christian, but I am a Christian. And although I'm not from CHC, I have nothing against them. Secondly, I have nothing against pastors, 1 of my best friends married a pastor in US...And like many people, I do not see the big deal about the dress matter...<br><br>I'm an avid music lover, I tune in to almost all channels of radio all day and visit record stores on a daily basis. From a music-listener's point of view, Ho Yeow Sun's albums should not be selling as well as it allegedly does! I seriously cannot remember any 1 of her songs! It's not that I'm bias or what....like say, I don't like 5566 but I know certain songs are sung by them...I may not be a fan of Alan Tam or Gigi Leung, but at least I can name some of his songs....and so on. Of course you may argue that these songs are very much requested on radio or something like that but if HYS cds are selling like hot cakes and she's the best selling artiste in the region, does that not mean her songs are so wonderfully fantastic and that everyone wants to request her songs on the radio?<br><br>Secondly, her voice is really mediocre! She sounds exactly like the girl next to me in church every week-- and I do stand next to a different girl every week! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> It's ridiculous to indicate that her vocals are so powerful that people will just sit up and pay attention. Everyone knows you have to have a unique voice (esp if You're Singaporean) to make it in the music scene :think: Sun Yanzi, Ah Du...<br><br>Thirdly, I have seen her church members(I may be wrong) in action during the period of the last album. I was in Tower Records and you see a bunch of (very obviously church-goers)--stone eyed, enter the store and walk straight to her cds and each of them took up like 10 copies and brought straight to the counter. The only reason I noticed was coz' their actions were so weird.<br><br>Lastly, the Straits Times article with her pastor hubby was very very disappointing! I was hoping for a good answer to everyone's queries but as a pastor, I think he did a very bad job of defending his stance. I would have to say that from the way he answered, I can imagine how he can psycho church members into buying the cds without 'forcing' them to. If anyone has the article,  you can see that the pastor does not answer any of the questions directly but goes around it. I guess it's what you call da fei suo wen.<br><br>Also, if you make a search on 'Ho Yeow Sun' on google or yahoo, you will find ABSOLUTELY NO fanpages on her. Pls don't say that's coz she's not an idol singler. Even old foggie singers like Cai Qin, Su Rui have fan pages...I don't really understand why a top selling artiste do not have the fans who want to dedicate a page to her....think about it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nachons:</div><div class="quote_body">ok I'm here to leave my 2 cents worth.<br>First of all,I must clarify that I am a Christian, not a staunch Christian, but I am a Christian. And although I'm not from CHC, I have nothing against them. Secondly, I have nothing against pastors, 1 of my best friends married a pastor in US...And like many people, I do not see the big deal about the dress matter...<br><br>I'm an avid music lover, I tune in to almost all channels of radio all day and visit record stores on a daily basis. From a music-listener's point of view, Ho Yeow Sun's albums should not be selling as well as it allegedly does! I seriously cannot remember any 1 of her songs! It's not that I'm bias or what....like say, I don't like 5566 but I know certain songs are sung by them...I may not be a fan of Alan Tam or Gigi Leung, but at least I can name some of his songs....and so on. Of course you may argue that these songs are very much requested on radio or something like that but if HYS cds are selling like hot cakes and she's the best selling artiste in the region, does that not mean her songs are so wonderfully fantastic and that everyone wants to request her songs on the radio?<br><br>Secondly, her voice is really mediocre! She sounds exactly like the girl next to me in church every week-- and I do stand next to a different girl every week! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> It's ridiculous to indicate that her vocals are so powerful that people will just sit up and pay attention. Everyone knows you have to have a unique voice (esp if You're Singaporean) to make it in the music scene :think: Sun Yanzi, Ah Du...<br><br>Thirdly, I have seen her church members(I may be wrong) in action during the period of the last album. I was in Tower Records and you see a bunch of (very obviously church-goers)--stone eyed, enter the store and walk straight to her cds and each of them took up like 10 copies and brought straight to the counter. The only reason I noticed was coz' their actions were so weird.<br><br>Lastly, the Straits Times article with her pastor hubby was very very disappointing! I was hoping for a good answer to everyone's queries but as a pastor, I think he did a very bad job of defending his stance. I would have to say that from the way he answered, I can imagine how he can psycho church members into buying the cds without 'forcing' them to. If anyone has the article,  you can see that the pastor does not answer any of the questions directly but goes around it. I guess it's what you call da fei suo wen.<br><br>Also, if you make a search on 'Ho Yeow Sun' on google or yahoo, you will find ABSOLUTELY NO fanpages on her. Pls don't say that's coz she's not an idol singler. Even old foggie singers like Cai Qin, Su Rui have fan pages...I don't really understand why a top selling artiste do not have the fans who want to dedicate a page to her....think about it.<br><br></div></blockquote>I agree with wat u say totally!
