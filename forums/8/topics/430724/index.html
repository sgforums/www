              <p>Our country has gone from a small fishing village to a 1st-world country in less than 50 years, this fact has always amazed me. Our people at the very least have basic education and generally self-sufficient. One can walk alone at night without fear of being shot/mugged. I have friends in other countries who constantly worries about their safety as soon as night falls, hearing gunshots/screams in the neighborhood. Our recent election in Singapore is still considered "polite" as in nobody resorts to killing/kidnapping. The election has not even started in Thailand but some opposition member has already been shot in the head and there's more killing to come I guess.</p>
              <p>Now, the PM has listened to the people's concern and had a major cabinet revamp. This really shows his sincere intention to understand the people. No government is perfect, in fact, nothing is perfect. Our leaders are trying all they can to ensure Singapore march on towards a better future. What we citizens can do is to give back to this country by taking responsibility and doing our part. This is the reason why the song "Home" by Kit Chan always touches my heart.</p>

              The Principle of Similarity
              The principle of similarity, also known as the â€œassociation of ideas,â€� which falls under the category of â€œsympathetic magic,â€� is the thought that if a certain result follows a certain action, then that action must be responsible for the result. Therefore, if one is to perform this action again, the same result can again be expected. One classic example of this mode of thought is that of the rooster and the sunrise. When a rooster crows, it is a response to the rising of the sun. Based on sympathetic magic, one might interpret these series of events differently. The law of similarity would suggest that since the sunrise follows the crowing of the rooster, the rooster must have caused the sun to rise.[11] Causality is inferred where it should not have been. Therefore, a practitioner might believe that if he is able to cause the rooster to crow, he will be able to control the timing of the sunrise in Singapore...is it?

              <p>Eh, hello <strong>redwhite-s'pore</strong>. It's nice to see you again. After being thrashed here, nice to know you also making a new start.</p>
              <p>If his government is so good, I wonder why he needs to reshuffle his cabinet. MM Lee and SM Goh stepped down also. Is Singapore doomed now? When they pass away, are we doomed?</p>

              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">As a young man in the 80s, I had very little interest in politics.</span></span></strong></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I had experienced the Singapore economic miracle first hand. I stayed in a kampong without paved streets, without street lights at night and without toilets with flushing systems. While the PAP govt was in charge, the streets became paved and lighted.</div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The toilets were later upgraded to have a flushing system. Consumer goods such as TVs, radios, fans and refrigerators began to appear in homes as incomes rose. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You don't think too much about politics when you can see your life improving year after year. I grew up not knowing the difference between a socialist and a Marxist. </span></span></strong><br><br>For the many young Singaporeans of today,  their political awakening came in the past decade when the Internet and social media began playing a bigger role in politics and the great economic miracle ended without any clear vision by the PAP on how the country should progress.</div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Years of fumbling along followed with only one clear goal to grow the GDP by any means possible - expanding the foreign influx, casinos, tax haven for the rich and so on. The end result of rising income gap, rising cost of living and deteriorating quality of life woke many people up and they become interested in politics and political alternatives.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">My own political awakening came in 1987 when a group of young men and women were arrested and detained without trial.</span></span></strong> <strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I had great difficulty believing the official story presented to me that these people were out to overthrow the Singapore govt by force and they were part of a Marxist Conspiracy.</span></strong></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span></strong></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For many Singaporeans, it was hard to believe how a small group of unarmed men and women can take on and defeat the Singapore Police Force and the SAF which was armed with billions worth of equipment.</span> It didn't matter whether there was proof or no proof.</span></strong></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">It didn't matter whether ordinary citizens believed what they were told. It didn't matter what international human rights organisations or foreign govt concerned about human rights said. They were locked up and abused and there was nothing anyone could do to help them. The event ignited the fear in many people of the authoritarian govt that will go after people for doing what they believe is right for the country to preserve its own dominant power.<br><br>The WP winning Aljunied is a major political milestone in 2011. The other great milestone of equal importance is the demise of fear. 24 years after her unjust detention, former detainee, Teo Soh Lung, contested in Yuhua SMC.</div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Ordinary Singaporeans came out in full force to attend rallies and capable people stepped forward to say and do what they believe is right and good for this country.</div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The demise of fear ushers in a period of hope and change for Singapore.<br></span></span></strong>-----------<br><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: large;">Demise of fear</span> <br></strong><br><br>by Teo Soh Lung on Monday, May 16, 2011 at 3:48am </div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br>The recent retirement of MM Lee Kuan Yew and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong from the cabinet was welcome news to many Singaporeans. </div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br>Both men would like to be remembered as having brought Singapore to what it is today. Certainly we will remember them as having contributed to the economic success of Singapore. History will no doubt remember the good deeds of the two men. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">But history will also slowly but surely reveal the dark deeds of the two men. </span></span></strong></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br>There was a time when MM Lee as the first prime minister of Singapore could have achieved unparalleled greatness in this region if only he had been kind to his friends who helped propel him to fame. I am thinking of the greats of Lim Chin Siong, Dr Lim Hock Siew, Dr Poh Soo Kai and Loh Miaw Ping, who together with so many others helped him win his first general election in 1959 and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">unselfishly let him assume the office of prime minister.</span></span></strong></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What he did to them in 1963 and to hundreds if not thousands more in the years that followed was unforgiveable. We know today that they were <span style="color: #ff0000;">locked away under the Internal Security Act for decades and silenced for more than half a century. </span></span></strong></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong who was First Deputy Prime Minister in 1987 <span style="color: #ff0000;">learnt to be ruthless from MM Lee when he agreed to arrest and detain 22 innocent people that year.</span></span></strong></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">For three decades thereafter, the PAP appeared to be invincible. GE 2011 changed all that. In a matter of days, the prime minister and other ministers came out to apologise for their mistakes. It took many by surprise. Have leopards changed their spots? </div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br>I don’t know. All I know is that the young have taken control of Singapore and are determined to put a stop to the arrogance of the PAP.</div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The young and articulate opposition candidates came out in full force. They campaigned without fear.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> The people responded and suddenly, fear disappeared and they regained their voices.</span></span></strong> Both the people and the candidates realised in the course of just nine days that they have the power to change Singapore. </div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br>For me, GE 2011 is the most important GE after <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">1984 when two opposition members, namely J B Jeyaretnam and Chiam See Tong were elected into parliament.</span></span></strong></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">With six members of the Workers’ Party in parliament this year, we, the people of Singapore can have the confidence to feel free once again and to look forward to a PAP government that will be more accountable to us in the next five years.</div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">We can be sure that if they do not listen to us, the next GE will see more losses for the PAP. </div>
              <div style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">As for the passing of MM Lee and Senior Minister Goh, they will soon be forgotten except in the pages of our history book. </span></span></strong></div>
