            <div class='col-md body'>I ever encoutered once. A guy bought some stuff and carrying it in a plastic bag. very bulky and heavy. and he didnt seem to want to put the bag on the floor of the mrt and carry it like as though he very strong. and i was standing beside him and his damn ass bag kept hitting my leg all the way from Orchard MRT to Yio Chu Kang and he got off at YCK the same as me and i made a complain at the control station about his idiotic behavoir. Really a pain in the ass.<br><br>I also encounter 2 young punks trying to steal my wallet but luckily for the window i saw the relfection and caught them red handed. Singaporeans but they were talking like ang mohs.. stupid yellow bananas. Luckily the train was at raffles place. underground den the windown can see the reflection if not my wallet would have been pickpocketed away by 2 stupid yellow bananas. to tink they still could joke around after i turned around and fu*ked them upside down.<br><br>Once more. i encountered a drunk person on the mrt at around Admiratly and he bloody vomitted on the train. omg. that was the worst. the whole cabin stinked! hmm. thats a pretty good way to get seats to come to think of it. lols.<br><br>i cant stand malays and indians teenagers go into the train, then start blasting music from their handphones. most of the times will be malay or indian songs. wont ever be techno. lol. how i wish it was techno. their music irritates me. if i were a malay and they blast a malay song, of coz i wouldnt mind! but HEY LOOK we're all chinese HERE HELLOO?!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really find anything "disturbing" or "annoying".<br>It is not the person fault that he has got BO. It is not the fault that we Singaporeans are kiasu. If the guys want to spread their legs wide open, they are probably a girl (you know what I mean).<br><br>Teens sitting around the entrance talking loudly? Ok to me, as long as they are not at the opening of the entrance. But I feel like killing them sometimes lah.
