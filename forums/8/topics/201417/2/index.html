            <div class='col-md body'>It's annoying that I hv encountered ppl who..apparently got a new phone OR they simply had nothing better else to do... and start playing their ringtones aloud from the first one till the last one.<br><br>Of cos I can shud my ears while listening to iPod but it annoy sother passengers as well.<br><br>Another one is the gam cheong spiders looking for seat type. There was this incident whereby I was abt to 'take over' a seat after a passenger left hers (i was  standing near the door then)... the doors then open.. and in came a lady who shoved me to one side and I end up sitting a another passanger's lap. Cos too fast..

Imagine the poor fellas around him/her having to balance themselves just because of his/her selfish behaviour? Makes me feel like poking their backs with something sharp. And not to mention disgusting if they sweat.<br><br>-Blasting music on their mp3 speakers. Who the f*** wants to listen to whatever is in their playlist? Not me.<br><br>-Newspaper readers who just can't master the art of folding the paper in half while reading. Sometimes its good as I will save 70-80 cents of my money but if the idiot next to me is reading Lianhe Zaobao or Tamil Murasu, thanks but no thanks.<br><br>-People at the station platform who crowd around the door when the train arrives. Nuff said.<br><br>-Kids who sit around the door. you know how irritating when people from stations like Dover want to board the train. If they want to conduct some tribal council meeting, do it somewhere else.<br><br>-Mats and minahs who just love hogging the last cabin. Annoying buggers.</div>

There was one time I was carrying my large guitar bag double strapped on my shoulders and a group of ppl and I headed to the exit to Bugis, getting ready to alight and I looked in dismay when I saw the large group of ppl blocking the exits! Dumb! These ppl are absolutely dumb! How are the rest and I gona alight easily?

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually not really their fault if they on the headphone too loud, for example rock music the druming and guitar louder than the vocals sometimes. That's why need a bit louder than those usual pop and thus sounds loud to people but if you are listening you dun feel that loud lor. If you really dun want them to disturb you, buy a MP3 player or something and listen to songs to mask out the sound.</div>
