            <div class='col-md body'>YooHoo,<br><br>From my point of view here, she may not be worth all the trouble.  All the signs says that she's no longer interested.  What i'm saying is be ready for the worst.<br><br>Look on the bright side!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  There are so many stars out in the sky, so many fishes in the sea, so many roses in the world AND out of so many there is one especially for u.  So don't miss the forest for a single tree.<br><br>I'm getting old so perhaps i kena this kind of thing "Xiong Xiong" before.  Hahahaa... if it doesn't kill u it will make u stronger.<br><br>Take care.<br><br>ps.  Also hor, i think some times its good to have some strong character/principles in life.  I like to pamper girls too but not to the extent of losing myself.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yoohoo,<br><br>The age gap between you and your gf is too big, especially when she is still so young. At 17, most won't know what committment is about, and having a boyfriend is just like for "fun fun". Personally, I think you should go for someone older to have a more fufilling relationship. Her actions have already shown that she is still not matured enough for a long-term relationship.</div>

I always see a trend in this kind of thing.  Used to think there's only one perfect tree in the whole world.  Then few years down the road when i start thinking of my "Perfect" tree, it wasn't as perfect as before.<br><br>Anyway, u're only young once.  Enjoy it, man!  Those heartaches and happy times are definitely worth it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
