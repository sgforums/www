            <div class='col-md body'>Well, since you are so painful with him, why do u still want to be with him? The reason is definitely LOVE right? if you think the love can compensate for all the hurt that he has inflicted on you, den go for it.<br><br>Juz like myself, i am suffering emotionally so badly lately. she juz don want to answer my call, for watever reason i dono. But i do believe that our love is so strong tat when she answer my call again, i will forget abt all the hurt i once suffered from.<br><br>So fight for him if you tnk love &gt; hurt<br>Give up if you think Love &lt; hurt</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know how you feel, when you love another person whole heartedly, but all you get in return is heartache...<br>It doesn't feel good, but just a piece of advise someone gave me:<br><br>Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.<br><br>When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.<br><br>The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.<br><br>It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.<br><br>Giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours. It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.<br><br>Don't go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. Go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile.<br><br>There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real!<br><br>Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.<br><br>May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy.<br><br>Always put yourself in others' shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too.<br><br>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.<br><br>Happiness lives for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.<br><br>(Its easy for me to say, but hard to follow, I also trying to understand this)</div>
