I tried not to think about it but instead, diverted my attention to what i've gained the past few days, it helped only a little. But still, i felt a bit empty and I knew I have to face the negative tots again sooner or later, the most tomoro morning. So, I called a fren to talk about it.

Doing all I can to make it happen. And thus, all these miseries. By letting go, I know I'll become empty and not necessarily happy. It's not an easy process too, which I dun think I'm up to it. I told myself that I'll hang on and fight on, letting go only when I'm near madness or till I die. Good efforts seldom go to waste,rite?<br><br>I dunno. I appreciate your kindness, really. But I dun think I want to let go.<br>sorry.<br><br>Mikegk_76:<br>I dun like changes. It's hard to adapt. What if I change into someone worse?<br>As long as there's change, it's something new and unfamiliar, what if I lose my direction? Won't I be empty again? And there's no guarantee I won't resume old form. Then wouldn't it be a waste of time?<br><br>Dunno leh.....do you always welcome change without any hesitation at all?

And the more you revise them, they might sometimes just contort. That's why I prefer a more lasting good days,which will also include more memories. Which is why I'm praying so hard for the good days to return. Dun you want it like that too? Or am I being stupid here?<br><br>Sometimes I get tired too. But I'll not give up. After coming so far, I could go further. Giving up, you would not only lose hope and what little left that you've got, but also maybe a whole load of opportunities which might be waiting in store for you. I dunno.

            <div class='col-md body'>From the book I'm reading now....<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><strong>The most loving person is the person who is Self-Centered.</strong><br><br>Now if u look at it carefully. If you cannot love Self, you cannot love another. Many people make the mistake of seeking love of Self through love for for another. Of course, they don't realise they are doing this. It is not a conscious efffect. It's what going on in the mind. Deep in the mind. In what you call the subconcious. They think, " If I can just love others, they will love me. Then I will be lovable, and I can love me."<br><br>The reverse of this is that so many people hate themselves because they feel there is not another who loves them. This is a sickness- it's when people who are truly 'lovesick' because the truth is, other people do love them, but it doesn't matter. No matter how many people profess their love for them, it is not enough.<br><br>First, they don't believe you. They think you are trying to manipulate them -- trying to get something.(How could u love them for who they truly are? No. There must be some mistake. You must want something! Now what do u want?)<br><br>They sit around trying to figure out how anyone could actually love them. So they don't believe you, and embark on a campaign to make you prove it. You have to prove that you love them. To do this, they may ask you to start altering your behavior.<br><br>Second, if they finally come to a place out how anyone could actually love tehm, they begin at once to worry about how long they can keep your love. So, in order to hold onto your love, they start altering their behavior.<br><br>Thus two people literally lose themselves in a relationship. They get into rlationship hoping to find themselves, and they lose themselves instead.<br><br>This losing of Self in a relationship is what causes most bitterness in such couplings.<br><br>Two people join together in a partnership hoping that the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts, only to find that it's less.....<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Neale Donald Walsch from<br>[Conversations with God- Book 1]</div>

Everybody knows that. Is this the reason why?<br><br>I'm beginning to think too much again this week, but I tell myself to keep a very low expectation for everybody else, try to understand others more, and give myself more valid excuses why such and such isn't happening.<br><br>And all that's left are the sweet memories which bring back the sadness too.
