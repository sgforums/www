When I've got nothing to do, or even when I have something to do, I could just sit there and stare into space, daydreaming....but my brain is really thinking about other stuffs......as long as I have a moment of peace, my mind starts wandering and I'll be thinking of a lot of things.....<br><br>I think about why this thing happen and why that doesn't happen.....I sometimes think about questions in life, think until headache.....but most of the time, I'm thinking of why a certain person does this or said that or why he/she never say this or do that.........and I end up Hu Si Luan Xiang a lot.<br><br>So, I asking for help here. Can anyone tell me how not to think so much? Please.... I think I hu si luan xiang too much and am becoming a depressed person......I want to think normal like all my frens.....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Hymen,<br>Not exactly very sure of the exact reason why you let your thoughts run wild...me didn't read all your posts closely... but anyway, like you, I think a lot... Most of my hair are turning bronze, and I expect them to turn white in the near future...<br><br>Anyway, like what Darkforce says, try not to think too much... kill brain cells...<br><br>And well, I do think a lot too, letting my imagination run wild. My imagination will turn negative from time to time...once in a while...<br><br>I like to do a lot of thinking, 'cos I like to plan... like on the bus (quite typical hor), I will plan what I want to do when I get home, etc... nothing wrong with this... it helps to make your life more systematic.<br><br>By the way, if you're still having negative thoughts and your imagination and thoughts are running out of your control, spend 10 seconds and pause... PAUSE... just use your eyes to look around you... realise what you have lost when you spend time thinking about any other things, but not appreciate the things that are around you...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hope this will help...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hymen :<br><br>regarding ur reply up there ^^ ^^<br>the reason why I did not probe further is because it just make matter worse. Think it in another perspective... imagine this person whom u really dun like... and then this irksome person come and ask u.. eh Hymen, why u buay song me arh? say leh.. why dun like me. If i am in such a situation... it will only add to the dislike of this person. A lot of times I try to assimilate into a group of people... but they have already form their own clic and it's quite hard to break inside.<br>They see me as 'outsider', although they try to be friendly and really nice, the crunch comes when they do their gp activities and never call me. i just keep quiet and pretend to feel indifferent abt it.<br><br>I wish there were no judgement between friends,for it hurts badly. Sometimes I wonder whether I'm too sensitive or are they hypocrites. Hmm... I dun wish to judge people as well. but more than often I felt they are telling me that they better off without me but just kept me in their grp because it's not so nice to kick me out.<br><br>Hymen,like u,I am one sad guy with a lot of untold stories...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>[This message has been edited by chch (edited 29 December 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shervon99 : Thanx,will it really help? I dun think I can really appreciate the things around me when my mood is fouled. Furthermore, when my mind is crammed with all the negatives thoughts, I doubt I could remind myself to pause and look around. If I knew to pause, I would be able to stop thinking too much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>chch : Have you or will you ever find a way to overcome the pain when such things happen again? It really doesn't feel good to be neglected when you so want to participate in their activities. I face such a problem now too. Well, as you would've expected, it's one of my many problems....haha.... see, I got posted to another dept and I got, automatically, excluded from their activites. I want to join in so much, but all I can do, it seems, is to watch them move on with fun,with their lives, while I'm stuck in the past.<br><br>Anyway, I'm taking Devil1976's approach here. If you wanna pour anything out,no, I'm not gonna meet you....haha....but my email is hymen20@hotmail.com .<br><br>abfackeln : Thinking too little definitely isn't good but it doesn't bring you as much emotional and mental problems as thinking too much. If you think too little, even if you have to face the music for errors you made, you won't be thinking too much about it, rite?<br><br>This week, I predicted it to be sad. Cos I think too much, as usual. But somehow, it was better than I thought. Cos I enjoy myself when I come here, to this forum. Thanx, guys.<br><br>However, the problem still exists. I still think too much. And when I force myself not to think, I break my train of thoughts or distract myself or focus on other things or whatever, I feel very uncomfortable. My heart and mind tells me that something is left dangling in my head, unsolved, unsettled. At this rate, I can't really stop myself from thinking too much but it seems that I have to face my negative thoughts full force. How??? Any solutions?<br></div>
