            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Q: Firstly, How packed is Phuture on Fridays? I know its really bad on the eve of public holidays, but what about on ladies nights? Is it bad to the extent where its really skin to skin, unmovable?</span><br><br>A: Really depends, on several occasions Phuture isn't so crowded until like 11:30pm where it starts to get difficult to move around, and usually it becomes so packed by 1:00am it is difficult to enjoy yourself and is unbearable. On ladies' nights (isn't it Mambo Jumbo?) the crowd usually intensify roughly at the same time period, though why are you at Phuture on Mambo night?<br><br>I wonder if there is other days that are ladies' night.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">On mambo nights in zouk<br>Q:Is it also packed skin to skin? I wonder how they dance then, heard they play retro music with funny moves then. </span><br><br>A: Yup. Retro Disco Music from the 80s to now. There's a whole set of silly dance moves that veterans may know. I find Mambo nights really fun, and the dance floor (from experience) have some room to actually move your arms up.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Q:Then on non-mambo nights, what kind of music does zouk play? Is it house? </span><br><br>A: House, Electronica, Techno, rarely Trance. Personally I prefer MOS for my music.<br><br>Other queries...<br><br>I don't really understand about their entrance fee, I just pay for Zouk or Phuture, they give me drink coupons, and I freely roam the club. I think it is just where your coupons can be used, that's all.<br><br>And some advices: Bring/Go with someone who is experienced, get sufficiently tipsy a little, don't get into trouble, don't drink too much until puke (trust me, it is close to the 2nd worst thing you can experience), and just DANCE.[/i]</div>
