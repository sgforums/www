            <div class='col-md body'>There was something called the Beng Lian culture in the 90s. There was also rock culture, soccer fever , games which made people come together for socialising. Not much internet. Free time was spent more often going to movies, engage in sports, picnics gatherings ect. People bring songbirds to chai at park and coffeeshops. People of all races mixed together  It was through this social culture most people became streetsmart.</div>

But they are intellectual  the elitist method which is not desirable. They tend to be immune to other's feelings, selfish and arrogant and no sense of contributing good to society.
