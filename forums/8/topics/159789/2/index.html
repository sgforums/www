So u see ppl imitating westerners culture, idealogy......and society as a whole degenerates. Then slowly it will destabilise the political powers and finally a revolution will happen to replace the old regime.<br><br>Its happened many times in the past, like the changing of dynasties...more recently the overthrowing of the Soviet Union.

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with you on this post.. Have been following what you and MR SOh has been saying..<br><br>I'm born in the early 80s.. and really am shock at the amount of "changes" these kids have these days. I think the first sign of such "images" that appear are actually in the late 80s to the early 90s.. This is where many westernize influences come in..<br><br>Media plays an important part of "growing" in a teenagers life.. How many western shows are there back in the 70s and 80s compared to the present period?? What about the "open-mindedness" in people these days? Not pointing the blame at westerners, I feel that most asians in their teens follow blindly..<br><br>Like both of you.. I am disgusted at the fact that everything you ask them.. Their reply is I don't know leh.. etc.. I feel like asking.. "Than what you know?"<br><br>Many people will say time changes and such.. I truely agree with that.. But time changes does not mean that basic values as an asian.. Regardless of race or religion should change. Their own culture and values should maintain to bring down to future generations.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by philia:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually I was referring to how girls are discriminating against the Chinese-speaking.
