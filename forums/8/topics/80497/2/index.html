But of course, like anyone else, I've heard most cases didn't work out.<br><br>Heard from an ex-officer, whom told me something quite direct and straightforward when he knew that I have a girlfriend.<br><br>"Young man, NS is a phase when your girlfriend leaves you."<br><br>How nice, and he said that when we first and last met. Just an acquaintance.<br><br>Whatever he said, do make sense. You are in camp for 5 days. You get to book out only on weekends. The first thing on your mind, is your bed. During meet-ups with your girlfriend, whatever you say, will be just about the army life. You know nothing much about her life out of Tekong. And you can't do a lot since your monthly intake is only around 350. Then conversations and relationship starts to get boring.<br><br>So efforts count a damn big part. Don't ever take things for granted. Try to fresh up the relationship in every way you can. At least, do your part.<br><br>I am entering this phase soon.

            <div class='col-md body'>rber a joke dat me n my frens crack.. recently went for bmt recourse..all my platoonmates also going to ord soon..we r looking out of our bunk when we see recruits coming in..they got 2 and half yr to serve n ironically we got 2 months left.. we r joking among ourselves saying dat.. "2 yrs ago we come in tekong n our gfs in uni are snatched away.. now (pointing to the new recruits) we r going to snatch ur gfs away when we go uni" haiz... well dat's life la...<br><br>advice is for a r/s to succeed during a ns period, it will take a lot of trust n understanding b/w the couple.. wish all NSFs good luck la.. if ur gf got snatched away during this period it juz shows dat ur gf CANNOT MAKE IT.. forget abt her n take u revenge when u ORD!

Seriously. When you're in the first few weeks of NS when you have no control at all, it's all up to the strength of your relationship and the willpower of the girl. Once you're out every weekend then it should be pretty much back to normal. After all, the girl should be happy that the guy is stuck with a bunch of guys everyday with hardly any chance to stray (if he does, then something is seriously wrong with him). What you're afraid of is the girl finding someone else...then if the girl so easily does, then she really isn't worth it.</div>
