            <div class='col-md body'>let me play devil's advocate.<br><br>a brit friend and i were exchanging views on the fairer sex of our respective nationalities. i described the average s'porean girl like this,<br><br>paraphrase:<br>"S'pore women are generally nice. They are polite, well-behaved and most have very nice hair. However, the average s'porean girl seems to be a 'group' person instead of an individual. the s'pore girl tends to retreat very often into the nest of like-company whenever in public or in strange situations. she seeks reassurance and comfort from the rest of the group and seldom ventures into socially alien territories. the ability to stand out from the crowd is rare, and if one girl does stand out, she is magnified 10 times over because of the stark disparity in behavour from the rest. as such the average s'porean girl's identity is not hers alone but one that is shared by the group and the clique. this could be due to a number of reasons that range from conservatism, insecurity, no desire for the new, to not being in the mood to fend off guys. however, she seems to have a very fixed image of what a 'proper' woman should be and behave like, and i think she is more intent on portraying this image than allowing individuality to emerge."<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the question of self esteem in Sg girls have a lot to do with our individualism, as Terence has mentioned. If you take a good look around, you'll find that most girls are pretty much similar,in terms of their appearances. Long, salon-relaxed hair, brown- tinted by salons, latest Japanese/Utilitarian fashion, with prada bag &amp; cellphone in tow. (At least that's what everyone was wearing when I left S'pore!!)<br><br>Sure, they may be smart, but they also succumb to the latest fashion trends.  Getting them to break out of the clique may be worst than public speaking to them. To be term an individualist = weird/"out" (as opposed to the "in" crowd) person &amp; may be the worst nightmare ever! Conforming is the main idea here! Most are just content with the idea of finishing school(a degree/dilpoma preferably!), find a job and settling down "happily ever after" with their boyfriends/would-be future husbands. "Why be different from others, when life is good this way &amp; all my friends are the same?" Of course, there are some who just plainly could not be bothered with what's happening around them.<br><br>I seem to be drifting off... but anyway, to sum it up, following the latest fahion trends<br>does not indicate low self-esteem or lack of confidence. Personally, I think it's more a case of "I couldn't care less abt the rest" type of attitude, with life being such a bed of roses.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The topic 'Many' sggirls have low self-esteem and not 'All'... I tend to agree more or less. Of course I don't know all of them, but that's the impression that seems to sweep the streets.<br><br>Besides fighting as Males vs. Females, hey guys and gals, haven't u seen ppl of your own sex that look like they have no clue?<br><br>Shucks, many guys and gals here are assertive and carry themselves well, and some are individualistic with style. But there are SOO many who TRY to be individualistic... heck, individualism is becoming a fashion!! That sure is ironic. Of course there are still the clueless trend puppies who follow everything, even if the stuff don't look good on them.<br><br>There are just to many wannabes out there..... sigh....<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pokemon&gt;&gt;<br><br>Well, I don't really agree about what is said about SG girls having low self-esteem. So much that I even bothered to look up the dictionary for the meaning of self-esteem.<br><br>From the Collins Cobuild, self-esteem is: If you have self-esteem, you feel that you are a good, worthwhile person, and for that reason you behave confidently.<br><br>I feel that if you say that girls who go to silly measures like eyebrow tatooing... wearing coloured contacts... enlarging their breasts.... , they are girls with low self-esteem.... then you must be referring to girls from all over. SG girls are not the only girls who do such things!!! How come Mariah Carey is not being criticised for having enlarging her breasts? Britney Spears? So celebrities have the right to go for surgery, etc... while normal girls will have low self-esteem if they do? I'll say that double standards are being practised.<br><br>Yet on the other hand... if you go according to the definition in the dictionary, then having self-esteem is about feeling worthwhile. Must we all be good-looking in order to feel worthwhile about ourselves... ?<br>Then this means that everyone is superficial and nothing else expect looks matters, yeah?<br><br>These girls do what they do because of VANITY. They want to look good. Of course, looks have a part to play in whether you are able to feel and behave confidently.... but many people are still able to carry themselves well even if they are fat, ugly or average-looking.<br><br>Everyone would want to be beautiful/ stunning. Men go for plastic surgery too, though not as commonly seen as women who do it. So are those men lacking in self-esteem? What about those men who are losing hair/ balding and go to all lengths to have hair on their head? It's seen as normal for them... but women have low self-esteem when they dye their hair?</div>

Having self-esteem is like feeling that you are worthy. And, because you think of yourself to be worthy... you are able to behave in a confident manner. I can't say that a person's look do not play a part at all (depends on the individuals..), but mianly it is about how you feel about yourself. Not how others see you or what they think of you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NiaveGirl&gt; yaay for yoU! :]<br><br>I think what Terrence quoted is true. Most Sg girls are that way. Its amazing how well they practice "mob mentality" in everything they do, from hairstyles to clothes to the way they speak...<br><br>As much as i hate it when you guys are schizo about what you want, what pisses me off even more is how women propogate this crap! The only people who care if a female can fit into a size 6 dress is another female. What Space said about "the female of the species is more deadly than the male" rings soooo true! In an age when we have progressed from not being able to elect to holding seats in parliment, we are driving ourself to an early death with this overly critical outlook of ours. Females bitch, sadly that's what we relish in. "oh look at that! she's not carrying a hello kitty bag! How unfashionable!" Do you girls think that guys actually care whether or not you can wear a size 6? Or that you have a flawless complexion? Or if your hair isn't crimped?(if he does dump him!) I doubt they are as critical of our bodies/looks as we are, well those who aren't dickheads at least! So yeah, why dwell in conformity?? Its definately a refreshing change to meet a girl who has original ideas in her head, rather than the run-of-the-mill airhead that runs rampant in this country.<br><br>But hey! who died and left the you men the paragon of individuality anyway??<br><br>[This message has been edited by MsSeuss (edited 05 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>schizo= short for schizophrenia. some psychological condition where someone has two or more diff personalities. so in this case, you guys can't decide what you want from us girls and i'm exagerrating just a little here..<br><br>conformity= to conform i.e. to behave accordingly to standards/expectations etc etc<br><br>paragon= paragon of s'thing, means u're perfect example of whatever that something is. so if you're a paragon of individuality, it means you're the perfect example of individuality...<br><br>come to think of it, delving deeper, that can be taken to be a contradiction cos there can actually be no paragon of individuality cos you can't draw boundaries for indivisualism, cos that will be conformity... hmmmm how amusing.. its quite oxymoronic in its own way. Anyway, being as ermm direct as i can, what i mean by the paragon of individuality thing is "who bloody gave you guys the right to comment on us girls, cos you're not perfect either!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MsSeuss,<br><br>I was about to start pounding out the contradiction in terms when I read 'paragon of individuality' in your earlier post but saw that you realised the contradiction in your last. Damn!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>No, you're right, we men are guilty of herd mentality and conformity as well. Many of the sins we accuse women of, we are similarly guilty of. However, I think there is a slight distinction from the severity of herd mentality between men and women. And these are the reasons why perhaps men don't suffer from it as much as women.<br><br>1. Ego - the innate need to be Alpha male. This explains why men are more willing to break out of a circle to try new and more dangerous things, i.e. walking up to a woman in a club and showering her with pallid pick-up lines.<br><br>2. Cultural/traditional baggage - like it or not, this is a patriarchal society where the onus is still on the man to shoulder the burden of responsibility. This includes providing for the family (which is increasingly shared by women), 'macho' gestures as measure of manhood, the view that women are still there for men to 'take care of' etc. As such, this cultural baggage drives men from their circle to validate himself.<br><br>3. Peer pressure - very often the acts caused by peer pressure are acts which the rest of the group are afraid themselves of doing. Peer pressure is a way of transposing the responsibility to another more unfortunate member of the group to do or try something the rest fear to do. As such, peer pressure pushes a man from the circle of conformity.<br><br>Sad but true.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 06 February 2000).]</div>
