Let him boast and taunt all he wants  , after all I am sure you are a much MUCH MUCH  better person than he is . No point in degrading yourself to get back at him - he is not worth the trouble or the time or even your reputation.<br><br>Well , gazelle , you can be rich /wealthy/well off as you said but your comments (behavioural wise) neither  reflect class nor wisdom at all.

Havent you count the number of posting your fellow loners kakis have contributed to this forum? Isnt that what you call fools that talk alot or empty vessel making noise??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
