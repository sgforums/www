Though you have to be sure of the reason(s) that you are attracted to her e.g. you fancy her because of her personality instead of the idea of being in cyberlove. 'Love conquers all' so keep an open-mind. I am in a relationship with someone whom I've chatted to for a period of time and things are pretty good between us.<br><br>Best of luck mate!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi alt99, first of all, welcome! same to me here!<br><br>Ok! to tell u the truth, IRC can be a great connection between two or more people around the world. But to me is only part of our imagination so called cyber kinda thingy.<br><br>As for your case, since u're in London now where as she is in Singapore, is kinda hard to make a good relationship going unless u 2 keep on contact each other as much as possible. But that doesn't mean it will work!<br><br>Anyway, not sure whether u have seen her b4 or not, things can be different once u're in the reality.(Agreed with ZhaoYun)Believe me, I've went thru this b4! You can't judge a person by just chatting with her online with all the words poping out. U can chat for hours! will it be the same if U chat with her face to face? Which is more important. Of coz in real life right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Lastly, you can still try your best of luck! And another thing is that, u're in London and studying right? This will cause u more burden in your life if u involve more on relationship other than your studies. You have your choice!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers!<br><br>------------------<br>Make new friends but keep the old...<br>These are sliver, those are gold!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's nothing harmful from knowing someone from irc. I knew my ex-gf from IRC and we lasted for a yr. Do meet her and it is only then that you can decide whether she is right for u. After that, it all depends on trust and communication between the both of you. I am now currently studying overseas too and in a relationship with a gal from IRC yet again. Things arent turning out well for me as a long dist relationship prooves to a little taxing because of lack of trust and etc.<br>Meet up with her. And from then on u can decide on how the relationship will progress. think about the positive and negative factors (can i trust her? will she be faithful?). communication there should not be a problem. u still have Irc icq telephone watever. Be sure of what you want and be prepared for obstacles.<br>Wish you all the best dude. take care and hope everything works out fine for you.</div>
