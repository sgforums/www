Stop posting NIS/Symantec propaganda. It installs more than 6 services which are always running, around 3 useless processes (like NOPDB, Norton Speed Disk. Why is it running when you are not de-fragging?) and 3 required processes all named cc*.exe. Worse still, opening the main Norton window is laggy as your machine is trying to run another process (NMain.exe). Therefore, Norton is a memory hog. No, this bug isn't fixed in NIS/NSW 2006. Tons of memory leaks should keep people like you happy.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Hi launtpc,<br><br>Symantec doesn't pay me anything, I'm just sharing my exeriences.<br><br>I believe what you are referring to is Norton System Works; YES, that sucks.<br><br>NIS2006 will not be a memory hog, if you have above 512Mb of RAM, I am currently running on 1.5Gb DDR RAM on a 64bit platform.<br><br>Technically, if you are up to specs, any software will run fine.<br><br>I've had no real problems with NIS all these while.<br><br>I always say nothing good or that works, comes FREE.

We donÂ’t save personal information. We donÂ’t do many other things that legitimate software companies do to enhance their marketing efforts, like use persistent Web cookies. This conservative approach is intentional because we take privacy extremely seriously.<br><br>"After being contacted by James Borck of Infoworld, we maintained an ongoing dialogue with him to discover the source of his issue. Initially, we were unable to reproduce it in our labs, until he submitted his log files. At that point, we were able to identify the bug and provided Mr. Borck with a temporary workaround. We never refuted his contention that an issue existed, although it did take some time to replicate it.<br><br>"The actual communication in dispute is a simple encrypted GET request that is checking to see if the userÂ’s security software is current. We will continue to work with Mr. Borck and anyone else who might have any concerns about this issue." Âµ</div>

Last fall, InfoWorld Senior Contributing Editor James Borck discovered ZA 6.0 was surreptitiously sending encrypted data back to four different servers, despite disabling all of the suiteÂ’s communications options. Zone Labs denied the flaw for nearly two months, then eventually chalked it up to a Â“bugÂ” in the software -- even though instructions to contact the servers were set out in the programÂ’s XML code. A company spokesmodel says a fix for the flaw will be coming soon and worried users can get around the bug by modifying their Host file settings.
