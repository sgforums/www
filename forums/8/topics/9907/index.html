            <div class='col-md body'>The sale and use of Mifepristone was recently approved by the Food Drug and Administration (FDA) in the US on September 28. With this drug - sold under the name of Mifeprex and also known as RU-486 -  abortions can be carried out without surgery. Its availability in the market - whether in a genuine form or otherwise - has also meant easier access to abortion as more general practitioners who previously do not provide abortion may do so now.<br><br>And Singapore women, say doctors interviewed, have gone to clinics asking for the drug.<br><br>"Most of them are in their early 20s and early 30s, fairly educated and informed. They have probably read about RU-486 from the web or from women's magazines.<br>"All of them want it for social abortions, and not for therapeutic indications such as foetal deformities," said a gynaecologist of seven years' experience. He spoke on condition of anonymity.<br><br>Although Mifepristone is known to be useful for the treatment of benign conditions such as fibroids, and in the softening the cervix after a woman suffers a miscarriage, there has been no reported effort by the medical community here to ask the government to bring in the drug.<br><br>As to why, the gynaecologist said: "Perhaps if GPs can prescribe Mifepristone, there is a concern that there may be an increase of abortions. Then, there will be a hard time keeping track of the statistics and to encourage people to have more children."<br><br>Mifepristone is currently only available in countries such as France, Britain, Sweden, China and more recently in the US.<br><br>Though it is not approved for use in Singapore, it is nevertheless available on the Internet. Couple with the fact that Singapore women are already asking for the drug at gynaecological clinics, the medical, practical, moral and political implications of the abortion drug may already be knocking on our doors.<br><br>In a reply to questions from HealthAnswers, Ms Claire Chiang, Nominated Member of Parliament, said this raises the question of what one should do when an unapproved but desired drug is available on the Internet.<br><br>Mifepristone And A Pro-Choice Policy<br>In Singapore, the number of abortions hovers about 16,000 a year. In a report by The Straits Times, more than 2,000 teenage girls, some as young as 13, had abortions last year.<br><br>When asked for her views on how Mifepristone would be viewed in an Asian context, Ms Chiang told HealthAnswers that Mifepristone, has sparked renewed interest in the question of whether the Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) Act in Singapore should be amended.<br><br>Ms Chiang was recently in the spotlight for asking in Parliament if the Termination of Pregnancy (TOP) Act could be amended so that youths aged 13 to 21 required parental consent for an abortion.<br><br>Mr Lim Hng Kiang, the Minister of Health, said then in a written reply: "It has been observed that pregnant girls are often in a very desperate situation and likely to resort to extreme measures." On balance, he said, it was decided not to make parental consent compulsory.<br><br>She said she would now follow up by raising her concerns surrounding Mifepristone when Parliament next meets on November 13th.<br><br>She said in an email to HealthAnswers: "Under the law on the termination of pregnancy, although youths aged between 13 and 21 do not need parental consent for an abortion, the availability of the drug Mifepristone - which is not approved by government - over the Internet, raises urgent questions about the implications of the drug at the personal, medical and policy levels."<br><br>"As this drug is widely available in the US and approved by the FDA, does the government have the intention of legalising Mifepristone in due time to be consistent with FDA guidelines?" she wrote.<br><br>"What are our reasons for discouraging dispensation of this drug if under the TOP Act," she added, "If any teenage can seek abortion without anyone knowing? Is it time to work towards some consistency by discouraging the use of Mifepristone at the medical level, as well as at the level of the sale through the Internet and, and amend the TOP to require parental consent so as to deter to some degree, sexual indulgence?"<br><br>Ms Chiang added that the issue of Internet censorship on the advertising and purchases of this drug should be addressed in the interests of protecting Singapore teenagers. "The reason is that a drug as potent as Mifepristone may have adverse effect on a woman's body in the long-run," she wrote<br><br>She added more research and information, and public discussion on the above matters are necessary, as anecdotal information from the medical community has shown that fairly well-educated women in their 20s and 30s are already asking for the drug.<br><br>"If this is widely made available on the Internet, and there is no censure or way of tracking transactions over the Net, we run the risk of having young women using it routinely for social abortions. The long term implications on women's health and fertility issues have been raised with no clear literature on the nature and extent of damage that this drug could do in the long run."<br><br>Psychological Issues<br>Ultimately, does the drug really take away the psychological and emotional pain now that Mifepristone offers a way out of surgical abortion?<br><br>Doctors and counsellors seem to differ in opinion.<br><br>"Without a doubt, most women would prefer the abortion drug as it is convenient, gives them privacy and is less psychological traumatic compared to surgical abortion," said the gynaecologist interviewed earlier.<br><br>However, Ms Juliana Toh, principal therapist at the Counselling &amp; Care Centre, said although the drug may give a woman an easier way out of pregnancy, it really is a lesser of two evils.<br><br>"The abortion drug is obviously more convenient to the woman and it gives her privacy. But to say that the emotional and psychological loss is lesser than that of a surgical abortion may not be right," she said.<br><br>"For one, the drug-induced abortion is a two to three day process which may cause the woman to feel intense guilt over her decision. Because the abortion is done in secrecy, the experience of not sharing the experience with anyone could bring about more psychological pain. This secret the woman keeps has also a potential to cause strain in a relationship," she added.<br><br>She also noted that any secret in a relationship can create barriers in a family or a relationship.<br><br>Finally, although the woman may make a safer or more private choice for the way she terminates her pregnancy, she still has to come to terms with her loss. As in all cases of mourning for a dead member of the family, she is emotionally vulnerable.<br><br>Says Juliana: "And because a woman is dealing with a loss when she has an abortion, she needs not only support in making such a decision but also in the aspect of living with that decision."<br><br>That is one decision that is sure to change one's life - and which one should make with care.<br><br>------------------<br>When night falls, I rise,<br>When all that was left is starlight in extreme darkness.<br>I struggle to break free of the grasp,<br>but alas,<br>This time of the night,<br>Darkness prevails...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.. i feel that there is some possibility of pple misusing this drug... especially in the case of teen pregnancy. Even if the drug is available... i still think that we should practice abstinance... it's the safest way out.</div>
