            <div class='col-md body'>i got 3 pictures of the fort war. dam sad...that time my computer couldn't handle the immense amount of action going on at the fortress...and often i'd lag and find myself somewhere else. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>oh well..at least i had fun when i finally upgraded my comp. absolutely no lag at all, even during fort wars.<br><br>unfortunately there was one downside. you know how monsters can be irritating because if they keep hitting you, you'd slow down. and you know for pyroll tos 3, you start out in a danger zone. my old comp would take about 5 - 10 seconds to load the monsters up, and by the time it does i'd have drove to a safe spot. i ma have taken damage, but at least i made it to the safe point. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>with my old comp it was slightly harder, since all the monsters would hit me and slow me down. eventually, i decided to just pull my internet cable out, drive to the safe spot, then plug it in. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><img src="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c164/lene321/invisible1.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c164/lene321/invisble2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c164/lene321/invisible3.jpg"></div>
