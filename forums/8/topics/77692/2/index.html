Dun be over superstitious.<br><br>By the term 'Period 8', we refer to a set of differing condition of sorts which in theory, will influence this sphere for the next 20 years.<br><br>By theory, Period 8 which see the dominant influence of the 'Gen' is supposed to hint at the phenomena of young men ascending to the seat of power during this period.<br><br>Lot of literary pursuits and immerse progress in the field of researchs.<br><br>And as the direction of 8 is supposed to be in the North East, one may expect the NE section to under go significant development further.<br><br>Within the SG context, this probably be materialised in the coming rise of popularity for the Seletar 21, Simpang 21, and Punggol 21 new towns.<br><br>The San Sha or 3 Killings is a influence which is affect more by the year, e.g during in the Year of the Monkey, San Sha will be situated in the South.<br><br>If we go by theory again, the Flying Stars for both the Da Yiun and this current year will have the Number 9 Star in its southern sector.<br><br>The Number 9 star is an auspicious star. However, it also has a multiplying effect, which coupled into our understanding, may result in the following :<br><br>Da Yun ( 20 years from 2004 onwards) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 9 star in South.<br>2004 Flying Star <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 9 star in south<br>2004 San Sha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> direct South.<br>Kallang River point <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Area refered to the Head of a dragon<br>Shape of Circle Line <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Shaped like a Cresent Moon knife<br><br>And the rest is history as we know it.<br><br>As for the crack in the Padang or rumour that the Westin is going to collapse, I haven't heard of words going on on this.<br><br>But I would see this more as the working of irrational fear more than credible information.<br><br>To put in a word or fairness, nobody can really predict the happening of disasters.<br><br>It is always easy to review upon what has already happened and then attempt to apply theory or hearsays onto the event.<br><br>It's like what people say 'ma hou pao', so I dun really like to attribute fully, the cause of the Circle Line or even, the Ayer Rajah incident to only feng shui factors.<br><br>More importantly, the actual happenings should be investigated and made know for better prevention work on similar tragedies from happening ever again.<br><br>This is just a personal view, but I think if someone really over believes too much in lucky or unlucky direction, then it might be quite hard for them to live a normal life.<br><br>Imagine if I tell someone that West is his unlucky direction.

            <div class='col-md body'>Feng shui, there are people who believe, and also people who don't. Yet, no one knows if it's true. Well, Chinese are superstitious. From my perspective, I think its the walls and planks. I think we should take this as a lesson and learn from it. I strongly believe this year will be a good year for Singapore. My dad who was unemployed for quite some time got a job and I believe the unemployment rate will decrease and the economy will pick up. Singaporeans will lead a better life with their belts loosen.
