            <div class='col-md body'>People who respond to the OP and havent lived in a western country really have no idea what he means. What he says is quite true.<br><br>Caucasians generally are more socially outgoing than Asians. This is partly due to upbringing, and partly due to the emphasis on education Asian parents have. Even ABC's are often more introverted and quieter than westerners because of this (although ABC's are often still more outgoing and worldly than Singaporean guys cuz they can move out from home more easily etc)<br><br>Thus the  majority of overseas guys are more outgoing and have more interests than Singaporean guys.<br><br>Some Singaporean guys may think they are into sport, because they read or watch the English soccer league, but that's nothing. In Western countries, hundreds of thousands, if not millions enrol to play cricket/baseball in the summer, soccer/gridiron/Australian Rules in the winter every weeknd.<br><br>This isnt to say that Singaporean guys are bad people. They arent. They are generally mild tempered and safe. It makes for a decent society overall.<br><br>(Unfortunately, girls dont often like "safe" and mild" guys- they want someone more exciting and outgoing........)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OneWithTheForce:</div><div class="quote_body">People who respond to the OP and havent lived in a western country really have no idea what he means. What he says is quite true.<br><br>Caucasians generally are more socially outgoing than Asians. This is partly due to upbringing, and partly due to the emphasis on education Asian parents have. Even ABC's are often more introverted and quieter than westerners because of this (although ABC's are often still more outgoing and worldly than Singaporean guys cuz they can move out from home more easily etc)<br><br>Thus the  majority of overseas guys are more outgoing and have more interests than Singaporean guys.<br><br>Some Singaporean guys may think they are into sport, because they read or watch the English soccer league, but that's nothing. In Western countries, hundreds of thousands, if not millions enrol to play cricket/baseball in the summer, soccer/gridiron/Australian Rules in the winter every weeknd.<br><br>This isnt to say that Singaporean guys are bad people. They arent. They are generally mild tempered and safe. It makes for a decent society overall.<br><br>(Unfortunately, girls dont often like "safe" and mild" guys- they want someone more exciting and outgoing........)<br></div></blockquote>what girls want, they don't get. Hence they complain. At the end of the day they have a choice - marry Sg men or remain single. Simple.</div>
