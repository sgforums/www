            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, TS is the one starting to whine about singaporean men!?<br><br>That aside, i think why singaporean women feel so lowly about our guys here is because of all that foreign influences that affect our mentality here... A lot of them expect guys to treat them like princesses, just like those korean dramas where the guy is always portrayed to be so gentlemenly, so silent yet secure.. and they never really know that such guys don't exist in reality, even if they did...how much of them can they take?... Can you imagine a singaporean guy forcefully forcing a girl into kissing in the public? In those stupid serials, girls feel that that type of lovelife is so freaking exciting and bla ...but if ur the one being kissed i think majority of the girls here will slap the guy and run off. ..<br><br>sg girls need to wake up and stop thinking of themselves as princesses lah..<br><br>then again, most of these girls whining about singaporean men are often not even mature enough to make such comments...i wonder how old is TS. Most of the ladies(not girls, its a different group of females that i respect) i know love their husbands and family a lot, even though they also felt that singaporean man are boring..i guess they get sick of complaining after a few yrs and decide to settle down... and maybe having a family makes them change their opinions about sg guys because when u have a family to look after , whats important is a loyal, stable, and interactive mate, someone you can talk to...not someone that is silent and secure, because in time, silence will make you feel insecure anyway....not someone who will forcefully kiss you in the public..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Generalizations are mostly based on opinion, and thus, they can't be argued against. However, if you start to draw conclusions and draw an argument from them, expect to flames coming your way.<br><br><blockquote><strong>have no life. Mostly are gullible... generally no ambition....<br>narrow minded.... </strong></blockquote>Opinion. If a guy is too open-minded, he'll tend to be seen as one who has no opinion or stand, or too willing to give in to others. Then we'll get similar complaints.<br><br>Ambition is a difficult thing to have when you keep getting shot down by your own people.<br><br><blockquote><strong>They spend most of their time on IT gadgets, toys and car, computers and internet. </strong></blockquote>Ever hear of <strong>hobbies</strong>? Guys don't have to spend all their stuff on the ladies, and there are guys who don't have ladies to spend on. Besides, stating the last two is highly ironic.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Worst of all they are mummy's boy. and also suffering from some form f paranoi and symptoms unrequited love<br></strong></blockquote>Again, opinion.<br><br>Unrequited love is like cancer. I won't choose to assume here. If one has never felt it, one will never know how potentially devastating to the person it can be.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings, Adrian.<br><br>I appreciate your response.<br><br>The use of "I am here longer" does not serve to make my argument more right than one who has been here for a lesser period of time. What it does is establish the basis for educated comment. I withdraw any wrong implications that the line may aver and apologize for that. This debate should not be boggled down by a claim of "more right".<br><br>I am unsure that one can say with much certainty that Singaporean guys have a narrower range of interests compared to their Western counterparts, just as I am unsure if one can say with certainty the converse. I know MANY Americans who love to sit around doing nothing- no hobbies, nothing, just as I know some international citizens who laze around watching tv at the expense of work... just as I know many Americans who strive passionately... And really, "narrower range of interests" is an amoral ground that is of no merit or fault.<br><br>I am confident enough to know that the Singaporean INDIVIDUAL is far more versed in international happenings than my American counterparts- a simple look at the daily news is telling given their 99% emphasis on locat (ie, state level) news.<br><br>To say that the Singaporean Male is less ambitious, spend most of their time on IT stuff or that girls are hypocritical is without any basis. I humbly suggest that your "OP" differs from the essence that which JJ had originated with.<br><br>In regard your independence factor, I will accpet if you are saying that Western counterparts BECOME independent at a EARLIER stage, but if you are saying that they are MORE independent, that is simply a debate of quantative measurements ... and one we need not go into.<br><br>I note your comments on freedom of speech but regretfully, cannot provide my critical analysis of that statement in a public forum.<br><br>Essentially, if we look at pure stats and percentage,  the claims that JJ presents are absurd, relatively speaking.<br><br>I appreciate your comments and am glad that they are more benefiting than many others posted in response to the thread.<br><br>Cheers<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OneWithTheForce:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm afraid that if you're going to use the "i've been here longer than you" tagline, then my time in Australia and Singapore far exceeds yours young Alvin.<br><br>And the OP is still correct- in general, Singaporean guys have a narrower range of interests compared to their western counterparts, are less outgoing and much more dominated by their parents (or Mum, as the case may be) than the westerner of the same age.<br><br>I've mentioned in my previous post some of the reasons for this.
