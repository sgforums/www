(notice i dont use da word cheena in this context cuz tho tht's wht i feel bout them, i decide i shall give em respect for once)<br><br>If ya aint a hermit hidin in a shell all day, u'd haf notice tht many many chinese gals are obsessed wif pple lyk sly N gay chou.. Frm a personal viewpoint, i think ther nt worth wht these ignorant young gals are sacrificin.. Look at da chinese guys.. a large propotion of em have either of these two hairstles.. spiky hairstyles imitatin some taiwan actor or smt.. i'm nt sure who cuz i dont rly fancy cheena stuff.. i noe nuts bout cheena music too. K.. da other guys follow da sylvester style.. Basically they keep their hair long N sweep it ta one side... I feel tht it's nt only nt pleasing ta my eyes but also ah beng ta a certain extent... Seein ppl spot hairstlyles similar ta members of da four-numeral boyband group simply causes discomfort ta my heart.. it makes me wonder why pple can actually live wif this kinda grass-lookin N oddly coloured bush on their heads tht's nt even nice.. Makes em look lyk escaped lions frm da zoo...<br><br>Movin on ta girls, u will have already noticed da trend.. Many gals lurf ta wear many many wristbands, pink short skirts tht they think are sweet N havin rebonded hair.. Once again i shall say since i dont really follow cheena fashion trends, im nt tht sure where da origin of such trends are.. they aren't glam N style nuff for me tht's fer sure. Frm tht i can infer how bad their dress sense is.. i think they are followin pple lyk jolin.. cindy N so on.. Many of em are juz act-cutes.. they make use of their 'cute-ness' which is often faked ta get pple ta actually buy their records.. As a matter of fact, think.. how many of em are actually talented N sing well?.. In fact none of em are comparable ta english artists.. if we're talkin bout pop, look at mariah carey N christina aguilera. Acknowledge tht we're referin ta two completely diff areas here (cheena N english) but still... da richness of the english artists N da quality of their albums are so much better.. I'm nt tellin ya nt ta buy anymore cheena records but i feel tht most cheena songs are rip offs frm japs N english.. some of their bg rhythm N accompanyment are of low quality.. N surprisingly, these singles top da taiwan charts lyk nobody's business..<br><br>On da whole, as fer chinese pple, most of em followers as classified under <span style="font-style: italic;">bengs N lians</span>.. they follow fashion blindly. U might wanna refer ta this cuz it's my assessment of wht i think is glam N style..<br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=154060" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=154060</a><br>might nt coincide wif ya thinkin but hey.. at least i've my own unique style tht i feel is nice N nt copyin others N bein a poseur. Most of these pple unknowingly become fashion victims.. their dress sense is morbid N uncool in my opinion cuz i hate cheena styles.. I muz also add tht mentally inadequate gals haf tattooed emselves accordin ta wht their idols do.. N i've seen it. It's nt only stupid on their part but insensible cuz they are unaware tht they've ta live wif it fer da rest of their goddamn lives!! God bless them.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Movin on to non-chinese, im referin ta malays, indians etc.. Frm my observations, i noticed tht there also followin more of da <span style="font-style: italic;">african american</span> style.. Don't believe me?.. let Princess Bianca prove ya wrong..<br><br>For guys there generally TWO different kinds of styles.. If ya take a nice walk arnd orchard road, sometimes ya mite see malay or indian guys (sometimes it's hard ta differentiate) dressin up lyk those rappers.. these pple will wear exceedingly large shirts wif basketball team logos or numbers.. along wif a bling on their neck.. tht's some metallic thing usually in a form of a gold chain, cross, or whtever tht's shiny. Some of em even haf blings on their arms, fingers etc. Most of em are spotted wearin NY caps which are exactly wht 50 cent wears in his MTV videos.. I myself watch mtv regularly so i'm very updated of da most recent hits N all.. Talkin bout shoes, some of em go crazy fer designer brands such as "G-unit" if ya havent heard bout em. it originated in da USA N it bein a clothing line by da rapper group G-unit is a hot fav among americans in da USA.. it's very costly ta get em in sg however but da price these pple are willin ta pay is outrageously high. See, it's no diff frm a normal sneaker or shoe N they think it's so posh N glam.. Ta sum it up.. they juz wear big N act big.. everythin ta em is three sizes bigger.. they pants are lyk fallin off anytime. ta hell with tht.<br><br>The second kind.. i noticed they lurf ta skate. It's kinda weird cuz according ta me, skatin is a white's kind of hobby in da US.. lotsa white caucasian guys lurf ta skate N all.. more thn da african americans.. This is higly evident in void decks N outside shoppin malls.. Some ignorant guys even skate on da roads, riskin their lives.. tho it might be cool ta be classified as a 'sk8er', many teens are obsessed wif it.. i shall nt criticise their hobby but i'm juz stating it as a fact as it's one of da trends tht's happenin lately.. Many of em are also heavily tattooed.. I've actually seen malay/indian guys with almost their entire bodies tattooed all over.. up till their necks.. N wearin sleveless top walkin arnd bugis village N even paragon. Dont noe wht ya think of such pple but to me, too much tattoos aint good.. I've one teeny lil tattoo on my hip.. (a letter B) N i guess tht's all i will ever have.. if nt one or two more. Definately nt those hardcore tattooing freakos!..<br><br>Nxt we haf da chics.. Similar ta guys.. they think they are Ciara or missy elliot. I've been thinkin that muslim is a very strict religion in there practices until recently i see malay girls havin dyed there hair bright gold N ash brown.. da colour's even nicer thn mine. Some did perms ta make it look glamorous.. it leaves me thinkin.. aint those malay muslim gals s'posed ta wear a tudung according ta customs?.. guess they are becomin more open minded.. which is good!! i respect em fer tht daring move.. But sadly, most of their styles are similar ta R&amp;B artists lyk ciara fer example.. If ya didnt noe.. ciara has nicely rebonded N sometimes perfectly curled ash brown hair N i feel tht's she's quite attractive.. Some pple follow her style blindly. I'm nt very sure bout their customs so i aint fit ta comment.. but im juz curious as to.. are they allowed ta haf piercings?.. N by havin piercings i mean non-ear piercings.. I've seen some of em spottin nose studs, eyebrows N tongue piercings.. Cool i'd say but some of em over-do it. I've had a tongue barbell myself N da feelin's amazin.. its less painful thn piercin my ear.. N it takes relatively fast ta heal too.. worth it ta me. but ya hafta take very very good care of it cuz it mite get infected N things are gonna get ugly. Now it's gone ya.... cuz of school. </span><br><br>One more thing i dont feel comfortable is gals wearin exceedingly low jeans or skirts, showin off their fats.. One rule ta follow.. if ya dont haf anythin ta show of, dont! i'm utterly disgusted da other day i wuz at jurong point.. saw this girl wearin a skirt with no belt, N it's practically juz RESTING on her hips.. looks as if it's goin ta fall anytime. N if she squats down, it's gonna slip right down her ass.. To make matters worse, she's nt even pretty.. juz another act cute. For me, as much as i lurf weain low-rise.. i noe my limits N will nt show my crack on purpose.. now tht's CHEAP. i think showin a lil bit of thong or g-string is sexy so i do it occasionally dependin on situations.. but nt showin ya ASS. it's no diff frm bein naked rite?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">DISCLIAMER - Some of da comments made by <span style="color: violet;">Princess Bianca</span> are subjected ta her own personal views N nt to be taken too seriously..

            <div class='col-md body'>I cant stand today's chinese music myself. There are too many talentless people today in the Mandarin Pop sector. I dont think i have seen any real talent so far. The only few mandarin singers i respect and like are Emil Chau, Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau. These are the people who have lasted for a long time because of their real love on music and not just to make money.<br><br>You have nooo idea how much i wanna kill those SHE, Jay Chou, Sly, Jolin Tsai, Cyndi Wang, *shudders*.<br><br>Jay Chou writes the most boring songs ever... His singing has no emotion in it. Its always monotonous...<br><br>I only like the mid-ninties chinese music. Ever since the whole pop manufactured shite landed in Hongkong roughly in 1998, i have switched to english music... It just saddens me but i really have to be honest. The young chinese generation of today lack creativity and true talent.<br><br>Mariah Carey may have a great voice, but i dont like her because she dresses like a tart.<br><br>I like singer-songwriters who seriously have talent and are not in the business just for money. I dont usually like famous people because 80% of em are just money making machines.<br><br>I hope that the chinese listeners will open their eyes wide to see all through Hongkong Taiwan's money making entertainment industry. Almost NO ONE is in the business for the music entirely. Its shameful to say that.<br><br>LISTEN TO OLD CHINESE SONGS LAH! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bout au revior:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="font-style: italic;">For an introduction, <span style="color: violet;">Princess Bianca</span> thinks it's too much wht these young sgpeans do ta so-call idolise their idols..whom they think are so great evn to da extent of queing up fer DAYS juz ta see boybands such as 5566. as for 5566, i rather keep my comments ta myself cuz if i were ta say em out, it'd nt be nice..</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">first of all.. i shall make it clear tht i'm nt racist in any comments i make N tht's why i divided my opinions into basically two sectors, da chinese pple N da non-chinese.. (notice i dont use da word cheena in this context cuz tho tht's wht i feel bout them, i decide i shall give em respect for once)<br><br>If ya aint a hermit hidin in a shell all day, u'd haf notice tht many many chinese gals are obsessed wif pple lyk sly N gay chou.. Frm a personal viewpoint, i think ther nt worth wht these ignorant young gals are sacrificin.. Look at da chinese guys.. a large propotion of em have either of these two hairstles.. spiky hairstyles imitatin some taiwan actor or smt.. i'm nt sure who cuz i dont rly fancy cheena stuff.. i noe nuts bout cheena music too. K.. da other guys follow da sylvester style.. Basically they keep their hair long N sweep it ta one side... I feel tht it's nt only nt pleasing ta my eyes but also ah beng ta a certain extent... Seein ppl spot hairstlyles similar ta members of da four-numeral boyband group simply causes discomfort ta my heart.. it makes me wonder why pple can actually live wif this kinda grass-lookin N oddly coloured bush on their heads tht's nt even nice.. Makes em look lyk escaped lions frm da zoo...<br><br>Movin on ta girls, u will have already noticed da trend.. Many gals lurf ta wear many many wristbands, pink short skirts tht they think are sweet N havin rebonded hair.. Once again i shall say since i dont really follow cheena fashion trends, im nt tht sure where da origin of such trends are.. they aren't glam N style nuff for me tht's fer sure. Frm tht i can infer how bad their dress sense is.. i think they are followin pple lyk jolin.. cindy N so on.. Many of em are juz act-cutes.. they make use of their 'cute-ness' which is often faked ta get pple ta actually buy their records.. As a matter of fact, think.. how many of em are actually talented N sing well?.. In fact none of em are comparable ta english artists.. if we're talkin bout pop, look at mariah carey N christina aguilera. Acknowledge tht we're referin ta two completely diff areas here (cheena N english) but still... da richness of the english artists N da quality of their albums are so much better.. I'm nt tellin ya nt ta buy anymore cheena records but i feel tht most cheena songs are rip offs frm japs N english.. some of their bg rhythm N accompanyment are of low quality.. N surprisingly, these singles top da taiwan charts lyk nobody's business..<br><br>On da whole, as fer chinese pple, most of em followers as classified under <span style="font-style: italic;">bengs N lians</span>.. they follow fashion blindly. U might wanna refer ta this cuz it's my assessment of wht i think is glam N style..<br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=154060" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=154060</a><br>might nt coincide wif ya thinkin but hey.. at least i've my own unique style tht i feel is nice N nt copyin others N bein a poseur. Most of these pple unknowingly become fashion victims.. their dress sense is morbid N uncool in my opinion cuz i hate cheena styles.. I muz also add tht mentally inadequate gals haf tattooed emselves accordin ta wht their idols do.. N i've seen it. It's nt only stupid on their part but insensible cuz they are unaware tht they've ta live wif it fer da rest of their goddamn lives!! God bless them.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Movin on to non-chinese, im referin ta malays, indians etc.. Frm my observations, i noticed tht there also followin more of da <span style="font-style: italic;">african american</span> style.. Don't believe me?.. let Princess Bianca prove ya wrong..<br><br>For guys there generally TWO different kinds of styles.. If ya take a nice walk arnd orchard road, sometimes ya mite see malay or indian guys (sometimes it's hard ta differentiate) dressin up lyk those rappers.. these pple will wear exceedingly large shirts wif basketball team logos or numbers.. along wif a bling on their neck.. tht's some metallic thing usually in a form of a gold chain, cross, or whtever tht's shiny. Some of em even haf blings on their arms, fingers etc. Most of em are spotted wearin NY caps which are exactly wht 50 cent wears in his MTV videos.. I myself watch mtv regularly so i'm very updated of da most recent hits N all.. Talkin bout shoes, some of em go crazy fer designer brands such as "G-unit" if ya havent heard bout em. it originated in da USA N it bein a clothing line by da rapper group G-unit is a hot fav among americans in da USA.. it's very costly ta get em in sg however but da price these pple are willin ta pay is outrageously high. See, it's no diff frm a normal sneaker or shoe N they think it's so posh N glam.. Ta sum it up.. they juz wear big N act big.. everythin ta em is three sizes bigger.. they pants are lyk fallin off anytime. ta hell with tht.<br><br>The second kind.. i noticed they lurf ta skate. It's kinda weird cuz according ta me, skatin is a white's kind of hobby in da US.. lotsa white caucasian guys lurf ta skate N all.. more thn da african americans.. This is higly evident in void decks N outside shoppin malls.. Some ignorant guys even skate on da roads, riskin their lives.. tho it might be cool ta be classified as a 'sk8er', many teens are obsessed wif it.. i shall nt criticise their hobby but i'm juz stating it as a fact as it's one of da trends tht's happenin lately.. Many of em are also heavily tattooed.. I've actually seen malay/indian guys with almost their entire bodies tattooed all over.. up till their necks.. N wearin sleveless top walkin arnd bugis village N even paragon. Dont noe wht ya think of such pple but to me, too much tattoos aint good.. I've one teeny lil tattoo on my hip.. (a letter B) N i guess tht's all i will ever have.. if nt one or two more. Definately nt those hardcore tattooing freakos!..<br><br>Nxt we haf da chics.. Similar ta guys.. they think they are Ciara or missy elliot. I've been thinkin that muslim is a very strict religion in there practices until recently i see malay girls havin dyed there hair bright gold N ash brown.. da colour's even nicer thn mine. Some did perms ta make it look glamorous.. it leaves me thinkin.. aint those malay muslim gals s'posed ta wear a tudung according ta customs?.. guess they are becomin more open minded.. which is good!! i respect em fer tht daring move.. But sadly, most of their styles are similar ta R&amp;B artists lyk ciara fer example.. If ya didnt noe.. ciara has nicely rebonded N sometimes perfectly curled ash brown hair N i feel tht's she's quite attractive.. Some pple follow her style blindly. I'm nt very sure bout their customs so i aint fit ta comment.. but im juz curious as to.. are they allowed ta haf piercings?.. N by havin piercings i mean non-ear piercings.. I've seen some of em spottin nose studs, eyebrows N tongue piercings.. Cool i'd say but some of em over-do it. I've had a tongue barbell myself N da feelin's amazin.. its less painful thn piercin my ear.. N it takes relatively fast ta heal too.. worth it ta me. but ya hafta take very very good care of it cuz it mite get infected N things are gonna get ugly. Now it's gone ya.... cuz of school. </span><br><br>One more thing i dont feel comfortable is gals wearin exceedingly low jeans or skirts, showin off their fats.. One rule ta follow.. if ya dont haf anythin ta show of, dont! i'm utterly disgusted da other day i wuz at jurong point.. saw this girl wearin a skirt with no belt, N it's practically juz RESTING on her hips.. looks as if it's goin ta fall anytime. N if she squats down, it's gonna slip right down her ass.. To make matters worse, she's nt even pretty.. juz another act cute. For me, as much as i lurf weain low-rise.. i noe my limits N will nt show my crack on purpose.. now tht's CHEAP. i think showin a lil bit of thong or g-string is sexy so i do it occasionally dependin on situations.. but nt showin ya ASS. it's no diff frm bein naked rite?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">DISCLIAMER - Some of da comments made by <span style="color: violet;">Princess Bianca</span> are subjected ta her own personal views N nt to be taken too seriously.. It's nt meant ta be offensive in ANY way.. so try nt to flame please.<br><br>love &lt;3<br>bianca. :]</span></div></blockquote>whatever..since you made it clear it's your own personal opinion..I hope you don't impose your views on other people although your intention to post it here is questionable.<br><br>Why? It's because it's just plain rude to impose your views on other people and that annoys me. No Im not saying you are doing that. I respect your views and hope you respect others as well. And by the way this is not your personal blog. This is a forum, something designed to be used for public discussion, not for people to comment on your personal life and such.<br><br>I respect you because anyone worth listening to is worth respecting.
