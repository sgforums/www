As we were looking at the display case, the<br>boy behind the counter asked if we needed any help. I replied,<br>"No, I'm just looking at your nuts." My sister started to laugh<br>hysterically, the boy grinned, and I turned beet-red and walked away.<br>To this day, my sister has never let me forget.<br>Faye Emerick, 34, Ellerslie, MD<br><br>Strip Mall<br><br>My husband and I took our three kids out shoe shopping one day. We were<br><br>going from store to store, and the kids were getting restless. At one<br>crowded store, I was standing near a bench when my 3-year-old climbed up<br>on it, grabbed hold of my elastic-waist shorts, and jumped off pulling<br><br>both my shorts and my underwear to the floor. I raced out of there, much to<br>the<br>delight of the appreciative onlookers.<br>Patricia Lamond-Stocksick, 35, Lathrop, CA<br><br>Curl Up and Die<br><br>I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in tow and<br>asked loudly, "How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job?"<br>Melinda Lowe, 39, Seguin, TX<br><br>Pad, please!<br><br>An insurance man visited me at home to talk about our mortgage<br>insurance. He was throwing a lot of facts and figures at me, and I wanted to<br>follow<br>as best I could, so I told my 6-year-old son to run and get me a pad. He<br>came back and handed me a Kotex right in front of our guest.<br>Kathy Newman, 46,Winston-Salem, NC<br><br>Ho, Ho, Ho<br>I was taking a shower when my 2-year-old son came into the bathroom and<br><br>wrapped himself in toilet paper. Although he made a mess, he looked<br>adorable, so I ran for my camera and took a few shots. They came out so<br><br>well that I had copies made and included one with each of our Christmas<br>cards. Days later, a relative called about the picture, laughing<br>hysterically,<br>and suggesting I take a closer look. Puzzled, I stared at the photo and was<br>shocked to discover that in addition to my son, I had captured my<br>reflection in the mirror - wearing nothing but a camera!<br>Name Withheld<br><br>Na-na na-na na-nah!<br>While in line at the bank one afternoon, my toddler decided to release<br><br>some pent-up energy and ran amok. I was finally able to grab hold of her<br>after receiving looks of disgust and annoyance from other patrons. I told<br>her<br>that if she did not start behaving "right now" she would be punished. To my<br>horror, she looked me in the eye and said in a voice just as<br>threatening,<br>"If you don't let me go right now, I will tell Grandma that I saw you<br>kissing Daddy's pee-pee last night!" The silence was deafening after<br>this enlightening exchange. Even the tellers stopped what they were doing.<br>I mustered up the last of my dignity and walked out of the bank with my<br><br>daughter in tow. The last thing I heard when the door closed behind me<br><br>were screams of laughter.<br>Amy Richardson; Stafford, Virginia<br><br>Surprise!<br>It was the day before my eighteenth birthday. I was living at home, but<br><br>my parents had gone out for the evening, so I invited my girlfriend over<br>for a romantic night alone. As we lay in bed after making love, we heard the<br>telephone ring downstairs. I suggested to my girlfriend that I give her<br><br>a piggyback ride to the phone. Since we didn't want to miss the call, we<br>didn't have time to get dressed. When we got to the bottom of the<br>stairs, the lights suddenly came on and a whole crowd of people yelled,<br>"SURPRISE!"<br>My entire family: aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins and all my<br>friends were standing there. My girlfriend and I were frozen in a state of<br>shock<br>and embarrassment for what seemed like an eternity. Since then, no one in my<br>family has planned a surprise party again.<br>Tim Cahill, Poughkeepsie, New York<br><br>Priceless<br>One of the funniest "most-embarrassing-moment" stories I've come upon in<br>a long time was about a lady who picked up several items at a discount<br><br>store. When she finally got up to the checker, she learned that one of her<br>items had no price tag. Imagine her embarrassment when the checker got on<br>the<br>intercom and boomed out for all the store to hear, "PRICE CHECK ON LANE<br><br>THIRTEEN, TAMPAX, SUPERSIZE." That was bad enough, but somebody at the<br><br>rear of the store apparently misunderstood the word "Tampax" for<br>"THUMBTACKS."<br>In a business-like tone, a voice boomed back over the intercom. "DO YOU<br>WANT THE KIND YOU PUSH IN WITH YOUR THUMB OR THE KIND YOU POUND IN<br>WITH A HAMMER?"<br><br>Mom's Advice<br><br>A teacher noticed that a little boy at the back of the class was<br>squirming around, scratching his crotch and not paying attention. She went<br>back to<br>find out what was going on. He was quite embarrassed and whispered that<br><br>he had just recently been circumcised and he was quite itchy. The teacher<br>told him to go down to the principal's office. He was to phone his mother<br>and<br>ask her what he should do about it. He did it and returned to his class.<br>Suddenly, there was a commotion at the of the room. She went back to<br>investigate only to find him sitting at his desk with his penis hanging<br><br>out.<br>"I thought I told you to call your mom." she screamed. "I did," he said,<br>"And she told me that if I could stick it out till noon, she'd come and<br><br>pick me up from school."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Subject:  Noodle &amp; Bao Story ... interesting moral ..<br><br>Chapter One<br>===========<br>One day, noodle quarrel with meat bao(bun). They had a fight but bao was too clumsy and lost badly. He was very angry and he told noodle to stay behind if he has the guts and he'll get his pals to assist him. Meat bao went to find bread, man tou, jian bao etc to get them to reinforce him. Along the way, they saw maggi mee. They ah bish ah bish ah bish and beat maggi mee up and maggi mee beri puzzled why he kena beaten up. He said, "Why u all beat me? What have I done to deserve this?" The meat bao said, "Noodle! Dun think u perm your hair then cannot recognise u!"<br><br>Chapter Two<br>===========<br>Maggi mee, who was beaten up for no reason, was very angry.  So he went to find bee hoon, udon, fried noodles etc to seek revenge.  But on the way, they met small bao. Maggi mee looked at small bao for a while then told his brothers, "Bra-der! Whack him!" Maggi mee whack small bao harder &amp; harder.<br>After the noodles family has left, they asked Maggi Mee why he hated small bao so much and beat him up so badly. Maggi mee said. "At first wanna teach him a small lesson only, but then see him act cute, made me so angry."<br><br>Chapter Three<br>=============<br>The more small bao thought of it, the more buay song he was. So, he found the bao family to whack Maggi mee. Then they found ying shi juan (noodles covered with bun). They brought him back as hostage and were about to put him on the stove to force him to talk when the bao head said, "That's not noodles! That's our undercover!"<br><br>Chapter Four<br>============<br>The family of bao and noodles are now enemies and they have gang fights whenever they see each other. One day, the noodles family was having a walk when they saw char siew bao alone. Seeing the good chance, all of them attacked him. The noodles family shouted, "Beat him hard hard! Don't give chance just because he's vomiting blood!"<br><br>Chapter Five<br>===========<br>Poor char siew bao, with his injuries, went to the baoheadquarters to look for help. All the bao family was activated and together with red bean bao,green bean bun etc. they went to seek revenge. All the passerbys siam them as they look like they will kill.<br>They saw french fries jalan jalan along, shopping. The bao family attacked him. The bao head shouted, "Noodle people still wear gold go shopping! Whack him!!!"<br><br>Chapter Six<br>==========<br>Finally, the bao family manage to kidnap noodle, the one who started up the whole show, and brought him back to the bao headquarter.All the baos took turns to whack him. At the end, the chief of baos - dua bah bao took a final roll over noodle before they dump him.<br>When the poor noodle finally went home, none of the family member could recognise him bcoz he is totally disfigured - flatten. In order not to let the family bear the bad name, he appears as a new member named Mee pok.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Playwright Jim Sherman wrote this today after Hu Jintao was named<br>chief of the Communist Party in China.<br><br>HU'S ON FIRST<br>By James Sherman<br><br>(We take you now to the Oval Office.)<br><br>George: Condi! Nice to see you. What's happening?<br>Condi: Sir, I have the report here about the new leader of China.<br><br>George: Great. Lay it on me.<br>Condi: Hu is the new leader of China.<br><br>George: That's what I want to know.<br>Condi: That's what I'm telling you.<br><br>George: That's what I'm asking you.

And then get me the U.N.<br><br>Condi: Yes, sir.<br><br>George: Not Yassir! The guy at the U.N.<br>Condi: Kofi?<br><br>George: Milk! Will you please make the call?<br>Condi: And call who?<br><br>George: Who is the guy at the U.N?<br>Condi: Hu is the guy in China.<br><br>George: Will you stay out of China?!<br>Condi: Yes, sir.<br><br>George: And stay out of the Middle East! Just get me the guy at the U.N.<br>Condi: Kofi.<br><br>George: All right! With cream and two sugars. Now get on the phone.<br>(Condi picks up the phone.)<br>Condi: Rice, here.<br><br>George: Rice? Good idea. And a couple of egg rolls, too. Maybe we  should send some to the guy in China. And the Middle East. Can you get Chinese food in the Middle East?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A Resignation Letter<br>================<br><br>Mr Baker,<br><br>As an employee of an institution of higher education, I have a few very basic expectations. Chief among these is that my direct superiors have an intellect that ranges above the common ground squirrel.<br><br>After your consistent and annoying harassment of myself and my co-workers during the commission of our duties, I can only surmise that you are one of the few true genetic wastes of our time. Asking me, a network administrator, to explain every little nuance of everything I do each time you happen to stroll into my office is not only a waste of time, but also a waste of precious oxygen.<br><br>I was hired because I know about Unix, and you were apparently hired to provide amusement to myself and other employees, who watch you vainly attempt to understand the concept of "cut and paste" for the hundredth time.<br><br>You will never understand computers. Something as incredibly simple as binary still gives you too many options. You will also never understand why people hate you, but I am going to try and explain it to you, even though I am sure this will be just as effective as telling you what an IP is.<br><br>Your shiny new iMac has more personality than you ever will. You walk around the building all day, shiftlessly looking for fault in others. You have a sharp dressed useless look about you that may have worked for your interview, but now that you actually have responsibility, you pawn it off on overworked staff, hoping their talent will cover for your glaring ineptitude. In a world of managerial evolution, you are the blue-green algae that everyone else eats and laughs at. Managers like you are a sad proof of the Dilbert principle.<br><br>Seeing as this situation is unlikely to change without you getting a full frontal lobotomy reversal, I am forced to tender my resignation, however I have a few parting thoughts.<br><br>1. When someone calls you in reference to employment, it is illegal to give me a bad recommendation. The most you can say to hurt me is "I prefer not to comment." I will have friends randomly call you over the next couple of years to keep you honest, because I know you would be unable to do it on your own.<br><br>2. I have all the passwords to every account on the system, and I know every password you have used for the last five years. If you decide to get cute, I am going to publish your "favourites list", which I conveniently saved when you made me "back up" your useless files. I do believe that terms like "Lolita" are not usually viewed favourably by the administration.<br><br>3. When you borrowed the digital camera to "take pictures of your mothers b-day", you neglected to mention that you were going to take pictures of yourself in the mirror nude. Then you forgot to erase them like the techno-moron you really are. Suffice it to say I have never seen such odd acts with a ketchup bottle, but I assure you that those have been copied and kept in safe places pending the authoring of a glowing letter of recommendation.<br>(Try to use a spell check please, I hate having to correct your mistakes.)<br><br>Thank you for your time, and I expect the letter of recommendation on my desk by 8:00 am tomorrow. One word of this to anybody, and all of your little twisted repugnant obsessions will be open to the public. Never fuck with your systems administrators, because they know what you do with all your free time.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>T. Brewer</div>
