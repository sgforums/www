The pkg includes:<br><br>- helping u decide on a romantic way of proposing, choosing the Engagement Ring, capturing the moment on camera...<br><br>Juz kidding...<br><br>Honestly, a Proposal is only truly special n Unique, if it's thot of by u.  Wat I'd personally prefer is tt My Guy proposes on his own, without asking for ideas from another person.  Similarly, watever ring he chooses shd be chosen by himself, be it silver n crystal or watsoever, I'll wear it wif Pride.<br><br>I think ur girl wld appreciate u coming up wif a Proposal urself... as long as it's nothg as Unromantic as "Eh, wan to apply for HDB flat or not???" it shd be okie  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Congrats!!!<br><br>RP</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, try this .... book a small hotel room, those budget hotel will do, but must have nice scenery.Preferable those in Chinatown or ??? which the buildings are old but of course, must have renovate!!!<br><br>Then get a couple of frens to help you to "renovate" the place, place balloons, alot of roses, light sticks and make it very romantic. Then don't forget a box of her fav chocolate, and also a champange! Must know how to open the champange and gives a "popz" sound. That should do, remember sincerity is very important and the rest is up to you!!!<br><br>All the best!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i still think tt it's the heart dat's important, and im sure your girl will not mind if your proposal is not the 'mega, super-duper romantic' type..a simple one will do, more importantly, you have to show your sincerity..which means tt a bit of effort needs to be put in lah   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>just share with you how one of my friend proposed (in case you really run out of ideas)...<br><br>well, this couple have been going out for 3 yrs plus, so the guy thot of settling down...wat he did was to make a photo album "THEIR" photo album...the album flows like this...<br><br>1st, he inserted his baby photos, how he grew up, until adult stage...*important part*..AND how the girl came into his life (so insert photos of her) and photos of them together, all the photos showing how they shared life together, dates they went to, holidays overseas, paktoring...blah blah blah...(the idea is to create a sequential flow of images to exemplify how the girl entered his life and made his life happy and complete...and to remember the good times they had) and the last page of the album, he sort of made a pop-up thingy, and in it, was the proposal ring!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  boy, was she surprised!<br><br>and the proposal took place after a movie, and they went to the same movie theatre they went to on the very 1st date!<br><br>over everything else, i thk the guy was sincere, thus took the trouble and effort to make a photo album of his and their life story...<br><br>all the best for your proposal!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
