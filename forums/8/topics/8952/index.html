            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmmm......<br><br>interesting topic...<br><br>I have always asked myself a similar question to this one.  My question is "who are you actually?!"<br><br>I have been playing online since almost 5 yrs ago.  I admit I was lost when I had first started, but as time goes by I noticed that my true self kicks in.  And here I am now, I can tell you that I am not much different online and in real life.  Those who have met me or chatted with me on the phone should know.  Or even those that I have known on a personal basis...<br><br>What I want to know is for those that claims to be all that online, are they really all that?!  Those that claims to be picked up at clubs and having such killer body...do you really have it?!  I have heard stories in the forum about certain people here.  How they claim to be so happening online, but in real life they are nothing but an empty shell.  Those are the people that really need a reality check.<br><br>Anyways...It doesn't matter what you appear to be online, or even what people thinks/say about you.  The thing that matters is you know who you are and you know what you are doing.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

The roles of son, brother, bf, gf e.t.c. All these roles can be stressful at times. So to relieve these stress and be someone you can never be. You can only do it on net and escape unnoticed. I'm not saying that it's alright to do these.<br><br>But deeper down inside each of us, there is a naughty side, alien side  which cannot be reveal to the outside world due to the social reponsibility and the fact that we care how ppl look at us.<br><br>------------------<br>Gerald<br>SinglesONE.com</div>
