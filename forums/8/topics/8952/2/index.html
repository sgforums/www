            <div class='col-md body'>Well, everytime we go online, we actually meet some special ppl. These ppl are those who hide behind their monitor, they do not go out to face the world, and they do all sorts of funny things behind their masks on the net.<br><br>Thinking that they can just stay behind forever, from their mask they actually do some really mean things, thinking that they'll never be detected.(those of you who are guilty of this pls F___ O__ from this forum)<br><br>There are also funny ppl who come out of nowhere and suddently defended another "asshole" who happen to be under fire from the forumites. Well this makes us doubt their real identity. DO they realise that if we do want to trace, its so easy to trace the ip address......(BEWARE!!!!) They think we have no brain???? In the net, they can just register another name and just say something in defence of their real name....... talk about double life!!!!! (again those of you who are guilty of this pls F___ O__ from this forum)<br><br>Well Those GUILTY ones who read this may instantly think that who am I to say these things in here, since i am still relative NEW in here. BUT Take note: this place is for ppl to post their heart felt statements, I am not afraid of those of you who will subsequently post replys to fire me. Well if you cannot even show your face to us in real life, your statements are rather like your identity on the net......PURE CRAP!!(Never solid, just fictionous).<br><br>Those of you who seen me and know for years liao, thanks for your help and support through these years. I've found very good friends on the net before(you know who you are), and trust me, it takes A GREAT DEAL of real life interaction to get to this stage in a people-to-people relationship. So those of you....... get the hell out of your fictionous identity and come out, Face the world out here!!! BE REAL!!!<br><br>PS: IF I OFFEND ANYONE BY POSTING THIS STATEMENT............. JUST TOO BAD!!!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>****************************************************<br>Fate exists but it can only take us so far,<br>Because once you are there,<br>It's up to you to make it happen...<br>--From "Can't Hardly Wait"--<br>****************************************************</div>
