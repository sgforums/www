                  Stabbing incident at NTU 
                  
                  SINGAPORE: A coroner's inquiry into the unnatural death of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) student David Hartanto Widjaja has been set for next month. 
                  
                  The 21-year-old student died after falling from a campus building in March, after discussing his final-year project with his supervisor Chan Kap Luk. 
                  
                  Professor Chan sustained stab wounds as a result of the incident and was hospitalised. 
                  
                  Mr Widjaja's parents and elder brother attended a scheduled hearing at the Subordinate Court on Wednesday. 
                  
                  Their lawyer, Shashi Nathan, and State Counsel Shahla Iqbal, who is assisting the court in the inquiry, spent almost an hour in the chambers of State Coroner Victor Yeo before the matter was mentioned in open court. 
                  
                  "Today we have, in my view, quite a fruitful meeting with the state counsel as well as the judge in his chamber to discuss the parameters of this case, where we are going to go and how we are going to move forward,â€� said Mr Nathan. 
                  
                  â€œThe coroner's court has fixed the matter for the hearing for five days in May, starting on May 20. And we have an idea of the various witnesses that are going to come forward. So we will look at it from that angle and take it from there." 
                  
                  Following an hour-long meeting in the state coroner's chambers, lawyer acting for the Widjaja family told the media about 16 witnesses have been lined up to testify at the inquiry from May 20 to 26, including the pathologist who performed the autopsy. 
                  
                  Professor Chan, who was the last person to be seen together with David, is also expected to testify. 
                  
                  Mr Nathan said a formal meeting between the Widjaja family and the police has also been arranged for Thursday.
