            <div class='col-md body'>RELATIONSHIPS:<br><br>When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled: "All Men Are idiots". Then she will get on with her life.<br><br>A man has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the break-up, at 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday night, he will call and say, "I just called to let you know you ruined my life, and I'll never forgive you, and I hate you, and you're a total floozy. But, I want you to know that there's always a chance for us."<br><br>This is known as the "I Hate You I Love You" drunken phone call, and 99% of all men have made it at least once.<br><br>LOCKER ROOMS:<br><br>In the locker room men talk about three things: money, football, and women.  They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.<br><br>Women talk about one thing in the locker room: sex. And not in abstract terms, either. They are extremely graphic and technical,<br>and they never lie.<br><br>MATURITY:<br><br>Women .mature much faster than men. Most 17-year old females can function as adults.<br><br>Most 17-year old Males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class.<br><br>This is why high school romances rarely work out.<br><br>MAGAZINES:<br><br>Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked women. Women's magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should not be seen by the light of day.<br><br>Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman's body.<br><br>Most naked men elicit laughter from women.<br><br>BATHROOMS:<br><br>A man has five items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, shaving cream, razor a bar of Dial soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn.<br><br>The average number of items in the typical woman's bathroom is 437.<br><br>A man would not be able to identify most of the items.<br><br>CATS:<br><br>Women love cats.<br><br>Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick<br><br>OFFSPRING:<br><br>A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite foods and secret fears and hopes and dreams.<br><br>A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.<br><br>LAUNDRY:<br><br>Women do laundry every couple of days.<br><br>A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry.<br>When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes to the Laundromat. Men always expect to meet beautiful women at the Laundromat. This is a myth perpetuated by re-runs of old American sitcoms.<br><br>MIRRORS:<br><br>Men are vain; they will check themselves out in a mirror.<br><br>Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface: mirrors, spoons, store windows, Joe Garagiola's head.  <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">(This is so damn true, cuz I do that all the time!)</span></span><br><br>TIME:<br><br>When a woman says she'll be ready to go out in five more minutes, she's using the same meaning of time as when a man says the football game just has five minutes left.<br><br>Neither of them is counting time outs, commercials, or replays.<br><br>FRIENDS:<br><br>Women on a girl's night out talk the whole time.<br><br>Men on a boy's night out say about twenty words all night, most of which are "Pass the Doritos" or "Got any more beer?"<br><br>RESTROOMS:<br><br>Men use restrooms for purely biological reasons.<br><br>Women use restrooms as social lounges.<br><br>Men in a restroom will never speak a word to each other.<br><br>Women who've never met will leave a restroom giggling together like old friends.<br><br>And never in the history of the manking has a man excused himself from a restaurant table by saying, "Hey, Tom, I was just about to take a leak. Do you want to join me?"<br><br>SEX:<br><br>Women prefer 30-40 minutes of foreplay. Men prefer 30-40 seconds of foreplay. Men consider driving to her place as part of the foreplay.<br></div>
