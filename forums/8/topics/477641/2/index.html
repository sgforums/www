              FROM
              
              BERNARD ZHANG, MANAGER (CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS), NEE SOON TOWN COUNCIL
              
              PUBLISHED:Â 28 NOVEMBER, 9:28 PM
              
              We refer to our residentâ€™s letter, â€œTimely for town councils to review internal processesâ€� (Nov 25, online). Nee Soon Town Council has contacted Mr Ryan Chan to explain the situation, and he has requested for our response on email.He had indeed paid Service and Conservancy Charges to the town council on Nov 1. However, the payment was missed out due to a communications lapse. The system generated a reminder notice automatically.
              
              We apologise and have taken steps to enhance communications between us and our banks to ensure payments are not missed out in future. 
              
              Mr Chanâ€™s late penalty fee will also be cancelled.We acknowledge the feedback he sent via our website on Nov 15. We have checked the system, and there was a programming error on the website. Hence, his email did not reach our feedback system. We shared that we are working with our web vendor to correct this.We also apologised for the inconvenience caused and lapse in response. 
              
              We assure Mr Chan that Nee Soon Town Council places service quality as a priority. We thank him for his letter.
