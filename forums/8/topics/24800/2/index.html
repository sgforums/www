            <div class='col-md body'>This kind of back-stabbing friend, you can shake him off, PLEASE, shake him off. In fact, he is not even your friend.<br><br>Best is you explain to your gf what kind of person he is, like what you told us, (eg. he late can, you late cannot, etc) your gf will know better who to believe. Then distance yourself away from him asap. Since you are rich enough to own a car, best is you get new handphone number and only give it only to certain people, your friends who don't know him and those who know his chao kuan and won't give him your number.<br><br>You've got nothing to fear from him. If he talks crap about you which is entirely not true, sue him for slander. He's not fit to be your friend anyway, so sueing him should not make you feel guilty. You've done more than enough as a friend on your part. If other people choose to believe him than you, then just too bad, just take it that these people bak jiu tah stamps. Time will tell anyway...<br><br>If you don't byebye him, I guarantee you will suffer forever.
