            <div class='col-md body'>2 months ago, my school organised a public forum which would be aired live on News radio 938. The purpose of the forum was to air the views and aspirations of the future generation of Singapore.<br><br>I was selected to participate in the forum. However, prior to the forum, I had to attend 3 meetings and brefing sessions to, in the words of my teacher, "ensure that the forum does not turn into a PR disaster".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
