            <div class='col-md body'>hi all<br>im kinda in a dilemma right now over which subjects to take in jc. i took triple sciences in sec school, but i have to drop one science subject now. the thing is, i dont know if i should take bio or physics. most likely, ill take chem and math, but should i drop physics or bio?<br><br>personally, i prefer physics to bio because its more relevant to daily life but i do better at bio. my bio grades are always higher than my physics grades. if youre talking about interest, ill take physics anytime. i do better at bio so im afraid that my grades will be compromised if i go for a subject that i like yet cannot score. also, i really hate the memorising. bio seems to be more content heavy than physics while the latter is more on application (true?)<br>anyone can tell me which subject, bio or physics, is more manageable?<br><br>another thing is, i have to choose one contrasting subject and since im in the science stream, its either econs, hist, geog or lit. is econs difficult? history's syllabus seems to be more interesting than econs but the essay writing demands of history really puts me off. i dont have any background in geog so i dont know if i should take geog. lit is definitely a no go because ive been disliking it since sec school.<br><br>anyone can offer any advice? thanks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i took physics instead of bio even though i am many times weaker in physics compared to bio. this is because physics + chem students can qualify for almost EVERY course in university. also, i personally think that jc physics spa is the easiest of all sciences.<br><br>if you intend on taking physics +chem or bio + chem, the 'standard' constrasting subject would be econs. taking something like lit or econs or art will most probably make u an odd combi student, and your timetable will be quite wierd.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bio is real hard in JC level. as in there's lots of things to memorise and also to study per chapter.<br>however for physics we covered some in pure physics in secondary sch and also most of the few chapters are related.<br><br>for h1, i took econs. haha cos i dun take lit and i hate memorising history.<br>anyway econs is not that difficult once u understand it =D</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah... I agree that physics and chem will give you more choices when you decide what course to take in university. If you don't take A-level bio, you can always take introductory biology in university. (In NUS, you can take this module "General Biology" and use it as a substitute of A-level bio. IMO, this module is much easier and less time-consuming than A-level bio.) I dun have A-level bio, so I took "General Biology" in NUS. After that, I took modules in biochem, molecular bio, medicinal chem, etc, and I'm doing pretty well. This shows that A-level bio is not really necessary if you wanna take bio-related modules in university. Of course, some courses in NUS, like pharmacy and food science &amp; technology, requires A-level bio. But most other courses do not require A-level bio. If you still have no idea what courses to take in university, go for A-level physics. It's more useful.<br><br>As for the contrasting subject, most people would go for econs. Econs may be the most relevant and useful to real-life situations, but it's rather tough and hard to score. Humanities are not that easy either, as you need to write fluent essays most of the time. As for me, I chose something special. I chose A-level art! I like A-level art, because I dun need to go for boring lectures. Class size for art is normally small, meaning that there're more interactions between the teacher and students. While my classmates are furiously writing econs essays, I'm happily drawing pictures. Of course, A-level art can be pretty "siong", esp when I have to rush my A-level art project. Also, art is something that I have to keep practising. (If you don't have the talent, you may need to put in extra effort to polish your drawing skills.)<br><br>If you love drawing or designing, and if your JC happens to offer A-level art, you can give it a try! If you dun like it, you can always change subject after 3 months. Hehe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> You can also check whether your JC offers music, or mother-tongue language &amp; literature (e.g. Chinese language &amp; literature).</div>

A degree in life scinece with a concentration in biomed is not like wat siaokau had said.<br><br>You need biology to get into life sciences. If you do not have a biology background, you need to take a biology bridging module in the first semester. And during this semester you are not allowed to take any of the life science modules.<br><br>NUS do not pick students. If you have the "good enough" A level grades, you can enter NUS or NTU. While in NUS, we bid for modules on a biding system. Meaning in each semester, you will be given certain amount of bidding credits say a 1000 points for e.g. And with this 1000 points you can bid for any module which intrerst U. Be it jap language or Anime or even forensic science. NUS do not pick students, instead U pick modules to study.<br><br>As for you, set your sight furthur. What do you want to earn for a living ? What do u want to study in uni ? JC is peanuts. Dun tink a A level is big f***. Poly grads are better off than a fuggin A level</div>
