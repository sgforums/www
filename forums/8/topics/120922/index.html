Handicapped ones also sometimes take things for granted.<br><br>There was once when I was at LAX (Los Angeles Airport) and had to use the loo.  I was at the airlines lounge area, where its very quiet, so they didn't build many loos.  All the loos were designed both for handicapped and normal people (there were not normal loos).<br><br>While I was in the loo, there was this guy who kept knocking at my door.  When I came out, I saw that it was this Chinese guy on crutches.  I smiled at him and gave him way, but he just showed me a dirty face, shook his head and went in.  As if he wants trouble.<br><br>Later, I found that he was on the same flight as me back to Singapore....and spoke with a local accent too.<br><br>I fully respect and will give way to those who need it......but in this case, I really felt like smashing his arms as well.  What a bastard.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The current 40s-50s. early 60s are baby boomers..<br>They have a different view and attitude compared to the late 60s and 70s.<br>There is a difference. the  60s and 70s are more gentle and easy going.<br>The 40s - 50s are the current batch whose children is in their late teens and early 20s.<br>These baby boomers bahaviours are pretty similar to the bad black sheeps in the younger counter parts we see today (late teens and early 20s). They exhibit the same rude, uncivil behaviour. These are people who are used to good life and abandance in therms of resource and whatever and mostly, if you ask me, they lack the refinements of character of the older generation. In a sense, I've observed very selfish behaviours where they are no shy when it comes to exerting their so cal priviledge and even abusing it cause they know they will get away.<br>I no longer give my seats to old folks who for some reason nowadays, always looked fresher and healthier than I do. Fact I might have more aches than these 40-50s years old...<br></div>
