They are so rude till I sian and think they deserve it.<br></div></blockquote>I was....er....just trying to protect a friend who is in the second half of his 30's.  He's a very very very nice guy....and may be mistaken for someone in his early 40's (and thus mistaken for a rude baby-boomer).  So I think hor.....below 45 is ok lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  Confirmed!!<br><br>Actually, I've seen unreasonable people of all ages....but admittedly, I did notice that those in their 50's now are among the worst.  I can't really relate that to baby-boomers and think that maybe its just coincidence that the unreasonable ones I've met happened to be in that age group.  And many of my bad experiences are with those who hold authoritative positions (eg. teachers, company executives, etc).<br><br>There was once when I was driving and accidentally cut into somebody's lane.  The other driver was a senior guy, obviously some sort of company executive driving a big European car.  He looked like a normal healthy guy.  I waved my hand, nodded my head and apologised....but he just kept rudely gesturing at me.  Finally, I lost my temper and wound down my window and said something like "I was in the wrong and I already said sorry, so what else are you unhappy about?".  His response was that if I wanted to fight, then come down and fight.<br><br>He then drove his car to the side of the road and stopped.  I did the same, behind him.  Both of us stepped out and he looked much older than when he was sitting in his car.  He was like one-leg in the grave already.....very skinny, walked like a bit weak in the knees, a bit hunched and all.  Probably in his late 60's.<br><br>He was still blasting away at me verbally and I just said "ok, forget it" and walked back to my car and drove away.  Basket, if I had even pushed him and he fell, his remaining leg would have gone into the grave.  Better don't play play lah....I've never killed anyone before and I didn't intend to start.<br><br>But its amazing that these senile old goats can actually challenge people to fights.  Suddenly one day challenge someone who cannot control, he will be in deep shit.  Maybe become a vegetable all his life.<br><br>Sh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it, if this wasn't Singapore, I would've choked him a bit and let him temporarily feel the panic of getting one step closer to his Maker.  Just to remind him that he shouldn't push his luck too far.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're not the only one.<br>I was on the bus on my way back... it was a stretch of higway near Kallang MRT. The bus was happily going along its way, when this 50++ yr old guy somehow purposefully cut into the bus lane and drove at crawl and cause the bus to brake suddenly. When the bus try to cut out, the car followed. That made the bus tail gate the car and I think the car driver gave the bus driver the middle finger when the bus horned him. The car kept hogging the lane knowing full well its a bus lane and refused to go out to the other lane where there was absolutely Zero cars. Then the bus driver had no choice but to filter out to the next lane. The car came up side by side the guy was all gestures and then he speeded up and then came into the front of the bus again and slowed down. The bus nearly ram into the car and was forced to stop. (I wish the bus rammed him and kill him on the spot cause he's rishing a bus load of people's lives with his reckless driving). This went on for quite some period. Honing and all sort of vulgarities from the car driver. The bus driver kept his cool although he was unhappy and grumbling. He noted down the car plate and refused to step off the bus when the car driver stopped at the nearest bus stop gesturing away.<br><br>It was a sway day for the bus driver. Cause in the next stop, along kallang road, friday night .. cars, trucks, vans all driven by mad people. The road in this section is utterly congested and there is no way to filter lanes. This old old man, musta tot he's superdude. Stood in front of the bus by the front door, less than 30 cm away. I was sitting right in front and could see his head just below the windscreen . He was waiting to cross the road (He could not possibly cross it in that kind of traffic) and waited for the bus to filter out to next lane and let him walk across. The driver got fed up and horn the guy to get off the road. It took the old man a full 1 minute before he comprehended that he's blocking everyone. Musta been thinking of the china chick he's going to do ...<br><br></div>
