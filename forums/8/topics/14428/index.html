            <div class='col-md body'>You must be new in network marketing as I see your commendable enthusiasm in trying to recruit distributors in this public forum.<br><br>Before you get flamed by ppl for doing that here(considered not ethical to do so in a public forum), I understand your enthusiasm in doing so.<br><br>Perhaps, we can turn this thread into a discussion on the pros and cons of network marketing.<br><br>One of the best books I have read about this subject is "The 4th Wave...building your downline." by Richard Poe.  Note that there are 2 wave 4 books by the same author. This book is a must read for all beginners and even veterans.<br><br>Just a little tip. The whole concept of network marketing is based on duplicability and one must be coachable. You can only learn this from an upline who is very successful and duplicate what he does. If your immediate upline is not successful yet, go to his upline and if not search further up for the right mentor. Your sponsor shud not be jealous as your success is also his success. If he understands the business well enough, he shud even encourage u to do so! If he is jealous, then that confirms that he is a wrong mentor.<br><br>There are 3 types of people in this business. The genius, the smart and the fool. Guess who will fail?<br><br>Its the genius because he thinks he is clever and start reinventing the wheel that is when he realise that what he does will not work and by then, too late liow. The smart will say, since the system works, I just follow. The fool will say, I always blur blur, so I better monkey see monkey do.<br><br>One more very important point to note, if you were recruited by the lure of money in a short time, you are being fed with wrong information. Yes, of course there are people who made good money in 6 to 8 months. Tens of thousands $$$$ per month, but those are rare.<br><br>There is alot of work to be done to be very successful just like in any business except that in this business, there is almost no financial risks involved. If you were to work dilligently for at least 2 years with the right mentor and company, you will never look back again by then as you will have created a stream of income every month without you being there, forever, barring unforseen circumstances. Not many people planned that long in this business and they gave up in a few months, that is why the rate of attrition is high and they blame that the system do not work. Why people behave like that? Amongst many reasons is that their sponsor sold them the idea of making money fast and little work needs to be done. That is misrepresentation. If you can overcome this mindset and work with the best mentor, permanent wealth is a very real possibility. I know. I have some good friends who can retire anytime they want and money still comes in every month.<br><br>Btw, I can't find the wave 4 books in the shops, so I ordered it from Amazon.com. See, I hve recommend 2 books and a website, so that is direct marketing isn't it although I do not earn anything. So why not recommend things and yet fetches you an income? Your company is in Health products business, so therefore you are in the business of helping people live longer and yet can make a good income, isn't that nice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>

If Nuskin and the rest are pyramid, why isn't the goverment closing them down after one and half year and whole market talking about it?<br><br>Since you mentioned Nuskin, lets discuss this company.<br><br>1) You can join them as sellers too. As sellers you can buy wholesale and sell retail at 43% markup straight into the pocket instead of 30%. Without any points maintenance too.<br><br>However, they have other methods of business developments that require quotas, that is if one is interested.<br><br>Have you ever wondered why when there are about 40,000 network companies in the world, I've heard of only one company(may be more) that publishes their distributor's  average income audited by world's biggest auditor Pricewaterhouse in the New York Stock Exchange Finacials? Nuskin?<br><br>Problems with buy/sell method for ALL MLM companies are:-<br><br>a) How do you prevent other distributors from undercutting? It is rampant. I have seen many people selling cost to cost. Huh? Cost to cost? How to do business? This also won't create customer loyalty because whoever comes with a cheaper simolar products, they will switch brand. All claim their products are good, so we will not compre products here.<br><br>b) That will only make you a sales man. Think how many products are you gonna sell to make, say $3000 a month? Even you can do it, that will be really tough, isn't it? Go do your calculation. You can say downline will help out? See (c).<br><br>c) When your downline starts to sell and then cannot make much money, many will drop out. When friends starts to reject them, somemore will drop out. Of course some will stay on, but it will take you a long long time to build if ever you yourself don't give up. And when they dropout, where are you ganna find replacements?<br><br>d) So you are for companies with no quotas? If no quotas where got commitment? Bet you in a while you will be chasing your downline why this chap not working that chap not selling? Then even your downline will start avoiding you.  Then many people will come to the wrong conclusion that MLM is a scam. It is not, cos they doing the business wrong just like any business you do it wrong will fail. Don't belif? See for yourself 5 months time.<br><br>What MLM companies do is this. They give you very good products to market. So most people do what? They sell and recruit and sell and recruit, don't you think that's tuff? When friends see you, they'll say "Here comes the MLM girl again, Ruuuuuuuuun!!".<br><br>Do you know Pareto's Theory 80/20. If you do, you will know what I mean.<br><br>Then the question is how come some of them make it so rich. You know what? Whilst the 95% of the people sells and anyhow recruit, they work on a business plan and execute the plan. That is why I mentioned, if you want to join the business, find an upline who is very successful because he probably has a plan. If you find one that is mediocre, he will teach you what he knows, that is how to be mediocre, like him cos that is what he knows isn't it? The rest are only salesperson and when you want passive income in doing what the rest are doing, you will either give up in a few months time and having alota frens avoiding you or you presevere and preservere and maybe in 7 years time, your income will grow. With your method, you will need alot of grit and emotional roller coaster.<br><br>If you are really serious about earning great passive income, look for business builders upline whether in Forever Young, Amway, Nuskin or whatever company.
