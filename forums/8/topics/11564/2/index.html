But that doesn't mean you cannot be a good daughter, mother, wife, worker, friend, lover IN FUTURE. Nobody is a born failure, and nobody is a born success. The only difference is TRYING. You are a failure if you dun try. It's easy to give ourselves up to despair and self-destruction whenever something happened. But have you tried picking yourself up and living more positively? The more misfortunes you face, the more you should prove that you can live positively. Do not be crushed be them. The light will always be at the end of the tunnel, but you must not stop walking if you want to reach it.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
