              <p><br>You can start by taking things more positively!!!!</p>
              <p>Since you are aware that you will always lean towards the bad or negative side of any situations, try reversing your depressed situation by finding all sort of crazy excuses to make that situation into a funny situation. And if you can make it funny enough to make yourself laugh out loud, then you have already taken a huge leap into happiness and becoming a positive person.</p>
              <p>Don't blame anyone for your own situation, the problem ALWAYS lies within YOU. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>As long as u beat other person in whatever they are doing and prove them wrong. Thats all the motivation i need. The more they say i will fail , the more chiong i become.</p>
              <p>Cause nothing beats ' IN YOUR FACE!'  that feeling. Your success is thier failure.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Anyone work and work for many many years and feel very tired? After cooping up in the office from 9am to 9pm everyday, i feel very tired. I wish i could do something different like doing a small business or be insurance agent or housing agent so i could meet more people. Yet on the other hand, i feared of the income loss. I need to suffer no income for at least 3 months.... i feel stressful yet i hate the office politics and the never ending work. Even taking leave is such a pain. Would be grateful if someone has such life changing experience care to share some of your experience?</p></div>
