              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Over
               the past few days, many Singaporeans have been affected by the MRT 
              service disruptions. Even more have expressed concern that such a major 
              and serious series of service failures could have occurred in Singapore.
               A friend of mine could not even get home till midnight last Thursday 
              and was understandably very upset when she related her experience to me.
               Other friends and residents have also approached me, emailed me or 
              FB-ed me to give their feedback on the matter. I did not think it would 
              have been at all helpful for me to publicly add to the chorus of 
              criticisms directed at SMRT, especially when the priority then was to 
              solve the problems and get the trains running properly again. Now that 
              the system seems to have stabilised, please allow me to make a few 
              points on the matter.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> This unfortunate episode has 
              uncovered many faults – from the maintenance regime, crisis management 
              to public communications. The Prime Minister has directed that a 
              Committee of Inquiry be convened to undertake a full investigation. This
               is a decisive and important move, to find out what went wrong and to 
              put things right. SMRT must take this in the right spirit. It is 
              critical for SMRT to take an honest look at itself, and address not just
               the areas of failure, but the systemic issues as well. Apart from that,
               the Government should also examine what more it could have done in this
               episode, and update its policies to prevent any future recurrences.<em> [As a side note, I thought it was an assuring move to have the Minister
               of Transport Lui Tuck Yew making personal visits to observe and ensure 
              that crisis management was carried out properly.]</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> When
               the MRT was built in the 1980s, it was at that time one of the most 
              modern mass transit systems in the world. I remember it felt pretty 
              exciting during those days when we tried out the new MRT, and sometimes,
               we would take it to nowhere in particular just for the fun of it. But 
              over the last 2 decades, technology has advanced rapidly, some 
              infrastructure has become dated and the load on the system has 
              multiplied manifold. Of course, this does not mean that we should 
              therefore accept service lapses. Singaporeans expect and deserve the 
              best possible mass transit system in the world, regardless of its age. 
              This also places a heavier responsibility on SMRT to focus on 
              maintenance, to keep standards of safety and service high. I can 
              appreciate that some parts of the infrastructure will be hard to change,
               e.g. we cannot build larger train platforms, but the tracks, rolling 
              stock, signalling equipment, etc. all can and should be regularly 
              inspected, serviced and upgraded.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Just as importantly, we 
              need good software. We need robust processes - on maintenance, crisis 
              management and service recovery; the staff need to be well trained; and 
              emergency procedures need to be regularly rehearsed. But more than 
              these, SMRT officers must have the right attitude. They should not be 
              working off templates (as some have pointed out…) but should instead be 
              able to respond competently, confidently and in a timely manner to an 
              evolving situation. They must have pride in the role that they play, no 
              matter how small it may seem in the grand scheme of things, because 
              major disasters are often the result of the smallest of lapses. After 
              all, it seems that a set of small claws on the third rail was what 
              caused the major problems. Above all, SMRT officers must possess a 
              strong service culture, motivated to always do what is best for 
              Singaporean commuters, and not just for achieving corporate goals. When 
              one has the right “heart”, it will show and I think Singaporeans will 
              appreciate that.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Finally, I know that the SMRT officers, 
              especially its frontline staff, backroom operators and engineers, have 
              gone through a lot these last few days. They are the people who work 
              through weekends and public holidays to keep trains running. They will 
              again be at their stations as many of the rest of us break for Christmas
               and the New Year. It is the season of giving, forgiveness and new 
              hopes. I hope they will keep up their spirits, and not feel too 
              dejected. Positive energy keeps us going (negativity drains our energy) 
              and I wish SMRT the best as it goes about addressing the problems it 
              faces. I hope the end of the year will also signal the end of problems 
              for our MRT systems, and that the new year will bring pleasant journeys 
              on our public transport for all!</span></p>
