              <p>There are now very few job openings for people living here....as most jobs are channelling towards providing for foreigners as they get top priorities now. In order to secure them a place to stay foot here. If you go to any job agencies here and apply for jobs, you will know that what priorities they give to the foreigners and not to the people here. Out of 10 applicants, there are 6 foreigners chasing for these jobs.</p>
              <p>And dont mentioned about elderly people above 40 or 50 yrs old...do you think they will stand a chance to survive under these severe conditions?  They stand very little chance of getting a decent job here, maybe to try their luck in the Casinos to earn a big buck if they are fortunate.</p>

              <p>More bullshit from PAP regime:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Goh Chok Tong attacks Chiam on union with Malaysia idea</strong></p>
              <p>May 01, 2006</p>
              <p>PEOPLE'S Action Party leaders - including Senior Minister Goh Chok
                          Tong - last night launched a scathing attack on veteran opposition
                          leader Chiam See Tong's idea for economic union between Singapore and
                          Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Speaking at a PAP rally in Potong Pasir,
                          Mr Goh - who has been tasked by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to help
                          the party's candidate Sitoh Yih Pin unseat incumbent Mr Chiam in the
                          coming elections - said the opposition leader was not being a 'realist'.</p>
              <p>He
                          was referring to Mr Chiam's suggestion at a rally in Chua Chu Kang Park
                          on Saturday that one way to grow the economy would be for Singapore and
                          Malaysia to strike an economic union.</p>
              <p>'Economic
                          union is possible only between two countries of equals, otherwise it is
                          not possible,' Mr Goh said. 'My point for bringing this out is, to show
                          that (while Mr Chiam) has some ideals, some vision, he is not a
                          realist.'</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam had also said on Saturday that
                          such a union would allow Singaporeans to travel freely to Malaysia, and
                          that because the Opposition has no history with the Malaysian
                          government, it could 'bargain on a clean slate' on bilateral issues.</p>
              <p>In
                          response, Mr Goh said: 'When it comes to negotiations with the
                          Malaysians, would you rather Lee Kuan Yew negotiate or Chiam See Tong?
                          Just ask yourself . . . would you rather I (or PM Lee) negotiate, or
                          Chiam See Tong?'</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam's comments also came under fire
                          from two other PAP leaders who turned up at the rally - Trade and
                          Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang and Minister for Community Development,
                          Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan - as well as Mr Sitoh himself.</p>
              <p>Mr
                          Balakrishnan noted that, while Mr Chiam's plan would allow Singaporeans
                          to 'pack their bags and travel to Malaysia anytime', it would also
                          allow equal access to Singapore.</p>
              <p>'His teammates in the
                          Singapore Democratic Alliance have been saying that foreigners have
                          been taking away jobs from Singaporeans,' Mr Balakrishnan said.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">
              </span></span></span></p><h1><strong>'You
                          want union? You want free entry of people, of foreigners . . . are you
                          really talking about making this place so everyone can come here? No
                          work permits, no employment pass no control? Think again. Think very
                          carefully,' he said.</strong></h1>
              <p></p>
              <p>In his speech, Mr Lim also questioned
                          Mr Chiam's suggestion, and asked Singaporeans to compare the economic
                          strategy of the PAP to that of the Opposition in order to judge who
                          would better serve their interests.</p>
              <p>'Mr Chiam says, we join
                          Malaysia, we have a market of 27 million straightaway. Therefore, we
                          can have double-digit growth every year,' Mr Lim said. 'Wah lau, so
                          easy ah . . . so why just join Malaysia? Why not join Indonesia? They
                          have 240 million people. Maybe triple-digit growth.'</p>

              That's like basically ç­‰æ­».    
              
              There are already PRC bus drivers driving public transport in the country and they are employed by SMRT / SBS ( the 2 companies that are increasing the bus fares every year to justify their operating cost ).  I wouldn't be surprised that there are PRCs working as van drivers and taxi drivers.
              
              <p>
              A better approach is to invest your cash and CPF into investments and let them grow.</p>

              <p>For men in their 40 or 50 yo, they should be at the apex of their careers, if you are still labouring on the ground by this time or sitting in some coffeeshops passing days, then something is very wrong, either u had a bad young life or simply wasted most of your life away. Worst of all is that i noticed that many Uncles like to patronise young gals at this age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For women in their 40 or 50, unless you are a career woman who can self support yourself and flirt around, otherwise for those lower office women or housewives, they should be taking care of the family finance and control the husband movement. Otherwise hor, some if not all the money would change hand into other women banks, especially those foreign gals who had account with  bank of china or vietnam or thai farmer bank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By 50yo, women should have menopause, but men got men no pause...damn, God is not fair to us!!</p>
