            <div class='col-md body'>This was taken out from a Straits times forum....something for you to look out.<br><br>INCIDENT ON THE NORTH-EAST LINE<br><br>Train doors almost crushed pram.<br><br>PARENTS travelling with young children on the North-East Line should exercise extra care.<br><br>On Saturday, at about 3 pm, I was at the Outram Park MRT station to board the Punggol-bound train. When the train came to a halt and the doors opened, I was near the front of the group that had just stepped on board. Suddenly, without warning, the doors started closing even though there was still a small crowd behind me. They slammed forcefully onto a pram that was halfway between the platform and the train. The pram was wedged<br>between the doors. The incident caught the crowd by surprise.<br><br>Fortunately,commuters on both sides of the doors reacted swiftly. But it took the combined strength of at least 10 men about 15 seconds to forcibly stop the doors from closing further and crushing the pram. In the melee, the couple's other toddler son who was walking behind the pram slipped one of his legs into the gap between the platform and the train. Luckily, the howling boy was immediately lifted clear of the gap without suffering any injury.<br><br>Even as all these were happening, several passengers were frantically searching for an emergency button or intercom-phone. But nobody could locate one. After the pram was freed, the parents sat down in the train and calmed their children. The train was strangely quiet; everyone was stunned. The father declined to make a report. And the train didn't move as the doors that had been forced open were apparently jammed. No station staff came down immediately to investigate the incident. When I made my way to the station office after more than five minutes, I found them huddled around TV monitors, apparently trying to get the train<br>moving again.<br><br>I told them what had happened. Several of them then rushed down to the platform. But their priority was to isolate the technical fault and get the train moving. I stayed behind to explain to the station-master how the pram got caught between the doors. What appalled me was that the station-master had absolutely no interest in the incident. He waved me away with a feedback form and asked me<br>to submit it to the company. I wonder what he said in his daily report. If the mother pushing the pram had been there during off-peak hours and no one was on board or on the platform to stop the doors from slamming shut with great force, the pram could have been crushed, and the child seriously injured, or worse.<br><br>The incident made me wonder what safety mechanisms are in place in the driverless trains. Why did the doors close without warning even though many people were still boarding? Why didn't the doors retract automatically when they hit the pram?<br><br>Are there sensors or motion detectors to stop the doors from closing on a person? Where are the emergency button and intercom-phone? Why are they not positioned for instant recognition and easy access? Was it a case of human or computer error? Are the station staff properly trained to prevent such accidents and to handle emergencies? Why were they so blase about what could have been a fatal accident?</div>
