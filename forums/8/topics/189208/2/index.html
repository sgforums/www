Basically, have a personal goal and plan to be financially independent. Invest your time wisely. Money lost can be earned back, but time lost can never be gotten back.<br><br>By the way, a diploma or degree only help you get a job, it does not determine if you are successful or not. My point is you can still do well in financial line if you put in the effort.</div></blockquote>okay i agree with u but some jobs do not really require specific knowledge. tasks are directly affecting your commission (e.g sales) so die die u have to please your clients or customers...u do that well of course u get your comission . a diploma or degree is what some representatives of employers (i will not put the blame on employers) are using as a chip on the table to mark your renumeration down</div>
