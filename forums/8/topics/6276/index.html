It was great to know you people.<br><br>As for cooking, I think you all miss out the true hero, our personal satay guy, Eck.<br><br>Eck:<br>Thanks for the cooking, you can be a great pro at this.<br><br>Willa:<br>*laffs* Dun think too highly of me, I'm just trying to buaya you. Your smile and that tongue of yours is too great a charm for me to resist.<br><br>Lex:<br>How baby? Did you get home safely? I sure hope you did. Or I would kill myself for not sending you home.<br><br>Tet:<br>Sorry my dearest, I can't be exculsively your for the night, but dun worry, I'll still be your knight for the rest of the month as promise. *LOL* And yes, you do look so cute tonight, with the little red hat. I almost wanted to bear my arms for you to bite. But then again, I think that would bring jealousy to the rest and so I save it for our private moments. *winks*<br><br>Chief:<br>I have to agree with Maya on your complexion, smooth as silk and white as snow. See you around often.<br><br>Worm:<br>Sorry you gotta leave early, but hey It's great knowing you, and your fetish of course. And thanx for commenting on my big butt.*LOL*<br><br>NCMK:<br>Hope you join us more often, and hey, it's your first outing so being shy is excusable. But no second chances ok? *laffs*<br><br>Ace:<br>Gald that you find us fun, and enjoy the outing. Dun give us a miss ok?<br><br>Airex:<br>No did not forget you, join us more, and I'm sure we will pronouce your nick by correctly. *LOL*<br><br>Secerts:<br>No, I'm not trying to pick you up with the faye thingy, and I sure hope to see you around more often.<br><br>errie:<br>Remeber to bring your tie the next time, forget it, I'll be your tie*laffs*, you cutesy baby. I love to boogie with you.<br><br>YLH:<br>Great to know you, hope I did not frighten you with my buayaness. *LOL* But hey, all in the name of fun.<br><br>Petridish:<br>Yes, we did not talk much, as the gals were busy keeping me busy, but hey, we can catch up in an all guys outing, how's that?<br><br>Eastpark:<br>Give me sometime, and I will compare our chest next time. The gym is calling out to me. And dun you go around bullying my Maya, or I'll use my "dear" attack on you again. *LOL*<br><br>Bochup:<br>Well at least the effort to come was there, you made a fine addition to our fun.<br><br>Xue:<br>Not sure if you will see this, but i think you will make 1 fine lady.<br><br>Sonic:<br>You deserve the Mr. Sgforums all right, As for the crap. I sure hope you enjoy it. *LOL* Go polish up, and I'm sure you are unbeatable with those boyish good looks.<br><br>Su:<br>So how you find your way home? hope it was not too difficult.<br><br>Awe:<br>You sure is the star of the night, everyone is complimenting on your...ermmm...you know what I want to say.<br><br>Maya:<br>Thanks for the company, I sure hope that you reach home safely. And yes, you look great tonight, I love the new haircut. The breeze was great and the moon was romantic.
