            <div class='col-md body'>They just sell insurance from Manulife, AXA, Asialife, HSBC and some lesser known companies.<br><br>They always say because they are IFAs, (Independent Financial Advisors), they can  recommend a plan that best suit your requirement. This is not true. They sell based on which policy gives them a higher com.<br><br>Go at your own risk. Just because they are not the normal AIA, prudential, ntuc, common insurance companies doesn't mean they are any better. In fact, I'll pick AIA/prudential/ntuc/great eastern any day.<br><br>Examples of other IFAs are IPP Capital, First Principle, etc.<br><br>There is this term "Vesting" that applies to their companies. Meaning they will still receive commission from their insurance sales even after they had left the company. (AIA/ntuc/GE/prud/ they do not get anything if they leave.)  So if I'm with this IFA today, I sell you based on the plan that gives me the highest com. 2-3 years later, I may jump to another IFA or quit this line altogether and work some other job, and I'll still continue to get the com from the premiums you are paying. Good right?<br><br>And, if you need help/clarification/claims on the policies you had bought, I'll ask you to call the company directly. It's hands off for me.<br><br>And I'll bet you the person who took over your policies from me won't good a good job for you. He's getting nothing servicing you.<br><br>Cheeers.<br></div>
