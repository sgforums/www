            <div class='col-md body'>i am a realist, and also a atheist...<br><br>i know that the shooting is a bad event to the victims and to the familes and friends.....<br><br>however, to say that the event is totally senseless reflects a lack of understanding of reality and the fact that people are living a delusional life.<br><br>firstly, we all have read news everyday that death of all kinds of shape and sizes happen. freak accidents, homicides and whatever bizzare way you can die... choking to over fishball is also very unlucky but that is the way it is...<br><br>i can understand that when kins die... its natural to die, to grief and blame the killer... however.. we must also learn from the event and realise that this kind of event is not senseless as you think...<br><br>in london, news has reported a rise in teenage stabbing and death which is also senseless. due to the lack of video coverage and sensationalisation effect, it is not widely reported...<br><br>so called senseless and freak death has always existed and will continue to exist in today digital age.. therefore, it is not a new thing..<br><br>the only thing new is that people are not facing reality. i also hope that this events will make people learn about reality and shows that there is no god at all.<br><br>look here. first, we know that mad people exist. people who are depressed and filled with hatred against the society exist. perhaps we masses have been too indulged in IPOD, sex, partying and love to know that ugly things exist on earth.<br><br>if people want to minimize these crimes and accidents, the solution is not to pray. its pointless. real action have to be taken like forming group to tackle problem. that would means you to see less youtube and play less often.<br><br>if you want to indulge in fun and pleasure while the poor remains poor and the depressed remain depressed, then be prepared that the crime rate and psychopaths number will not be reduced.<br><br><strong> the CHO guy was indeed wrong to kill others and he was basically mentally mad also. but it is not very surprisng or senseless to me that this kind of things can occur.</strong><br><br>mentally unstable people in life<br>guns that can be purchased in US<br>we still have rich poor gap in modern world<br>most of us are mostly concerned about finding our own happiness<br><br>given these circumstances, i have no doubt that shooting incidents can occur...<br><br>its not that senseless if you look and think about life more clearly...<br><br></div>
