              <p>I myself thinks that the current path that mankind is currently heading into is a path of no return, to put it simply, a path that leads towards depleting the world resources and ultimately our own extinction.</p>
              <p>We spend too much time working, then earning the so call money(which some say is the devil's gift), and ultimately we spend it. This is the way economy works now, where everyone had to contribute in one way or another by working and also by spending back the money back to the economy.</p>
              <p>But had anyone ever questioned do we really need the stuff that we're buying? Do you still remember the movies or dvds you're watched years ago? do you still play playstation one? do you still use iphone 2G? do you still use windows 95? All these products is basically the same, what i mean is windows 95 is the same as windows vista, and iphone 2G is the same as iphone 3GS, they're just different generations and you just pay a money to have the 'latest' version which speaking relatively, it's actually the same. We work, economy moves, shares rises, property rises and resources get used up faster and faster. Oil is going to be used up in another 80yrs time(just one generation) and sadly no reliable alternatives is available, and shockily, even if there's alternative, our buildings, infrastructure will not be equipped to tap into this new source, so we're definitely DEAD within the next 200 years(which is amazing short given the amount of time we've evolved as human) </p>
              <p>I myself feels the correct way is to cut down on technological advancement, lets face it, we don't need a iphone every year (if there's no one new model every year, we'll always own the latest model), we don't need a new movie per month, we don't need new games every month (we'll forget how to play it years from now anyway) etc. We should build a world whereby everyone works maybe 1-2 days a week (if everyone in the world do that, it's basically the same as working 5 days a week), then we can spend the rest of our time talking, playing simple games, or just relaxing instead of participating in the vicious cycle that we're currently in. The world will be moving slowly if thats the case, but nature is a slow machine, no point rushing here and there when life itself tooks it own sweet time. Life must be moving slowly in order to be appreciated.</p>
              <p>But given the way nations and companies of the free world market is being lay out currently, where 1 major world power is check by another major world power and companies is being checked by their competitors. NO ONE can stop this cycle, america can't be the first to stop moving their economy with the world's other power still powering their economy on, countries can't be the first to cut down "significantly" on their natural resource output without risking falling behind their competitor countries, no one can stop it now. It is a joke even thinking that countries will work together for the sake of mankind, cause lets face it, they'll need to earn points for their own political reasons back on their own country, no point worrying stuff which is generation ahead when their own office term is til the next election which is only 4-5 years to go. They would only want the market to move and economy to prosper so they can remain in office.</p>
              <p>So lets face it, we're definitely DEAD, so don't bother having kids cause i can almost assure you they'll experience a world war that makes WW2 seems like a kids game in their lifetime, good news is, you and I are safe, since we'll not be alive when that happens.</p>

              <p>Humans are raping the earth everyday. now mother nature is angry and is fighting back. the weather is getting hotter by the years. very soon, the temperature of the globe will soon rise to 40 and we will be scorched to death.</p>
              <p>the culprits are the state and companies mining or exploiting for raw materials and natural resources. but indirectly we are the consumers of the end product, like it or not. when people abstained from eating shark fins due to the killings of sharks in the oceans for their fins, how come no one stood up for forests and trees? you should avoid buying from IKEA, and those furniture goods to save trees and papers. how about abstaining use of paper in office for a stand against logging of forests and trees? how about going paperless and bookless online.</p>

              <p>I myself feels democracy fails in this area. A system which goes towards the majority will always display the qualities of the majority. In this perspective will be greed,selfishness.</p>
              <p>As much as we all agree that much action have to be taken, who is willingly to be the first to stay away from eating shark fins? who is willingly to be the first country to step away from industralisation?</p>
              <p>We're all addicted to the modern economy although some are not aware of it, we need all the things that we have now in order to survive, just like some drug abusers who need drugs. We need internet, we need new iphone per year, we need to watch new movies, we need to have new places to go every weekend and new countries to tour, we work hard so we can have money to go for all these, in other words, we're all slaves to the economy, completely manipulated and tuned to the way the devil want us to work. And the democratic government is slave to the people. We're all slave to one another.</p>
              <p>Ever watch the recent japanese movie - ultimate gambler? There're a scene in it which i think deserve our thinking, when kaji earns his first paycheck in the underground facility, he's being lured into all the fantastic food and stuff which drives him to spend almost all his paycheck, all of course is a evil plot to make sure he keeps spending his hardearn money so he can never repay his debt and therefore be forever a slave down there. Isnt that what we are now? We're all being attracted to all the various elements in this modern society that we can't resist not buying it, we can't stop using it, we cannot live without money - we can't live without working, isnt that make us a slave? Different methods but end result is the same.</p>

              <p>In Singapore,</p>
              <p>Without oil, all our oil power plants/transport vehicles will fail.</p>
              <p>Without electricity, all our computers and electrical appliances will fail.</p>
              <p>Without computers and electrical tools, all our banks and companies will fail.</p>
              <p>The economy will crash and all of us will be out of jobs/income.</p>
              <p>All our electrically-powered water plants and pumps will fail. We will need to collect clean water from rain and reservoirs. (assuming there is no water pollution or drought)</p>
              <p>And without farms to produce food, people will start killing and stealing from one another for food.</p>
              <p>Having lost everything, people will go crazy and start killing anyone and commiting sucides.</p>
