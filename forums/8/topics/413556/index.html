              <p>Just noticed there is a lot of talk about foreigners in Singapore.  i get it... and suddenly to be remotely associated as a PRC is a BAAD thing.</p>
              <p>Some Singaporean friends i speak to say as "long as you did NS," you're cool.</p>
              <p>But I wanted to ask how cool you are with foreigners? To what extent does National Service give a foreigner the right to be a citizen?</p>
              <p>There are the full foreigners that have green cards... they are not eligible for what seems to be increasing benefits for Singaporeans (like cheap schools.. ha ha or voting... lol)  But they are foreigners none-the-less.</p>
              <p>Then There are the PRs.. that are here to "make money' try and purchase HDB property and live here as a resident while keeping onto their own citizenship.  Some of them enjoy cheaper University and school costs here.</p>
              <p>Then there are the PRs that have completed national service and are citizens.</p>
              <p><br>How cool are you with the 3rd type?  Are they accepted amongst you? Or are they still foreign and should pack up? </p>

              <p>NSF pay should increase. it should tag with the ministers pay increase.</p>
              <p>the ratio of peearse and floor traps i companies is too high. event if ghamen has enforced a rule fo ratio X:Y, tehre are still many companies out there nto following. i know becasue alsthougnc a company is ISO certified a product is ROHS compliant, the source still have no certification of confromance to delcare ROHS complaint. i know because if a spring were to be made to tolerate and peform at a force of 6.5N/mm per drawing specification, a source can also make a spring with similar form factor and ship it to customer even if no readings were taken opr if the spring do not meet this basic finctional parameter. in the measurement report the stupid inspector just type and spoof the readings only. when got problem -  - --sampling check mah.</p>

              <p>There are many types of foreigners. You have to get clear who is who first. </p>
              <p>Foreign talent/Foreign workers: Foreign talents and workers holder certain qualification and skills. They come to Singapore to work and never intend to stay long in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Immigrants are people who left their country and migrate to Singapore. </p>
              <p>What the Singaporean detest is not the foreigners themselves but rarer the government's funny policy in importing people into Singapore. Why do we spend so much money to artificially import people to Singapore, without first considering the benefit of Singaporeans?</p>
              <p>The growth of population in Singapore is so dramatical over the years. Our facilities, transports and employments cannot coped with sudden increased. </p>
              <p>NS does not meant anything at all. All the females Singaporeans do not do NS. This do not made the females a lesser Singaporeans then a male. And how about the people who migrate at the age of 35 years, they are too old to do NS. And this argument can goes on. NS is nothing of relevance to migration policy. </p>
