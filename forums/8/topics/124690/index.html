            <div class='col-md body'>Wilko hits out at Sven snub<br><br>Mookie Pal<br>info@sleague.com<br><br>Geylang United star John Wilkinson has hit out at Sven-Goran Eriksson for ignoring his growing claims for a place in the England squad.<br><br>Versatile forward Wilkinson is in a rich vein of form at Bedok but has been left mystified by Eriksson's refusal to include him in the England squad for their previous two World Cup qualifiers against Northern Ireland and Azerbaijan.<br><br>The 25-year-old also hinted at a strained relationship between himself and Swede Eriksson, saying that they "did not see eye to eye".<br><br>"I'm devastated at being left out of the England squad because I've always wanted to wear the Three Lions and help the national team do well," said Wilkinson.<br><br>"Just because I'm playing abroad shouldn't mean I can't get a look in. I'm surprised Sven's not been to Singapore to see me even once.<br><br>"Look at who he's got in the team. Surely I've got to be ahead of Phil Neville in the running. And although Joe Cole's doing well now, I think I'd be even better there because I've got more pace," said Wilkinson.<br><br>Wilkinson, currently joint-topscorer in the S.League with five goals from four games, believes his international exile at the hands of the beleaguered Swede springs from a poor personal relationship between the two.<br><br>"Sven and I don't see eye-to-eye. After all that's happened, I'm not sure England should have a foreign coach. If Terry Venables was in charge, I'm sure I would've gotten a chance.<br><br>"Venables might not spend as much time with the secretaries at the Football Association and he'd definitely recognise true English talent," said Wilkinson.<br><br>Geylang coach Scott O'Donell has also come out in support of Wilkinson's international ambitions.<br><br>"I'm very surprised and disappointed that John wasn't included in Sven's squad," said O'Donell. "He certainly doesn't lack any self-confidence so he would bring a lot of confidence to the England squad."<br><br>Eriksson has refused to comment publicly on Wilkinson's claims, but insiders at Soho Square have revealed that the crafty Swede was angered by the outburst.<br><br>He reportedly told his inner circle: "I was prepared to give him (Wilkinson) a chance but now he's blown it. (Woodlands Wellington midfielder) Mark Williams has got a better chance than him now."<br><br>While the relationship between Wilkinson and Eriksson is bound to be further dented by the latest outburst, the Geylang star's international hopes could yet be rescued by the intervention of England skipper David Beckham.<br><br>It was revealed by Spanish paper Marca last week that Wilkinson and Real Madrid midfielder Beckham share a close friendship, including frequent shopping trips to Paris and Milan together.<br><br>"Yeah, I often help Dave out when he's a bit short, or when he needs an opinion on a new sarong, so I'm hoping he'll put in a word with Sven for me," said Wilkinson.<br><br>"But I'm not holding any high hopes. Sven'll probably put Emile Heskey in instead. I mean, come on, Emile Heskey?"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
