            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I chose the exclamation/caution icon.  I was inspired by the voxbox "things u didn't know", and adults' words that said that it's such a sad thing that todays youths know nuts about sex.<br><br>I have to believe in what he says...to an extent.  I would like to say that in the past, it was worse.  U had to learn about sex and reproduction from watching farm animals...or cats and dogs going at it...:-)<br><br>Today's generation is not much better.  As with many things in Singapore society, we have learned to be more open and a bit more accepting and willing to experiment and try new things...but we have not developed any platform or forum for free speech about these new things.  Blame it on Asian values or the Gov, but whatever it is, we don't have the appropriate forum for speech...and writing in to GO magazine and TEENS doesn't count as a forum for discussion and understanding...<br><br>Let's take a look at sex education in Singapore...I was watching a show on Channel NewsAsia the other week and they were on this ssubject.  It seems that now a days, more and more youths want to experiment and try out sex.  But noone wants to tell them what the hell it is.  Parents don't want to say.  Pai-Sei.<br><br>...Evil, immoral thing to talk about, will lead children astray, will give them an idea that parents condone it if they talk about it...<br><br>Churches and mosques definately won't talk about it.  Taboo subject or too immoral.<br><br>Schools won't talk about it for fear of leading kids astray and give them wrong impression that Government institutions condone pre-marital sex.<br><br>It seems that Singapore schools and Government have realised that they need to teach kids thesse things instead of learning it the hard way...or from wrong sources the wrong way.  So they decidde to send out teachers who specialise in the subject to go and give talks to schools all over the small island of Singapore.<br><br>What I saw was a trvesty to learning.  It makes a mockery of everything that the institution of learning stands for...U should see how they teach these children about sex.  They try and make it seem that u are evil minded and morally wrong to find girls sexually attractive.  and that they were evil  perverts for even thinking such things,...and if they did it, they would suffer great consequences to their humanity and spirituality.,...and their parents, friends and teachers would all disown them.<br><br>By GOD!!!U don't go and tell children these kind of things.  And they call themselves educators.  No wonder noone here knows little about sex and although most people here do it, they hide it behind a facade of innocence and" decency'.<br><br>I detest this style of teaching, if u can call it that.  They've managed to turn something that had the potential of being a great learning experience into a scare tactic to stop people from doing things the gov. doesn't want them to do.  they've turned such a beautiful thing into a thing of fear.<br><br>Is it any wonder that our children go astray and never let us know about it.  Their sex teachers make sure they are too scared about the subject to speak.  And it's all taught by old aunties and ladies in their 50's +++.  These people have no idea of what it's like now a days.  They totally grew up in a very diffferent environment and social setting...and their moral views aren't on cue with todays youths.<br><br>u can't bend people to ur will, u must bend urself for the people.<br><br>What they need to do is educate!!!Educate and not preach if u really want people to learn. Of all the people I know in Singapore, only one person's mother told her about the birds and the bees.  An astoundingly low number.<br><br>And even the things they do teach properly about sex doesn't cover or say enough.<br><br>In the west, they teach us in school all about it.  where what hole is and what it looks like and they even play porn0 movies in University for educational purposes...as if teaching us in high school wasn't enough...:-)  but they make sure that we do know...and I went to a Catholic school...so go figure...<br><br>Now it may seem that westerners are looser than asians..I thought that at first.  i truly did...until I came to singapore.  When I was first here, I thought that Everyone with the exception of the few sluts here and there, were virgins and had never experienced it..because of the asian value thing...<br><br>But as I stayed here longer and got to know more people, I began to realise that it was just on the surface.  Behind closed doors, they become something different.  It was only just within the last couple years that I realised this.  Wow, Asians are sexual creatures after all...It's just that the westerners are more open about what they do...They see nothing wrong with it...While We do see something wrong with it.  and it's all built into our subconscious by our society and parents/grand-parents...etc...And most make us feel that it's wrong somehow.<br><br>If our teens are going to do it whether everyone disagrees or not, we better be prepared to take responsibility for teaching them what they need to know.  Or else the teachers, parents, etc... are to blame.  ok, not all the time, but u must know the logic of it.  I don't care whether people think that it's immoral to teach teens such things, but u must. We have to understand that we must open our minds to this and cannot fall back on old ways of thinking that are inappropriate for dealing with new issues/problems in a new societal context. If we make it compulsory for people to take driving lessons, why not teach them sex education?  It doesn't make sense.<br><br>Let's not fail our generation.<br><br>"No army can withstand an idea whose time has come..."<br><br>What R Ur views on this?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, i do agree of having sex education in Singapore..<br>U sure give a lot of good points..<br>I am sure that if Government want to implement this education in Singapore, they will do this in the early stages..and not waiting for now..For this familiar topic is already known to many of the ppl in Singapore..<br>There is pros and Cons regarding the implementation of this education.<br>Even without this education, most of us already know sex thru' several sources..(XXX VCD, magazines..etc)..So there is no need for the education anyway..I really admired the Daring young ones who tried the forbidden fruit. Hate to say, time has change...<br><br>Now Singapore is lacking of children now and maybe in the future, in the Newpaper, it mention of Singapore is lacking less than 50 000(estimate) children per yr...maybe due to the stress of the working class ppl..So i wonder if the government will encourage the<br>next generation havin more babies?hehe...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm.... this reminds me of a story a friend once told me....<br><br>There was this uneducated(no formal education) couple who couldn't concieve for years and the wife was complaining of pain during sex. So they went to a doctor hoping he could solve their problems.<br><br>So what happened? Due to their ignorance(no education) it seems that the husband had been sticking "Mr Happy" into his wife's rear end and not her privates.... Which explains the pain and why the wife couldn't conceive....<br><br>Ouch! Hope that doesn't happen on my first time  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Would be sooooo embarrassing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok....what a long and insightful article...now I must structure my reply too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Just to comment that from a personal point of view, I have always believed in the "Caucasians are looser, Asians are more conservative" concept, whether I am errorneous or not has yet to be proven. As I grew up in a relatively "clean" environment, I was not exposed to sex, dirty stuff and taboo things all my life. I find it still hard to accept the fact that Asians are sexual creatures, women can be horny and other things many guys treat as normal. Don't blame me for this cos it's been really "clean" for me all my life !<br><br>Even in the Army, I used to hear of guys talking about their exploits, but took them all with a pinch of salt. In my opinion, I could never understand why guys wanted to have pre-marital sex and play with girls and all that. It just didn't occur to me that's all, and the Army gave me a different perspective. The entrance to University had dampened this point of view considerably, because (seemingly) the girls there were conservative, blur about sex, unused to being close to a guy etc...<br><br>This image was drained into me as I studied there for 2 years...couples are seen in school only holding hands, never doing anything "worse"...and it has made me believe that Asians are indeed either 1) Conservative or 2) Frigid ! I had this sanitized notion that all couples are clean and only hold hands and they don't DO anything in the privacy of their hostel rooms. Probably some NUS or NTU student is laughing as he/she reads this right now....but that's what I observed for 2 years, and it hasn't helped to change my opinion that Singaporeans are conservative/frigid.<br><br>So firewire, how did you accumulate evidence to make you conclude that Asians are very sexual ? I guess it might be the people you hang out with...becos I never stepped into a disco or a pub in my life...ad my friends are  all the very studious type who don't go around brainstorming ideas on sex and relationships. So please...any of you, just tell me ? Thanks !<br><br>As for sex education, it's been long recognized that the government is not teaching it very effectively. They cover the biological aspect of it but not the emotional aspect of it...and this makes students try to learn it in their own ways. Ignorance about sex is appalling I agree, especially when it concerns the entire human race's going concern ! From what I found out, girls and guys tend to be rather clueless about sex.<br><br>When I say clueless, I don't mean they don't know how to do it (animals have a natural tendency to copulate), but they are blur about aspects of sexual diseases, types of contraception, pregnancy, and other details of relationships. Perhaps this is what leads to abortions and STDs.<br><br>I myself learnt about bird and bees because I studied Biology in secondary school and all the way through junior college too. Basically my knowledge of sex is purely textbook-based, which is ll about chemicals and structures. One textbook even defined the "orgasm" in terms of which muscle contracted at which times to produce certain effects.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Education for our youth will always be stunted because of the perception that such knowledge is taboo or wrong. Firewire, don't expect any improvements for at least 30 to 50 years, if any. People are slow to accept new things and teenagers will continue their personal experimentations irregardles of how much info we can pump into them. Sad but true fact of life I suppose.....<br><br>Even till now, I am clueless about the whole sexual process (never had any FIRST time)...and would probably act like a fool when it comes to really making love to a woman. But then, who's to blame ?<br><br>Definitely not me... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
