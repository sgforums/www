Like I say, why NOT? No committment no nuttin......<br></div></blockquote>Well, Pixie_gal,<br><br>For the first thing, it is in my principles that I would not go for one night stand, because I am searching for something permanent. If I want to have sex with a gal, I would do it because I love her, not because I lust for her. Besides, I don't want to sleep around because I want to fulfil my sexual desires. So, whether I go for one-nite stands or not, it is not related to my wife being a virgin or not. That is two seperate issues.<br><br>Then coming back to my spouse, if she is not a virgin, there is nothing I can do. Virginity is just an traditional virtue which made tedious by morality and religion. I value it as a virtue, but not many people might think of it as a virtue, because our morals are subjected to the social norms of the society.<br><br>There should not be a segregation of virgins and non-virgins, because we are all humans. We are allowed to make mistakes and because of that, we should be tolerant of mistakes and forgive and forget.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>
