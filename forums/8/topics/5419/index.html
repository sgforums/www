I'm new here, and looking at the previous thread where there was some sound tips from ataraxia, decided to post a question to all:<br><br>How long is it after you know the other person before you guys (and girls) get attached?<br>I know there are probably many different answers to this, but juz wanted to get a gauge of the average/normal/(and extreme) times....<br><br></div>

She is outgoing and I am an introvert.  I sometimes think how could a very different couple stay together.  Maybe they need one another to compensate each other shortcomings.  I hope u know what i am talking about!  I am not a great writer.<br><br>One more point.  I definitely don't regret being attached.  But, I sometimes feel that it is nice to be a single.  Ie., do things  whenever and whatever I like such as buying a Merc without asking for opinion and permission.  U know who is the financial controller here!

            <div class='col-md body'>To Clausius:<br><br>Those are good questions you are asking.  Is it possible for an introvert and an extrovert to become attached? Hmmm!  I don't really know!  What happened to me may not apply to everyone.  All I can say is that she and me hardly have any similar interests.  Occasionally, she complains to me that she is dating an "old man" and finds me boring!!!.<br>But she is attached to me because there are more pros quality than cons quality in me, I think?  Or else, she would have dumped me a long time ago.  Of course, there are times that we need to reconcile differences between her and me.  Sometimes, the reconciliation gets very rough.  I get "beaten" badly most of the time.  In fact, it is 100% of the time!  HAHAHAHA!  I am not a good arguer in heated situations. Also, knowing her very well, I would not want to escalate the argument.  Or else, I would just get myself into deeper trouble.  So I compromised most the time.<br><br>So, all what I know is that she is going to be married to me in a couple of years time.<br><br>Sorri... can't really answer your questions but these help!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's all up to individual. The very first girl that I like so much, I waited for 3 years!!1 During these 3 years, she changed 3 bf, and I was never on her mind. We were classmate from sec 1 to 4. So by sec 3, I really fallen for her. She knows it. The whole world knows it. At that time, we are very good friend. But I hope to improve to closer relationship but I failed.<br><br>But what came to a shock for me when school reopen for sec 4, she's ATTACHED!!!! I was down but still not ready to give up. Some of my friends say I toopid but well, it's me so dun bother about that. But really went on in my mind which till now i still can't figure out. During the Nov sec 3 hols, she asked me this qn "who is the girl I like?". So I just reply "You lah!". And then she laughed! And I laugh and we hang up the phone soon coz of incoming calls. Then when school reopen, really shock to hear that news.<br><br>After some time, I asked her when she got attach, she told me it's somewhere in Nov!! I don't believe this man! Is it becoz I never ask her first??? After our Os, she went on the JC and I thought WHY I din follow her there but I can't coz need to work. She broke up when this bf and I thought here comes my chances but sigh, it's someone else this time.....<br><br>So this goes on and till I finally, fully, totally, wholeheartedly, breavely, smartly, stupidly, watever-watever-ly gave up on her! I told her. In fact during these 3 years, she kepting telling me to give up but I just dun feel like giving up.<br><br>So my story ends here...<br>hehehe...still haven't gone in your qn...take your time is what I alawyz believe in....don't rush into it, esp relationship.. if you are meant to be together, you will be....believe in FATE!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> duel of fate?!?!?!<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
