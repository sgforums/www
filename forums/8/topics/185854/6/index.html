Is it because girls<br>would serve their country without being told to? ok what kinda national service are girls already doing? questions that can start another discussion thread.<br><br>Basically guys just need to go on with NS knwing they have done their part.For gals stop looking national service as a male thing and show wat u can or wat u have already been doing for ur country.Hope to have some female responses  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

This is due to the reduction of manpower in the VARIOUS MINISTRIES as a result of the " conscipted female clerks and receptionists" . Operating costs will lower. The reduction in taxes not only applies to guys it will also apply to all the girls since they had served national service. Morevover, such work experience in these jobs will also benefit the girls when they go out work next time. This may even increase the overall work productivity of the workers, leading to better economy.</div>

I guess most guys just cant stand the idea of us gals so-called relaxing and shopping whilst you guys have to spend 2 years serving the country right???<br><br>The thing is, if gals do NS, the economy wlll suffer because everyone will graduate later, start work later etc etc.<br><br>If guys &amp; gals do NS, <strong>we gals graduate later=start work later=later marriages=lesser kids</strong><br><br>And making us do NS will make us <strong>tough women</strong>....haha. No more sweet, ladylike women to peel prawns for you guys.<br><br>We will be having even higher standards than before.<br><br>All in all, women will be relatively more tough-minded after NS &amp; <strong>lesser</strong> women will be happy being housewives or even having kids.<br><br>Sheesh...doing NS AND giving birth is like doing Spore too many favours already.</div>
