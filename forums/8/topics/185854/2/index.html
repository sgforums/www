            <div class='col-md body'><strong>i said that ballotting is probably more fair than conscription by sex. i never say it is fair. pls understand the difference.</strong><br><br>but this will lead to more troubles. it's fairness versus practicality. do u think ppl will accept that whether they waste 2 years (which is a lot of time) or not depends on something that is not as concrete as going by gender? i think we will end up with more defaulters years back, and by now we're invaded by malaysia.<br><br><strong>again i say the admin structure can allow for females. not the dxo taken over by nsfs. the female nsf can be clerks, right?? some how i think either you just refuse to get the point, trying to avoid it or are abit dense.</strong><br><br>the structure allow for females, u can have female NSF clerks, but do u really wan that to happen. can u guarantee the minimum quota of ppl to sign on as regulars just to handle sensitive issues?<br><br><strong>we?? what we?? who are the we? case closed? perhaps which is why pple are trying to get it open since certain pple are presumptiously shutting it out.<br><br>you argue certain roles need to be taken by males to be effective, are you by the same sentence admitting that for other roles the sex doesn't matter or females may even be more suitable? i'm not even arguing why you think the role can be done better by the male.</strong><br><br>in fact, for most roles in the military context, males are more effective.<br><br><strong>i am not advocating conscription to waste their 2 years i am advocating conscription as needed. note that  said we can free up the males in exchange for the time the females spend to serve. in essence the time "wasted" is the same. and it is not a wastage for the sake of it, and it can be justified.</strong><br><br>so you wan to escape your NS liabilities? there is no exchange, guys will have to serve, unless u wan this important pillar of the nation to collapse. just look at the mervyn tan case and the ensuing furore.<br><br><strong>as far as i am concerned you have presumptiously closed the case and nothing you have said or at the af forum has satisfactorily cleared the case. perhaps you are the one who needs to be enlightened.</strong><br><br>that is because it is not my duty to answer ur question. i will only go thus far. if u think u have a valid point, by all means, pls write to the newspaper, and we can have a good debate at the national platform.</div>
