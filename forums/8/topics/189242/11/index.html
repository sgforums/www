As a part of the policy to limit the influence of the Chinese Communists and to encourage the ethnic Chinese to assimilate, the state required Indonesian Chinese individuals to change their names. This was a difficult balance because while the names were changed, laws continued to identify them as 'different' from indigenous Indonesian groups. Indonesian businessman Liem Sioe Liong, for example, had his name changed to Sudono Salim. With Suharto's downfall came new laws, one of which allowed the Chinese to revert to Chinese family names,<br><br>Many of the later generations have kept the Indonesian form of the name. Other Indonesian Chinese, however, maintain their Chinese name as well as their family names. As is customary with Chinese names, the family name (or surname) is traditionally written in front of the given (or first) name.</blockquote>even in france..u have to have French name<br><br>i think they want to make it ONE NATION ONE PEOPLE...<br><br></div>

There's a simple reason: Amid the horrifying riots that left more than 1,000 dead in this troubled country in May, Chinese women -- some just young girls -- were subjected to a systematic campaign of brutal, ugly rape.<br><br>For ethnic Chinese women, that awful assault has turned their homeland into a republic of terror.<br><br>For Ayasanjaya, it means good business. He sold just a few hundred of the sad devices after putting them on the market in mid-July last year. After "the tragedy in May," sales have shot up to around 5,000 units, he says.<br><br>Republic of Rape<br><br>There is perhaps no better evidence of the terrible crimes committed against Chinese women during the riots than the success of Ayasanjaya's anti-rape belt.<br><br>Though human rights groups have protested and even filed a $4 billion lawsuit against the Indonesian government on behalf of victims of the May riots, little has been said so far about this horrifying, public campaign of mass sexual assault.<br><br>Slowly, piece by piece, the abominable story of the public rape campaign is emerging. The government and army have promised to investigate the awful attacks, but few expect them to confirm the worst tales of terror.<br><br>Many even believe that the Indonesian army -- dominated by Muslim Indonesian natives -- encouraged and condoned the anti-Chinese rampage that was set off after soldiers gunned down six students at a Jakarta university. The riots were described at the time as a "democratic uprising" against the repressive regime of former President Suharto. Now it looks like they were primarily a sick orgy of violence and rape, directed against the affluent Chinese minority that dominates commerce in this massive Southeast Asian nation.<br><br>According to a recent report in the Sydney Morning Herald, during the riots young Chinese girls were pulled from their cars and raped in the street -- while a mob of angry Indonesian men watched the vulgar crime.<br><br>Elsewhere, Muslim gangs bashed their way into Chinese homes where they raped wives and daughters, often forcing their fathers to watch, before looting the houses for anything of value and then, as a final insult, setting their homes on fire.<br><br>The rapes were -- according to the worst reports from witnesses -- atrocious and indiscriminate. Pre-adolescent children were attacked. Elderly women were violated. After being raped, some were pushed back into their houses.<br><br>Then the houses were torched -- with the victims inside.<br><br>The Indonesian Human Rights Commission says it now possesses detailed evidence of 168 rapes of women and children, including evidence that 20 of those victimes later died from their wounds or were simply slaughtered by their attackers, the Herald reported.<br><br>"For the Chinese if you are raped it is not just a deep social shame, it is a curse, you can no longer be seen as a human being," a woman identified only as Ester, who runs a telephone hotline for the anti-racism group National Solidarity, told the Herald. "I got a lot of calls from victims and relatives who were so scared they wouldn't even give their names, they would just hang up."<br><br>"It is true that every time there are problems in Indonesia the Chinese are attacked, but public rape is very deviant behaviour. We have heard of mass killings before, but not mass rapes," Ester said, according to the Herald.<br><br>Worse than the massive rampage of sexual psychosis is the fact that the military appears to have done nothing to stop the rampage. Ethnic Chinese residents in Indonesia have claimed that, while Indonesians threatened to loot and burn their homes, they were specifically forbidden from carrying anything that seemed like a weapon.<br><br>"There is no protection and no justice in this country anymore," one witness wrote in a "Yellow Ribbon Campaign" distributed via e-mail across the Internet. Other messages tell of unspeakable gang rapes by mobs of "evil and savage" men.<br><br>One man claimed that he and his small group of Chinese neighbors were left defending their homes with nothing but sticks.<br><br>Another report claimed that -- in a final gesture of total perversion -- videotapes of some of the awful rapes are now being sold on the streets of Jakarta.<br><br>Time to Heal, or Time to Flee?<br><br>On the Internet, sites dedicated to emigrant Chinese society have been overrun by messages -- sometimes pleading, sometimes viciously angry -- demanding that all ethnic Chinese residents leave Indonesia. Despite the fact that for years many Chinese have worked and lived in peace with native Indonesians, many ethnic Chinese clearly believe that the worst is yet to come.<br><br>They may be right. According to new reports from Reuters on Monday, angry mobs in the Indonesian province of East Java have begun attacking Muslim homes and businesses owned by locals simply because the owners are believed to support Chinese merchants.<br><br>"Anonymous telephone calls have made me scared," one ethnic Chinese trader, who asked to have his name withheld, told Reuters. The trader said he was about to flee to Bali -- another Indonesian island -- to escape the violence.<br><br>And according to a report last week in the the Sydney Morning Herald, riot gangs haven't given up their addiction to mayhem. Armed with paint for now, they have begun "marking" Chinese homes for future attacks with a sinister color code: red means the building should be burned, black means its residents should be killed, and green means that the place should be looted, the Herald reported.<br><br>Who Will Stop It?<br><br>Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, has bemoaned the rape spree as an "atrocity" and called for an all-female investigation into the crimes. And to begin the process of racial integration, he has called for a law outlawing the use of the words pribumi and non-pribumi -- pribumi is the Indonesian word for "native" -- on signs in shopkeepers' windows. (Since the riots began, many businesses now post signs advertising the ethnic backgrounds of their owners as a defense against racist looting attacks.)<br><br>On Friday, dozens of Indonesian women held a protest at the Defense Ministry in Jakarta to protest against the terrible rape campaign, and against the fact that almost nothing has been done to make sure it won't happen again.<br><br>As police looked on, the women marched with banners saying "Rape is a whole life of terror" and "Indonesia! Republic of Fear, Republic of Terror, Republic of Rape," according to Reuters.<br><br>But <span style="color: red;">if the Indonesian army is left to enforce the peace, there will be little peace of mind for Chinese women. On Friday, the leader of the Catholic Church in East Timor -- the blood-stained former Portuguese colony that was violently occupied and seized by Indonesia in 1975 -- accused the military of waging a 20-year campaign of rape to smash the resistance of East Timorese who want independence for the region.<br><br>"If you ask me about rape, I am telling you the women of East Timor have gone through this since 1975 until now," Bishop Belo, a Nobel Peace laureate, said Friday.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are many ways a local government can handle the brutal murder of a high school student who volunteered as a counselor for rape victims. Wreaths and deep regrets come to mind. Not in republic of Indonesia. Just one day after teen-ager Martadinata Haryono was stabbed to death in her home, government officials called her a drug-addict, accused her of sodomy, and flouted all evidence by denying the murder had anything to do with her work comforting ethnic Chinese women raped in the country's terrifying May riots.<br><br>"People will now be afraid to tell anyone what happened during the riots," said Ester Indahyani Jusuf Lubis, leader of an anti-discrimination group, according to the Associated Press. "This is terrorizing Indonesia's ethnic Chinese." Haryono and her mother Wiwin both worked for Volunteers for Humanity, a group that counsels the estimated 168 mostly Chinese women who were raped during the spring chaos, which killed an estimated 1,200 and helped depose longtime president Suharto.<br><br>The Volunteers for Humanity and several other human rights organizations held a joint press conference to say they had received death threats warning them to stop assisting international investigations into the rapes, the BBC reported. Haryono and her mother were planning to visit the United States this week to testify in front of human rights panels, friends of the family told reporters. But just three days after the press conference, someone entered Haryono's room and stabbed her 10 times in the abdomen, chest and right arm, in addition to slicing her neck, Dr. Mun'im Idris told the state Antara news agency. "Her head was almost cut off at the throat," Idris said.<br><br>Albert Hasibuan, a leader of Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights, told AFP he suspected the killer was probably linked to "the government and other parties". That theory seemed even more credible on Saturday morning, when Jakarta newspapers quoted Lt. Colonoel Imam Haryatna, head of central Jakarta police precinct, as saying that robbery had been ruled out as a motive on account that nothing had been taken from the girl's house.<br><br>These are shocking facts about Ita Marthadinata that are forcefully and deliberately hidden from the public. Mrs.Y told me this. She got all of this info from Ita's uncle. Please prepare yourself:<br><br>Ita's VAGINA was POKED with an IRON BAR, so deep that it PIERCED through her body. The tip of the iron bar can be seen coming out from her back. This is similar to some May rape cases.<br>Ita suffered stabs in her chest, belly, palm. Her neck was slashed such that if the slash was only a few centimeter deeper, she would have been decapitated. Her neck muscles were all visible and the blood gushed out like river.<br>Ita was found holding an electric cable. She WAS ELECTRIC-SHOCKED.<br>Ita was SODOMIZED. A glob of sperm was found in her body and on the bedsheet.<br>Her face was crushed: her nose was broken, her lips were swollen, ALL HER FRONT TEETH WERE BROKEN.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hearing remarks made by republic of Indonesia President B.J. Habibie. One cannot help but notice the indifferent overtone of his stance on providing basic physical protection to the Chinese and preventing further violence. <span style="color: red;">Habibie is shameless to imply that if the Chinese were not to ''cooperate,'' they would see their assets burned to the ground and suffer the fate of murder, gang rape, and torture. Words such as these can only be construed as a blatant declaration of government-sponsored extortion and threat against the Chinese</span>, whose only crime is running the country's economy as law-abiding citizens of Indonesia.<br><br>Inaction on the part of the Indonesian government to protect the Chinese during the riots only fosters the traditional attitude of discrimination and distrust long accepted by Indonesian society. It also makes evident the all-too-willing mentality of those in power to use the Chinese as scapegoats for the massive economic failure triggered by their flawed policies and rampant corruption. Habibie must take immediate measures to curb further violence, punish the perpetrators, and guarantee basic human rights to his citizens of Chinese ancestry. The world does not need to witness another campaign of ethnic cleansing.</div>
