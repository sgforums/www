And ultimately and most importantly, that should not be a reason and a justification for any of that discrimination to occur here in which the government's stand is made clear. Just pointing out to those of you who think that prejudice against the chinese in Malaysia and Indonesia should be "revenged" here in Singapore.<br>Tolerance is one thing.

            <div class='col-md body'>Obviously, there is 'discrimination', however I believe that we experience here in Singapore is a result of global economical and local social circumstance. I do concede that some jobs demand preference for Chinese/Mandarin speaking workers, that might seem to non-Chinese job applicants as a form of discrimination exercised by these firms. However, I ask of you to consider is this so much of racial discrimination or a fall out for the need to have mandarin speaking workers? An alternative would be to enforce a system of 'affirmative action' which will grant minorities employment ahead of majorities. However, will that really solved the problem or it just creates another problem? I think a good way is to foster closer racial intergration, why just learn chinese, learn malay or tamil as well, and non-chinese citizens can also have the option of learning chinese. Of course, for that to be possible, we'll have to streamline the really extensive curiculum for our students.<br><br>Furthermore, I believe that we have to take it upon ourselves to learn more about each other. I do know that when a Malay gets married under the void deck, all the Malay families in that particular block actually help out. I mean why just Malays? I think Chinese, Indian or Eurasian families should go participate in the activities as well. This brings to the point of 'community self-help' which the MM brought up recently at his speech at the American School. I think if we can bring about the spirit of self-help transcending racial or ethnical lines, it will be a good step forward towards further integration.<br><br>We are all Singaporeans, I think that should take precendece to whether you're Malays,Eurasians, Indians or Chinese. Let us not make the mistakes our neighbours made by living along racial lines.</div>

Is it affecting the Chinese here? In any way can it be a justifiable cause for Chinese vendetta here against the non-Chinese here? If you want to bring injustice, I will! Americans invade Iraq and kill, rape civilians in the name of democracy and freedom? What happen to Iraq now? The Brits formed Israel and yrs later they invade, formed Israel and claim the land to be thier own! Israel tormented Palestine everyday, tanks, rockets fighting with guns and stones? I'll invade your house and claim to be my own, you want? And when you protect your house, I'll call you a terrorist! I'll not go further as it is not the agenda here. And plse dont go into stereotyping all Muslims are terorrists. We hate them and do not condone their acts. In fact, they are causing us more problems now!<br><br>Plse talk abt Singapore and the motion of the agenda. Plse answer with regards to my points and queries. Do not answer if you have no base or points to counter to my points on discrimation, insensitivity and intolerance. Chinese are smart so you dont want to sound like a dumbass.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll rest my case. It is in the Chinese mostly though not all. Selfish. If they are not facing it, why would they bother abt what the minorities are facing? If it does not bring wealth to them, why bother? Easy way out is to keep being blinded and not open to the issues.<br><br>Hands up if any of the Chinese sincerely and willingly wants to look into what the minority SINGAPOREAN here is facing and campaign to fellow Chinese abt the needs to eliminate discrimation, insensitivity and intolerance! I bet NONE! The Chinese mentality is dont do it if they wont gain anything, especially wealth! Further, the mentality is to protect your own backside first!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please kindly advise those who complain here abt discrimination to Malaysian and Indonesian minorities  to take the advise to migrate instead of bringing the irrelevant issues here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I have not given up yet and would not want to be a loser as someone else who choose to be one when he/she could not come up with contructive counter efforts to the issues.<br><br>This is my country, my homeland. Remember the song one people, one country, one SINGAPORE? Remember the pledge "We the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves as one united people....regardless of race, language or religion.....to build a democratic society base on justice and equality.....so as to achieve peace, prosperity and progress for the nation". If you failed to understand the motion here, I bet you would not understand the gist and crux of the pledge. furthermore, pledge is in English and not in Mandarin, so the majority would not understand. So what if the anthem is in Malay. Many acknowledged it is just a song. Therefore actions and deeds project a louder tune. Change to English by all means but will it change the majority mindset an overturn the discrimation towards the minorities?<br><br>Why should I migrate? Now I am not welcomed in my own homeland, place of birth? Now I am not able to fight for the rights and question where is the integrity and sincerity of the majority behind the pledge? The best excuse is to migrate if you dont like it? Give up my rights to the majority? Tell me 3 good reasons why I should migrate and quit on fighting losers like you!<br><br></div>
