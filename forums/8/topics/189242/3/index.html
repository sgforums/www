How has a society gone from racial harmony to racist? Its because of people like you, who relate every single small incident to being recist and stereotype. If you are not being racist in the first place, then maybe you will not even think this kind of matters as something worth argueing about.</div>

So lets say our gov introduce similar policies that benefit chinese.. IT would blantantly show that we dont give all equal rights. Right now, everyone here has equal rights. Its whether the person want to fight for his or not. So you want the gov to set laws that prohibit companies to hire chinese only? Then the private sectors will cry foul.. and this vicious cycles starts all over again... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
