            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by expiringpoet:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi chenc,<br>Did you know that no malays were conscripted in the SAF between 1969 and 1973; at the same time regular Malay soldiers were removed from combat posts, ... and promotional prospects curtailed. Although limited conscription of Malays into the SAF recommenced in 1973, restrictions on their placement in certain Militarily critical areas persisted until today. This policies have drawn, over time, alot of criticisms and until now, the govt hasn't been able to provide a satisfactory explanation.<br><br>You can also, if you're interested, read more about the government's distrust and marginatlisation of malays by researching Dr Lily Zubaidah Rahim's book on "The Singapore Dilemma". Doubtless, it will shed more light into this rather complex issue of race in singapore.</div></blockquote>Yeah and so I heard about it too.. But don't know much so can't make general comments leh..<br>But my views are, in a way, the Malays are more sensitive, why? Because most of us malays, when we see Singapore having conflicts with Malaysia, we tend to be defensive and have the idea that our presence are being compromised in a way, especially among the older malay generations here because some were from malaysia or had relatives there, and also we are the minority. Therefore, due to our close proximity with malaysia, there is an increased tendency to have more conflicts with them than other countries, hence increasing the uneasiness and uncomfortableness among the Malays, hence increasing the prospects of a rebellion by the malays as compared to the others. Wouldn't that be more riskier if we look in terms of the military area?<br>Trust? Yeah they can trust malays but there have to be limitations in the trust so as to prevent the worst from happening. It is a pre-emptive move to avoid facing such situations in future. If they don't trust us at all, then all malays no need go NS liao.<br><br>Because of not knowing these small unknown possible reasons, most malays will have the simple general idea that, "No malays in higher posts? Rascists." Then this idealism/mentality spreads around, handed down from generations to generations without even trying to find out the reasons behind it and all.<br><br>But bottom line, can't be blame, all human behaviour mah..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The truth is, most service-type industries must take in Chinese speaker to stay competative and suit the market's needs. This can neither be fair nor unfair. Living in a society like this, one of a minority race has to accept the fact that equality is rare in society.<br><br>Back to your title of this thread.  Yes, in some sort of ways it is. However, this does not mean racist. You got rejected because the employer has other needs to considered. But you are not being insulted because of your race. You can still walk around freely in Singapore no matter what race you are.<br><br>Thus, while Singapore is not racist, being a minority here has to accept the trend of the society and live life according to it. Life is unfair, it is up to you to make an exception.</div></blockquote>govt has the power to help...either by making everyone learn mandarin...or get those chinese speaking only learn english<br><br></div>

But do you know how many percent of the whole PSLE cohort are allowed to take 3 Language subject? Top 1 - 5 % of the cohort.<br><br>Why is this so? Coz MOE no money? No. This is because most students, having 6 acadamic subject to juggle in Sec 1, cannot possibly take 3 Language Subjects. It is impossible to make all kids sit at home all day and only study. It is unhealthy. Most students find difficulties even with only 2 Language subjects.<br><br>Dun even think about letting Primary school students take 3 Languages. With only. Even if you make them study all the time, the result would only be that they managed to pass all subjects, each with a mere 50%. How does that help?</div>
