Republic of Fear, Republic of Terror, Republic of Rape," according to Reuters.<br><br>But if the Indonesian army is left to enforce the peace, there will be little peace of mind for Chinese women. On Friday, the leader of the Catholic Church in East Timor -- the blood-stained former Portuguese colony that was violently occupied and seized by Indonesia in 1975 -- accused the military of waging a 20-year campaign of rape to smash the resistance of East Timorese who want independence for the region.<br><br><span style="color: red;">"If you ask me about rape, I am telling you the women of East Timor have gone through this since 1975 until now," Bishop Belo, a Nobel Peace laureate, said Friday.</span></div></blockquote>Now think about it, I once read an article about what happened in an Islamic country in middle east.

            <div class='col-md body'>Racism not really happening in S'pore but discrimination and insensitivity sure do.<br><br>job ads require mandarin speaking. Jobs that do not involve China, HK, Taiwan still require Mandarin? Most singaporean speak English! I was at a job interview (mid-career change) for a middle management post and the ad did not indicate Mandarin speaking preferred. I qualified with my credentials but was asked if I can speak mandarin would be an advantage. Here, if the minorities are to compete with equal credentials for a job, 99.99% a Chinese will be preferred and accepted to the job. My sis-in-law got good results and can speak mandarin well. She have not been able to get jobs for the last 1.5yrs! There sure is something abt discrimination. If not abt language, reason given will be inexperience for her. Coincidentally, her classmate without experience and with lower grade and is a Chinese got the job. Any reason for this? so what if we non-mandarin speaking learn mandarin? It is still Chinese being preferred. It is open in Msia and Indo that the majority which is malay are preferred. Msia favor bumis openly and it is in the open. S'pore? Chinese preferred but not open. I didnt believe this when I was young, parents, uncle, aunties told me but after I got into the workforce, I really see it happening. Even if I qualified with good credentials, I would not be given a 2nd look for promotions and mid-career change for higher post. DISCRIMINATION is obvious but not openly acknowledged by the majority. Some examples of discrimination and S'pore being a Chinese country :<br><br>1. job ads. mandarin has turned into an international language? why dont the China businessman pick up English that is being spoken internationally worldwide? Do you speak Mandarin if you are in Australia, Europe, Africa and US? Current situation is not helped by the terorist bastards who claim what they did to be in the name of Islam. All the more, recruiters stick to their own for security!<br><br>2. why are there mission schools and SAP schools with no non-Chinese in the enrolment? These kids will grow up not knowing abt mixing with other races and will feel uncomfortable and insecure if they are not within their own race. AND there are so much issue abt madrasah even though secular subjects are taught.<br><br>Next is insensitivity and intolerant. Examples :<br>1. colleagues speak mandarin in meetings when there are non-mandarin speaking attendees. Have to constantly remind to switch to Ch5 but happen again and again.<br><br>2. have been working in a large company for 7 years. Have not been going to company or dept function for the last 6 yrs. Why? becos the first 2 yrs, I requested for Muslim food. The admin and commitee sigh and passed remarks very leceh and ma fun. So in order not to tarnish and misrepresent that Islam the religion is troublesome, I save everybody the trouble. BUT, it is funny ( i hope I am laughing) that when a group from the majority race request for strict vegetarian food, they happily catered for it.<br><br>3. on friday prayers, govt give some leeway to park along the road betw 12-2pm. The Chinese cant tolerate this and complain to police post! I was on duty during NS when I received the call. Standard procedure applied is to see everything is in order and no congestion and to show our face that we attended to the calls. Did the minority complain when the Chinese park along the roads near churches, temples and during funerals?<br><br>4. late 80s, early 90s mosques are advised not to blast speakers for the dawn prayer call as it deemed noisy and disturb the peace of the residence. Adhered to it. Did we complain when the Chinese (not all) burn joss papers and offerings at pavements, void decks and corridors with smoke and ash getting into our homes? No we did not. We tolerate and be sensitive to other religion.<br><br>5. "Pets Not Allowed" sign are put up at eating places and fast food restaurant for hygiene and religious resons. Still the Chinese (not all) sit their dogs on the chairs. Did we complain? NO! becos we are tolerant.<br><br>Where are the sensitivity and tolerance? Sad to say S'pore is indeed becoming a selfish Chinese nation. Those who beg to differ, I hope you have the chance to be discriminated and feel what we are facing.</div>

Even if I qualified with good credentials, I would not be given a 2nd look for promotions and mid-career change for higher post. DISCRIMINATION is obvious but not openly acknowledged by the majority. Some examples of discrimination and S'pore being a Chinese country :<br><br>1. job ads. mandarin has turned into an international language? why dont the China businessman pick up English that is being spoken internationally worldwide? Do you speak Mandarin if you are in Australia, Europe, Africa and US? Current situation is not helped by the terorist bastards who claim what they did to be in the name of Islam. All the more, recruiters stick to their own for security!<br><br>2. why are there mission schools and SAP schools with no non-Chinese in the enrolment? These kids will grow up not knowing abt mixing with other races and will feel uncomfortable and insecure if they are not within their own race. AND there are so much issue abt madrasah even though secular subjects are taught.<br><br>Next is insensitivity and intolerant. Examples :<br>1. colleagues speak mandarin in meetings when there are non-mandarin speaking attendees. Have to constantly remind to switch to Ch5 but happen again and again.<br><br>2. have been working in a large company for 7 years. Have not been going to company or dept function for the last 6 yrs. Why? becos the first 2 yrs, I requested for Muslim food. The admin and commitee sigh and passed remarks very leceh and ma fun. So in order not to tarnish and misrepresent that Islam the religion is troublesome, I save everybody the trouble. BUT, it is funny ( i hope I am laughing) that when a group from the majority race request for strict vegetarian food, they happily catered for it.<br><br>3. on friday prayers, govt give some leeway to park along the road betw 12-2pm. The Chinese cant tolerate this and complain to police post! I was on duty during NS when I received the call. Standard procedure applied is to see everything is in order and no congestion and to show our face that we attended to the calls. Did the minority complain when the Chinese park along the roads near churches, temples and during funerals?<br><br>4. late 80s, early 90s mosques are advised not to blast speakers for the dawn prayer call as it deemed noisy and disturb the peace of the residence. Adhered to it. Did we complain when the Chinese (not all) burn joss papers and offerings at pavements, void decks and corridors with smoke and ash getting into our homes? No we did not. We tolerate and be sensitive to other religion.<br><br>5. "Pets Not Allowed" sign are put up at eating places and fast food restaurant for hygiene and religious resons. Still the Chinese (not all) sit their dogs on the chairs. Did we complain? NO! becos we are tolerant.<br><br>Where are the sensitivity and tolerance? Sad to say S'pore is indeed becoming a selfish Chinese nation. Those who beg to differ, I hope you have the chance to be discriminated and feel what we are facing.</div></blockquote>i summarise for you.<br>malaysia and indonesia open.<br>singapore not open.<br>happy now?</div>

Jobs that do not involve China, HK, Taiwan still require Mandarin? Most singaporean speak English! I was at a job interview (mid-career change) for a middle management post and the ad did not indicate Mandarin speaking preferred. I qualified with my credentials but was asked if I can speak mandarin would be an advantage. Here, if the minorities are to compete with equal credentials for a job, 99.99% a Chinese will be preferred and accepted to the job. My sis-in-law got good results and can speak mandarin well. She have not been able to get jobs for the last 1.5yrs! There sure is something abt discrimination. If not abt language, reason given will be inexperience for her. Coincidentally, her classmate without experience and with lower grade and is a Chinese got the job. Any reason for this? so what if we non-mandarin speaking learn mandarin?

Look at malaysia...The chinese are suffering there and if you want to open a shop, your shop has to include one malay worker at least and the sign board has to add on malay words too. So....Is it fair to the chinese over there? Don't tell me malaysia is a malay country and singapore is a multi-racial nation. That's only a excuse.......Be Grateful!</div>
