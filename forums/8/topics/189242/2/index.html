It is very obvious, if you are non-chinese, that there is discrimination. Its everywhere, but only if you're malay or indian or others, then your eyes will be open to it.<br>If you're malay, the discrimination is in religion (cannot wear tudung in school and in the office or certain organisations) , discrimination in NUS and NTU - subject to quota so the numbers of malays going to higher instituition is always kept low, discrimination in Armed Forces...shall i go on? Yes, and discrimination in getting jobs. Everywhere, ads says "Chinese or mandarin speaking only". And the worst part? Malays are not allowed to take mandarin in school. So how? then govt keep saying malays have highest retrenchment nos in times of recession. Of cos lah, duh...  sigh...</div>
