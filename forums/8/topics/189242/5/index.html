            <div class='col-md body'>Another question I asked you. If you are non-chinese, but you can speak fluent mandarin, hokkien, tamil, hindi, cantonese, malay, english, and some others, and provided you have an impressive CV, WHICH company wouldn't want to recruit you? Especially, if the company seeks those chinese spoken also. Unless, they specifically ask for Chinese people then, that is questionable right? You don't know exactly their customer base and what they require mah. If the company deals with only people who don't understand anything apart from Chinese language, it is only right and logical they require and hire those who are able to converse in Chinese right? So if you want that job, then make an attempt to go for mandarin classes. If they still reject then questionable already right?<br><br>About the Chinese Prs thing, don't really know much so not gonna make a comment about that...</div>
