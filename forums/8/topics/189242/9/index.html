            <div class='col-md body'>For our reading pleasure.<br><br>Someone once analysed that malay ministers in singapore only fulfil a token role. They are usually 2 at any given time appointed, and its usually for Ministry of Env and Ministry of Muslim-Malay affairs.<br><br>While i'm on this, anyone ever considered the significance of why there is a need for Minister for Muslim affairs but never Chinese or Indian affairs?<br><br><strong>Letter to SFD (Singapore For Democracy) </strong><br>extracted from<br>http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/DearSingaporean/2000/171100.html<br><br>It's ironic that prime minister Goh Chok Tong has chosen to extol the virtues of meritocracy to Singaporeans, in particular to the Malays. This is because the very fact that Goh is the prime minister of Singapore clearly demonstrates that meritocracy has long been dead in our island republic.<br><br>Goh is put there because he is Chinese (among other things), according to our Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew who appointed him to the post in 1990. When announcing his choice for the post of prime minister to succeed him, Mr Lee had noted there were two other better-qualified persons for the post, including former minister S Dhanabalan.<br><br>But what did Mr Lee say about Dhanabalan? He said to the disgust of Singaporeans of all races who believed in a multi-racial society that the country was not ready to accept Dhanabalan, an Indian, as prime minister.<br><br>In our parliamentary system, choosing the prime minister is the responsibility of members of parliament from the majority party, and in this case the PAP MPs had to decide who among themselves is capable enough to become the country's prime minister. By rejecting a Singaporean of Indian origin, is it then not clear that the PAP MPs, Mr Lee included, and not Singapore as claimed by Mr Lee, were not prepared to accept Dhanabalan as prime minister? Another question that needs to be asked is: What has happened to meritocracy, a concept that Singapore leaders keep boasting to the world?<br><br>I'm bringing up this question of meritocracy because none other than Goh Chok Tong himself spoke about the need to strictly adhere to this principle at his recent talk to Malay-Muslim leaders who attended a forum organised by the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP).<br><br>Mr Goh also told the participants that there was no Malay permanent secretary or high court judge because no suitable candidates were around. Is this true?<br><br>When Singapore became independent in 1965, the permanent secretary in the foreign ministry was Malay and a top man in the legal service was also a Malay-Muslim. What has gone wrong leading to the present dearth of Malay talent in Singapore? The PAP seems to have no difficulty finding a Malay cabinet minister, a post obviously requiring higher talent. There are also junior Malay ministers, parliamentary secretaries and members of parliament, who have all been recruited through PAP's rigorous selection process. Are we now to understand that the PAP Malay MPs were taken on board because of their loyalty and not for their superior latent as often claimed by our senior minister Lee and other PAP leaders?<br><br>It looks like there is only hypocrisy and not meritocracy in our multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-lingual Singapore!<br><br>C.

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, i knew quite alot of singaporeans no matter what racial they are, they are quite piss off that the chinese from china keep emigrate to singapore. But as for me, i am quite happy and welcome the chinese there to stay here as we all know that singaporeans chinese birthrate are quite poor, so it will be a good idea for the chinese over there to stay here so that the chinese can keep producing their next generation here and singapore will be forever rule by the chinese.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by expiringpoet:<br><strong>For our reading pleasure.<br><br>Someone once analysed that malay ministers in singapore only fulfil a token role. They are usually 2 at any given time appointed, and its usually for Ministry of Env and Ministry of Muslim-Malay affairs.<br><br>While i'm on this, anyone ever considered the significance of why there is a need for Minister for Muslim affairs but never Chinese or Indian affairs?<br><br>[b]Letter to SFD (Singapore For Democracy) </strong><br>extracted from<br>http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/DearSingaporean/2000/171100.html<br><br>It's ironic that prime minister Goh Chok Tong has chosen to extol the virtues of meritocracy to Singaporeans, in particular to the Malays. This is because the very fact that Goh is the prime minister of Singapore clearly demonstrates that meritocracy has long been dead in our island republic.<br><br>Goh is put there because he is Chinese (among other things), according to our Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew who appointed him to the post in 1990. When announcing his choice for the post of prime minister to succeed him, Mr Lee had noted there were two other better-qualified persons for the post, including former minister S Dhanabalan.<br><br>But what did Mr Lee say about Dhanabalan? He said to the disgust of Singaporeans of all races who believed in a multi-racial society that the country was not ready to accept Dhanabalan, an Indian, as prime minister.<br><br>In our parliamentary system, choosing the prime minister is the responsibility of members of parliament from the majority party, and in this case the PAP MPs had to decide who among themselves is capable enough to become the country's prime minister. By rejecting a Singaporean of Indian origin, is it then not clear that the PAP MPs, Mr Lee included, and not Singapore as claimed by Mr Lee, were not prepared to accept Dhanabalan as prime minister? Another question that needs to be asked is: What has happened to meritocracy, a concept that Singapore leaders keep boasting to the world?<br><br>I'm bringing up this question of meritocracy because none other than Goh Chok Tong himself spoke about the need to strictly adhere to this principle at his recent talk to Malay-Muslim leaders who attended a forum organised by the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP).<br><br>Mr Goh also told the participants that there was no Malay permanent secretary or high court judge because no suitable candidates were around. Is this true?<br><br>When Singapore became independent in 1965, the permanent secretary in the foreign ministry was Malay and a top man in the legal service was also a Malay-Muslim. What has gone wrong leading to the present dearth of Malay talent in Singapore? The PAP seems to have no difficulty finding a Malay cabinet minister, a post obviously requiring higher talent. There are also junior Malay ministers, parliamentary secretaries and members of parliament, who have all been recruited through PAP's rigorous selection process. Are we now to understand that the PAP Malay MPs were taken on board because of their loyalty and not for their superior latent as often claimed by our senior minister Lee and other PAP leaders?<br><br>It looks like there is only hypocrisy and not meritocracy in our multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-religious and multi-lingual Singapore!<br><br>C.
