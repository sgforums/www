Theres always reasons. For example, maybe some jobs cannot allow a Malay to go off and pray on Fridays because maybe that period of the time is when its the busy time slot in the company. Also, some jobs might require you to know and speak chinese or dialet. Or maybe a restraunt is selling pork so Muslims cannot be employed.<br><br>Do you see a Chinese complain because he is not a muslim and therefore cannot take up Halah-food related jobs? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Indians are quite sad there becos  the civil service dont admit indians and of cos chinese businesses dont employ indians or rarely do. So they are neither here nor there.

But usually the companies they want to recruit people who can speak Eng and Mandarin right? Not Mandarin only right? The problem here is probably not with the companies, but because of the nature of the customers they will deal with. Correct some old people can speak malay lah but preferably Chinese mah..</div>
