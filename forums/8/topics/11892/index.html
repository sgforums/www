            <div class='col-md body'>For those of you who have not read abt my plight, my gf is currently deciding to choose b/w me or another guy. She says she likes this guy very much, more than her feeling towards me.<br><br>I tried to salvage tis r/s and she is not deciding who to choose. It has been very long already (1.5 wk since she told me, and 3-4 weeks since she started to give me cold shoulder)<br><br>Does the fact tat she is still willing to consider means she still hope to save tis r/s? Gals, why is she taking such a long time? YOu know its very painful to wait. One day is equivalent to ten days~!!!<br><br>Meanwhile i tried to send flowers, buy gifts and write letters, etc... hoping to touch her. When i met her yesterday, she says she is touched and i haf won half the battle, ask me to continue. But when i call her after tat, she told me over the phone tat things are not on my side~!??<br><br>Very ironic hor? Any gals can decipher her intention and meaning to the above contradicting words?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dump her. Not worth your time man, you're just going to condition her into thinking she can do this again and again. She already has, as seen in the case as when she said you won half the battle and asks you to contitnue, then when you call her another day she tells you that things are not on your side.<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyah... she trying to make you put more attention on her. If everything smooth sailing, maybe she won't get so much gifts from you. Maybe if you stopped she will realise it and try to convince you instead?<br>Eh, not confirm one hor. Cos when I was at that age I like to say break up or bring another guy into the picture so that my bf will treasure me more.<br>But really, how much more of this can you take? It happened once, it will happen again. Especially when she is constantly meeting new ppl. She may be matured for her age, but being matured doesn't mean being a stable gf.<br><br>------------------<br>**I want u to be with me.....<br>be with me in the morning...be with me in the nite...with me when its dark out...with me when its light...<br>I want u to be with me...no matter what we do...just keep this reminder...of how much I love u...**</div>

But it's ok, I think you like to suffer from this kind of unstable feelings.<br><br>She may be toying around with you.  I said it before pampering a girl is good but not to the extent of losing your own integrity, principles, and self-esteem.  If that's the case, there's no difference between a puppy dog and a man.<br><br>She may be waiting for you to make the decision because she doesn't know how to break off with you.  In the Kama Sutra, one way of breaking off a relationship is to give the cold shoulder.  After sometime when things are cold, just go away without saying goodbye.  You getting all this?  Come on, ask her one last time, will she be happy with the new guy.  If the answer is "Yes", you know what to do.  If you love her set her free.  If it's "Don't know..." then I guess you have to continue suffering or end it there and then.  The choice is yours.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yoohoo, it's not like I'm trying to goad you into leaving her, just act normal around her and let her make the decision. She's currently in the pre honeymoon mood with the other guy right now, if you treat her super well just for this, she's gonna expect the same from you all the time. It's a condition tolerance level. If you give her a B, sooner or later she'll want a B+, give her a B+ and she'll ask for an A-. If you are at B and because of some emergency or emotional factor you need to give a B-...she's gonna feel fucking unloved and whine and whine and whine. Trust me this happened to me once and I found out 3 years too late it wasn't worth keeping her even for free sex.<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>
