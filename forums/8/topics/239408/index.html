You see, the PAP-led govt says that it is 'good' for chickens to cross the road, and it doesn't give any other reason besides that. Hence, all chickens are advised to cross the road for their own good. If not, a stat board will be set up to ensure that chickens cross the road. This stat board, like so many others in S'pore, will be staffed by close-to-retirement SAF generals, or washed-out admin-officers who can't really hack it in IE S'pore or PMO's office. Whatever it is, chickens better do what they have been told, or else...</div>
