If the school chooses to force a student to drop, the student may simply refuse to withdraw his registration and payment.<br><br>There are students who do awfully bad in internal examinations but have shown to have scored distinctions at the GCE level.<br><br>Therefore, it's the principle of it all that matters. I've a friend who went all the way to be allowed to drop Mother Tongue at the AO Level and succeeded. Realistically and technically, what can the school do, short of making up a file of unsuitability of character?</div>

The results won't matter because the registration is already done.<br><br>Besides, its always useful to bring it all the way up. it normally works based on publicity.<br><br>of course they could possibly find excuses and ways to force the issue, but then thats up to him to blow up or diffuse.<br><br>anyway why is the school trying to force you to drop?</div>
