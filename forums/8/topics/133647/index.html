            <div class='col-md body'>Saw  the movie a while ago. Why would people say this was the worst in the series?<br>I mean the director Fincher went on to  make good movies later on like SEVEN or Fight Club<br>I think this 3rd movie did some things differently than the norm . The pacing and suspense were slower with a lot of moody environments and music. More fincher styled of slow moody suspense. Gotta love the gothic styled space horror and constant references to religion. The opening cedit was explanatory in itself  how  Ripley's craft crash landed in Fiorina Fury 161. This time Ripley had no weapons to fight monsters instead had to rely on wits and limited resources. The setting itself was unique - A prison.<br>In all everything inclusing the camerawork was the best for its time. The colours had more orangey, strak grey or reddish hues than the commonly used blue schemes for such movies (ALiens).This is a dark and mean spirited show. Both of the first two had gems of hope in them. This one reeks with despair and hopelessness.<br><br>The reason fotr its Box office flop could be that it had no grandeur feel like the previous ones in the series. Felt more like an X-Files episode<br><br>The characters were an enigmatic bunch<br><br>First saw it back in 1993 when i was 12.<br><br>A few critics have seen the picture as an allegory for AIDS and Holocaust-era detention camps. The alien creature, as the Village Voice put it in 1992, humps people to death, and, moreover, kills men by making them pregnant. In particular, the alien's insidious parasitic eggs (undetectable until specialized tests reveal them, and leading to certain death) are viewed as the clearest symbol of AIDS.<br><br>The prison planet, with its shaven-headed prisoners (including Ripley), in which all inhabitants are deemed expendable, mirrors the history of Holocaust death camps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>David Fincher (born May 10, 1962) is an American film director.<br><br>Born in Denver, Colorado, Fincher started as an animator at Industrial Light and Magic in 1980 and stayed until 1984(?). In 1986, he founded the video-production company Propaganda Films. He directed big-budget videos for artists such as Madonna (including "Express Yourself" and "Vogue"), George Michael, Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones (including "Love Is Strong"), as well as commercials. In 2005 he made a return to music videos by directing the single "Only" off of the Nine Inch Nails album With Teeth.<br><br>Like a number of other video directors, including Julien Temple, Russell Mulcahy, and Spike Jonze, he then moved into film. His debut was Alien3 (1992), which was then the most expensive picture ever made by a first-time director, but it was a financial and critical disappointment. Despite this initial setback, Fincher's career rebounded dramatically with his next film, the disturbing thriller Se7en. It was followed by the complex, daring and controversial Fight Club, which almost immediately put Fincher in the forefront of recent post-video era. Even Fincher's more conventional work, such as The Game and Panic Room contains his distinctive dark photography with innovative uses of computer graphics.<br>[edit]<br><br>Filmography<br>Alien3 (1992)<br>Se7en (1995)<br>The Game (1997)<br>Fight Club (1999)<br>Panic Room (2002)<br>Benjamin Button (2006)<br>Untitled biopic of the Zodiac killer (2006?)</div>

Personal preference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The ending of "Alien 3" was quite poignant though. Ripley has been sharing such a close bond with the Alien species throughout the three movies that her fall to the molten pit clutching with two hands the newborn Alien bursting out from her chest seemed to give the trilogy a full-circle finish.</div>

Wrong movie to experiment</blockquote>However, looking from another angle, maybe "Alien 3" was Fincher's big break into feature films and if he didn't do it he might not have had the opportunity to garner enough attention from producers to make the cult classic that was "Se7en".<br><br>Maybe it wasn't that moviegoers weren't ready for Fincher's brooding-suspense-with-a-twist style, it could be that predecessor Cameron had raised the bar so high with the thrilling "Aliens" that in comparison "Alien 3" may have appeared a tad flat to the mainstream audience.
