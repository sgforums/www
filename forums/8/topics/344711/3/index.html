              <p>ty for ur insights</p>
              <p>btw my map was a tower defense game, that's why it require so
              much scripts.</p>
              <p>cool, but im more into <span style="text-decoration: underline;">game developing</span>, not map
              design, btw what i design wasn't exactly a map, it was a tower
              defense game lol, there's only 2 made for the game coz it require
              massive scripting lol. so im not very into level design but more on
              the concept like how enemy comes in, where are the mountains but
              not the geography of the land etc...</p>
              <p>and i mean securing the entry to the course with port folio, not
              career yet. coz im afriad i might not get enough points. just in
              case.</p>
              <p>oh and if u make an rpg with some client wont it be unpopular? i
              mean is there a rpg maker for flash instead? which then i can
              upload the game to like newground etc and it get rated and
              comments. so it it get good rating and amount of plays, it's
              obvious that it is good and easier to show whoever too.</p>
              </div>

              <p>It's essentially the same thing, you can't develop a game without
              the physical maps to support it. A game developer is actually the
              person who source for the funds and decides who he wants to employ for
              the game project, the CEO or the Producer to be more specific. </p>
              <p>Not
              to sound insulting here, but i'm pretty sure that's not something you
              would be able to do unless you got an EXTREMELY rich godfather or
              godmother. </p>
              <p>Map design IS game designing, you basically plan the content and construct the flow that you want the player to experience. You
              need to know level design in order to be able to control how the enemy
              comes in, is the gameplay balanced? Would the game be fun for the
              player? Can the fun experience last beyond the first try...etc.</p>
              <p>The
              point of using the RPG maker is to show your potential employer you
              understand the principles of game design to make the game fun. I don't
              understand how complex the scripting for Tower Defense can get, but
              you're betting that your employer understands the Warcraft Editor to
              know that, so that route may be abit risky for you.</p>
              <p>From what i
              know, the original makers of Counterstrike has managed to secure jobs
              in the gaming industry as game designers and i believe so have the
              creators of DOTA.</p>
              <p>To be frank, currently the government's
              direction is to train modellers and animators to feed the foreign
              gaming companies. There is actually a short supply of local game
              designers which is going to be essential if Singapore is going to
              create any local games. So this is actually a good career route for
              you.</p>
              <p>Among the polytechnics, NYP's probably the best option but
              from what my NYP colleagues tell me they will deal more heavily on
              animation and modelling, touching only slightly on game designing.Game
              design principles is not quite an actual science yet and with how
              technology is moving, it would most probably be outdated the moment you
              graduate.</p>
              <p>I would recommand that you check out the Diploma
              courses that 3Dsense is offering, as they also teach environment
              modelling and have people who works in the industry teaching part time.</p>
              <p>Your
              other option would be CGProtege though the modelling courses they offer
              is mostly character modelling. The animation courses they offer is
              pretty good for both feature films and gaming animation. While not
              exactly what you want, it does allow you to put your foot into the door
              to understand more about game development.  </p>
              <p>I hope this
              information helps you and those who are interested in entering the
              industry. You replied to me too late, or i would have asked the lead
              game designer what he would look for in a portfolio. Now i got to ask
              em on Wednesday.</p>

              <p>hmmm. i think nyp is better in this area since they started
                      earlier and produced more results.</p>
              <p>anyway, if ur into scripting, then better dun come this course
                      in sp.</p>
              <p>dgdd in sp is more towards designing and development aspects
                      (thats why its called game design and development), and since
                      scripting is part of the development phase, we do learn a bit here
                      and there.</p>
              <p>basically this course only teaches the basics of everything, and
                      u have to choose wad u wan to specialise in and improve on ur own.
                      1 of the third years is actually better in scripting using python
                      (for panda3D) then the lecturer.</p>

              <p>Just to furthur clarify, there is a difference between a game designer and a game programmer.</p>
              <p>The game designer basically organises what the lead game designer wants and distributes the tasks to the programmers/artists. While scripting knowledge can be useful to be able to explain more clearly to the programmers what you want, it's not an essential skill. Modelling knowledge however, is useful because it's easier to show the level modellers what you're thinking.</p>
              <p>But overall, you probably will use Excel scripting, MS Word and Photoshop far more.</p>
              <p>Also, the problem with the game design courses now is that they teach you old gaming engines which companies tend to give up using after you've completed the course. When you enter a gaming company,  you most likely have to be re-trained in using the engine they're using.</p>
              <p>There is also diversity in the engines that gaming companies use. Blade and Soul uses Unreal 3, Aion uses Crytek's CryEngine, Relic uses Essence Engine, Blizzard their own engines as well. So no matter what game design course you enter, you basically have to be retrained.</p>
              <p>That's why it's important for you to demostrate to your potential employer that you know how to make a simple game fun even with limited tools (RPG maker, Flash, Warcraft map editor..etc). Because this sort of things can't be trained. I won't recommand Flash, because you have to create all the assets (Graphics) yourself, and you will probably be discouraged while making them.</p>

              <p>and jc is very hard for me- i almost retain sec 3, im not talented at maths, and i dun take A maths, and most of all dun think i can get low enuff points,not low in confidence but base on the shitty result i had, i probly jsut make it in the course in poly.</p>
              <p>ya i will learn some basic after O from the internet so if i miss the entry point or smth hopefully they'll still accept me</p>

                  comes in, is the gameplay balanced? Would the game be fun for the
                  player? Can the fun experience last beyond the first try...etc.</p>
              <p>The point of using the RPG maker is to show your potential
                  employer you understand the principles of game design to make the
                  game fun. I don't understand how complex the scripting for Tower
                  Defense can get, but you're betting that your employer understands
                  the Warcraft Editor to know that, so that route may be abit risky
                  for you.</p>
              <p>From what i know, the original makers of Counterstrike has
                  managed to secure jobs in the gaming industry as game designers and
                  i believe so have the creators of DOTA.</p>
              <p>To be frank, currently the government's direction is to train
                  modellers and animators to feed the foreign gaming companies. There
                  is actually a short supply of local game designers which is going
                  to be essential if Singapore is going to create any local games. So
                  this is actually a good career route for you.</p>
              <p>Among the polytechnics, NYP's probably the best option but from
                  what my NYP colleagues tell me they will deal more heavily on
                  animation and modelling, touching only slightly on game
                  designing.Game design principles is not quite an actual science yet
                  and with how technology is moving, it would most probably be
                  outdated the moment you graduate.</p>
              <p>I would recommand that you check out the Diploma courses that
                  3Dsense is offering, as they also teach environment modelling and
                  have people who works in the industry teaching part time.</p>
              <p>Your other option would be CGProtege though the modelling
                  courses they offer is mostly character modelling. The animation
                  courses they offer is pretty good for both feature films and gaming
                  animation. While not exactly what you want, it does allow you to
                  put your foot into the door to understand more about game
                  development.  </p>
              <p>I hope this information helps you and those who are interested
                  in entering the industry. You replied to me too late, or i would
                  have asked the lead game designer what he would look for in a
                  portfolio. Now i got to ask em on Wednesday.</p>

              moe website has a list of unis where u can go to after poly.
              
              in my case, i'll recommend digipen if u are seriously interested in entering the game industry.
              
              if i rmb correctly, theres a game engine called rpg maker, can be used to make simple rpgs.
              u might also wan to check out game maker, a simple to use but (a little) limited game engine. these game engines can still produce impressive games nonetheless.

              <p>The reason why Stevenson is advocating 3D animation and modeling to you, is because it has much more job opportunities than just game design. That skill is transferable to other industries such as TV and film, graphic design, web design, and so on so forth. Besides, it is also common knowledge that no school can really teach game coding to a employable skill. It takes a huge amount of self learning over the internet so that is why passion for it is vital.</p>
              <p>To explain Digipen, let's talk about the 2007 Valve's smash hit Portal. In 2006, Digipen students created a game called Narbacular Drop. It is the concept of shooting portals and using them to get to places. After a bunch of awards later, that game caught on to Valve's eye and needless to say, they loved it so much that they hired the students into Valve to create Portal. It is obvious that Portal has been integrated to the Half Life game series when you play Half Life Episode 2. Anyway, out of that student team, there were coders like Kim Swift and there are art design people like Realm Lovejoy. They were all hired permanently into Valve as a team.</p>
              <p>So you see here, it looks as though those students got lucky but it did not happen by chance. If you do go ahead with NYP's course, make sure you are damn good at it. Graduate there and make sure you put yourself through Digipen, whereby at the end of that course you had created something amazing that would set you as someone employable.</p>
              <p>Don't just limit yourself to scripting for maps, or making quests by RPG maker. When you learnt everything you could from those, buy a copy of Half Life (The Orange Box is great value) and download the modding tools. Get involved in the modding community in making coding for weapons etc. Get yourself familiar with the coding landscape of the game industry. Like what Stevenson said, every game company or the game themselves would use a proprietary engine, but it is not that hard for you to quickly get familiar with them if you are already an experienced coder in C++, Python, Java, etc. Passion is one thing, it only start to matter if you do something with it.</p>
              <p><br>Everyone had to start somewhere, and not everyone is a insanely talent child prodigy so never listen to the naysayers (you know who you fucking are.) In actual fact a lot video game designers come from humble roots of making home brew games so don't be afraid to show your maps around for advice. What is important is that you know what you are getting into, and that you know what you need to know in order to be successful and get a job. Sideline, obviously I'm not asking to buy those games now and fritter your O level time away. As every school lecturer would tell you, coding needs good math and science, so make sure you do well in school for those because you would need them when you learn your code. You need to be able to think logically (This is also why Art and Coders are separate careers, they are inherently exclusive skills.)</p>
              <p>You proved that you are not just another bread and butter game addict trying to get on a cool job bandwagon. Because if you are able to sit on your butt and pump out code for 6+ hours, you had just taken the first few steps to the game industry by having a passion for it. An artist starts out doodling his favorite characters in his own style, or maybe an web designer begins to study his downloaded blog code, it is still a way to get involved in the industry.</p>
              <p>Just concentrate on your studies now, and keep looking out for more oppuntunities coming your way. Don't forget what you enjoy the thing that makes you really happy. If coding 6+ hours everyday makes you damn happy when you play the finished product, go for it dude! Just make sure you know what you need to do to be good at it! That is the difference between successful, employed people like Stevenson, and people who log on to sgForums, flame everyone else to divert their thoughts of their own failures, use an avatar of hot Japanese people to conceal their obesity, and end their posts with an angel smiley to make themselves appear innocent.</p>

              <p>The reason why Stevenson is advocating 3D animation and modeling to you, is because it has much more job opportunities than just game design. That skill is transferable to other industries such as TV and film, graphic design, web design, and so on so forth. Besides, it is also common knowledge that no school can really teach game coding to a employable skill. It takes a huge amount of self learning over the internet so that is why passion for it is vital.</p>
              <p>To explain Digipen, let's talk about the 2007 Valve's smash hit Portal. In 2006, Digipen students created a game called Narbacular Drop. It is the concept of shooting portals and using them to get to places. After a bunch of awards later, that game caught on to Valve's eye and needless to say, they loved it so much that they hired the students into Valve to create Portal. It is obvious that Portal has been integrated to the Half Life game series when you play Half Life Episode 2. Anyway, out of that student team, there were coders like Kim Swift and there are art design people like Realm Lovejoy. They were all hired permanently into Valve as a team.</p>
              <p>So you see here, it looks as though those students got lucky but it did not happen by chance. If you do go ahead with NYP's course, make sure you are damn good at it. Graduate there and make sure you put yourself through Digipen, whereby at the end of that course you had created something amazing that would set you as someone employable.</p>
              <p>Don't just limit yourself to scripting for maps, or making quests by RPG maker. When you learnt everything you could from those, buy a copy of Half Life (The Orange Box is great value) and download the modding tools. Get involved in the modding community in making coding for weapons etc. Get yourself familiar with the coding landscape of the game industry. Like what Stevenson said, every game company or the game themselves would use a proprietary engine, but it is not that hard for you to quickly get familiar with them if you are already an experienced coder in C++, Python, Java, etc. Passion is one thing, it only start to matter if you do something with it.</p>
              <p><br>Everyone had to start somewhere, and not everyone is a insanely talent child prodigy so never listen to the naysayers (you know who you fucking are.) In actual fact a lot video game designers come from humble roots of making home brew games so don't be afraid to show your maps around for advice. What is important is that you know what you are getting into, and that you know what you need to know in order to be successful and get a job. Sideline, obviously I'm not asking to buy those games now and fritter your O level time away. As every school lecturer would tell you, coding needs good math and science, so make sure you do well in school for those because you would need them when you learn your code.

              <p>Haha! Thanks ã‚ˆã�¿ã�Œã�ˆã‚‹ ã�•ã‚“! Would like to add one last thing to reiterate what I said earlier. It's what Stevenson also said.</p>
              <p>Your
              ability to code is not enough. You have to remind yourself the reason
              you are studying all these is because you want to bring your games to
              life. Your ideas and interests direct what kind of code you want to
              learn. While I realise your future employablity is more important than taking your game ideas to life, you shouldn't just bury yourself studying code you are not going to use.</p>
              <p>Take a gander at games nowadays. Compare the game Portal to let's say, Crysis. I know Crysis is a breakthough in graphics, but Portal is the one that really brought the real meaning of games. We all know Portal is fun as hell, we can play it over and over, make maps for it, etc. Crysis will be dismembered in memory as graphics evolve by time, but Portal will remain as ever an absolute classic for the ages. Trust me on this one because it had happened to Pong.</p>
              <p>But you would realise that Portal would have never existed without the coding skills that Kim Swift had. I am sure that there are people who had the same Portal game idea that she had but could not code it into reality. So what I like to think is that, when you do study your code, don't just memorise it all blindly. Always take into account on how you can apply it to your own ideas, how to bring it to life. But don't neglect your skills to dream up ideas that could never give fruit either. Strike a balance as you let your ideas dictate what kind of game you want to make in the future.</p>

              <p>Is there really a course in polytechnic devoted completely to game development? I'm not that sure of the current trends now.</p>
              <p>So far, what i know is though they call it game development it still mostly involves modelling and animation, actual scripting and playing around with game engines are more electives. Basically they make you jack of all trades, but master of none.</p>

              <p>i think u shld just take a look at what the course in nyp has to offer, thn try a bit of hands on for them see if u like what the major course has to offer.</p>
              <p>i know for certain that if u feel that one of the major course is not to ur liking, u'll regret taking the course as u will be taking that major course for 3 years.</p>
              <p>well so long as u find out what the course has to offer and if u like it, thn go ahead.</p>
              <p>It is very important to find out what the course has to offer thoroughly and do a bit of hands-on on it to see if u like it. dont just listen to what the lecturers say u have to do a bit of hands-on.cause sometimes what the lecturers say and what u will be doing can feel very different.</p>
              <p>Anyway, work hard for ur o levels first, if u arent very good at maths just practice it daily, it helps.</p>
              <p>Work hard and good luck</p>

              <p>Is there really a course in polytechnic devoted completely to
              game development? I'm not that sure of the current trends now.</p>
              <p>So far, what i know is though they call it game development it
              still mostly involves modelling and animation, actual scripting and
              playing around with game engines are more electives. Basically they
              make you jack of all trades, but master of none.</p>

              <p>Yes I believe that the culture of the game industry in the US prefers that you excel at one particular thing in order for them to hire you, being a run of the mill averaged of skill would get you nowhere. And it is true no school in Singapore can truly teach you to be at an employable level as per the reasons Stevenson mentioned; Whatever they teach you would be outdated when you actually begin to find a job. Moreover they could only do is teach you the basics at best. They introduce to you the layout of the skills you need and help get you started, but frankly you would have to boost yourself with your own self study by the end of year 1 to be actually good in it. That said, being in a course gives you constant doses of motivation and there are lecturers to help and students to compare your work too. Not to mention that there would be like-minded and competent classmates to meet and make friends with.</p>
              <p>So those schools are good for those things but you cannot totally rely everything on them. I am sure those who did would have a rude shock when they expect the school to handle their future for them.</p>
              <p>I think what Stevenson meant by you learning 3D modeling and animation is that it would be something you can fall back on for security. Besides, you need to create object placeholders in the games that you make, and it's best that you are able to do something substantial before an art person comes in for the real thing.</p>
              <p>One good indicator for the quality of the school is the percentage of former students who became the school lecturers. If there are alot of them you might be cautioned in taking that course.</p>
              <p>Anyway, don't just tell yourself that you are bad at maths if you haven't really tried to study it. You would have to tell yourself that you would need to use it for the future, and you should begin to actually like doing maths when you have an interest for it!</p>
              <p>Take it easy man, it's great that you are giving your future some serious thought. That is something to be commended! Hope everyone had a great Chinese New Year (includes you too Stevenson) and all the best for your future dude!</p>

              <p>That would my main worry when you mention you want to go for NYP. </p>
              <p>NYP is the poster child for the government's attempt to promote the game and animation industry. It has links with LucaArts and EDB and receives a lot of attention by the higher ups. Thus it is definitely the poly to go for if you're interested in the gaming industry.</p>
              <p>However, it also means the competition is particularly intense. They do however if i remember correctly, give interviews to determine how "passionate" you are to join the course when you don't have enough points to enter.</p>
              <p>You need to prepare a portfolio to show them though. But what you have to show them then i have no idea.</p>
