              <p>22 hours per week, studio time. But most people would spend at least 10 hours in the studio, coming back on weekends too, which makes that around 50 hours a week? lol it depends, really. I can assure you that out of the 50 hours they spent in the studio... at least 50% of the time isn't used productively.</p>
              <p>NYP is a good choice. At least from what I have heard, you stand a better chance getting a job after you graduate --- i'm not kidding.. </p>

              <p>True but the problem is there isn't a unified course(That i know of) that handles programming and game design. Most game programming courses that i know of deals completely with programming codes, which is actually supposed to work this way.  </p>
              <p>Unfortunately game design is still much regarded as an art, rather than a class of its own.</p>

              <p>It's great that you have decided on which course you are taking on now so you can concentrate on your O levels. I'm sure you are to focus better as you already know what you want to do after you graduate from secondary school.</p>
              <p>By the way, I think it should be a prerequsite that you know a bit of how 3D works, I think it actually would have an impact when you do programming. Understanding how 3D space works would be important when you see all the FPS staple right now.</p>
              <p>Great reference by the way Stevenson, I love the "Devil's Game Design Tips."</p>

              <p><br>Good luck then.</p>
              <p>I've talked briefly with my lead game designer. He personally thought if you want to apply for a game designer position fresh out in the industry he would like to see you do a mod of a game or a game map.</p>
              <p>Right now it's actually a bad idea to look for a course devoted to just game design because when you graduate you can only be a game designer and nothing else.</p>
              <p>Taking up modelling, animation or programming would allow you some flexibility because when you're a newbie getting in a game company no matter what should be your first piority to gain the experience.</p>
              <p>If you have any more doubts and questions in the future just PM me. Hope to see you in the industry in a few more years.</p>
