              <p>Singapore's gaming industry is crap. Be prepared to (spend money) and work in the United States if you want a successful career.Those high paying one includes Bungie Studios, Valve etc etc which is the world's known companies.</p>

              <p>i already looked it up it was mostly about animating videos, yea i am interested in that but not as a career, and regardign the diploma it's game design and developement, on sp, there some course alike in other poly but it isint as good. well if scripting for like 6 hour + is lazy , i really doubt what ur capable of. i have my own concepts and idea of small games i would like to make, but that's just part time stuff, it will the most bring 100 buck from the ads put at my game a month that's all.oh fyi, i do have my map up on gamespot, i have no idea who put it up though, it took me liek 6+ hours of scripting, if u think ur so hard working and efficient , come up with something as good, if u cant , take ur criticism and fk off</p>
              <p>Are u somesort of typical singaporean out-casted faggot? which can instantly jump to conclusion without much consideration with ur miniture brain. you can simply make assumption with no evidence at all, well i doubt most of ur post are relevent to the topic, when someone ask for a game developer carrier position, u give them some video animation company that make cold storage ads showing apple and milk boxes jumping around. sigh sadly this forum have unintellectual people like you posting near 5k of crappy post around,how sad.</p>

              <p>Please don't mention about your silly game maps which most kids around the world can also made them with the kindly provided map making tools in-game.</p>
              <p>Looking at how show-off you are about your little puny silly map, I can tell you honestly you are not good enough for the gaming world.</p>
              <p>Cos the gaming world is quite a niche and small industry at the moment as compared to the rest.</p>
              <p>So if you're not the best of the best, you won't even be able to apply at all. One of the major criteria for jobs in gaming industry is that you need to build up your own impressive PORTFOLIO first before you can even be considered for selection.</p>
              <p>You only made one map and you're already so show-off about it, that's so typical Singaporean mentality. Maybe you really don't have any other achievements in your life and that's why you're constantly harping on your silly uploaded map on gamespot where every registered user can also upload on gamespot.</p>
              <p>Other people only need to use a fraction of the time needed to create a game map as compared to you. If you're a bangalah worker, then 6hrs+ can buy you a cow back in bangalah land ok? And I will be sooo impressed and proud of you.</p>
              <p>But since you're not a bangalah, wasting 6hrs+ of your time on a game map only tells your future employers how inefficient and unproductive you are as an employee. Do you think you deserved a pay rise for that? You'll probably be lucky to keep your job if your employers decides to tell you that you won't be getting any pay rise this year and you get to keep your job.</p>
              <p>As a TS, you created this topic to ask for opinions, but when I give you my opinions, you think you know better.</p>
              <p>If that's the case, then why don't you tell us what you really know?</p>
              <p>Unless you created this topic because you think you know the most amongst the forumers here in sgforums and you think you would like to take this opportunity to boost your own inflated-ego and build up your confidence and show-off to everyone in here that you're planning to study in a "cool" diploma course?</p>

              <p><br>Alright i work in the game industry so i'd give you some advice from my knowledge</p>
              <p>Best of what i can understand from you, is that essentially you want to be a game designer. The job scope of a game designer basically means designing the world levels, quests and overall structure of the game.</p>
              <p>Most local gaming schools here i think don't really give an actual practical education in terms of game designing. It's pretty much a global thing, since technology is moving faster than any schools could keep up.</p>
              <p>Actually i would correct parn on her opinions. I have talked with my game designers colleague before on what is required of them when they go for an interview.</p>
              <p>They recommended making mini quests using Free RPG makers, though i believe the Warcraft map creation engine works pretty well as well but how exactly do you submit what you've done i'm not sure. So designing maps is actually useful in this sense.</p>
              <p>I can check with them and see if you like.</p>

              <p>Yes, i fully intend to be international in the future. Why stay in Singapore when you can explore the world during your youth?</p>
              <p>I know NYP's game design course is good as i was from there. You will practice level design i can assure you, during one of the modules, our assignment was to create a multiplayer game map using the Quake 3 editor. The module is actually called: "Games Level Design".</p>
              <p>Trust me, apply for NYP. You will enjoy yourself from what i'm hearing of you. If you like the designing/artistic side, go to "Digital Media Design". If you like doing hard coding &amp; technical stuff, go to "Digital Entertainment Technology". You will do cool stuff during your 3rd year like motion capturing &amp; character modeling. If you love games, you will surely enjoy your 3 years in poly.</p>

              <p>there will also be a maya class for 3d animation.under module GDDS1</p>
              <p>thn there will be games design and principles which teaches u about game mechanics and things about games which is rather useless IMO. THE module GDP</p>
              <p>there is also an acting in animation class, where u learn acting for animation purposes. this one is under the module GDDS1</p>
              <p>there is also scriptwriting for first years where u have to write a 30 pages script based on ur own idea. under the module SGD</p>
              <p>Thn there is also Flash for year 1 which is immensely boring, the teacher for flash is quite lousy. the module is 2DGD</p>
              <p>Thn there is History of Ideas (HTI) which teaches quite a lot of things like character archetypes, philosophy, arts  Etc Etc. and u will have to hand in a journal regarding the topics taught every semester in addition to other projects given to u in the module.</p>
              <p>lastly, there is 2d game tools, where they teach u how to use photoshop and adobe illustrator.quite boring, all u have to do is buy the txtbook and use it, the teacher is rather useless.</p>
              <p>IF u do not like drawing, it is better for u not to join this course as there will be a lot of drawing involve.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there will be a lot of projects to hand in.</p>
              <p>These are the modules for Year 1-Sem 1, year 1-sem 2 onwards i do not know them that well since i withdrew from the course before sem 2 started.</p>
              <p>and also the workload for this course is i would say as much as or more than jc workload because of all the projects and homework. and i know quite a few ppl who joined the course only to find it not to their liking.Furthermore, the teachers are not that good except for the one teaching HTI.</p>
              <p>AND aside from these modules, there will be 2 additional modules not related to the course like Critical Reasoning Skills, IDEAS etc etc. for the 1st semester and u will be having General Elective Modules for the 2nd semester.</p>
              <p>IT is also not easy to score well in this course cause it is subjective. and by taking this course, u will limit the amount of courses u can take in public uni. i believe that there are only 2 courses open to DGDD students in Uni, and furthermore the course in uni is not directly related to what u have studied since there is no game design course in uni.</p>
              <p>Think carefully before making ur decision.</p>

              <p>oh yea and i forgot to mention that u nid a lot of creativity for this course cause u nid to come up with ur own game in the first year already.First year doing boardgame btw.</p>
              <p>if u cannot come up with an interesting and creative and fun game, you will lose out. and by the way, there are quite a lot of talented and creative people taking the course too.</p>
              <p>and furthermore u got to be creative in ur scripting and in other projects as well as DGDD is not all about scripting.</p>
              <p>if u are not creative and hardworking u will lose out in the industry. by hardworking, be prepared to work 13 hrs a day for ur project in year 3, since year 1 is nothing compared to year 3 and in year 1 u already get bombarded by projects. when u go out to work in the gaming industry, u shld also be prepared to work 13 hours a day.</p>
              <p>to sum it up when u work, u work for long hours and for low pay. unless u make it big in the industry or talented enough to get into a major company for games, however at the start u will be working long hours for low pay and it is very difficult to make it big in the industry as its not just about hardwork, u nid alot of creativity too.</p>
              <p>so think carefully about the decision.</p>

              <p>Anyways , TS , do what your interest takes you to. If you're really interested in making <strong>successful</strong> games , you gotta try and be the best. Parn's right. Singapore companies hasn't produce any <strong>good</strong> games atm. Mostly the ideas and stuff like that is imported from USA , Japan , Korean , etc.</p>
              <p>Then if you really wanna make a successful one , i can tell you it's gonna be hard work. I am already struggling with mere mobile applications in IT, you can imagine what's gonna take you if you're developing a game project.</p>

              <p>It's not that I don't want to encourage TS to go for it, but unlike other career choice, but to blindly encouraged TS to jump into the gaming industry without possessing the right kind of mentality would be causing TS more harm than good in his future career...even though it's not like he really cares what I advised him anyway. As long as I'm not typing things that he wants to read, he would be upset...and so I don't even bother to respond to his idiotic post.</p>
              <p>Like I have mentioned before, gaming industry is quite a niche industry to penetrate into if he is not good enough or committed to this as his career.</p>
              <p>So far, TS have not displayed any form of commitments towards his career in the gaming industry. He probably have a very naive view of it and maybe nobody here really knows enough to advise him of the kind of work and time that this kind of career expects out of him.</p>
              <p>I don't think anyone really knows what kind of job TS would like to work as for his future career. And I think TS himself also have no idea what kind of job he would like to work as for his future career and the job scope.</p>
              <p>It may be a fun thing for TS to do right now and enjoy his diploma course for what is worth. But if TS is unwilling or he has NO MONEY to further his interest in the gaming industry or he does not have a future plan and prepared to make any sacrifice and commitments for saving up enough money to further his education overseas, then TS must be prepared to have another backup path for his career.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, like I have mentioned many times, gaming industry is a niche market and no matter how "cool" it is going to sound, there's nothing to be cool about if you don't have any backup plan and ended up jobless in a dying career in Singapore in the future.</p>
              <p>Of course we can always advise and encourage any tom, dick or harry that comes hopping onto the sgforums to pick on our brains or look for trouble or ashamed to use their main nick to ask for help in times of trouble. But if I were to advise or encourage anyone, I'll first want to assess the person before I give out the wrong advice or maybe the person really don't deserves any advice from me at all, then I'll let it pass and maybe I think the person already had enough good advices, then I'll also skip and go to read another thread.</p>
              <p>Every advice counts and of course every single drop of flames also matters. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br> Alright i work in the game industry so i'd give you some advice
                              from my knowledge</p>
              <p>Best of what i can understand from you, is that essentially you
                              want to be a game designer. The job scope of a game designer
                              basically means designing the world levels, quests and overall
                              structure of the game.</p>
              <p>Most local gaming schools here i think don't really give an
                              actual practical education in terms of game designing. It's pretty
                              much a global thing, since technology is moving faster than any
                              schools could keep up.</p>
              <p>Actually i would correct parn on her opinions. I have
                              talked with my game designers colleague before on what is required
                              of them when they go for an interview.</p>
              <p>They recommended making mini quests using Free RPG makers,
                              though i believe the Warcraft map creation engine works pretty well
                              as well but how exactly do you submit what you've done i'm not
                              sure. So designing maps is actually useful in this sense.</p>
              <p>I can check with them and see if you like.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>ty for ur insights</p>
              <p>btw my map was a tower defense game, that's why it require so much scripts.</p>
              <p>cool, but im more into <span style="text-decoration: underline;">game developing</span>, not map design, btw what i design wasn't exactly a map, it was a tower defense game lol, there's only 2 made for the game coz it require massive scripting lol. so im not very into level design but more on the concept like how enemy comes in, where are the mountains but not the geography of the land etc...</p>
              <p>and i mean securing the entry to the course with port folio, not career yet. coz im afriad i might not get enough points. just in case.</p>
              <p>oh and if u make an rpg with some client wont it be unpopular? i mean is there a rpg maker for flash instead? which then i can upload the game to like newground etc and it get rated and comments. so it it get good rating and amount of plays, it's obvious that it is good and easier to show whoever too.</p>

              <p>other than programming there are other things as well</p>
              <p>there will be drawing, learning how to draw and everyweek u got
              to hand in an assignment for drawing.under the module GDDS1</p>
              <p>there will also be a maya class for 3d animation.under module
              GDDS1</p>
              <p>thn there will be games design and principles which teaches u
              about game mechanics and things about games which is rather useless
              IMO. THE module GDP</p>
              <p>there is also an acting in animation class, where u learn acting
              for animation purposes. this one is under the module GDDS1</p>
              <p>there is also scriptwriting for first years where u have to
              write a 30 pages script based on ur own idea. under the module
              SGD</p>
              <p>Thn there is also Flash for year 1 which is immensely boring,
              the teacher for flash is quite lousy. the module is 2DGD</p>
              <p>Thn there is History of Ideas (HTI) which teaches quite a
              lot of things like character archetypes, philosophy, arts  Etc
              Etc. and u will have to hand in a journal regarding the topics
              taught every semester in addition to other projects given to u in
              the module.</p>
              <p>lastly, there is 2d game tools, where they teach u how to use
              photoshop and adobe illustrator.quite boring, all u have to do is
              buy the txtbook and use it, the teacher is rather useless.</p>
              <p>IF u do not like drawing, it is better for u not to join this
              course as there will be a lot of drawing involve.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there will be a lot of projects to hand in.</p>
              <p>These are the modules for Year 1-Sem 1, year 1-sem 2 onwards i
              do not know them that well since i withdrew from the course before
              sem 2 started.</p>
              <p>and also the workload for this course is i would say as much as
              or more than jc workload because of all the projects and homework.
              and i know quite a few ppl who joined the course only to find it
              not to their liking.Furthermore, the teachers are not that good
              except for the one teaching HTI.</p>
              <p>AND aside from these modules, there will be 2 additional modules
              not related to the course like Critical Reasoning Skills, IDEAS etc
              etc. for the 1st semester and u will be having General Elective
              Modules for the 2nd semester.</p>
              <p>IT is also not easy to score well in this course cause it is
              subjective. and by taking this course, u will limit the amount of
              courses u can take in public uni. i believe that there are only 2
              courses open to DGDD students in Uni, and furthermore the course in
              uni is not directly related to what u have studied since there is
              no game design course in uni.</p>
              <p>Think carefully before making ur decision.</p>

              <p>Yes, i fully intend to be international in the future. Why stay
              in Singapore when you can explore the world during your youth?</p>
              <p>I know NYP's game design course is good as i was from there. You
              will practice level design i can assure you, during one of the
              modules, our assignment was to create a multiplayer game map using
              the Quake 3 editor. The module is actually called: "Games Level
              Design".</p>
              <p>Trust me, apply for NYP. You will enjoy yourself from what i'm
              hearing of you. If you like the designing/artistic side, go to
              "Digital Media Design". If you like doing hard coding &amp;
              technical stuff, go to "Digital Entertainment Technology". You will
              do cool stuff during your 3rd year like motion capturing &amp;
              character modeling. If you love games, you will surely enjoy your 3
              years in poly.</p>

              <p>Go for NYP if you are really interested in gaming development. However, be prepared that it's not going to be easy. My specialization was Digital Entertainment last time (not that I'm good at it), and there was intensive hardcore programming to be done. A simple mini game already requires alot of codings. It's very taxing but if u really don't mind doing C++ programming (which is kinda difficult), then go for it.</p>
              <p>My lecturer once told me that even though gaming industry is not popular yet,  but if u are really good and interested in what u are doing, u will excel in that industry and there will be good prospects.</p>

              hmmm. i think nyp is better in this area since they started earlier and produced more results.
              
              anyway, if ur into scripting, then better dun come this course in sp. 
              
              dgdd in sp is more towards designing and development aspects (thats why its called game design and development), and since scripting is part of the development phase, we do learn a bit here and there.
              
              basically this course only teaches the basics of everything, and u have to choose wad u wan to specialise in and improve on ur own. 1 of the third years is actually better in scripting using python (for panda3D) then the lecturer.
