              <p>Yes this is like the previous dead thread, me too is interested in game design and development . I am not wanting to slack either and i know how it's like, i rmb i coded a stage for a game taking like 6 hours+ (it's on game spot) so i really dun mind hard work ,(probably as long as it is on computer). I am not like those gamers who think making sophisticated games is easy</p>
              <p>I am in my O level now, yes sad year, i am really very interested in game developement. I probably not so much into design as i am not so interested in art, but the making of games. oh yea the thing is ,-i dun like studying , but i can really work whole day on my computer though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from the previous thread, it really is confusing to read, there is encouraging post and extremly discouraging post,</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>the positive:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>-Yea go ahead... as long as you create fun games for gamers like
                                                  me to play in the future</p>
              <p>-yes i believe that this is a course which requires lotsa
                                                  passion. and if you can make it, go ahead. there's nth better then studying what you like, and working in a
                                                  job that you like as well.</p>
              <p>-Yea since you’ve got the passion for the course, then go for
                                                  it.</p>
              <p>-One gaming company?<br> <br> Actually there are loads of gaming companies in
                                                  Singapore........<br> <br> If i had the money i would love to go high on digital animation and
                                                  game design......and i would also open my own gaming company and
                                                  studio and also be one of the first Singaporean company to produce
                                                  an international CG movie......<br> <br> I wish it would come true someday......i can just imagine being the
                                                  director of a game and get the best crew in Singapore so that we
                                                  can make a name for our country....</p>

              <p>-worse is games design course. spore can dream of making US hit
                                                  games like maple leave or little fighter, at the most they'll work
                                                  for Nestle to design pathetic children games distributed to kids
                                                  for free wif evry purchase of Nestle.</p>
              <p>haiz..i dont think this course is good la. leads to nowhere one.
                                                  unless u can secure a position in square-enix ,capcom or EA
                                                  games,etc. if not. <img title="Sad" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"></p>
              <p>right now, in singapore, there are alot of games companies set up
                                                  locally, but as the industry is still in infancy stage, they are
                                                  now still gaining experience by starting with casual games, mobile
                                                  games, etc.</p>
              if you're talking about the PC / PS2 / xBox games industry, it
                                                  doesn't even exist.<br> if you're talking about those small-time, Java-based little games
                                                  for mobile phones, we do have a small but slowly-growing market
                                                  here.<br> the industry for mainstream gaming (PC / console) won't be
                                                  established in the next couple of decades.</blockquote>

              <p>What you would mainly do is programming. So yes, you will spend loads of time on your computer typing out coding for the games &amp; homework would be lots of memorizing.

              <p>I transferred out because i realized that programming wasn't the thing for me. My interest just didn't lie there. I am a more visual person &amp; technical things bore me. I'm currently pursuing an Arts Diploma @ LaSalle.</p>
              <p>A lot of key memorizing is involved as C++ programming has ALOT of coding to remember. I agree with what you said about getting it in your brain, but that is with many years of practice. It is tough i can assure you, but since you don't mind programming the whole day &amp; if gaming is your passion, go for it! You'll enjoy yourself.</p>

              <p>Thanks shadez for sharing<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png">, well although i script a map whole day i think it is diff from coding, but nvm at holiday-after O level i will try some coding(i bet it's still like the map scripting-whole day work),but i'll still enjoy it though, it's not about whole day coding but seeing what u  made comes alive and mainly seeing other ppl play it.</p>
              <p>so yea, i think i will go for it!</p>
              <p>oh i think i may go to digipen institute in the future and aim for game developer certificate.</p>
              <p>oh but is there any other route? in case anything goes wrong, like is there other institute?oh and i rmb there's other game dev courses but sp one look better, coz others is catergerized in like"multimedia and animation""game design" they dun look specialised at all, too general .and i fear i cant get in sp poly, it need 14 points, is there any thing like direct poly or port folio? meaning like i request for that course first and they will secure my position more, letting me enter with below 20 points. or maybe can i get in with interview, maybe i'll make a basic game and show them my maps and other stuff that show my interest in the course.Im really worried i cant enter that course..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oh and shadez where do u plan to go after u get all ur degree ? im thinking ea singapore but there wont always be a position, so the choice in singapore are rather limited...</p>

              <p><br>I see....didn't expect that you're an "expert" about this.</p>
              <p>Since you are not interested in animation, maybe you should go for the other areas in game making then.</p>
              <p>Do you know which areas you're interested in?</p>
              <p>Oh wait....do you even know what areas you can specialise in game making?</p>
              <p>I hope an "expert" like yourself can tell me what areas you're interested in developing/nurturing in the game making industry.</p>
              <p>If you really think your diploma course is going to make you a one-person game creator, then you are just too naive. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I just thought it would be better for you to be an ace of one trade than a joker of all trades. </p>
              <p>But I must be wrong to have higher expectations for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>If you do not have enough interest towards a gaming related career to look it up and research about it on google, then what makes you think you really like that diploma course and you are going to do well in it?</p>
              <p>As far as I can see, you're just lazy and hoping by entering and studying some cool courses like game design &amp; development, you will be shaving some easy money and hoping that your peers might be seeing you very de up.</p>
              <p>You must be super naive to have such imaginations. Up till now, I still cannot comprehend which part of the education systems or upbringing actually nurtures such hopeless imaginations in Singaporeans nowadays.</p>
              <p>You won't make any game even if you're free during your free time, simply because you're just too plain lazy and you have no idea what kind of game you are going to make.</p>
              <p>Is your own home-made game ever going to be good enough for anyone else to enjoy? I don't think you will even enjoy the game that you have created if you can come up with any good idea for a game or if you can even create one at all.</p>
              <p>Before you reply any further, you should first do some research on the internet regarding the diploma course that you want to pursue and the kind of "cool" jobs that you have always imagined to work as in your future. And you must be really good at what you are doing first and have your own portfolios ready before your employers would even want to consider you for any position in your future companies.</p>
              <p>Animations is already the most fun part of the game creation process, unless you want to be a game-tester? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I would actually recommend you to apply @ NYP as they have a more intensive "game production" programmes than SP. Under the SIDM (School of Interactive Digital Media), there are 2 courses: "Diploma in Digital Entertainment Technology" &amp; Diploma in Digital Media Design". These courses, one of which i was from, are intensive programmes that REALLY focus mainly on games.</p>
              <p>What i would like to know is which part of the game production cycle are you most interested in? Is it a) the creative side or b) the technical side?</p>
              <p>You can enter via "Special Admission Exercise"(?) using portfolio, which was how i got in. Just bring your created game levels &amp; you should be able to get in. Most important is to show your passion during the interview.</p>

              <p>Quite honestly, i've not got an ideal job in mind. Most preferbably something in the creative industry, fashion design or graphic design. The course i'm in now focuses on creating interfaces (eg. Wii Remote, PS3 controllers...etc) so i might pursue that job scope.</p>
              <p>Personally though, i detest office jobs where i have to wear a shirt &amp; pants everyday. The great thing about designing companies (even game companies) is that they don't require you to dress formally. Wearing shorts &amp; tee to work is the norm. That's what i'm aiming for...</p>

              <p><br>Your course does not only involves scripting for games, if it is...then you should pick another course as this is a useless course.</p>
              <p>Why don't you try to tell people in the gaming industry that you have scripted for like 6hrs+ for a silly map and uploaded it on gamespot?</p>
              <p>You might get alot of blank stares followed by unlimited LOLs from them. If they kept quiet, it also doesn't means you're good...it just meant they are either trying to hold back their laughter or they think you're just another idiotic kid from Singapore.</p>
              <p>Anybody also can upload their game maps on gamespot, so who are you trying to fool around here? And if you are not the only person in the world that can create game maps with the map making tools provided by the game. &lt;--- Don't you know that? And if you do know it's nothing special, is there any cause for you to brag about it?</p>
              <p>If you can't even handle animations or create them, then you certainly are not ready to be a game developer.</p>

              <p>think shadez's advice to go NYP is pretty good.<br><br>there are usually 3 "parts" involved in making a game<br><br>1) Programming (coding / creating the game engine)<br>2) Art (concept, 3d modelling and animation)<br>3) Design (Level / map design, and gameplay design)<br><br>from what you mentioned, seems like you want to do the 3rd "part".<br>NYP does have courses that caters to that, as mentioned by shadez :)<br><br>though what you mentioned is right. there are not many jobs in sg for designers (most go to the art and programming side), but there are also very few people who actually study and are good at game design. so it's still a viable option for you, if that is your interest.</p>

              <p><br>Please branch it out all the parts more clearly for the naive TS.</p>
