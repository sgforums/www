            <div class='col-md body'>I was a former student at Cat High. For those of you who do not know where cat high is, it's located along Bishan St 22 and Bishan St 24. We moved into the new premises, if my memory serves me correctly in 1994, from what is now Ai Tong School in the Sin Ming area. I can tell you that although I haven't personally encountered any supernatural occurances, they has been a lot of stories circulating around of this nature. I'm sure those of you who were formerly of Cat High Primary know the story of the toilet near what was/is the Primary 1 classrooms. But personally, used that toilet a couple of times myself, nothing strange happended.<br><br>My brother too just entered Cat High Sec, thus he was required to participate in the orientation camp. During the camp itself, it was arranged for the students to sleep in the classrooms. (The classrooms were the sec 1 and 2 classrooms that faced the field). According to my brother before nightfall, the student leaders specifically warned that students not to shine their tourches into the field at night. However, as it is, you are dealing with a bunch of 13 year olds buzzing with curiousity, so a warning as grave as it might sound is actually taken as a challenge. As expected, an individual decided to find out for himself why he should not shine tourches into the night when told not do so. What he saw could not be ascertain, but my brother told me that the boy's face turn totally pale of shock. Apparently, he was inconcilable after the incident and had to be taken to another part of the school, with the sighting still remaining a mystery.<br></div>
