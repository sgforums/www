              <p>Just want to check how many of you would dare to approach girls on the street and how would you start you conversation with?</p>
              <p>Most of the time when I board the train from harbourfront to my place at buangkok, there was this girl who also board in the same station as me and alight also the same. She captured my attention when in train and even sat beside me, when we both alight at the same station we walk quite close to each other towards the escaloter, my heart was beating fast and wondering how would I approach? It's kind of weird when you walk up to her and straight away ask for number right? would it scare her off? (for girls answer).</p>
              <p>Any creative ideas?</p>

              <p>from what i heard from female friends, they don't really like the idea
              of getting approached on the streets, if you're not good looking don't
              even bother. in that 30 seconds (at most) all she does is judge your
              appearance lol. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Personally, I am not interested in starting conversations wih stranger, male or female, regardless of appearance.</p>
              <p>But if you are interested, here are some things which you may try out:</p>
              <p>1) Direct approach. The next time you meet her, tell her what a coincidence it is and say Hi to her. Start a conversation which you are able to control, and make it short and sweet to prevent her from finding you irritating. Do this repeatedly for 3 ~ 5 times at least, then you can start asking for her e-mail first. Only after you chatted with her quite often, then should you attempt to get her hp no.</p>
              <p>Oh, did I mention that this approach should only be tried out only if you are good-looking enough?</p>
              <p>2) 'Accidental' approach. Bump into her 'by accident' or drop your coins/ items near her. Apologise/thank her for helping you pick the items up in the respective cases, and start a conversation with her about how often it is that the two of you see each other. If she say yes, she often see you, then you can try starting a short conversation with her everytime you meet her, till you feel confident enough to ask for her hp no. If she says no, she doesn't remember you, I suggest that you don't bother to try anything further out.</p>
              <p>Well, once again, your looks matter. If you are not at least above average-looking, don't bother trying.</p>
              <p>3) 'Helping' approach. This one requires a bit of luck and you to be around. When she drops something, or couldn't find a seat while you have one, help her out by doing the gentlemanly thing. Next, start a conversation with her after she thanked you, and mention about how often you see her. Depending on her reactions, if she say yes, she remembers you, then start a conversation with her. Continue this everytime you meet her, and you should be able to get her hp no. by the 3rd time you meet her. If she doesn't remember you, then start a conversation everytime you meet her, and by the 6th time you talk to her, ask for her e-mail. Only ask for her hp no. when you think the 2 of you have converse enough.</p>
              <p>In this case, you only need to look average at least. It is the 'best' scenario, but you will need quite a bit of luck.</p>
              <p>All in all, I will say that appearance matters a lot, so make sure you put on some gel and try to look neat/cool when you decided to try approaching her. Btw, everything above is read up by me, so don't blame me if they don't work.</p>

              <p>You're talking about what human beings in britain or aus would do. Singaporeans aren't into that, so if you wanna strike a conversation with her, you need to be with her for at least a few years in some common institution... only then will you have a shot ha.</p>
              <p>Pathetic isn't it? But that's sin city.</p>
