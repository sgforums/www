              <p>well, u r lucky to b sharing the train with her, same time at the same carriage....</p>
              <p>take a long time for that to work. Beside, if u keep meeting the same people over and over again, wont it seem rude for not making an effort to know one another?</p>

              <p>hey brother, you will be fine as long as you exalt a little confidence. girls like men, not boys and the moment you lack it, it turns you to a little boy.</p>
              <p>there is nothing to lose actually. i have my fair share of rejection too... actually success rate is 30% but hey! isn't that like sales, you can't be selling Toyota to everyone on the street but there is a 50% target audience that can only afford a Toyota or likes a Toyota and look where it brought them, the top of the motor industry.</p>

              <p>She had tanned skin, average height, hair tied into two pony tails.</p>
              <p>She looked cute and more so when she smiles....thump thump...</p>

              <p>Heart beating a little faster, i went to her counter and asked for a drink. While she was doing so, i asked if she was a perm staff and it turned out she's a part timer and in her 3rd year of her poly studies.</p>

              <p>frankly, i did know a gal on the train a few years back. we always got on from the same train station (NE Serangoon) but she'll alight at Dhoby Ghaut... i used the same strategy, visual flirting and after a few days, just wave a "hi" and subsequently chatted with her. there was once i was on leave but i just wanted to see her. we chatted and i offered to walk her to her office, she asked won't i be late and i just said, "for you, it's worth it" and i was given the opportunity to walk her to her work place.</p>

              <p>hey brother, you will be fine as long as you exalt a little confidence. girls like men, not boys and the moment you lack it, it turns you to a little boy.</p>
              <p>there is nothing to lose actually. i have my fair share of rejection too... actually success rate is 30% but hey! isn't that like sales, you can't be selling Toyota to everyone on the street but there is a 50% target audience that can only afford a Toyota or likes a Toyota and look where it brought them, the top of the motor industry.</p>
