              <p>well, that's your opinion and i have nothing to say... if you do not like to use cars to compare women as an anology, you can use brands, food, fruits or even exclusive properties like the Peak in Hongkong... i'll stay with car brands but that's me.</p>
              <p>i personally do not wish my wife to be a high flyer... i mean personally. i am a low profile guy. if my wife is a hot shot lawyer whose life is always on the rush, going to court, fighting battles after office hours in her office while i'm left to watch tv alone, i'd rather not even consider... i've seen many high flyers divorced after a few years due to hectic work schedules. i have friends who are accountants, lawyers, doctors and even property agents who are doing very well. big cars, big houses, big paycheck but they aren't able to balance work and family. now that's a fact that we can't deny; once we neglect them, they will drift further from us and once they cross that thin fine line, we aren't going to get them back.</p>
              <p>if you wish to define girlfriends; i can see where you are going... you can bring them around to "show off". "hey, my gal is one of the best female lawyers in Singapore." or "you know her first property is a 4 million bungalow all by herself?" but once you have to choose a wife, i'll advise you to find one that is family orientated if you wish to be married for a long long time... likewise for ladies, if you wish to find a husband, find one who is also family orientated. unless you would prefer one that stays out working till wee hours in the night and the first to be out of the house without kissing you good morning?</p>
              <p>so personally and thank the Almighty God, my wife isn't a high flyer... she's just a staff nurse who only wish to snaggle with me after work... she has no big ambition but just to grow old with me. we don't stay in a big condominium or bungalow, just a 4 room HDB flat and a Mitsubishi Lancer. we have enough to eat and enough clothes to wear. she does buy branded stuffs sometimes but nothing over $500. our weekends are spent on window shopping or a pinic at east coast or pasir ris park... maybe a movie or two if good movies are in town.</p>
              <p>we do travel once in a while and we just got back from Hong Kong in June before Swine Flu... we hope to travel to Italy one day to see the Pope but we are not in a hurry. i have desire to climb higher in my company but that is just to afford a little more luxury, maybe a Toyota Allion in September... but again, that's just me</p>
              <p>further more Ferrari may not appeal to everyone either... there's still Porsche, Bugatti, Pangani, Koenigsegg, Mercedes, Maybach, BMW, Lamborghini and Aston Martin... woah, a long list.</p>

              <p>comparing toyota to ferrari is as good as comparing plain jane to elite sucessful beautiful women. Who dun want a hot and performing car? Dun u want ur lady to be both hot and performing (be it smart, sucessful, etc)?</p>
              <p>but using ferrari on angel? that is kinda overkill. Plz dun shame ferrari.... ferrari aint trophy wife/ger.... they does even better then they look.</p>

              <p>well, that's your opinion and i have nothing to say... if you do
              not like to use cars to compare women as an anology, you can use
              brands, food, fruits or even exclusive properties like the Peak in
              Hongkong... i'll stay with car brands but that's me.</p>
              <p><strong>i personally do not wish my wife to be a high flyer... i mean
              personally. i am a low profile guy. if my wife is a hot shot lawyer

              after office hours in her office while i'm left to watch tv alone,
              i'd rather not even consider... i've seen many high flyers divorced
              after a few years due to hectic work schedules. i have friends who
              are accountants, lawyers, doctors and even property agents who are
              doing very well. big cars, big houses, big paycheck but they aren't
              able to balance work and family. now that's a fact that we can't
              deny; once we neglect them, they will drift further from us and

              <p>i have worked as a surveyor before and i had to approached hundreds of people over 3 nights.</p>
              <p>well i managed to approach all of em- something which i found out was that generally everyone likes to be approached. I approach them with manners(asking if they can spare me 2 minutes of their time) and talked in a courteous tone.</p>
              <p>Asking for a phone number straight in the face without even talking to her for a few minutes is akin to embarrassing yourself. Case example: I have seen 2 dudes on a street approaching a pair of secondary school students for their contact number. Apparently because they dont know anything about being approached and approaching, they DICKproached themselves.</p>
