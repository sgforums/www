And a TRAVELLER in the land and kingdoms of your LORD... But is there MORE to that? I have UNCOMPLETED THEORIES to work with.... IF one fine day I'm DONE... MAYBE we shall MEET AGAIN?<br><br><strong><br>Do you know that among the 300 greatest scientists during the 17th-19th century, 242 scientists were God-believers? More than 90% of the scientists in US, Britain, and France were Christians.  The rest either are God believers (Catholics or Jewish )or non-believers .</strong><br><br>NO DOUBT, there WERE there... BUT they're also the DEFEATED ones.... Yes... Great inventions and such come from them all.... BUT they were also the ones STUCK STONED when MAJOR REVOLUNTIONARY DISCOVERIES SCIENCE hit them HARD. Yes... They stood STRONG in their FAITH of SCIENCE... In the FOUNDATION laid down (nothing to do with religion...)... STILL, the TRUTH is as COLD as the WALLS....<br>An ADDITIONAL POINT to add... &gt; 90% of the scientists were Christians DOESN'T prove ANYTHING... Take for INSTANCE a MAJORITY of a certain country is full of UNREASONABLE VIOLENCE CREATORS..... Is that a GREAT THING or what...? I'm not saying ANYTHING about Christians here... But please refrain from giving this sort of STUPID examples...<br><br><strong><br>Almost all technology you use in your home were invented by Christians or are the results of Christian inventions - TV &amp; Light bulb (invented by Thomas Edison who is a Christian), discovery of electricity and advancement of electronics etc are by Christians.<br><br>Since you dislike Christians so much, please prove it by stop using them ok thanks.</strong><br><br>Your words AMUSES me.... WONDER WHO told you all the CHUNK of FACTs above which you CANNOT even properly understand? These are the FRUIT of SCIENCE... NOT RELIGION... In QUOTING such IRRELEVANT EXAMPLES, your FRAME of mind is none less childish than OSAMA BIN LADEN.... If the chairs you sit, tables you use... Noodles you eat... Are NOT cooked by Christians.... Does that mean you DON'T EAT or USE them....? Please DON'T use RELIGION in a IRRELEVANT way..... A RELIGION is USED to PRAISE a GOD... NOT to SHOW OFF....<br><br><strong><br>Got meh? how come we only know about Thomas Edison, Michael Faraday, Isaac Newton or Galileo?<br>Is there any famous Muslim scientist such as Osama bin Edison?  Why can't anyone recall of any Muslim inventions??<br></strong><br><br>MANY NICE NAMES up there? I'm SURE IF one really TRY HARD enough they can DOUBLE the number of non-Christian inventors for you? What's WRONG with you..? INVENTION is SCIENCE not RELIGION.... BIG NAMES A..? HOW MUCH do you REALLY know about those people up there...? Their CONTRIBUTIONS...? FLAWS...? I'm NOT AGAINST CHRISTIANs.... But I'm quite SURE SOME of them would be pretty much a little UPSET with the kinda AIR you POST...<br></blockquote>To CONCLUDE, RELIGION and SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES are SEPARATE issues altogether.

How many god we have?<br><br>Genesis 3:6 -3:7<br>"So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate. Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons."<br>Genesis 3:21 - 3:22<br>"And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them. Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever"<br><br>Then I must thank Satan, at least he freed me from puppet life. I want my own life.<br><br>As for the cloth, I wear because I want to cloth myself against wind, sun, and of cause I know what is good and bad. I am not ashamed of my body, I am naked infront of myself, my mom, my dad, everyone when young. I am naked now to my beloved. but to do it in public, it is against the law, it is not that I can't , but law doesn't aprroved it.<br><br>You dare kyo23 to strip, you are evil as satan, how sinful can you be? you know the law doesn't allow, how about yourself, why you wear clothes, BECAUSE YOU GOT A BRAIN WHICH YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD!!!<br></div>
