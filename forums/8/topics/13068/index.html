            <div class='col-md body'>I guess so. Then again, according to bible literature, it is not jus the dying that kills. Its the eternal separation from an Eternal God that matters.

Some examples, first man and woman fell into sin, BUT Jesus became the sin and raise our helpless positions to heavely positions.

            <div class='col-md body'>To joanne:<br>the prophecy of Bible thousands of years on Europe - prophecy of seven heads and ten horns , which are the leaders of the various countries of Europe.<br><br>please read below<br><br>Revelation 17:9 - 17:18<br>"This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated;  they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain only a little while.  As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to perdition.  And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast.  These are of one mind and give over their power and authority to the beast;  they will make war on the Lamb [Jesus], and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful."  And he said to me, "The waters that you saw, where the harlot is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.  And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire,  for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.  And the woman that you saw is the great city which has dominion over the kings of the earth."<br><br>(the above prophecy is on the way to coming true - now there are 12 countries in Euro currency,  Sweden, England and Norway is still deciding whether to join. Once joined there will be 15 countries. There may be 2 more countries like Switzerland and Hungary etc who might join in later when they see the benefits of common currency,<br>Till now, no one knows which country or who is "harlot"(the woman), but I suspect it is United States of America, because the Bible has prophecy about the Final World War,  it seemed that America was not mentioned to be involved. Why America will not be involved in the Final World War? The reason maybe because of - please read the above prophecy again and you'll understand why)<br><br>and soon the European countries will use a common currency, but will become cashless nations very soon (read below):<br><br>Revelation 13:16 - 13:18<br>"Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty-six. "<br><br>Joanne, please accept and have trust in Jesus, because God's prophecies on the world events is never wrong.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 08 January 2002).]</div>
