Then Esau went out to get the meat.<br>Gen 27:6 And Rebekah said to Jacob, her son, Your father said to your brother Esau in my hearing,<br>Gen 27:7 Go and get some roe's meat and make me a good meal, so that I may be full, and give you my blessing before the Lord before my death.<br>Gen 27:8 Now, my son, do what I say.<br>Gen 27:9 Go to the flock and get me two fat young goats; and I will make of them a meal to your father's taste:<br>Gen 27:10 And you will take it to him, so that he may have a good meal and give you his blessing before his death.<br>Gen 27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, But Esau my brother is covered with hair, while I am smooth:<br>Gen 27:12 If by chance my father puts his hand on me, it will seem to him that I am tricking him, and he will put a curse on me in place of a blessing.<br>Gen 27:13 And his mother said, Let the curse be on me, my son: only do as I say, and go and get them for me.<br>Gen 27:14 So he went and got them and took them to his mother: and she made a meal to his father's taste.<br>Gen 27:15 And Rebekah took the fair robes of her oldest son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob, her younger son:<br>Gen 27:16 And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck:<br>Gen 27:17 And she gave into the hand of Jacob, her son, the meat and the bread which she had made ready.<br>Gen 27:18 And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I: who are you, my son?<br>Gen 27:19 And Jacob said, I am Esau, your oldest son; I have done as you said: come now, be seated and take of my meat, so that you may give me a blessing.<br>Gen 27:20 And Isaac said, How is it that you have got it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord your God made it come my way.<br>Gen 27:21 And Isaac said, Come near so that I may put my hand on you, my son, and see if you are truly my son Esau or not.<br>Gen 27:22 And Jacob went near his father Isaac: and he put his hands on him; and he said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.<br>Gen 27:23 And he did not make out who he was, because his hands were covered with hair like his brother Esau's hands: so he gave him a blessing.<br>Gen 27:24 And he said, Are you truly my son Esau? And he said, I am.<br>Gen 27:25 And he said, Put it before me and I will take of my son's meat, so that I may give you a blessing. And he put it before him and he took it; and he gave him wine, and he had a drink.<br>Gen 27:26 And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, my son, and give me a kiss.<br>Gen 27:27 And he came near and gave him a kiss; and smelling the smell of his clothing, he gave him a blessing, and said, See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field on which the blessing of the Lord has come:<br>Gen 27:28 May God give you the dew of heaven, and the good things of the earth, and grain and wine in full measure:<br>Gen 27:29 Let peoples be your servants, and nations go down before you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother's sons go down before you: a curse be on everyone by whom you are cursed, and a blessing on those who give you a blessing.<br>Gen 27:30 And when Isaac had come to the end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had not long gone away from Isaac his father, Esau came in from the field.<br>Gen 27:31 And he made ready a meal, good to the taste, and took it to his father, and said to him, Let my father get up and take of his son's meat, so that you may give me a blessing.<br>Gen 27:32 And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your oldest son, Esau.<br>Gen 27:33 And in great fear Isaac said, Who then is he who got meat and put it before me, and I took it all before you came, and gave him a blessing, and his it will be?<br>Gen 27:34 And hearing the words of his father, Esau gave a great and bitter cry, and said to his father, Give a blessing to me, even to me, O my father!<br>Gen 27:35 And he said, Your brother came with deceit, and took away your blessing.<br>Gen 27:36 And he said, Is it because he is named Jacob that he has twice taken my place? for he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not kept a blessing for me?<br>Gen 27:37 And Isaac answering said, But I have made him your master, and have given him all his brothers for servants; I have made him strong with grain and wine: what then am I to do for you, my son?<br>Gen 27:38 And Esau said to his father, Is that the only blessing you have, my father? give a blessing to me, even me! And Esau was overcome with weeping.<br>Gen 27:39 Then Isaac his father made answer and said to him, Far from the fertile places of the earth, and far from the dew of heaven on high will your living-place be:<br>Gen 27:40 By your sword will you get your living and you will be your brother's servant; but when your power is increased his yoke will be broken from off your neck.<br>Gen 27:41 So Esau was full of hate for Jacob because of his father's blessing; and he said in his heart, The days of weeping for my father are near; then I will put my brother Jacob to death.<br>Gen 27:42 Then Rebekah, hearing what Esau had said, sent for Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, It seems that your brother Esau is purposing to put you to death.<br>Gen 27:43 So now, my son, do what I say: go quickly to Haran, to my brother Laban;<br>Gen 27:44 And be there with him for a little time, till your brother's wrath is turned away;<br>Gen 27:45 Till the memory of what you have done to him is past and he is no longer angry: then I will send word for you to come back; are the two of you to be taken from me in one day?<br>Gen 27:46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, My life is a weariness to me because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of Heth, such as these, the women of this land, of what use will my life be to me?<br>Gen 28:1 Then Isaac sent for Jacob, and blessing him, said, Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan;<br>Gen 28:2 But go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father, and there get yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.<br>Gen 28:3 And may God, the Ruler of all, give you his blessing, giving you fruit and increase, so that you may become an army of peoples.<br>Gen 28:4 And may God give you the blessing of Abraham, to you and to your seed, so that the land of your wanderings, which God gave to Abraham, may be your heritage.<br>Gen 28:5 So Isaac sent Jacob away: and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramaean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.<br>Gen 28:6 So when Esau saw that Isaac had given Jacob his blessing, and sent him away to Paddan-aram to get a wife for himself there, blessing him and saying to him, Do not take a wife from among the women of Canaan;<br>Gen 28:7 And that Jacob had done as his father and mother said and had gone to Paddan-aram;<br>Gen 28:8 It was clear to Esau that his father had no love for the women of Canaan,<br>Gen 28:9 So Esau went to Ishmael and took Mahalath, the daughter of Abraham's son Ishmael, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife in addition to the wives he had.<br>Gen 28:10 So Jacob went out from Beer-sheba to go to Haran.<br>Gen 28:11 And coming to a certain place, he made it his resting-place for the night, for the sun had gone down; and he took one of the stones which were there, and putting it under his head he went to sleep in that place.<br>Gen 28:12 And he had a dream, and in his dream he saw steps stretching from earth to heaven, and the angels of God were going up and down on them.<br>Gen 28:13 And he saw the Lord by his side, saying, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac: I will give to you and to your seed this land on which you are sleeping.<br>Gen 28:14 Your seed will be like the dust of the earth, covering all the land to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south: you and your seed will be a name of blessing to all the families of the earth.<br>Gen 28:15 And truly, I will be with you, and will keep you wherever you go, guiding you back again to this land; and I will not give you up till I have done what I have said to you.<br>Gen 28:16 And Jacob, awaking from his sleep, said, Truly, the Lord is in this place and I was not conscious of it.<br>Gen 28:17 And fear came on him, and he said, This is a holy place; this is nothing less than the house of God and the doorway of heaven.<br>Gen 28:18 And early in the morning Jacob took the stone which had been under his head, and put it up as a pillar and put oil on it.<br>Gen 28:19 And he gave that place the name of Beth-el, but before that time the town was named Luz.<br>Gen 28:20 Then Jacob took an oath, and said, If God will be with me, and keep me safe on my journey, and give me food and clothing to put on,<br>Gen 28:21 So that I come again to my father's house in peace, then I will take the Lord to be my God,<br>Gen 28:22 And this stone which I have put up for a pillar will be God's house: and of all you give me, I will give a tenth part to you.<br>Gen 29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey till he came to the land of the children of the East.<br>Gen 29:2 And there he saw a water-hole in a field, and by the side of it three flocks of sheep, for there they got water for the sheep: and on the mouth of the water-hole there was a great stone.<br>Gen 29:3 And all the flocks would come together there, and when the stone had been rolled away, they would give the sheep water, and put the stone back again in its place on the mouth of the water-hole.<br>Gen 29:4 Then Jacob said to the herdmen, My brothers, where do you come from? And they said, From Haran.<br>Gen 29:5 And he said to them, Have you any knowledge of Laban, the son of Nahor? And they said, We have.<br>Gen 29:6 And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well, and here is Rachel his daughter coming with the sheep.<br>Gen 29:7 Then Jacob said, The sun is still high and it is not time to get the cattle together: get water for the sheep and go and give them their food.<br>Gen 29:8 And they said, We are not able to do so till all the flocks have come together and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the water-hole; then we will get water for the sheep.<br>Gen 29:9 While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she took care of them.<br>Gen 29:10 Then when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, coming with Laban's sheep, he came near, and rolling the stone away from the mouth of the hole, he got water for Laban's flock.<br>Gen 29:11 And weeping for joy, Jacob gave Rachel a kiss.<br>Gen 29:12 And Rachel, hearing from Jacob that he was her father's relation and that he was the son of Rebekah, went running to give her father news of it.<br>Gen 29:13 And Laban, hearing news of Jacob, his sister's son, came running, and took Jacob in his arms, and kissing him, made him come into his house. And Jacob gave him news of everything.<br>Gen 29:14 And Laban said to him, Truly, you are my bone and my flesh. And he kept Jacob with him for the space of a month.<br>Gen 29:15 Then Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother are you to be my servant for nothing? say now, what is your payment to be?<br>Gen 29:16 Now Laban had two daughters: the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.<br>Gen 29:17 And Leah's eyes were clouded, but Rachel was fair in face and form.<br>Gen 29:18 And Jacob was in love with Rachel; and he said, I will be your servant seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.<br>Gen 29:19 And Laban said, It is better for you to have her than another man: go on living here with me.<br>Gen 29:20 And Jacob did seven years' work for Rachel; and because of his love for her it seemed to him only a very little time.<br>Gen 29:21 Then Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife so that I may have her, for the days are ended.<br>Gen 29:22 And Laban got together all the men of the place and gave a feast.<br>Gen 29:23 And in the evening he took Leah, his daughter, and gave her to him, and he went in to her.<br>Gen 29:24 And Laban gave Zilpah, his servant-girl, to Leah, to be her waiting-woman.<br>Gen 29:25 And in the morning Jacob saw that it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What have you done to me? was I not working for you so that I might have Rachel? why have you been false to me?<br>Gen 29:26 And Laban said, In our country we do not let the younger daughter be married before the older.<br>Gen 29:27 Let the week of the bride-feast come to its end and then we will give you the other in addition, if you will be my servant for another seven years.<br>Gen 29:28 And Jacob did so; and when the week was ended, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel for his wife.<br>Gen 29:29 And Laban gave Rachel his servant-girl Bilhah to be her waiting-woman.<br>Gen 29:30 Then Jacob took Rachel as his wife, and his love for her was greater than his love for Leah; and he went on working for Laban for another seven years.<br>Gen 29:31 Now the Lord, seeing that Leah was not loved, gave her a child; while Rachel had no children.<br>Gen 29:32 And Leah was with child, and gave birth to a son to whom she gave the name Reuben: for she said, The Lord has seen my sorrow; now my husband will have love for me.<br>Gen 29:33 Then she became with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Because it has come to the Lord's ears that I am not loved, he has given me this son in addition: and she gave him the name Simeon.<br>Gen 29:34 And she was with child again, and gave birth to a son; and said, Now at last my husband will be united to me, because I have given him three sons: so he was named Levi.<br>Gen 29:35 And she was with child again, and gave birth to a son: and she said, This time I will give praise to the Lord: so he was named Judah; after this she had no more children for a time.<br>Gen 30:1 Now Rachel, because she had no children, was full of envy of her sister; and she said to Jacob, If you do not give me children I will not go on living.<br>Gen 30:2 But Jacob was angry with Rachel, and said, Am I in the place of God, who has kept your body from having fruit?<br>Gen 30:3 Then she said, Here is my servant Bilhah, go in to her, so that she may have a child on my knees, and I may have a family by her.<br>Gen 30:4 So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.<br>Gen 30:5 And Bilhah became with child, and gave birth to a son.<br>Gen 30:6 Then Rachel said, God has been my judge, and has given ear to my voice, and has given me a son; so he was named Dan.<br>Gen 30:7 And again Bilhah, Rachel's servant, was with child, and gave birth to a second son.<br>Gen 30:8 And Rachel said, I have had a great fight with my sister, and I have overcome her: and she gave the child the name Naphtali.<br>Gen 30:9 When it was clear to Leah that she would have no more children for a time, she gave Zilpah, her servant, to Jacob as a wife.<br>Gen 30:10 And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a son.<br>Gen 30:11 And Leah said, It has gone well for me: and she gave him the name Gad.<br>Gen 30:12 And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a second son.<br>Gen 30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I! and all women will give witness to my joy: and she gave him the name Asher.<br>Gen 30:14 Now at the time of the grain-cutting, Reuben saw some love-fruits in the field, and took them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to her, Let me have some of your son's love-fruits.<br>Gen 30:15 But Leah said to her, Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me? and now would you take my son's love-fruits? Then Rachel said, You may have him tonight in exchange for your son's love-fruits.<br>Gen 30:16 In the evening, when Jacob came in from the field, Leah went out to him and said, Tonight you are to come to me, for I have given my son's love-fruits as a price for you. And he went in to her that night.<br>Gen 30:17 And God gave ear to her and she became with child, and gave Jacob a fifth son.<br>Gen 30:18 Then Leah said, God has made payment to me for giving my servant-girl to my husband: so she gave her son the name Issachar.<br>Gen 30:19 And again Leah became with child, and she gave Jacob a sixth son.<br>Gen 30:20 And she said, God has given me a good bride-price; now at last will I have my husband living with me, for I have given him six sons: and she gave him the name Zebulun.<br>Gen 30:21 After that she had a daughter, to whom she gave the name Dinah.<br>Gen 30:22 Then God gave thought to Rachel, and hearing her prayer he made her fertile.<br>Gen 30:23 And she was with child, and gave birth to a son: and she said, God has taken away my shame.<br>Gen 30:24 And she gave him the name Joseph, saying, May the Lord give me another son.<br>Gen 30:25 Now after the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Let me go away to my place and my country.<br>Gen 30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have been your servant, and let me go: for you have knowledge of all the work I have done for you.<br>Gen 30:27 And Laban said, If you will let me say so, do not go away; for I have seen by the signs that the Lord has been good to me because of you.<br>Gen 30:28 Say then what your payment is to be and I will give it.<br>Gen 30:29 Then Jacob said, You have seen what I have done for you, and how your cattle have done well under my care.<br>Gen 30:30 For before I came you had little, and it has been greatly increased; and the Lord has given you a blessing in everything I have done; but when am I to do something for my family?<br>Gen 30:31 And Laban said, What am I to give you? And Jacob said, Do not give me anything; but I will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me:<br>Gen 30:32 Let me go through all your flock today, taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black, and all the marked or coloured goats: these will be my payment.<br>Gen 30:33 And so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come; if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured, or any sheep which is not black, you may take me for a thief.<br>Gen 30:34 And Laban said, Let it be as you say.<br>Gen 30:35 So that day he took all the he-goats which were banded or coloured, and all the she-goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks, and all the black sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons;<br>Gen 30:36 And sent them three days' journey away: and Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flock.<br>Gen 30:37 Then Jacob took young branches of trees, cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands.<br>Gen 30:38 And he put the banded sticks in the drinking-places where the flock came to get water; and they became with young when they came to the water.<br>Gen 30:39 And because of this, the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour.<br>Gen 30:40 These lambs Jacob kept separate; and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with Laban's flock.<br>Gen 30:41 And whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young, Jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinking-places, so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks.<br>Gen 30:42 But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put the sticks before them; so that the feebler flocks were Laban's and the stronger were Jacob's.<br>Gen 30:43 So Jacob's wealth was greatly increased; he had great flocks and women-servants and men-servants and camels and asses.<br>Gen 31:1 Now it came to the ears of Jacob that Laban's sons were saying, Jacob has taken away all our father's property, and in this way he has got all this wealth.<br>Gen 31:2 And Jacob saw that Laban's feeling for him was no longer what it had been before.<br>Gen 31:3 Then the Lord said to Jacob, Go back to the land of your fathers, and to your relations, and I will be with you.<br>Gen 31:4 And Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come to him in the field among his flock.<br>Gen 31:5 And he said to them, It is clear to me that your father's feeling is no longer what it was to me; but the God of my father has been with me<br>Gen 31:6 And you have seen how I have done all in my power for your father,<br>Gen 31:7 But your father has not kept faith with me, and ten times he has made changes in my payment; but God has kept him from doing me damage.<br>Gen 31:8 If he said, All those in the flock which have marks are to be yours, then all the flock gave birth to marked young; and if he said, All the banded ones are to be yours, then all the flock had banded young.<br>Gen 31:9 So God has taken away your father's cattle and has given them to me.<br>Gen 31:10 And at the time when the flock were with young, I saw in a dream that all the he-goats which were joined with the she-goats were banded and marked and coloured.<br>Gen 31:11 And in my dream the angel of the Lord said to me, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.<br>Gen 31:12 And he said, See how all the he-goats are banded and marked and coloured: for I have seen what Laban has done to you.<br>Gen 31:13 I am the God of Beth-el, where you put oil on the pillar and took an oath to me: now then, come out of this land and go back to the country of your birth.<br>Gen 31:14 Then Rachel and Leah said to him in answer, What part or heritage is there for us in our father's house?<br>Gen 31:15 Are we not as people from a strange country to him? for he took a price for us and now it is all used up.<br>Gen 31:16 For the wealth which God has taken from him is ours and our children's; so now, whatever God has said to you, do.<br>Gen 31:17 Then Jacob put his wives and his sons on camels;<br>Gen 31:18 And sending on before him all his cattle and his property which he had got together in Paddan-aram, he made ready to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.<br>Gen 31:19 Now Laban had gone to see to the cutting of the wool of his sheep; so Rachel secretly took the images of the gods of her father's house.<br>Gen 31:20 And Jacob went away secretly, without giving news of his flight to Laban the Aramaean.<br>Gen 31:21 So he went away with all he had, and went across the River in the direction of the hill-country of Gilead.<br>Gen 31:22 And on the third day Laban had news of Jacob's flight.<br>Gen 31:23 And taking the men of his family with him, he went after him for seven days and overtook him in the hill-country of Gilead.<br>Gen 31:24 Then God came to Laban in a dream by night, and said to him, Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob.<br>Gen 31:25 Now when Laban overtook him, Jacob had put up his tent in the hill-country; and Laban and his brothers put up their tents in the hill-country of Gilead.<br>Gen 31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, Why did you go away secretly, taking my daughters away like prisoners of war?<br>Gen 31:27 Why did you make a secret of your flight, not giving me word of it, so that I might have sent you away with joy and songs, with melody and music?<br>Gen 31:28 You did not even let me give a kiss to my sons and my daughters. This was a foolish thing to do.<br>Gen 31:29 It is in my power to do you damage: but the God of your father came to me this night, saying, Take care that you say nothing good or bad to Jacob.<br>Gen 31:30 And now, it seems, you are going because your heart's desire is for your father's house; but why have you taken my gods?<br>Gen 31:31 And Jacob, in answer, said to Laban, My fear was that you might take your daughters from me by force.<br>Gen 31:32 As for your gods, if anyone of us has them, let him be put to death: make search before us all for what is yours, and take it. For Jacob had no knowledge that Rachel had taken them.<br>Gen 31:33 So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent, and into the tents of the two servant-women, but they were not there; and he came out of Leah's tent and went into Rachel's.<br>Gen 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and had put them in the camels' basket, and was seated on them. And Laban, searching through all the tent, did not come across them.<br>Gen 31:35 And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry because I do not get up before you, for I am in the common condition of women. And with all his searching, he did not come across the images.<br>Gen 31:36 Then Jacob was angry with Laban, and said, What crime or sin have I done that you have come after me with such passion?<br>Gen 31:37 Now that you have made search through all my goods, what have you seen which is yours? Make it clear now before my people and your people, so that they may be judges between us.<br>Gen 31:38 These twenty years I have been with you; your sheep and your goats have had young without loss, not one of your he-goats have I taken for food.<br>Gen 31:39 Anything which was wounded by beasts I did not take to you, but myself made up for the loss of it; you made me responsible for whatever was taken by thieves, by day or by night.<br>Gen 31:40 This was my condition, wasted by heat in the day and by the bitter cold at night; and sleep went from my eyes.<br>Gen 31:41 These twenty years I have been in your house; I was your servant for fourteen years because of your daughters, and for six years I kept your flock, and ten times was my payment changed.<br>Gen 31:42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would have sent me away with nothing in my hands. But God has seen my troubles and the work of my hands, and this night he kept you back.<br>Gen 31:43 Then Laban, answering, said, These women are my daughters and these children my children, the flocks and all you see are mine: what now may I do for my daughters and for their children?<br>Gen 31:44 Come, let us make an agreement, you and I; and let it be for a witness between us.<br>Gen 31:45 Then Jacob took a stone and put it up as a pillar.<br>Gen 31:46 And Jacob said to his people, Get stones together; and they did so; and they had a meal there by the stones.<br>Gen 31:47 And the name Laban gave it was Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob gave it the name of Galeed.<br>Gen 31:48 And Laban said, These stones are a witness between you and me today. For this reason its name was Galeed,<br>Gen 31:49 And Mizpah, for he said, May the Lord keep watch on us when we are unable to see one another's doings.<br>Gen 31:50 If you are cruel to my daughters, or if you take other wives in addition to my daughters, then though no man is there to see, God will be the witness between us.<br>Gen 31:51 And Laban said, See these stones and this pillar which I have put between you and me;<br>Gen 31:52 They will be witness that I will not go over these stones to you, and you will not go over these stones or this pillar to me, for any evil purpose.<br>Gen 31:53 May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, be our judge. Then Jacob took an oath by the Fear of his father Isaac.<br>Gen 31:54 And Jacob made an offering on the mountain, and gave orders to his people to take food: so they had a meal and took their rest that night on the mountain.<br>Gen 31:55 And early in the morning Laban, after kissing and blessing his daughters, went on his way back to his country.<br>Gen 32:1 And on his way Jacob came face to face with the angels of God.<br>Gen 32:2 And when he saw them he said, This is the army of God: so he gave that place the name of Mahanaim.<br>Gen 32:3 Now Jacob sent servants before him to Esau, his brother, in the land of Seir, the country of Edom;<br>Gen 32:4 And he gave them orders to say these words to Esau: Your servant Jacob says, Till now I have been living with Laban:<br>Gen 32:5 And I have oxen and asses and flocks and men-servants and women-servants: and I have sent to give my lord news of these things so that I may have grace in his eyes.<br>Gen 32:6 When the servants came back they said, We have seen your brother Esau and he is coming out to you, and four hundred men with him.<br>Gen 32:7 Then Jacob was in great fear and trouble of mind: and he put all the people and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups;<br>Gen 32:8 And said, If Esau, meeting one group, makes an attack on them, the others will get away safely.<br>Gen 32:9 Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, the God of my father Isaac, the Lord who said to me, Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you:<br>Gen 32:10 I am less than nothing in comparison with all your mercies and your faith to me your servant; for with only my stick in my hand I went across Jordan, and now I have become two armies.<br>Gen 32:11 Be my saviour from the hand of Esau, my brother: for my fear is that he will make an attack on me, putting to death mother and child.<br>Gen 32:12 And you said, Truly, I will be good to you, and make your seed like the sand of the sea which may not be numbered.<br>Gen 32:13 Then he put up his tent there for the night; and from among his goods he took, as an offering for his brother Esau,<br>Gen 32:14 Two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred females and twenty males from the sheep,<br>Gen 32:15 Thirty camels with their young ones, forty cows, ten oxen, twenty asses, and ten young asses.<br>Gen 32:16 These he gave to his servants, every herd by itself, and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and let there be a space between one herd and another.<br>Gen 32:17 And he gave orders to the first, saying, When my brother Esau comes to you and says, Whose servant are you, and where are you going, and whose are these herds?<br>Gen 32:18 Then say to him, These are your servant Jacob's; they are an offering for my lord, for Esau; and he himself is coming after us.<br>Gen 32:19 And he gave the same orders to the second and the third and to all those who were with the herds, saying, This is what you are to say to Esau when you see him;<br>Gen 32:20 And you are to say further, Jacob, your servant, is coming after us. For he said to himself, I will take away his wrath by the offering which I have sent on, and then I will come before him: it may be that I will have grace in his eyes.<br>Gen 32:21 So the servants with the offerings went on in front, and he himself took his rest that night in the tents with his people.<br>Gen 32:22 And in the night he got up, and taking with him his two wives and the two servant-women and his eleven children, he went over the river Jabbok.<br>Gen 32:23 He took them and sent them over the stream with all he had.<br>Gen 32:24 Then Jacob was by himself; and a man was fighting with him till dawn.<br>Gen 32:25 But when the man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob, he gave him a blow in the hollow part of his leg, so that his leg was damaged.<br>Gen 32:26 And he said to him, Let me go now, for the dawn is near. But Jacob said, I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing.<br>Gen 32:27 Then he said, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.<br>Gen 32:28 And he said, Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel: for in your fight with God and with men you have overcome.<br>Gen 32:29 Then Jacob said, What is your name? And he said, What is my name to you? Then he gave him a blessing.<br>Gen 32:30 And Jacob gave that place the name of Peniel, saying, I have seen God face to face, and still I am living.<br>Gen 32:31 And while he was going past Peniel, the sun came up. And he went with unequal steps because of his damaged leg.<br>Gen 32:32 For this reason the children of Israel, even today, never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food, because the hollow of Jacob's leg was touched.<br>Gen 33:1 Then Jacob, lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming with his four hundred men. So he made a division of the children between Leah and Rachel and the two women-servants.<br>Gen 33:2 He put the servants and their children in front, Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph at the back.<br>Gen 33:3 And he himself, going before them, went down on his face to the earth seven times till he came near his brother.<br>Gen 33:4 Then Esau came running up to him, and folding him in his arms, gave him a kiss: and the two of them were overcome with weeping.<br>Gen 33:5 Then Esau, lifting up his eyes, saw the women and the children, and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God in his mercy has given to your servant.<br>Gen 33:6 Then the servants and their children came near, and went down on their faces.<br>Gen 33:7 And Leah came near with her children, and then Joseph and Rachel, and they did the same.<br>Gen 33:8 And he said, What were all those herds which I saw on the way? And Jacob said, They were an offering so that I might have grace in my lord's eyes.<br>Gen 33:9 But Esau said, I have enough; keep what is yours, my brother, for yourself.<br>Gen 33:10 And Jacob said, Not so; but if I have grace in your eyes, take them as a sign of my love, for I have seen your face as one may see the face of God, and you have been pleased with me.<br>Gen 33:11 Take my offering then, with my blessing; for God has been very good to me and I have enough: so at his strong request, he took it.<br>Gen 33:12 And he said, Let us go on our journey together, and I will go in front.<br>Gen 33:13 But Jacob said, My lord may see that the children are only small, and there are young ones in my flocks and herds: one day's over-driving will be the destruction of all the flock.<br>Gen 33:14 Do you, my lord, go on before your servant; I will come on slowly, at the rate at which the cattle and the children are able to go, till I come to my lord at Seir.<br>Gen 33:15 And Esau said, Then keep some of my men with you. And he said, What need is there for that, if my lord is pleased with me?<br>Gen 33:16 So Esau, turning back that day, went on his way to Seir.<br>Gen 33:17 And Jacob went on to Succoth, where he made a house for himself and put up tents for his cattle: for this reason the place was named Succoth.<br>Gen 33:18 So Jacob came safely from Paddan-aram to the town of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and put up his tents near the town.<br>Gen 33:19 And for a hundred bits of money he got from the children of Hamor, the builder of Shechem, the field in which he had put up his tents.<br>Gen 33:20 And there he put up an altar, naming it El, the God of Israel.<br>Gen 34:1 Now Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had by Jacob, went out to see the women of that country.<br>Gen 34:2 And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite who was the chief of that land, saw her, he took her by force and had connection with her.<br>Gen 34:3 Then his heart went out in love to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he said comforting words to her.<br>Gen 34:4 And Shechem said to Hamor, his father, Get me this girl for my wife.<br>Gen 34:5 Now Jacob had word of what Shechem had done to his daughter; but his sons were in the fields with the cattle, and Jacob said nothing till they came.<br>Gen 34:6 Then Hamor, the father of Shechem, came out to have a talk with Jacob.<br>Gen 34:7 Now the sons of Jacob came in from the fields when they had news of it, and they were wounded and very angry because of the shame he had done in Israel by having connection with Jacob's daughter; and they said, Such a thing is not to be done.<br>Gen 34:8 But Hamor said to them, Shechem, my son, is full of desire for your daughter: will you then give her to him for a wife?<br>Gen 34:9 And let our two peoples be joined together; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves.<br>Gen 34:10 Go on living with us, and the country will be open to you; do trade and get property there.<br>Gen 34:11 And Shechem said to her father and her brothers, If you will give ear to my request, whatever you say I will give to you.<br>Gen 34:12 However great you make the bride-price and payment, I will give it; only let me have the girl for my wife.<br>Gen 34:13 But the sons of Jacob gave a false answer to Shechem and Hamor his father, because of what had been done to Dinah their sister.<br>Gen 34:14 And they said, It is not possible for us to give our sister to one who is without circumcision, for that would be a cause of shame to us:<br>Gen 34:15 But on this condition only will we come to an agreement with you: if every male among you becomes like us and undergoes circumcision;<br>Gen 34:16 Then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to us and go on living with you as one people.<br>Gen 34:17 But if you will not undergo circumcision as we say, then we will take our daughter and go.<br>Gen 34:18 And their words were pleasing to Hamor and his son Shechem.<br>Gen 34:19 And without loss of time the young man did as they said, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter, and he was the noblest of his father's house.<br>Gen 34:20 Then Hamor and Shechem, his son, went to the meeting-place of their town, and said to the men of the town,<br>Gen 34:21 It is the desire of these men to be at peace with us; let them then go on living in this country and doing trade here, for the country is wide open before them; let us take their daughters as wives and let us give them our daughters.<br>Gen 34:22 But these men will make an agreement with us to go on living with us and to become one people, only on the condition that every male among us undergoes circumcision as they have done.<br>Gen 34:23 Then will not their cattle and their goods and all their beasts be ours? so let us come to an agreement with them so that they may go on living with us.<br>Gen 34:24 Then all the men of the town gave ear to the words of Hamor and Shechem his son; and every male in the town underwent circumcision.<br>Gen 34:25 But on the third day after, before the wounds were well, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and came into the town by surprise and put all the males to death.<br>Gen 34:26 And Hamor and his son they put to death with the sword, and they took Dinah from Shechem's house and went away.<br>Gen 34:27 And the sons of Jacob came on them when they were wounded and made waste the town because of what had been done to their sister;<br>Gen 34:28 They took their flocks and their herds and their asses and everything in their town and in their fields,<br>Gen 34:29 And all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives; everything in their houses they took and made them waste.<br>Gen 34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have made trouble for me and given me a bad name among the people of this country, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and because we are small in number they will come together against me and make war on me; and it will be the end of me and all my people.<br>Gen 34:31 But they said, Were we to let him make use of our sister as a loose woman?<br>Gen 35:1 And God said to Jacob, Go up now to Beth-el and make your living-place there: and put up an altar there to the God who came to you when you were in flight from your brother Esau.<br>Gen 35:2 Then Jacob said to all his people, Put away the strange gods which are among you, and make yourselves clean, and put on a change of clothing:<br>Gen 35:3 And let us go up to Beth-el: and there I will make an altar to God, who gave me an answer in the day of my trouble, and was with me wherever I went.<br>Gen 35:4 Then they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which they had, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob put them away under the holy tree at Shechem.<br>Gen 35:5 So they went on their journey: and the fear of God was on the towns round about, so that they made no attack on the sons of Jacob.<br>Gen 35:6 And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan (which is the same as Beth-el), he and all his people.<br>Gen 35:7 And there he made an altar, naming the place El-beth-el: because it was there he had the vision of God when he was in flight from his brother.<br>Gen 35:8 And Deborah, the servant who had taken care of Rebekah from her birth, came to her end, and was put to rest near Beth-el, under the holy tree: and they gave it the name of Allon-bacuth.<br>Gen 35:9 Now when Jacob was on his way from Paddan-aram, God came to him again and, blessing him, said,<br>Gen 35:10 Jacob is your name, but it will be so no longer; from now your name will be Israel; so he was named Israel.<br>Gen 35:11 And God said to him, I am God, the Ruler of all: be fertile, and have increase; a nation, truly a group of nations, will come from you, and kings will be your offspring;<br>Gen 35:12 And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you; and to your seed after you I will give the land.<br>Gen 35:13 Then God went up from him in the place where he had been talking with him.<br>Gen 35:14 And Jacob put up a pillar in the place where he had been talking with God, and put a drink offering on it, and oil.<br>Gen 35:15 And he gave to the place where God had been talking with him, the name of Beth-el.<br>Gen 35:16 So they went on from Beth-el; and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, the pains of birth came on Rachel and she had a hard time.<br>Gen 35:17 And when her pain was very great, the woman who was helping her said, Have no fear; for now you will have another son.<br>Gen 35:18 And in the hour when her life went from her (for death came to her), she gave the child the name Ben-oni: but his father gave him the name of Benjamin.<br>Gen 35:19 So Rachel came to her end and was put to rest on the road to Ephrath (which is Beth-lehem).<br>Gen 35:20 And Jacob put up a pillar on her resting-place; which is named, The Pillar of the resting-place of Rachel, to this day.<br>Gen 35:21 And Israel went journeying on and put up his tents on the other side of the tower of the flock.<br>Gen 35:22 Now while they were living in that country, Reuben had connection with Bilhah, his father's servant-woman: and Israel had news of it.<br>Gen 35:23 Now Jacob had twelve sons: the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first son, and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun;<br>Gen 35:24 The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;<br>Gen 35:25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali;<br>Gen 35:26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher;

And because of his dream and his words, their hate for him became greater than ever.<br>Gen 37:9 Then he had another dream, and gave his brothers an account of it, saying, I have had another dream: the sun and the moon and eleven stars gave honour to me.<br>Gen 37:10 And he gave word of it to his father and his brothers; but his father protesting said, What sort of a dream is this? am I and your mother and your brothers to go down on our faces to the earth before you?<br>Gen 37:11 And his brothers were full of envy; but his father kept his words in mind.<br>Gen 37:12 Now his brothers went to keep watch over their father's flock in Shechem.<br>Gen 37:13 And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers with the flock in Shechem? come, I will send you to them. And he said to him, Here am I.<br>Gen 37:14 And he said to him, Go now, and see if your brothers are well and how the flock is; then come back and give me word. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.<br>Gen 37:15 And a man saw him wandering in the country, and said to him, What are you looking for?<br>Gen 37:16 And he said, I am looking for my brothers; please give me word of where they are keeping their flock.<br>Gen 37:17 And the man said, They have gone away from here, for they said in my hearing, Let us go to Dothan. So Joseph went after them and came up with them at Dothan.<br>Gen 37:18 But they saw him when he was a long way off, and before he came near them they made a secret design against him to put him to death;<br>Gen 37:19 Saying to one another, See, here comes this dreamer.<br>Gen 37:20 Let us now put him to death and put his body into one of these holes, and we will say, An evil beast has put him to death: then we will see what becomes of his dreams.<br>Gen 37:21 But Reuben, hearing these words, got him out of their hands, saying, Let us not take his life.<br>Gen 37:22 Do not put him to a violent death, but let him be placed in one of the holes; this he said to keep him safe from their hands, with the purpose of taking him back to his father again.<br>Gen 37:23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they took off his long coat which he had on;<br>Gen 37:24 And they took him and put him in the hole: now the hole had no water in it.<br>Gen 37:25 Then seating themselves, they took their meal: and looking up, they saw a travelling band of Ishmaelites, coming from Gilead on their way to Egypt, with spices and perfumes on their camels.<br>Gen 37:26 And Judah said to his brothers, What profit is there in putting our brother to death and covering up his blood?<br>Gen 37:27 Let us give him to these Ishmaelites for a price, and let us not put violent hands on him, for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brothers gave ear to him.<br>Gen 37:28 And some traders from Midian went by; so pulling Joseph up out of the hole, they gave him to the Ishmaelites for twenty bits of silver, and they took him to Egypt.<br>Gen 37:29 Now when Reuben came back to the hole, Joseph was not there; and giving signs of grief,<br>Gen 37:30 He went back to his brothers, and said, The child is gone; what am I to do?<br>Gen 37:31 Then they took Joseph's coat, and put on it some of the blood from a young goat which they had put to death,<br>Gen 37:32 And they took the coat to their father, and said, We came across this; is it your son's coat or not?<br>Gen 37:33 And he saw that it was, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has put him to death; without doubt Joseph has come to a cruel end.<br>Gen 37:34 Then Jacob, giving signs of grief, put on haircloth, and went on weeping for his son day after day.<br>Gen 37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters came to give him comfort, but he would not be comforted, saying with weeping, I will go down to the underworld to my son. So great was his father's sorrow for him.<br>Gen 37:36 And in Egypt the men of Midian gave him for a price to Potiphar, a captain of high position in Pharaoh's house.<br>Gen 38:1 Now at that time, Judah went away from his brothers and became the friend of a man of Adullam named Hirah.<br>Gen 38:2 And there he saw the daughter of a certain man of Canaan named Shua, and took her as his wife.<br>Gen 38:3 And she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Er.<br>Gen 38:4 And again she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the name Onan.<br>Gen 38:5 Then she had another son, to whom she gave the name Shelah; she was at Chezib when the birth took place.<br>Gen 38:6 And Judah took a wife for his first son Er, and her name was Tamar.<br>Gen 38:7 Now Er, Judah's first son, did evil in the eyes of the Lord, so that he put him to death.<br>Gen 38:8 Then Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife and do what it is right for a husband's brother to do; make her your wife and get offspring for your brother.<br>Gen 38:9 But Onan, seeing that the offspring would not be his, went in to his brother's wife, but let his seed go on to the earth, so that he might not get offspring for his brother.<br>Gen 38:10 And what he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord, so that he put him to death, like his brother.<br>Gen 38:11 Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, Go back to your father's house and keep yourself as a widow till my son Shelah becomes a man: for he had in his mind the thought that death might come to him as it had come to his brothers. So Tamar went back to her father's house.<br>Gen 38:12 And after a time, Bath-shua, Judah's wife, came to her end; and after Judah was comforted for her loss, he went to Timnah, where they were cutting the wool of his sheep, and his friend Hirah of Adullam went with him.<br>Gen 38:13 And when Tamar had news that her father-in-law was going up to Timnah to the wool-cutting,<br>Gen 38:14 She took off her widow's clothing, and covering herself with her veil, she took her seat near Enaim on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was now a man, but she had not been made his wife.<br>Gen 38:15 When Judah saw her he took her to be a loose woman of the town, because her face was covered.<br>Gen 38:16 And turning to her by the roadside, he said to her, Let me come in to you; for he had no idea that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me as my price?<br>Gen 38:17 And he said, I will give you a young goat from the flock. And she said, What will you give me as a sign till you send it?<br>Gen 38:18 And he said, What would you have? And she said, Your ring and its cord and the stick in your hand. So he gave them to her and went in to her, and she became with child by him.<br>Gen 38:19 Then she got up and went away and took off her veil and put on her widow's clothing.<br>Gen 38:20 Then Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat, to get back the things which he had given as a sign to the woman: but she was not there.<br>Gen 38:21 And he put questions to the men of the place, saying, Where is the loose woman who was in Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There was no such woman there.<br>Gen 38:22 So he went back to Judah, and said, I have not seen her, and the men of the place say that there is no such woman there.<br>Gen 38:23 And Judah said, Let her keep the things, so that we may not be shamed; I sent the young goat, but you did not see the woman.<br>Gen 38:24 Now about three months after this, word came to Judah that Tamar, his daughter-in-law, had been acting like a loose woman and was with child. And Judah said, Take her out and let her be burned.<br>Gen 38:25 And while she was being taken out, she sent word to her father-in-law, saying, The man whose property these things are, is the father of my child: say then, whose are this ring and this cord and this stick?<br>Gen 38:26 Then Judah said openly that they were his, and said, She is more upright than I am, for I did not give her to Shelah my son. And he had no more connection with her.<br>Gen 38:27 And when the time came for her to give birth, it was clear that there were two children in her body.<br>Gen 38:28 And while she was in the act of giving birth, one of them put out his hand; and the woman who was with her put a red thread round his hand, saying, This one came out first.<br>Gen 38:29 But then he took his hand back again, and his brother came first to birth: and the woman said, What an opening you have made for yourself! So he was named Perez.<br>Gen 38:30 And then his brother came out, with the red thread round his hand, and he was named Zerah.<br>Gen 39:1 Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar the Egyptian, a captain of high position in Pharaoh's house, got him for a price from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.<br>Gen 39:2 And the Lord was with Joseph, and he did well; and he was living in the house of his master the Egyptian.<br>Gen 39:3 And his master saw that the Lord was with him, making everything he did go well.<br>Gen 39:4 And having a high opinion of Joseph as his servant, he made him the overseer of his house and gave him control over all he had.<br>Gen 39:5 And from the time when he made him overseer and gave him control of all his property, the blessing of the Lord was with the Egyptian, because of Joseph; the blessing of the Lord was on all he had, in the house and in the field.<br>Gen 39:6 And he gave Joseph control of all his property, keeping no account of anything, but only the food which was put before him. Now Joseph was very beautiful in form and face.<br>Gen 39:7 And after a time, his master's wife, looking on Joseph with desire, said to him, Be my lover.<br>Gen 39:8 But he would not, and said to her, You see that my master keeps no account of what I do in his house, and has put all his property in my control;<br>Gen 39:9 So that no one has more authority in this house than I have; he has kept nothing back from me but you, because you are his wife; how then may I do this great wrong, sinning against God?<br>Gen 39:10 And day after day she went on requesting Joseph to come to her and be her lover, but he would not give ear to her.<br>Gen 39:11 Now one day he went into the house to do his work; and not one of the men of the house was inside.<br>Gen 39:12 And pulling at his coat, she said, Come to my bed; but slipping out of his coat, he went running away.<br>Gen 39:13 And when she saw that he had got away, letting her keep his coat,<br>Gen 39:14 She sent for the men of her house and said to them, See, he has let a Hebrew come here and make sport of us; he came to my bed, and I gave a loud cry;<br>Gen 39:15 And hearing it he went running out without his coat.<br>Gen 39:16 And she kept his coat by her, till his master came back.<br>Gen 39:17 Then she gave him the same story, saying, The Hebrew servant whom you have taken into our house came in to make sport of me;<br>Gen 39:18 And when I gave a loud cry he went running out without his coat.<br>Gen 39:19 And hearing his wife's account of what his servant had done, he became very angry.<br>Gen 39:20 And Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, in the place where the king's prisoners were kept in chains, and he was there in the prison-house.<br>Gen 39:21 But the Lord was with Joseph, and was good to him, and made the keeper of the prison his friend.<br>Gen 39:22 And the keeper of the prison put all the prisoners under Joseph's control, and he was responsible for whatever was done there.<br>Gen 39:23 And the keeper of the prison gave no attention to anything which was under his care, because the Lord was with him; and the Lord made everything he did go well.<br>Gen 40:1 Now after these things the chief servant who had the care of the wine, and the chief bread-maker in Pharaoh's house, did something against Pharaoh's orders;<br>Gen 40:2 And Pharaoh was angry with his two servants, with the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker;<br>Gen 40:3 And he put them in prison under the care of the captain of the army, in the same prison where Joseph himself was shut up.<br>Gen 40:4 And the captain put them in Joseph's care, and he did what was needed for them; and they were kept in prison for some time.<br>Gen 40:5 And these two had a dream on the same night; the chief wine-servant and the chief bread-maker of the king of Egypt, who were in prison, the two of them had dreams with a special sense.<br>Gen 40:6 And in the morning when Joseph came to them he saw that they were looking sad.<br>Gen 40:7 And he said to the servants of Pharaoh who were in prison with him, Why are you looking so sad?<br>Gen 40:8 Then they said to him, We have had a dream, and no one is able to give us the sense.

            <div class='col-md body'>That in the christian literature speaks of Faith. Basically it means God created everything by the words of His mouth. Something like when Jesus was healing people in His time, He will say "be healed" and the person will recover. It speaks of the super-nature quality ( I cant think of another way to put it) of God....one of His attributes.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FireIce:</div><div class="quote_body">wat was tt thing tt starts with<br>"Let there be light, and there was light...."???<br><br>it wasn't true until dear Edison invented something call..............light bulb?<br><br>&gt;ponders&lt;<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thot I can keep quiet, but....<br><br>this is my personal view, nothing against or for...<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>My comments on life being living on this one tiny planet called "Mother Earth"<br><br>From the moment we are born, we are actually walking towards death. I have to admit I am afraid of death, afraid to think that one day I will become some ashes, lying in some coffin that my sons put me into... I do not like the feeling of knowing one day I WILL pass away from this land, and I believe there are others who share the same feelings as me, but that doesn't stop the clock from ticking...even now<br><br>And because of this very reason, religion came into life from the times of ancient Chinese, Viking, Greek, Egypt, and Romans.... to our times. Religion teaches us how to live respectable and being good, and of course from there came the price of getting to heaven, nirvana, another world, whatever...The assurance of life does not end, but a continue journey.<br><br>Let jus face it, nobody really knows the answer, you have to be there to confirm. The bible, Koran, Tao, scriptures, scrolls, text... whatever can say many things, but who is alive and can provide the evidence that heaven, hell, another place is there. The text is written by human, who is the same as you and me. Who is alive again to prove that the person who wrote it get the idea from some super being, god.<br><br>True, I am skeptical, but at least I got brains to believe what I believe, not jus some text who is written few thousand years which nobody can verify now. For e.g. Buddha get nirvana, who really knows...he said only you yourself can know. Jesus say those who believe in him will get eternal life...who really knows, those who knows perhaps will never get the chance to return to tell you.<br><br>The point is nobody can provide the truth. Faith is the only thing that religion is all about. If you believe, there will be heaven. If you don't, there will be not.<br><br>Another thing, even if you go to heaven, even if you go get nirvana, so do you do then? Sleep, mediate, and play for eternity... what do you think Buddha is doing now? what do you think god is doing now? nobody knows... don't give me the crap the bible says, the Buddha says, I SAY "THE ROCK SAYS..."<br><br>So don't worry, Joanne, live normally and spent more time with your love ones, enjoy your stay at "Planet Earth" when the trees is still there, when the birds is still there, you won't know what will happen next. maybe I will be knock down by a car later, who knows... what must come will come... be it now, be it later. If god punished me for not believing in him, then so be it, if Buddha says I will be in hell forever, so be it...<br><br>If really there is war, it is not prophecy, but human are the one who destroy it, it is not god will. we are given free will. If really there is a change in climate, ozone layer, green house effect, it is human, not god, not Buddha. don't blame on others for what we have done.<br><br>to end...<br><br>I don't believe in fate<br>I don't believe in god<br>I don't believe everything is fixed<br><br>I know of my past<br>I know of my present<br>But I will not know of my future<br><br>If there is no earth<br>If there is no me<br>then where will I be<br><br>Live your life happily<br>Live with the nature<br>Live with your love ones<br><br>Don't worry about tomorrow cause tomorrow might never come<br>Rather use your time, will, to do something meaningful<br>Spend times with your love ones, who know what tomorrow might brings</div>

But if you want to be religious fanatic ops..i mean holy person, then go do just your part, Do what you can to get to heaven now. it's only 26 years from now before jesus arrive. Quick mai tu liao, cultivate yourself, study more bible, boost the sale of bible as well. Good for the economic also  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. Make yourself closer to god by praying and attending more church instead wasting time here, wasting time going to school. Hey, they don teach bible in school. Wat the fark! useless educational system, attend the church better, get your biblology cert now before it's too late. shoo shoo go...better study hard, must get first class honour in bible study else not effective one.<br><br>Hey joanne, since you still young, innocent  and having a long way to go, study your bible now and can forget about going to school, learn from the wise Rapture direct before 2028 else it will be too late. And Rapture since you are so wise why don force the government make bible study the only educational subject. Going to heaven, that's the ultimate aim of yours. How noble  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Don't post here anymore else Ah nic will be here to close down this thread again. And also, stop forcing the rest who think practically and logically to believe in your religions. We need more practical pple esp the scientist instead of more dreamer. We don want any more holy war happening here. Go study hard ok. thanks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
