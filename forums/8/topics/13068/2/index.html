And the woman said, I was tricked by the deceit of the snake and I took it.<br>Gen 3:14 And the Lord God said to the snake, Because you have done this you are cursed more than all cattle and every beast of the field; you will go flat on the earth, and dust will be your food all the days of your life:<br>Gen 3:15 And there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed: by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded.<br>Gen 3:16 To the woman he said, Great will be your pain in childbirth; in sorrow will your children come to birth; still your desire will be for your husband, but he will be your master.<br>Gen 3:17 And to Adam he said, Because you gave ear to the voice of your wife and took of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take, the earth is cursed on your account; in pain you will get your food from it all your life.<br>Gen 3:18 Thorns and waste plants will come up, and the plants of the field will be your food;<br>Gen 3:19 With the hard work of your hands you will get your bread till you go back to the earth from which you were taken: for dust you are and to the dust you will go back.<br>Gen 3:20 And the man gave his wife the name of Eve because she was the mother of all who have life.<br>Gen 3:21 And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins for their clothing.<br>Gen 3:22 And the Lord God said, Now the man has become like one of us, having knowledge of good and evil; and now if he puts out his hand and takes of the fruit of the tree of life, he will go on living for ever.<br>Gen 3:23 So the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to be a worker on the earth from which he was taken.<br>Gen 3:24 So he sent the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden he put winged ones and a flaming sword turning every way to keep the way to the tree of life.<br>Gen 4:1 And the man had connection with Eve his wife, and she became with child and gave birth to Cain, and said, I have got a man from the Lord.<br>Gen 4:2 Then again she became with child and gave birth to Abel, his brother.

And he said, I have no idea: am I my brother's keeper?<br>Gen 4:10 And he said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the earth.<br>Gen 4:11 And now you are cursed from the earth, whose mouth is open to take your brother's blood from your hand;<br>Gen 4:12 No longer will the earth give you her fruit as the reward of your work; you will be a wanderer in flight over the earth.<br>Gen 4:13 And Cain said, My punishment is greater than my strength.<br>Gen 4:14 You have sent me out this day from the face of the earth and from before your face; I will be a wanderer in flight over the earth, and whoever sees me will put me to death.<br>Gen 4:15 And the Lord said, Truly, if Cain is put to death, seven lives will be taken for his.

And they had bricks for stone, putting them together with sticky earth.<br>Gen 11:4 And they said, Come, let us make a town, and a tower whose top will go up as high as heaven; and let us make a great name for ourselves, so that we may not be wanderers over the face of the earth.<br>Gen 11:5 And the Lord came down to see the town and the tower which the children of men were building.<br>Gen 11:6 And the Lord said, See, they are all one people and have all one language; and this is only the start of what they may do: and now it will not be possible to keep them from any purpose of theirs.<br>Gen 11:7 Come, let us go down and take away the sense of their language, so that they will not be able to make themselves clear to one another.<br>Gen 11:8 So the Lord God sent them away into every part of the earth: and they gave up building their town.<br>Gen 11:9 So it was named Babel, because there the Lord took away the sense of all languages and from there the Lord sent them away over all the face of the earth.<br>Gen 11:10 These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad, two years after the great flow of waters;<br>Gen 11:11 And after the birth of Arpachshad, Shem went on living for five hundred years, and had sons and daughters:<br>Gen 11:12 And Arpachshad was thirty-five years old when he became the father of Shelah:<br>Gen 11:13 And after the birth of Shelah, Arpachshad went on living for four hundred and three years, and had sons and daughters:<br>Gen 11:14 And Shelah was thirty years old when he became the father of Eber:<br>Gen 11:15 And after the birth of Eber, Shelah went on living for four hundred and three years, and had sons and daughters:<br>Gen 11:16 And Eber was thirty-four years old when he became the father of Peleg:<br>Gen 11:17 And after the birth of Peleg, Eber went on living for four hundred and thirty years, and had sons and daughters:<br>Gen 11:18 And Peleg was thirty years old when he became the father of Reu:<br>Gen 11:19 And after the birth of Reu, Peleg went on living for two hundred and nine years, and had sons and daughters:<br>Gen 11:20 And Reu was thirty-two years old when he became the father of Serug:<br>Gen 11:21 And after the birth of Serug, Reu went on living for two hundred and seven years, and had sons and daughters:<br>Gen 11:22 And Serug was thirty years old when he became the father of Nahor:<br>Gen 11:23 And after the birth of Nahor, Serug went on living for two hundred years, and had sons and daughters:<br>Gen 11:24 And Nahor was twenty-nine years old when he became the father of Terah:<br>Gen 11:25 And after the birth of Terah, Nahor went on living for a hundred and nineteen years, and had sons and daughters:<br>Gen 11:26 And Terah was seventy years old when he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.<br>Gen 11:27 These are the generations of Terah: Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.<br>Gen 11:28 And death came to Haran when he was with his father Terah in the land of his birth, Ur of the Chaldees.<br>Gen 11:29 And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah.<br>Gen 11:30 And Sarai had no child.<br>Gen 11:31 And Terah took Abram, his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, and Sarai, his daughter-in-law, the wife of his son Abram and they went out from Ur of the Chaldees, to go to the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and were there for some time.<br>Gen 11:32 And all the years of Terah's life were two hundred and five: and Terah came to his end in Haran.<br>Gen 12:1 Now the Lord said to Abram, Go out from your country and from your family and from your father's house, into the land to which I will be your guide:<br>Gen 12:2 And I will make of you a great nation, blessing you and making your name great; and you will be a blessing:<br>Gen 12:3 To them who are good to you will I give blessing, and on him who does you wrong will I put my curse: and you will become a name of blessing to all the families of the earth.<br>Gen 12:4 So Abram went as the Lord had said to him, and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy-five years old when he went away from Haran.<br>Gen 12:5 And Abram took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and all their goods and the servants which they had got in Haran, and they went out to go to the land of Canaan.<br>Gen 12:6 And Abram went through the land till he came to Shechem, to the holy tree of Moreh. At that time, the Canaanites were still living in the land.<br>Gen 12:7 And the Lord came to Abram, and said, I will give all this land to your seed; then Abram made an altar there to the Lord who had let himself be seen by him.<br>Gen 12:8 And moving on from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el, he put up his tent, having Beth-el on the west and Ai on the east: and there he made an altar and gave worship to the name of the Lord.<br>Gen 12:9 And he went on, journeying still to the South.<br>Gen 12:10 And because there was little food to be had in that land, he went down into Egypt.<br>Gen 12:11 Now when he came near to Egypt, he said to Sarai, his wife, Truly, you are a fair woman and beautiful to the eye;<br>Gen 12:12 And I am certain that when the men of Egypt see you, they will say, This is his wife: and they will put me to death and keep you.<br>Gen 12:13 Say, then, that you are my sister, and so it will be well with me because of you, and my life will be kept safe on your account.<br>Gen 12:14 And so it was that when Abram came into Egypt, the men of Egypt, looking on the woman, saw that she was fair.<br>Gen 12:15 And Pharaoh's great men, having seen her, said words in praise of her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh's house.<br>Gen 12:16 And because of her, he was good to Abram, and he had sheep and oxen and asses, and men-servants and women-servants, and camels.<br>Gen 12:17 And the Lord sent great troubles on Pharaoh's house because of Sarai, Abram's wife.<br>Gen 12:18 Then Pharaoh sent for Abram, and said, What have you done to me? why did you not say that she was your wife?<br>Gen 12:19 Why did you say that she was your sister? so that I took her for my wife: now, take your wife and go on your way.<br>Gen 12:20 And Pharaoh gave orders to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and all he had.<br>Gen 13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt with his wife and all he had, and Lot with him, and they came in to the South.<br>Gen 13:2 Now Abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold.<br>Gen 13:3 And travelling on from the South, he came to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been before, between Beth-el and Ai;<br>Gen 13:4 To the place where he had made his first altar, and there Abram gave worship to the name of the Lord.<br>Gen 13:5 And Lot, who went with him, had flocks and herds and tents;<br>Gen 13:6 So that the land was not wide enough for the two of them: their property was so great that there was not room for them together.<br>Gen 13:7 And there was an argument between the keepers of Abram's cattle and the keepers of Lot's cattle: at that time the Canaanites and Perizzites were still living in the land.<br>Gen 13:8 Then Abram said to Lot, Let there be no argument between me and you, and between my herdmen and your herdmen, for we are brothers.<br>Gen 13:9 Is not all the land before you? then let us go our separate ways: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; or if you take the right, I will go to the left.<br>Gen 13:10 And Lot, lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of Jordan, saw that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord had sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah; it was like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, on the way to Zoar.<br>Gen 13:11 So Lot took for himself all the valley of Jordan, and went to the east, and they were parted from one another.<br>Gen 13:12 Abram went on living in the land of Canaan, and Lot went to the lowland towns, moving his tent as far as Sodom.<br>Gen 13:13 Now the men of Sodom were evil, and great sinners before the Lord.<br>Gen 13:14 And the Lord had said to Abram, after Lot was parted from him, From this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west:<br>Gen 13:15 For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed for ever.<br>Gen 13:16 And I will make your children like the dust of the earth, so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered, then will your children be numbered.<br>Gen 13:17 Come, go through all the land from one end to the other for I will give it to you.<br>Gen 13:18 And Abram, moving his tent, came and made his living-place by the holy tree of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and made an altar there to the Lord.<br>Gen 14:1 Now in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch, king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim,<br>Gen 14:2 They made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar).<br>Gen 14:3 All these came together in the valley of Siddim (which is the Salt Sea).<br>Gen 14:4 For twelve years they were under the rule of Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they put off his control.<br>Gen 14:5 And in the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings who were on his side, overcame the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,<br>Gen 14:6 And the Horites in their mountain Seir, driving them as far as El-paran, which is near the waste land.<br>Gen 14:7 Then they came back to En-mishpat (which is Kadesh), making waste all the country of the Amalekites and of the Amorites living in Hazazon-tamar.<br>Gen 14:8 And the king of Sodom with the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is Zoar), went out, and put their forces in position in the valley of Siddim,<br>Gen 14:9 Against Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal, king of Goiim, and Amraphel, king of Shinar, and Arioch, king of Ellasar: four kings against the five.<br>Gen 14:10 Now the valley of Siddim was full of holes of sticky earth; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah were put to flight and came to their end there, but the rest got away to the mountain.<br>Gen 14:11 And the four kings took all the goods and food from Sodom and Gomorrah and went on their way.<br>Gen 14:12 And in addition they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who was living in Sodom, and all his goods.<br>Gen 14:13 And one who had got away from the fight came and gave word of it to Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the holy tree of Mamre, the Amorite, the brother of Eshcol and Aner, who were friends of Abram.<br>Gen 14:14 And Abram, hearing that his brother's son had been made a prisoner, took a band of his trained men, three hundred and eighteen of them, sons of his house, and went after them as far as Dan.<br>Gen 14:15 And separating his forces by night, he overcame them, putting them to flight and going after them as far as Hobah, which is on the north side of Damascus.<br>Gen 14:16 And he got back all the goods, and Lot, his brother's son, with his goods and the women and the people.<br>Gen 14:17 And when he was coming back after putting to flight Chedorlaomer and the other kings, he had a meeting with the king of Sodom in the valley of Shaveh, that is, the King's Valley.<br>Gen 14:18 And Melchizedek, king of Salem, the priest of the Most High God, took bread and wine,<br>Gen 14:19 And blessing him, said, May the blessing of the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth, be on Abram:<br>Gen 14:20 And let the Most High God be praised, who has given into your hands those who were against you. Then Abram gave him a tenth of all the goods he had taken.<br>Gen 14:21 And the king of Sodom said to Abram, Give me the prisoners and take the goods for yourself.<br>Gen 14:22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have taken an oath to the Lord, the Most High God, maker of heaven and earth,<br>Gen 14:23 That I will not take so much as a thread or the cord of a shoe of yours; so that you may not say, I have given wealth to Abram:<br>Gen 14:24 Give me nothing but the food which the fighting-men who went with me have had; but let Aner and Eshcol and Mamre have their part of the goods.<br>Gen 15:1 After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Have no fear, Abram: I will keep you safe, and great will be your reward.<br>Gen 15:2 And Abram said, What will you give me? for I have no child and this Eliezer of Damascus will have all my wealth after me.<br>Gen 15:3 And Abram said, You have given me no child, and a servant in my house will get the heritage.<br>Gen 15:4 Then said the Lord, This man will not get the heritage, but a son of your body will have your property after you.<br>Gen 15:5 And he took him out into the open air, and said to him, Let your eyes be lifted to heaven, and see if the stars may be numbered; even so will your seed be.<br>Gen 15:6 And he had faith in the Lord, and it was put to his account as righteousness.<br>Gen 15:7 And he said to him, I am the Lord, who took you from Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land for your heritage.<br>Gen 15:8 And he said, O Lord God, how may I be certain that it will be mine?<br>Gen 15:9 And he said, Take a young cow of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a sheep of three years old, and a dove and a young pigeon.<br>Gen 15:10 All these he took, cutting them in two and putting one half opposite the other, but not cutting the birds in two.<br>Gen 15:11 And evil birds came down on the bodies, but Abram sent them away.<br>Gen 15:12 Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep came on Abram, and a dark cloud of fear.<br>Gen 15:13 And he said to Abram, Truly, your seed will be living in a land which is not theirs, as servants to a people who will be cruel to them for four hundred years;<br>Gen 15:14 But I will be the judge of that nation whose servants they are, and they will come out from among them with great wealth.<br>Gen 15:15 As for you, you will go to your fathers in peace; at the end of a long life you will be put in your last resting-place.<br>Gen 15:16 And in the fourth generation they will come back here; for at present the sin of the Amorite is not full.<br>Gen 15:17 Then when the sun went down and it was dark, he saw a smoking fire and a flaming light which went between the parts of the bodies.<br>Gen 15:18 In that day the Lord made an agreement with Abram, and said, To your seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:<br>Gen 15:19 The Kenite, the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,<br>Gen 15:20 And the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,<br>Gen 15:21 And the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.<br>Gen 16:1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had given him no children; and she had a servant, a woman of Egypt whose name was Hagar.<br>Gen 16:2 And Sarai said to Abram, See, the Lord has not let me have children; go in to my servant, for I may get a family through her. And Abram did as Sarai said.<br>Gen 16:3 So after Abram had been living for ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, and gave her to Abram for his wife.<br>Gen 16:4 And he went in to Hagar and she became with child, and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for her master's wife.<br>Gen 16:5 And Sarai said to Abram, May my wrong be on you: I gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for me: may the Lord be judge between you and me.<br>Gen 16:6 And Abram said, The woman is in your power; do with her whatever seems good to you. And Sarai was cruel to her, so that she went running away from her.<br>Gen 16:7 And an angel of the Lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land, by the fountain on the way to Shur.<br>Gen 16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from and where are you going? And she said, I am running away from Sarai, my master's wife.<br>Gen 16:9 And the angel said to her, Go back, and put yourself under her authority.<br>Gen 16:10 And the angel of the Lord said, Your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered.<br>Gen 16:11 And the angel of the Lord said, See, you are with child and will give birth to a son, to whom you will give the name Ishmael, because the ears of the Lord were open to your sorrow.<br>Gen 16:12 And he will be like a mountain ass among men; his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him, and he will keep his place against all his brothers.<br>Gen 16:13 And to the Lord who was talking with her she gave this name, You are a God who is seen; for she said, Have I not even here in the waste land had a vision of God and am still living?<br>Gen 16:14 So that fountain was named, Fountain of Life and Vision: it is between Kadesh and Bered.<br>Gen 16:15 And Hagar gave birth to a child, the son of Abram, to whom Abram gave the name of Ishmael.<br>Gen 16:16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.<br>Gen 17:1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord came to him, and said, I am God, Ruler of all; go in my ways and be upright in all things,<br>Gen 17:2 And I will make an agreement between you and me, and your offspring will be greatly increased.<br>Gen 17:3 And Abram went down on his face on the earth, and the Lord God went on talking with him, and said,<br>Gen 17:4 As for me, my agreement is made with you, and you will be the father of nations without end.<br>Gen 17:5 No longer will your name be Abram, but Abraham, for I have made you the father of a number of nations.<br>Gen 17:6 I will make you very fertile, so that nations will come from you and kings will be your offspring.<br>Gen 17:7 And I will make between me and you and your seed after you through all generations, an eternal agreement to be a God to you and to your seed after you.<br>Gen 17:8 And to you and to your seed after you, I will give the land in which you are living, all the land of Canaan for an eternal heritage; and I will be their God.<br>Gen 17:9 And God said to Abraham, On your side, you are to keep the agreement, you and your seed after you through all generations.<br>Gen 17:10 And this is the agreement which you are to keep with me, you and your seed after you: every male among you is to undergo circumcision.<br>Gen 17:11 In the flesh of your private parts you are to undergo it, as a mark of the agreement between me and you.<br>Gen 17:12 Every male among you, from one generation to another, is to undergo circumcision when he is eight days old, with every servant whose birth takes place in your house, or for whom you gave money to someone of another country, and not of your seed.<br>Gen 17:13 He who comes to birth in your house and he who is made yours for a price, all are to undergo circumcision; so that my agreement may be marked in your flesh, an agreement for all time.<br>Gen 17:14 And any male who does not undergo circumcision will be cut off from his people: my agreement has been broken by him.<br>Gen 17:15 And God said, As for Sarai, your wife, from now her name will be not Sarai, but Sarah.<br>Gen 17:16 And I will give her a blessing so that you will have a son by her: truly my blessing will be on her, and she will be the mother of nations: kings of peoples will be her offspring.<br>Gen 17:17 Then Abraham went down on his face, and laughing, said in his heart, May a man a hundred years old have a child? will Sarah, at ninety years old, give birth?<br>Gen 17:18 And Abraham said to God, If only Ishmael's life might be your care!<br>Gen 17:19 And God said, Not so; but Sarah, your wife, will have a son, and you will give him the name Isaac, and I will make my agreement with him for ever and with his seed after him.<br>Gen 17:20 As for Ishmael, I have given ear to your prayer: truly I have given him my blessing and I will make him fertile and give him great increase; he will be the father of twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great nation.<br>Gen 17:21 But my agreement will be with Isaac, to whom Sarah will give birth a year from this time.<br>Gen 17:22 And having said these words, God went up from Abraham.<br>Gen 17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael, his son, and all whose birth had taken place in his house, and all his servants whom he had made his for a price, every male of his house, and on that very day he gave them circumcision in the flesh of their private parts as God had said to him.<br>Gen 17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he underwent circumcision.<br>Gen 17:25 And Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he underwent circumcision.<br>Gen 17:26 Abraham and Ishmael, his son, underwent circumcision on that very day.<br>Gen 17:27 And all the men of his house, those whose birth had taken place in the house and those whom he had got for money from men of other lands, underwent circumcision with him.<br>Gen 18:1 Now the Lord came to him by the holy tree of Mamre, when he was seated in the doorway of his tent in the middle of the day;<br>Gen 18:2 And lifting up his eyes, he saw three men before him; and seeing them, he went quickly to them from the door of the tent, and went down on his face to the earth;<br>Gen 18:3 And said, My Lord, if now I have grace in your eyes, do not go away from your servant:<br>Gen 18:4 Let me get water for washing your feet, and take your rest under the tree:<br>Gen 18:5 And let me get a bit of bread to keep up your strength, and after that you may go on your way: for this is why you have come to your servant. And they said, Let it be so.<br>Gen 18:6 Then Abraham went quickly into the tent, and said to Sarah, Get three measures of meal straight away and make cakes.<br>Gen 18:7 And running to the herd, he took a young ox, soft and fat, and gave it to the servant and he quickly made it ready;<br>Gen 18:8 And he took butter and milk and the young ox which he had made ready and put it before them, waiting by them under the tree while they took food.<br>Gen 18:9 And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, She is in the tent.<br>Gen 18:10 And he said, I will certainly come back to you in the spring, and Sarah your wife will have a son. And his words came to the ears of Sarah who was at the back of the tent-door.<br>Gen 18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were very old, and Sarah was past the time for giving birth.<br>Gen 18:12 And Sarah, laughing to herself, said, Now that I am used up am I still to have pleasure, my husband himself being old?<br>Gen 18:13 And the Lord said, Why was Sarah laughing and saying, Is it possible for me, being old, to give birth to a child?<br>Gen 18:14 Is there any wonder which the Lord is not able to do? At the time I said, in the spring, I will come back to you, and Sarah will have a child.<br>Gen 18:15 Then Sarah said, I was not laughing; for she was full of fear. And he said, No, but you were laughing.<br>Gen 18:16 And the men went on from there in the direction of Sodom; and Abraham went with them on their way.<br>Gen 18:17 And the Lord said, Am I to keep back from Abraham the knowledge of what I do;<br>Gen 18:18 Seeing that Abraham will certainly become a great and strong nation, and his name will be used by all the nations of the earth as a blessing?<br>Gen 18:19 For I have made him mine so that he may give orders to his children and those of his line after him, to keep the ways of the Lord, to do what is good and right: so that the Lord may do to Abraham as he has said.<br>Gen 18:20 And the Lord said, Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is very great, and their sin is very evil,<br>Gen 18:21 I will go down now, and see if their acts are as bad as they seem from the outcry which has come to me; and if they are not, I will see.<br>Gen 18:22 And the men, turning from that place, went on to Sodom: but Abraham was still waiting before the Lord.<br>Gen 18:23 And Abraham came near, and said, Will you let destruction come on the upright with the sinners?<br>Gen 18:24 If by chance there are fifty upright men in the town, will you give the place to destruction and not have mercy on it because of the fifty upright men?<br>Gen 18:25 Let such a thing be far from you, to put the upright to death with the sinner: will not the judge of all the earth do right?<br>Gen 18:26 And the Lord said, If there are fifty upright men in the town, I will have mercy on it because of them.<br>Gen 18:27 And Abraham answering said, Truly, I who am only dust, have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord:<br>Gen 18:28 If by chance there are five less than fifty upright men, will you give up all the town to destruction because of these five? And he said, I will not give it to destruction if there are forty-five.<br>Gen 18:29 And again he said to him, By chance there may be forty there. And he said, I will not do it if there are forty.<br>Gen 18:30 And he said, Let not the Lord be angry with me if I say, What if there are thirty there? And he said, I will not do it if there are thirty.<br>Gen 18:31 And he said, See now, I have undertaken to put my thoughts before the Lord: what if there are twenty there? And he said, I will have mercy because of the twenty.<br>Gen 18:32 And he said, O let not the Lord be angry and I will say only one word more: by chance there may be ten there. And he said, I will have mercy because of the ten.<br>Gen 18:33 And the Lord went on his way when his talk with Abraham was ended, and Abraham went back to his place.<br>Gen 19:1 And at nightfall the two angels came to Sodom; and Lot was seated at the way into the town: and when he saw them he got up and came before them, falling down on his face to the earth.<br>Gen 19:2 And he said, My masters, come now into your servant's house and take your rest there for the night, and let your feet be washed; and early in the morning you may go on your way. And they said, Not so, but we will take our night's rest in the street.<br>Gen 19:3 But he made his request more strongly, so they went with him into his house; and he got food ready for them, and made unleavened bread, of which they took.<br>Gen 19:4 But before they had gone to bed, the men of the town, all the men of Sodom, came round the house, young and old, from every part of the town;<br>Gen 19:5 And crying out to Lot, they said, Where are the men who came to your house this night?
