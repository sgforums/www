If you are goondu, i bet you will not even bother when your little brother is hanging out there to be teased by the wind in the public eyes. Does that mean that goondu is not sinful anymore?<br><br>We human got intelligence and know how to make cloth for ourselves for protection from cold and others.

            <div class='col-md body'>Boys and girls. I now draw your attention to the writings of Singapore's very own prophet Alex Kew Kai Fatt again.<br><a href="http://members.tripodasia.com.sg/alexkew/newtestament.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripodasia.com.sg/alexkew/newtestament.html</a><br><br><blockquote><br>RevelationC13V16: The beast forced all the people, small and great, rich and poor, slave and free, to have a mark placed on their right hands or on their foreheads. V17: No one could buy or sell unless he had this mark, that is, the beast's name or the number that stands for the name. V18: This calls for wisdom. Whoever is intelligent can figure out the meaning of the number of the beast, because the number stands for a man's name. Its number is 666.<br><br>We have to use logic to understand the verses. In our modern society for someone to force others to obey certain orders is not easy, even Hussein of Iraq could not get 100 % of his people to obey him. Verse 18 added a sentence : This calls for wisdom. One person will come forward to explain the meaning. My interpretation is 666 could be 18, and 6 in the Chinese writing can show the outline of our face. 18, 108, 72 are some numbers used in various religious writings and can be of different meanings, like the 18 'Lohans'. </blockquote></div>

Do u mean translated or that meanings were changed? Abit of an ambiguity there.<br><br></div></blockquote>NO OFFENCE. Just stating my VIEWS and SOME FACTS. Yes, the BIBLE has been REVISED or REWRITTEN (NO, not TRANSLATED or MINOR changes). Some parts of it have been REMOVED. It has been INCORPORATED IN LINE with MAJOR DISCOVERY with SCIENCE.<br>AMBIGUITY? It can be found in the BIBLE itself. Since a YOUNG AGE when I 1st got CONTACT with the BIBLE, I found it to be of GREAT AMBIGUITY. So DIFFICULT to UNDERSTAND. DIFFERENT believers thinking of a DIFFERENT MEANING and SOME pointing out the 'actual points'. When 'things' happened, they would quote from the BIBLE. And MANY would say,"We MISINTERPRETED it... This is what it was ACTUALLY trying to say..." FAIR ENOUGH... MAYBE...? Maybe NOT...?<br><br>My FINAL WORDS for THIS POST would be... Given the AMBIGUITY and the LENGTHY TIME along the travel of HISTORY.... It's NOT surprising that things 'hit on the nails'....<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>Though NOT the RIGHT thing to do,<br>This might be the ONLY NATURAL thing to be...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like heat</span> is produced when work done...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">EVIL</span> is the GENERATION of SYSTEM FLAWS... <strong>DEVIL PHRASE III</strong><br><br>In DREAMS you CAN NEVER DIE.....<br>For YOUR LIFE is about the EXISTENCE of....<br>Your Happiness.... Your Sadness... Your Pain.... Your Pleasure....<br>Like a painted sky, when it rains... All CEASE to BE...    DEVIL PHRASE IV<br><br>When Law &amp; Rules are there,<br>they are NOT about JUSTICE.<br>While reality &amp; dreams are there,<br>they are NOT about SURVIVAL..<br><br>And Life &amp; Death NOT about LIVING...<br>Good &amp; Evil NOT about definitions....<br><br>IF truly there is EVIL, it is NOT just one of its kind......<br><br>DEVIL'S SEVENTH PHRASE<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
