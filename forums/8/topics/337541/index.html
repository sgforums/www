              <blockquote>
              <p class="first">LONDON (AFP) - - A British woman is to divorce her husband after discovering he was having a virtual affair within the online game "Second Life," British media reported Friday.
              
              </p>
              <p>Amy Taylor, 28, met her husband David Pollard within the game in May 2003, and six months later, she moved into his home in Cornwall, southwest England.</p>
              <p>The couple married in July 2005, while their "Second Life" avatars Dave Barmy and Laura Skye -- younger, slimmer versions of their real-life selves -- also held an online ceremony for their virtual friends.</p>
              <p>After a rare break from the computer, however, Taylor returned to find her 40-year-old husband in an intimate, albeit virtual, position with an online prostitute within "Second Life", which she said was the "ultimate betrayal".</p>
              <p>"I was so hurt," she was quoted as saying in The Times, adding that theirs was a "very serious marriage".</p>
              <p>"I just couldn't believe what he'd done. It's cheating as far as I'm concerned, but he didn't see it as a problem and couldn't see why I was so upset.</p>
              <p>"He said I was just making a big fuss and tried to make out it was my fault for not giving him enough attention."</p>
              <p>Second Life is an online role-playing game with more than 15 million users, in which players can create virtual avatars and interact with other gamers, or the environment.</p>
              <p>The game has its own virtual economy, in which online currency can be exchanged for real-world US dollars, and several major businesses have set up "branches" within the game, while others operate entirely within it.</p>
              <p>According to the Daily Telegraph, Taylor claims that Pollard is now engaged to the woman he was having an online tryst with, despite never having met her.</p>
              <p>She has, meanwhile, found a new love, through fantasy online role-playing game "World of Warcraft".</p>
