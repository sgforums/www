            <div class='col-md body'>There are 2 sides of the arguement to everything so it depends on which one you go for.<br><br>Qualifications are results and achievements on pieces of paper that are framed up for other peoples' viewing pleasure. One shouldn't merely judge a person based on the merits that he/she has received but as a person on the whole. It usually is a gauge for intelligence as such but it is only a representation of the person. You'll have to interact with one to know one. As for external views and opinions, just treat them as such. The most important thing is that you know what you are doing and feeling. That said, you too should give a thought to whether you will be inclined to feel the way other people do. If so, what are you doing to do about it. See things beyond their sufaces.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm........<br>The way I look at it, even if both of you hold bachelors, or something similar, its useless, since I have this stupid phobia planted into me when I watched this stupid chinese show where this couple (both academically powderful people.) got married, but their son turned out to be a retard....<br><br>Freaks me out, to say the least.....<br><br>Now, on that note, I believe I can come up with requirements that beat even Terence's tough criteria.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>1)My spouse must have no <strong>TERMINAL</strong> medical history for the last <strong>FOUR</strong> generations, on <strong>BOTH</strong> sides of the family tree. Simply because, if she did, its like injecting a defective gene into what is otherwise, a healthy genetic specimen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2)He/She must have no obvious physical defects. (Eg. Cross Eyed, Super long neck, or long body, short legs....) Since, physical attributes are inherited genetically from both sides....<br><br>3)Mentality, and Background. A person's behaviour, and character is also largely "created" from the background he/she grew up in. (Eg. If a person's family history is abusive, that person tends to be abusive also.....), thus, a checkup on family behaviour, the way that person grew up, is required.<br><br>4)Must have no chemical/hormone disorders, or <strong>EVER</strong> taken physically damaging drugs. Since once the body is damaged, then, the child's genetic platform would be inherited from a damaged body.<br><br>5)The chosen spouse must have some physically pleasing attributes. (Eg. Super straight hair that almost never tangles, or an oval face, or Blue eyes or something great. No freckles please.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">)  Of course, the outcome wouldn't always be great, but at least, there's SOME pleasing attributes....<br><br>At least, better than having none....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>6)Qualifications. A University grad would be great. A higher one would be even better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Right... now, I wonder if anyone would actually take up these requirements for real..... Terence ? Maya ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ah terence,  all of us are racists simply because we can't help but judging and making assumptions from looks.  Maybe they are not fixed assumptions, but everytime someone of a certain race does something peculiar there'll be a part of you that goes "yups" because you've seen before done by someone in that race.<br><br>Terence, Terence, my gorgeous stud, you sound like a horse owner looking for a mare to breed with his prize stallion.  But horses don't care much about love and other mushy tings, do you?<br><br>Isn't Warwick in Coventry???<br><br>Barclays<br>I used to have a crush on LHL, the way he speaks on TV....<br>but then again I also had a baby crush on Dan Quayle.  Maybe it's because in Indonesia most ministers read from a piece of paper whenever they make a speech, or even talking in television, and they are so bad looking, so much for eloquence.<br><br>Colette, mistress of flame, can I study in your exalted school of flaming under your excellent tutelage?  Hee,heee, interested to take on Barclays and Terence?  If we go on a double date and driving along one of the interstates, I'm sure B and T would sit in the front seats and discuss some gone subjects passionately.  So much until we will be able to alight unnoticed at one of the deserted gas stations and we then can try to hitch a ride with those dashing motorbike gang types.  Bring your catsuit, dahling, vroom.<br><br>Rulakir:  I don't think our sole purpose of existence is procreating.  Surely it is more important that my spouse and I are compatible and we love each other to bits.  Then both of us have to<br>-want children, AND<br>-he knows how to rear children/willing to learn<br>Children, however good their genes are, need good environment to grow up in and it's you and spouse that have to provide it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, I'll prefer someone close to my level. If the girl has much more earning power than me, dun think I'll feel good (yeah yeah talk about a man's ego). Of cos I dun mind if she has a big inheritance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> as long as it is not used to put me down intentionally by her or her family. Afterall it does not make sense that I dun be with her cos her family leaves her a big legacy. As for a girl with lower qualifications, I don't think I'll mind but at least she must have a positive attitude towards upgrading herself either studies or other skills.</div>
