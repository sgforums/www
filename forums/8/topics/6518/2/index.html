            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>First of all, I think that I have to admit that I was laughing out loud when I read the posts, particularly the ones written by Terence. But after some thought, I think I would like to offer my opinions.<br><br>Well, I think, like Terence, I need a wife with no less than university qualifications, and it would be hell if she is from NUS, since I have indicated ages ago, I need a wife who is either from a foreign country with who enjoys British culture like pubbing and clubbing, and also the interests like watching American sitcoms and sci-fi series like Star Trek, B5, X-files, and animations like Simpsons, Dilbert, South Park and Futurerama. If she is a fellow doctorate would-be, it would be better.<br><br>Like Terence, I am more or less a Darwinist, in the case, that I believe that if both me and my wife are highly educated, we can provide a better ground for our children. Nevertheless, I don't discount away for gals who are in polys or education below that stage, but what worries me is our communication. Communication is an important aspect of a r/s. The disparity in educational level would indicate more or less some problems in this aspect.<br><br>Well, of course, if I want to have kids to be scientists or doctorates like me in the future, I won't keep preaching to them science, instead, I would force them to do humanities (read Shakespeare, Adam Smith and Freud) since when they are kids until they hate it and turn to science out of spite to me and then I achieve my objective.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>i'm the product of two illiterates &amp; yet i can write as well as anybody else here, in fact i've been told that i can flame even better.<br><br>true, no doubt there're topics which are way over my head due to lack of exposure or opportunities or simply they don't interest me but did the fact that i'm the off-spring of two poor illiterates hamper me? nah! i'm proud of my parents even though they drive me up the freaking wall all the time but i wouldn't change them for the world. sure, i wanted parents stinking rich, articulate, sophisticated but then, would they have time for me &amp; love me unconditionally with no undue pressure to conform to their ideals &amp; standards? &amp; most importantly let me have my own way, be it right or wrong? what matters is that they were there for me when things go wrong.<br><br>children? children are but blessings from God, it is hilarious to see two highly educated men subscribing to the Darwinian thinking that 2 highly educated adults will produce 1 smart kid, duh! by that logic, i would have been an idiot!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> tsk, tsk, man proposes, God disposes ...<br><br>should God decide not to bless one with children, you can do the hanky panky for years with nothing to show for it. what i think is most important is that the child is born healthy physically &amp; mentally, whether the child turns out to be a genius or not, that's highly irrelevant. why? just because the child is a couple of points below the genius level according to the Mensa's standards, are you going to love him/her less?<br><br>the only good thing i can see from the marriage between two highly educated people is the extra financial advantage for the child with every conceivable enrichment classes thrown in. childhood? what childhood does most our current generation get? ever heard the sick joke that when kids see a live chicken, they actually had to ask what it was? hehehe ... why? 'coz the chicken they're used to seeing ain't got no feathers or head ... hahaha ...<br><br>children are not an extension of ourselves &amp; we shouldn't even try to live our aborted dreams through them. true, we have to give them every advantage we can but we also have to be honest with ourselves, are we doing it for them or for ourselves? obviously, there are things that are not negotiable like basic education, exposure to the arts &amp; cultural stuff if you can afford it. but i believe what every child want would be the secure knowledge that they are loved for themselves, not what they could achieve.<br><br>sure, set your criterias but don't be too rigid, at the end of the day, it is love that   matters most for it would be the unconditional love a spouse can give when things go wrong which will substain you, not her intellect or her degrees. and if you don't love her, even her high intellect &amp; strings of Ph Ds after her name on her name card will leave you cold.<br><br>duh, i must have blown my chances with Terence &amp; prodigal now ... *sob sob* ahhh, but there's still Barclays. Barclays, where are you? i need consolation ...<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 14 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, colette:<br><br>Well, I think that there are reasons why both Terence and me set a criteria in choosing a girlfriend. For once, you can call me a pragmatic idealist.<br><br>If love is not about academic qualifications, then it is clear cut that any form of certificates regarding your education would not mean anything. However, in a modern society, it is very difficult to distinguish that. I have already given 2 appropriate reasons why we want that, not because of superiority or being extremist<br><br>1)Communication : Well, I think if the gal cannot communicate with you on the same level, it becomes increasingly difficult later.<br><br>2)Children : both parents being educated could help to provide a better environment and more background to the child's education.<br><br>I am sure that there are exceptions, like my 2nd ex-gf, a university undergraduate ran away with a bloke (who is her ex-bf) who is a polytechnic. After all these talk about compromise (and I did because I remain faithful in the long distance r/s), I decided that I should just stick to what I look for. Although it may be high expectations on my part, but at least I know that I won't have to get a gf who do not share common interests and ideas with me.<br><br>Well, my dear Colette, you are definitely more qualified than your certificate tells us. I think your English is definitely better than those who got their "Air" levels or even university qualification. So, you might turn out to be one of the anomalies, which Terence and I fail to classify.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, MayaJade,<br><br>There are always people who made it without going by the proper route. The crazy paper chase is simply not the way for those aspire to climb in the way like the CEO of Creative or the current Deputy Vice Chancellor of NUS, Professor Fong (who was the top 100 scientists as a Singapore in US, with his famous JQ theory in fracture mechanics and he is a polytechnic student in the 1970s-1980s). There are always anomalies. Some people don't need a certificate and carve their way out. I know that there is an example and perhaps a bad one, the ex-CEO of Microsoft, Bill Gates. He is a Harvard dropout, so what does that tell you?<br><br>If there exists a gal who has the kind of interests and brilliant ideas which I think is really good, but she don't have a university education, what makes u think that I won't go for it?<br></div>

In the reduction of intelligence to the positivist aggrandisation of qualifications derived from the generic and formulaic, (i.e. score a certain amont of points on the grading curve), the degree of constellating connections constituted in it, like the boheme or the Baudilaire poem, are produced in it solely by the aruptness common to everything torn from their contexts.<br><br>The justification of from a higher echelon of the petite bourgeious is the immediate degradation of the proletariat on the basis of ability ascribed to formal education. True, the meritocratic system in place in Singapore assumes that anyone with ability can work their way upwards and thus skew towards your model of intelligence = qualifications. But that is in neglecting the thousands each cohort who are hampered by social reasons not to be able to respond to the pressure-cooker system.<br><br>As for the tangential referal to the issue of love and qualifications, I'll concur with colette's obsevation that a majority of SG, no matter how romantised, will revert to the true-blue capitalist response of economic barter towards a relationship, and neccessating higher qualifications to a monied security.<br><br>*laughs* Pardons... fingers itchy as a certain someone else is quite impotent with written repartees... i sigh most of the time trying to point out obvious defiencies... *wave hand about a la Kenshin -- "ma ma..."*<br><br>Colette :<br><br>*sayang ... offers favourite rum-and-raisin ice-scream* I dun wanna be no spare tire ... after Prodigal and Terence, then look for me??

This cultural capital commodifies the circulation of knowledge and co-privileges the patterns and recipients of this circulation which, left to the intellect of the proletarian would fold. *rolls eyes* the raison dÂ’etre of the proletariat is the labour-value attached to their existence. give me the laissez faire any day of the week and twice on sundays! to detach this mode of existence would be to redefine the proletariat which would then be a smirk at a Marxist discourse.<br><br>The utilitarian narrative you seem to propose in the faculties of education transgresses the traditions of classical philosophy, calcified by victorian assertions (latin and greek philosophy as generic education to be (re)appropriated to specificity as tools for critical thinking) which I cannot, in all my good sense, accept as alternative. woo-hooooo!<br><br>Of course you agree with Colette!

So, in all fairness, perhaps I should share my personal experience instead. Esoteric critiques are fine as they are, but "library hours" are over.<br><br>I'm not too sure abt qualifications : I used to see a girl who tutors part-time at NUS in the Science faculty. But in all honesty (and I'll apologise to her for saying this), her intelligence wasn't that incisive. And since, you don't date someone just because there's coupla letters after their names, I was seeing her because we have great fun together.<br><br>So that's it really - the litmus test for me of "Would You..." thread is simply that "Can you have fun together?" If by dint of (un)fotunate circumstances that there is a disparity in qualifications, it doesn't really matter to me. In my rancour against the capitalist state, I retreat to a humanitarian individualism ; I simply will not barter a relationship nor prostrate myself at the altar of economic viability. I diss women who do. *laugh* I diss women more when they do and they pretend they don't.<br><br>I treat this topic seriously in the sense that I had worked this out for myself when I was younger and confused. Ultimately, even if the woman of my life is Cherie Cheung, has a doctorate in astrophysics and is great in bed BUT we can't laugh together, I think I'll feel empty and unconnected.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>*sighs deeply, arms crossed, thinking of the cheapness of Deprek Chopra*<br><br>------------------<br>It doesn't mean that love always has to obey Mariah Carey ...
