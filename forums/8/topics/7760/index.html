            <div class='col-md body'>Image? It is such a vague word. I dun look good to be frank, but I try to make up to it by dressing nicely, I like to be neat if I can, I dun like to smell of sweat...though I sweat still, such is what some may call as vain, but it is the way I like people to look at me and not feel bad. I think it is the basic respect you can give to someone, on a date, at a meeting, over dinner. You want to look appealing, so that at least people dun want to be far away from you.<br><br>On the internet, image is a different matter, image is what you make of it. I can be a devil, I can be the angel, I can even be god if people are foolish enough to believe(Of course I got to be good enough too.) Put simply, we are all behind a mask on the net. The screen infront of you right now happens to be your veil. Some of us might say that we try to be as real as we can virtually, but like most of us say...we try, but it is already almost immpossible to just behave according to what your nature desires, much less when you can jsut hide behind a mask and be anyone.<br><br>An image like it spells, is an image, it is most of the time unreal. An image is built, it is not inborn, but a nature is in born, it is part of you, the whole geas of being natural is to be able to bring this nature of you out into the open, and let it be your image. Such is what we is really being true to your self.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>J'adore Naive.
