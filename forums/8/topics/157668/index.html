            <div class='col-md body'>I am sure all of you have heard about those school girls in Japan selling themselves for money and stuff. Its a very common thing in Japan and alot of school girls are involved in it.<br><br>Now my main question is, are the girls in singapore heading down the same direction ? I am sure alot of you also know prostituition is legal in singapore and the legal age is 16 at the moment. The Singapore Government is reviewing the law at the moment and I assume will amend the legal age to be 18.<br><br>Are the brand conscience girls in singapore now doing the same thing as their counterparts in japan ? Selling themselves for money to buy what they want. As Singapore is getting more and more materialistic, is this the inevitable road that some girls will take ? So they can have what they want ? Most of all, to you guys out there, will you partake in such offers ? As it is totally legal, technically you are not doing anything wrong.<br><br>I am sure some girls look at this as an easy way to earn money and for the nymphos, all the sex they want. I am sure even some would screen the men and choose only those she wants to do it with. Imagine how much she could easily earn in a month if she is pretty enough.<br><br>The Great One<br><br>Fear is but our will to Live</div>

Obviosly u do not understand the situation in Japan n how Enjo Kosai works.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if that were the case, i wouldn't want to have any kids.<br>this is a sad world.<br>correct: without demand, won't have supply. The guys want sex, the girls want material goods. girls also willing to "work" to go for procedures to make themselves "prettier" - which in fact this beauty is only conceptualised by the media and objectified by men.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not a matter of who is at fault here. even if there is no suppy some guys will still goto geylang. my point is that this trend seems to be gaining steam in singapore as people are getting more and more materialistic. It is no fault of the girl or guy. It is by their own choice. No need to put the blame or cause on something else because at the end of the day it is their own decisions whether they want to partake or be involved in such trade.<br><br>If you wish to screen your boyfriend than there is already a sign of lack of trust. Pretty much I can say bye bye to the relationship. After all its all based on trust. But I am sure to many its nothing wrong as its the norm. Assuming both parties have been intimate before with other people it is fair enough is both parties take the screening for health purposes not for finger pointing or acusation.<br><br>If the girl wishes to be in this trade than if they boyfriend or new boyfriend finds out so be it. After all she made the decision and must bear with the consequences of her actions. Simple as that. All boils down to choice.<br><br>Now if the girl is upfront about it in the beginning even before the relationship starts and wishes to end her trade or has already stopped than its up to the guy whether he can accept her previous life or not. There is no blame here only choices and consequences.<br><br>The Great One<br><br>To Forgive is Divine</div>
