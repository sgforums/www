He hears all that is in this universe, His universe that is.<br><br>will he respond to u? that all depends in ur interpertation of `respond'. u see, u and i we see things in such a way that `respond' is something that we can see, feel, or acknowledge immediately after something or an action is initiated. like when we ask from our friends for some help, and they respond in one way or another. but when u say will God respond to u when u ask for something?... as a muslim we believe there are several things that might happen.<br><br>for example, let us use the most easiest scenario...cash. let say a person in need for some cash urgently for some family matters and medical needs. he prays to God for help...`God help me in this time of need (for some cash)' or something along those lines...<br><br>His response maybe...the person discovered that he may be recieveing some sort of bonus from his work, from the govt., a friend offering a loan, a friend paying back some money loaned to him sometime ago and so on...<br><br>or the person may have some oppurtunity to make some extra money over the next few months...from overtime, some extra allowances, u know small amounts of money over a period of time.<br><br>or He may not help u at all...in this world...u may pray and pray and pray untill u cry blood...He will still not help u...but u still must perservere in facing the tests that he gives u...then He will help u...where?? in the afterlife, on Judgement day when we are all gathered together to be judged, from the first man prophet Adam (pbuh) to the last.  He will help u there.<br><br>as to ur question whether God belongs to Islam...<br><br>u must understand what is Islam...what does it mean?? Islam is a word that most of us use as a name of a religion. but Islam is also a verb, or actions that a person do. when a person does Islam he is a Mu-islam...Muslim.<br><br>in arabic Islam means 5 things <span style="font-style: italic;">`surrender' </span>ur will to God's will, <span style="font-style: italic;">`submitting' </span>to His commandments, <span style="font-style: italic;">`obeying' </span>what He ordered u to do to the best of ur ability, do it in <span style="font-style: italic;">`sincerity' </span>and in <span style="font-style: italic;">`peace'</span>. so if a person is doing all the 5 things stated above, then he is doing Islam...a Muslim.<br></div>
