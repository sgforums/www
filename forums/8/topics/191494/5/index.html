Can a book; inspired by God or otherwise; fully explain God? If your Faith is in the God described in the Bible; you have an idol in your head. It is an idol because a book, even one inspired by God cannot fully explain God. Even if you find an encyclopedia that fully explains God; can your human mind then fully understands what the book says?<br><br>When do you stop seeking God?</div>
