            <div class='col-md body'>obiwan I wonder why you refused when rubberduckie said he will meet you instead.<br><br>And also to remind you guys: people accept Jesus because they find that they are sinful, not holy. They do not need Jesu if they are holy.<br><br>And regarding 'sinful', everyone has done wrong things at some points of their time dont you agree? even the most minor wrong thing is considered as a sin. I am trying to explain to you that they are not being crazy when they admit they are sinful, they're just being honest to themselves.<br><br>Because the Bible got say that God will look at the most minor wrong things that a person did in his life and will hold him guilty for it, especially when he still refused to admit that mistake.<br>sinful things also include things you did when you were a kid: such as stealing toys from your neighbour's kid, steal ten cent coins from classmate, fighting etc.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 09 February 2002).]</div>

According to Bible, sins can only be forgiven when that person accept Jesus, because God himself came down to Earth as Jesus on a rescue mission to forgive sins.<br><br>The reason why fisherprice go around posting about God / Jesus is because he want people to know the good news that God is willing to forgive Man of any sins in his life if he is willing to accept Jesus.<br><br>That's the end of my explanation, No arguements please , I am only explaining to you what we believe, not asking anyone to accept.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 09 February 2002).]</div>
