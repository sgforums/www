              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/8/topics/">Singapore DOES NOT have third world living standards - KRC</a></p>
              <p>Both articles are terrible. The first one doesn't attribute sources properly and wrongly equates purchasing power with living standards. But the second article misses that point altogether, and uses poor evidence. I studied in the States too and the most accessible lunches are US$5 (with a tumbler of soda) and even less (if you opt for junk), and it's little different on the street. If 400 Americans make as much money as half of the rest, what about the millionaires in Singapore (including those in power)?</p>
              <p>Our spending habits are probably different from a Western European family of three but the study should not be doused with a truckload of salt.</p>

              <p>I agree property prices go up due to scarcity of land but the major engine of growth for property are due to migrants. Immigrants compete with locals for property and rental thereby hiking up prices. PAP no longer generate popular support among younger and career successful Singaporeans so they look to new migrants for political support and fish votes.</p>
              <p>Falling birth rates are the fault of most singaporeans such as icerage who prefer to stay at home and hack forums and not look for jobs which eventually go to migrants.</p>
              <p>Stop bringing in poor quality migrants to work in restaurants and shopping centres. The kind of migrants Singapore should bring are researchers, IT programmers, intellectuals and owners of successful start up companies. Migrants should be limited to 20,000 a year not the usual intake of 200k a year.</p>

Tee Tua Bah, to the surprise of many who knew his <br>gambling habit was eventually promoted to become Commissioner of Police.<br>There are plenty of other abuse of power. Many who know it are reluctant to <br>reveal due to LKY penchant to abuse the law to bankrupt them.<br>Just ask yourself why is LKY so probusiness.

              <p>This Mrs Lee had been in coma for some time. So it wouldn't be strange that it was part of the reason for the abolishment.</p>
              <p>The old guard, many of them bought properties in bukit timah back in the 60s. And they have purposely kept that area prime. What was bought for $50,000 in those days has become millions of dollars today. In fact, the area there is a PAP fiefdom. They ALL have links to the PAP somehow. How do I know? My uncle is the son of an ex cabinet minister.</p>
