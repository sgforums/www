              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; margin-top: -2px; font-family: georgia;"> Study reveals Singaporeans endure one of the poorest quality of life</span></p>
              <p><span class="dropcap">A</span> report by international Swiss investment bank UBS <a href="http://satayclub.net/2011/04/ubs-singapore-has-lowest-wages-amongst-the-asian-tigers/">reveals that Singaporeans have one of the poorest quality of life</a> — a level comparable with Moscow and Johannesburg.</p>
              <p>Entitled “Price and Earnings 2009″, the report reveals that while 
                  Singaporeans enjoy one of the highest per capital GDP (PPP-adjusted) in 
                  Asia at $49,288, the figures belie the quality of life the ordinary 
                  Singaporean endures.</p>
              <p>Although Singapore has a higher GDP per capita than countries such as
                   Switzerland, it has a depressing wage index of only 31.3, compared to 
                  Zurich and Geneva of 119.8 and 107.5 respectively.</p>
              <p>The wage index of Singapore is approximately at the same level as 
                  that of Moscow (30.9), Tallinn (28.7) and Johannesburg (26.7).  In 
                  Asia-Pacific, wages in Tokyo (83.0), Sydney (74.1), Hongkong (42.3) and 
                  Taipei (35.5) also exceed that of Singapore.</p>
              <p><strong>Singaporeans have poor purchasing power</strong></p>
              <p>According to the UBS study, Singaporeans also have one of the poorest purchasing power compared to other countries in the world.</p>
              <p>The average annual salary is divided by the total price of a selected
                   basket of goods and service to derive a formula signalling the 
                  country’s purchasing power.</p>
              <p>Again, the average Singaporean’s purchasing power (39.9) falls 
                  strongly behind cities such as Zurich (106.9), Sydney (95.9), Taipei 
                  (58.9), Hongkong (58.1) and Tokyo (82.2). The country’s average 
                  purchasing power is comparable to only areas such as Kuala Lumpur 
                  (39.5), Warsaw (34.0) and Bogota (33.7).</p>
              <p>The report also reveals that Singaporeans spend longer working hours,
                   with lesser hours of vacation staying in a city that is ranked the 
                  second most expensive place to live in after Tokyo.</p>

              <p>That is why maybe the low birth rate need not be fought against.</p>
              <p>Singapore is small, and is crowded, and doesnt have natural resources.</p>
              <p>Which means property price is high, and most people work in service-related jobs.</p>
              <p>Low birth rate is natural because the population in Singapore is way oversubsribed above the capacity. Let it come down to its natural equilibrium.</p>

              <p>We dont have an Independent Workers Union (Ntuc = Goverment), And the Goverment is more about Growth and Pro-Employer/Companies,</p>
              <p>Ontop of it, We dont have any workers Right... Most companies that you work for, From the Low and High positions, Most will only hand out 12 to 14 days Leave per Year.. 18 days and above, Are pretty Rare this days, Unless your in a very high position.</p>
              <p>The only way for all this to change, Is for them to be voted out... Is no longer like our Parents time, When jobs were aplenty and Cost of living was much lower then it is now... The same job your Parents use to do in the 1990s, Pays the same Now but now Houses is no longer in their 80 Thousands to 200 000 for a huge 5 Rm and sweets are no longer 3 for 10cents.</p>

              <p>The report also reveals that Singaporeans spend longer working hours, with lesser hours of vacation staying in a city that is ranked the second most expensive place to live in after Tokyo.</p>

              <p><br>I felt it is not necessary to have the 44 working hours per week minimum requirement. Why not let the companies set it themselves?</p>
              <p>Although I spent 44 hours per week in my company, but the amount of time I spent on work is much lesser, so no OT for me.</p>

              <p>u may vote....but someone can change the 100% vote for opposition vote box  to one containing 100% vote for PAP box.</p>
              <p>is there anyone to ensure the vote boxes are not switched or changed like some magic show?</p>
