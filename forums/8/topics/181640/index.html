            <div class='col-md body'>Most recording devices actually beeps instead of the clicking sound.<br><br>I can't advise much because if there is no external device being attached to your house phone, the recording cannot take place at all, more ever the clicking sound. You can try changing another deskphone and see whether the sound persist. It might not be a recording but some fault with your phone line. Call up Singtel/Starhub to ask them to check your telephone line signal strength.</div>
