            <div class='col-md body'>I know that there have bee  quite a few threads about leaving the fourm and such...well here is another one...<br><br>I have met, through the course of my stay at sgforums and #sgcafe, many good people that i consider my friends(whether they consider me also i dun know)....And i feel that i may be getting too involved with what is happening in their lives and such...As if i was really a part of it anyway.<br><br>the crazy thing is that i think of peopel i meet here as my real friends(as real as non-virtual friends)...but i think that i am gettign too emotional about things that are happening...something very unchracteristic of me..Don't ask me why because i also dun't know the answer to that question myself.<br><br>I do truly feel for everyone who i've met here and all ...which is why i am taking a break..dunno how long ar..but need abreak..breath, fresh air...and all that...compose myself, think, gather and collect everything together again. rememebr who i am...what is most important to me...maybe? dunno yet... see first.<br><br>maybe i have a hard time dealing with people?...or i'm just unused to feeling for people because i've been alone for so long and had to fend for things myself...so meaning i didn't have to worry about anyone but me....Well things seem to have changed and although i dun have a hard time dealign with it, i prefer nto to deal with it.  Just a choice...mainly due to my principle that i dun want to interfere with anyones life(which is the driving force that compels me to do what i am doing).<br><br>I fear that if i stay any longer, the way things are, i will intefere...and i may have started to already....not something i want to do...<br><br>no actually i do want, but whetehr other people want is another thing...and anyway that's not even what to say,..aiyar..it;'s all not very clear ok.!!!!..but if i stay at this moment then i will surely cause trouble for people.<br><br>dunwan lah  care about people also no use...feel like inturder anyway.<br><br>so i take my temporary bow...a hiatus...700 posts is good enuff for now...<br><br>i bow out for now....those who know me can contact me whenever u feel like it because i am still one of the bitch boyz adn i wunt forget it guys....lets have dinner.<br><br>see u back whenever i get back...<br><br>...(in the 1 word of erriegal,"HEH~")....<br><br>as if it means anything to the anonymous out there anyway...shit....better sleep before i delete this thing.</div>
