            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Offical statement<br><br>The universities, polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education will continue to operate as normal. These institutes of higher learning have a different system of operation from our national schools. Furthermore, the students in our post-secondary institutions are older and are better able to understand the situation and take the necessary precautions.</strong><br><br>Two main arguments, that's how they write us off... and I would not mind if they were valid ones, but they are not, that's what makes it so fustratingly infurating, that words are being put into our mouth and arguments built on truth that is not there.<br><br><blockquote>These institutes of higher learning have a different system of operation from our national schools. </blockquote>What exactly does this imply? That the different system of operation somehow prevents the spread of disease? (if anything, the way such insutites operate make them more vulnerable to SARS spreading) Or that the different system of operation means it takes too much red tape and time to shut them down so it's not worth the effort anyway... their system of operations makes it harder for the parents to voice out? So no noise equal no action.<br><br><blockquote>Furthermore, the students in our post-secondary institutions are older and are better able to understand the situation and take the necessary precautions.</blockquote>I will not bother to touch on the maturity bit, esp for polytechnics and ITEs where this false for most of the students there. What do they mean by better understand the situtation? That SARS is okay to be spread in national schools? That it's our problem? And what necessary precautions can we take? Must we all wear face mask to school? Bathe in school 18 times a day? Skip school and fail our assignments and modules? Can we all detect SARS infected people just by looking at them? If anything it seems that we are not one bit prepared for a potential outbreak at all, and our demographics and school operations makes the spread of SARS all the more easier. It appears if any precautions we have taken, that is to all cry out in protest against what is happening.<br><br>I wonder if this reflects the hidden attitudes of the MOE, that all non-uniforms are second pirority when it comes to wellfare. It certainly feels that way from the student's prespective. I'm sure all these educational systems inspire us to be really patrotic and productive citizens... Frankly I can't imagine how a bill, which is supposed to be based on calming the public can get passed when virtually all poly students disagree vermently with it. Or shall we wait until cases start turing up in these schools before we act?<br><br>There should be consistency of action, working pple can take leave and such, but students are students, irregardless of where they come from, they can't just skip school. If they are gonna close schools to appease the parents, it's really illogical to implement it as a half-measure because this will only spread more panic among those who do not have the privilliage of this offical "protection" when they feel they rightfully should. One cannot describe how low morale can be now, esp when we have to stay in the same labs with pple from all over the poly and share the same computers (keyboards by the way, have 400 times more baterial and other stuff then your toliet seat) knowing that death lurks around somewhere but there's no way to avoid it because you are effectively trapped.<br><br>Nuff said.<br><br></div>
