              <p>ICA officers, although they decide whether to let a person enter Singapore without troubles or simply give them shit for that.</p>
              <p>I've seen many cases, ICA officers raising voices against asian seafarers, no they do not do that to angmohs unless they are from eastern european countries.</p>
              <p>Some of the things I've heard</p>
              <p>"You come singapore for what?" - harsh tone</p>
              <p>"Why your passport got staple? You know I can reject your entry right? Tell me why!" - arrogant and angry tone</p>
              <p>"Show me your boarding pass!" - demanding</p>
              <p>Once, this indonesian seafarer was first time in Singapore, something happened with the clearance and this plain-clothed ICA officer came out. He was asking questions to the seaman like a CID would to a criminal.</p>
              <p>Imagine, first contact at Changi Airport are SATs/CIAs staff who already half the time are not doing their job, next point are the ICA officers where they abuse their powers?</p>

              <p>Agree completely.  If you arrive legitimately from a country that doesn't require a visa then there's no need to be rude. </p>
              <p>It's a bit like the judges in American Idol v. Signapore idol.  American idol you get Simon Cowell being brutal but honest because he knows the business.  Singapore Idol you get Dick Lee trying to emulate Simon Cowell, but ending up nothing but a rude prick.  Heathrow Airport you get asked hard questions in order to see how you handle them or if you give anything away.  Singapore Airport you get rude immigration officers belittling passengers from *fellow Asean countries that are supposedly able to travel freely*.</p>

              <p>ICA officers, although they decide whether to let a person enter
                  Singapore without troubles or simply give them shit for that.</p>
              <p>I've seen many cases, ICA officers raising voices against asian
                  seafarers, no they do not do that to angmohs unless they are from
                  eastern european countries.</p>
              <p>Some of the things I've heard</p>
              <p>"You come singapore for what?" - harsh tone</p>
              <p>"Why your passport got staple? You know I can reject your entry
                  right? Tell me why!" - arrogant and angry tone</p>
              <p>"Show me your boarding pass!" - demanding</p>
              <p>Once, this indonesian seafarer was first time in Singapore,
                  something happened with the clearance and this plain-clothed ICA
                  officer came out. He was asking questions to the seaman like a CID
                  would to a criminal.</p>
              <p>Imagine, first contact at Changi Airport are SATs/CIAs staff who
                  already half the time are not doing their job, next point are the
                  ICA officers where they abuse their powers?</p>
              <p>No wonder, Changi Aiport is slipping behind..</p>

              <p>No lor, i go hong kong and when i return home to singapore very heart warming le. The ICA very nice says things like welcome home very warm feeling. But their travellator really need to change, the handrail some rubber thing break off le at Terminal 1 or maybe because it is still under upgrading...</p>
