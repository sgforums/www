            <div class='col-md body'>I used to work part time banquet in a renowned 5 star hotel under the catagory of "Casual Labour". Since it's only a part time job , there was no signing of any form of contract whatsoever. The only document that I was required to sign was the personal particulars form.<br><br>I have a question to ask , is a part timer's pay liable to a pay cut even though if he/she is not bounded by any form of contract?<br><br>Given the situation where my ex banquet manager assigned to me to another table in the middle of the wedding function and all hell broke loose as a result due to my negligence. As a result , one thing accumulated after another and the last straw came when forgot to serve the prawn sauce to the guest. Surprisingly , my ex manager wasen't really interested in my other screw ups EXCEPT for the incident concerning the prawn sauce. His entire shouting session at me seem to only revolve around that prawn sauce incident. Other screw ups include not serving the chicken dish which I presume is 100 times worst than not serving the prawn sauce. My boss F'ed me up for not serving the prawn sauce and as a result of all this , he issued a pay cut and evantually "sacked" me.<br><br>Another question I would like to bring up is whether reassigning of staff to another table in the middle function should only be restricted to EXPERIENCED STAFF. My ex manager assigned me to another table given that it was only my forth time working , making me inexperienced. My dad who has about 10 years of experience in the F&amp;B industry under belt mentioned , reassigning of staff to another table in the middle of a function should only be done to experienced staff.<br><br>So is reassigning of inexperience to another table during a function against the "rules of the F&amp;B industry?"<br><br>Perhaps people working in this industry would like to shed some light here....<br><br>The reason for me asking all this is that I intend to look for a part time weekend job preferably banquet as I have some experience in it and am currently pursuing full time diploma studies in a local polytechnic.<br><br>Cheers</div>
