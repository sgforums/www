U are right. There will bound to be different genre of music in different periods of time. Definitely there will be comparison to see how to improve the current thing. Its not only in music. It can go to all sort of things. Transport, housing, politics etc. Yes, perhaps U are right. U should appreciate what music there is today. If no comparison work is done between the good and the bad of the past n present of what to retain n eliminate. In the future it still the same.</div>

Or meats...?<br><br>Popularity depends on marketing and the market's taste... Packaging not really up to the singers... If you're thinking that new generation singers nowadays depends alot on 'packaging' and 'flowery', then I won't totally agree with you... I agree that at this age, 'packaging' and presentation are important... Some are often blind by it.. But that certainly doesn't mean that the singers themselves don't have a standard? Even the earlier generations have their own form of packaging... And the fact that they've been doing it for a longer period of time certainly puts them on a much advantage in some senses? Whether you're good or not, without certain level of 'marketing' &amp; 'packaging' these days, it's just difficult to stand out....</div>
