Like what you say, its personal preference. Yes, perhaps U consider Andy Lau is not 1 of the singing greats, his songs is the same from last time till now. But there are a lot who still like his songs and he is still "yi li bu dao", sweeping all the male awards in HK last year.<br>Why not U quote me some better singers than them?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But as compared to "shi li" I think Jolin Tsai still loses to Sandy Lam, Sally Yeh. That why I say. Packaging is everything now. Imagine every record companies trying to throw in all sorts of freebies when U buy CD. Buying CD now is unlike in the past whereby U know in the past Jacky Cheung n the rest is quality assured. U don't need all these freebies to attract consumers.<br><br>-----<br><br>I'm Looking 4 Trouble, where are you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Packaging or not, preference is something that you cannot force. Thus, the comparison is only with reference to your personnal preference. I will always prefer Leslie Cheung to Jeff Chang, Alan Tam to Andy Lau, Sam Hui to Ah Niu.
