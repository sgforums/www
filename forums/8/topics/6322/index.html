            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Alex that by reducing the sticks of cigarettes one smokes does not imply that one will stop smoking altogether. However to quit smoking, it may be more viable and easier to reduce gradually, to give time for the body to adjust. Even if eventually still never quit, at least the harm done to the body is less. The "cold turkey" treatment may be good and effective but then it is not easy to sustain for a smoker.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heeh..... here's a method my friend tried actually. It worked in its own quirky way. Not very well, but it sorta worked.<br><br>Basically, he passed his entire bankbook and ATM card to his mother, and told her to "Do as she sees fit to get him to stop smoking." Instead of letting him have full control of his own finances. (The logic went simply as "If I have money, I can smoke, if I have no $$$, I can't smoke.) So simply, his mother followed what she did during his student days. Giving him a daily allowance of $10 or so for work, and relinquishing control on weekends.<br><br>$10 ?? How the heck is he going to survive ? But well.... what to do... he already passed his ATM card to his mother already, and he didn't want to appear "weak minded", so boh bian.<br><br>So basically, everyday, he comes home for dinner after work. (Since you normally have nothing left after eating breakfast and lunch.) And since he can't afford a pack of smoke unless he wants to go hungry for the rest of the day, he has to ask from colleagues and such.<br><br>Well.... the idea sorta worked, since eventually, his colleagues got irritated with him continuously asking for a free cigarette (they didn't know that he's on a tight rein....) and he was also paiseh to ask.<br><br>He didn't totally get off it, but he smokes lesser now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (I think.....)<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think is possible to quit smokking, is just most smokers dont want to make it happen, as they think smokking is already part of their life, or maybe just cool.<br><br>First of all, i think smokers should think how did they got into smoking. To get attention? To get acceptance in a particular group? Just to be cool? so on..<br><br>Then they should think isit worth doing it, have they get what they wantted. Did the girl accept you? or did your friend actually think you are cool? Most ppl start fagging at a young age, say 12 - 16.. and they cant get rid of it when they past a certain age cause they think is not worth quiting it.<br><br>Some just think "hey im already 18, im legal to smoke" .Most smokers will only quit when 3 things past their life, money, girl/guy, health. Money, not enough money to buy.<br>guy/girl, your bf/gf/husband/wife demand you stop. Health, you got cancle, or other sickness related to ciggy, or someone close to you past away no thanks to ciggy.<br><br>Back to quiting smoking. Although most of my friend smokes.. about 85%, only 2 has succesfully quit smoking. Im 20 this year so there is a very high possibility most of my friend smoke. I dont smoke! those 2 that quit, ofcause there are no guaranty they wont start again. Just 2 that quit, is low %<br>but there is still chance.<br><br>Is just the first step they have to take.<br>Stop buying? Buy less? Get someone to control you? chew gum? so many.. which will work, i dont know. You just have to try if you want to quit. I dont think addiction cant be stop, i have a friend who smoke like 2 packs a day 40 sticks, but smoke less than 5 stick in 2 days while in Singapore. Was it<br>the tight law? or just not many smoking zone? i have no idea what got into his head during the trip, but i know if someone who smoke 40sticks a day can cut it down to less than 5 a day OVERNIGHT, that means there are chance to stop. Just when to make that first step.<br><br>I suggesst the Government make smokking law tigher, increase the price of ciggy, more tax. Why listen to them that their salary is not enough to buy ciggy, those non-smokers are the one that will suffer the most at the end. And this smokers are contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming ultimately.<br><br>ndrew<br><br>------------------<br>im shit, your shit, we are all shit,<br>serious shit!

Look at Deng Xiaoping, the old man smokes more in a day then me in a week!!!( and i m a VERY heavy smoker ) and he bloody live to a ripe old age of 90++...wau lau, best advertisement for cigarette companies.<br>It's all a big conspiracy from the Greens, anti-smokers and the church that we smokers are assaulted on all fronts!!! As a smoker born and bred, i have got a msg to them, F&amp;*% off ass&amp;*##, if u don't like my smoke, get the hell away from me. I don;t like ur breath too, doesn't mean that u have to sit outside the restaurant far away from me!!!<br>I derived extreme pleasure out of smoking and darn if i m going to let some inconsiderate ppl and government stop me from doing so. Hell, i prob. paid the highest income tax in this country due to my hobby of puffing.<br>So, get off my back u non smokers and be darned if i don't outlive all of u guys with *snigger* white lungs out there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>SMOKERS UNITE!!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

I m getting sick of all these kinds of attitude and it's time for me to settle straight the record.<br><br>So get this straight non-smokers, i have got the right to puff as long as the govt don't ban it outright. As for ur measure to narrow down our space tighter and tighter.....i m not scared and and i m not gong down without a fight!!! If u find the sight and smell of puffing disgusting, fine, go ahead and GET LOST cos no one can tell me to stop puffing!!!oh yeah, go back to the authorites u bunch of weaklings and tell them unless they want to lose a substantial amount of tax money from us, they better let us smoke in peace!!!<br><br>SMOKERS UNITE!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
