And someone was bitching at Fann Wong, that's RIGHT again ? Now there's just someone talking about Zoe Tay and that's WRONG ?<br><br>Perhaps all of you are RIGHT !<br>Celebirties like Fann Wong and Ho Yeow San are worth talking and bitching about because of their success. I don't think there'a anything much about Zoe Tay to rave about, she's just over rated. What else is she other than that Gambling woman and that Bobo nonsense in 1995 ?<br><br>Can anyone even mentioned anything else about her ? What chameleon ????? Aiyah, just stop talking about her la, her name also sounds sick.<br></div>
