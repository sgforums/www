            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore are expects to win more medal in the coming SEA games thanks to the imported talents from GuangZhou, Fujian province etc. You see, these athletes have no hopes of representing China in international competition but when they come to Singapore, they can smash our national records with ease and win regional games such as South East Asian Games.<br><br>Of course our regional neighbors like Malaysia are still stuck in the old-fashion thinking that it is worthwhile to train up their own indigenous talents and improve the performance of homegrown athletes through sheer hardwork. Oh what a joke, while they try so hard to spot local talent, train them, nurture them, ....Singapore through its INNOVATIVE foreign athletes import method, beat them like nobody's business.<br><br>Singaporeans can sit back relax and busk in the glory that our imported athletes brings home. Why train so hard? Why sacrifice shopping time, tours, movies and good restaurant food? Singaporeans should give up competitive sports altogether - why? Because you can spend all your time trying to beat your fellow indigenous Singaporeans, then when you think you can represent Singapore, the sports council import someone from GuangZhou and you become the subsitute. Now how stupid will you feel when that happens?<br><br>We, Singaporeans have such good leaders that we get to feel the thrill and glory of victory without much effort, we should sit back and enjoy this success that our leaders have engineered. Other countries are so stupid to try to train their own indigenous talents to win, make all their school children take part in Sports Day to choose local talent.<br><br>We should get rid of Sports Day altogether and call it a Theme Park day whereby the entire school take time off to visit Sentosa or Haw Par Villa.. We can eliminate the agony of defeat by importing the best, and beat our Malaysian/Indonesian sporting rivals with consummate ease.<br></div>

Whats the point in getting any sporting accredition either internationally or regionally. It doesn't make any difference to our wallets or our lifestyle. So what if we produce a Tiger Woods or a David Beckham? He would be the only rich one. His wealth won't be distributed to us. We can busk in his glory... true... but it would only be short lived and never touch our bottom line.<br><br>Moreover Singaporeans are just not very sports minded. We are more concerned about our studies and making money. Sports will never be a priority. We are also a very small nation with only 5 million people. It is very unlikely that we would be able to compete with a country like China (1.2 billion people), USA (500 million) people etc. There is a small talent pool and a small sports market. We can produce from time to time a Mardan, but we can never produce a Tiger Woods.<br><br>Many years ago after Singapore was "thrown" out of the Malaysian Cup.

Sorry dear gahmen, but things like nationalism and pride of our own country + people CANNOT be bought or purchased. </div></blockquote>I didn't quite read what the first post deep enough to fully understand what he was trying to say.<br><br>As a sportsman myself, competitive sports is not all about winning. Those medals, that podium means very little actually, and SHOULD mean little to a true sportsman. Sports doesn't end at the podium, winning should not be seen as the ultimate fate of the trainings.<br><br>It is the process of training itself. Sports is about pushing oneself to the edge of one's performance, through discipline, to push self to the highest standards. To be able to do this alone, as a sportsman, you've already won, you've already earned your own medal. You can't always be the best, for there'll always be someone out there who's more gifted in sports and beat you. Sports should train both the body and mind, should not use unothodox and illegal means to achieve winning.<br><br>By importing foreign talents into our nations and passing them the residentship and representing singapore, what does winning for singapore mean anymore? will singaporeans be proud if those chinese win for us? There's nothing to be proud of, but i'm ashamed. not just ashamed for myself as a sportsman, but also ashamed of this lax attitude of giving up on ourselves and let these chinese beat and smirk at us, ashamed of our nation for knowing nuts about sports, and buying talents to put us into further disgrace.<br><br>ablazegal is right. despite all that efforts, if any, to promote nationalism and cohesion in singapore, outsourcing undermines exactly that.<br><br>instead, should singapore be truly wise, singapore should spend more time and money and effort into our own talents, give them the support required. Speaking of this reminded of an incident that occured during the sea games/olympics sometime ago when jocelyn yeo became indifferent, totally unlike her. instead of talking and supporting her during her downtime, this matter was made public, appearing in every local paper and news. it's obvious that our gahmen is concerned more about 'face' and pride. they know nuts about sports.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What kind of retarded statement is this. I vehemently object to your proposal that we abandon competitive sports altogether. What is the nature of competitive sports? Is the Olympics all about winning? Is the World Cup all about winning? If you think so, i sadly shake my head and blame the government for allowing a shallow and narrow minded fool like you slip through our education system.<br><br>Before you slap me down with what our government is doing to improve sports in singapore, let me first say that this isn't about whether the government is doing the right thing in the first place.<br><br>The true nature of sport is in its competitive nature. The qualities of determination and sportsmanlike conduct is something that can be nurtured through sports. Thus to abandon competitive sports in Singapore is as good as shooting ourselves in the foot. Why? Cause that will only end up in more idiots like you being brought into the world by our society. You are forgetting the very true nature of sport. Remember Eddie the Eel in the Sydney Olympics? I found myself applauding him when I watched him complete his event. And I wasn't alone. Our society already plays too much emphasis on being number one in everything we do and to completely give up competitive sports because we can't become no.1 in sports would just condemn our future generations to becoming narrow and shallow minded morons (like you).<br><br>What of the efforts of our sportsmen? What of the efforts of people like Ang Peng Siong? Fandi Ahmad? Our national bowlers who have topped world rankings before? Were you there to share the glory when Singapore won the Tiger Cup last year? I bet not. What about our waterpolo team that has won every single SEA Games Waterpolo event since its conception? These people are heroes. And you? You're just some whiny fart who probably was always chosen last when people picked teams.<br><br>I shan't even dignify your 'nationalistic' outbursts with a reply because i simply think you are a bigoted and retarded person.</div>

Whats the point in getting any sporting accredition either internationally or regionally. It doesn't make any difference to our wallets or our lifestyle. So what if we produce a Tiger Woods or a David Beckham? He would be the only rich one. His wealth won't be distributed to us. We can busk in his glory... true... but it would only be short lived and never touch our bottom line.<br><br>Moreover Singaporeans are just not very sports minded. We are more concerned about our studies and making money. Sports will never be a priority. We are also a very small nation with only 5 million people. It is very unlikely that we would be able to compete with a country like China (1.2 billion people), USA (500 million) people etc. There is a small talent pool and a small sports market.

But don't you worry. I shall address your silly post now.<br><br>You are even worse than caramon. First of all. Singapore did not get thrown out of the M League. We left. Because we refused to accede to their request to allow them to collect a bigger percentage in gate receipts.<br><br>I don't even know where to begin hammering you. You just reek of the stench of the failure of our society to give you a good upbringing. All you care about is moneymoneymoneymoneymoney. You say that the money spent on improving football in singapore could have been better spent on the needy in singapore. I say that only you and TT Durai would share that opinion. Think about it you stupid retard. What did you learn in sec school human geography? It is not enough for a society to be economically strong. We must be socially and morally strong as well. If we throw all our efforts to becoming only economically strong, then we are even poorer than the poor.  And Singapore soccer is not worse than before. OPEN YOUR EYES. WHAT DID WE JUST ACCOMPLISH IN THE TIGER CUP? FLUKE? NO I DON'T THINK SO.<br><br>If you think our population is a stumbling block, then tell that to the Swiss. They've got a population that's 3 million more than us and they've got a former world no. 1 tennis player. They've got soccer teams that made EPL teams sweat it out in the Champions League. Yes they may have a bigger population, but please don't tell me that the 3 million extra that we don't have is the difference. Oh now i can hear you say "but they are ang moh what". Ang moh so what? Tell that to Fandi Ahmad who went to Holland to play footy before Park Ji Sung even kicked a ball.  Yah ang mohs are naturally bigger and stronger, requisites which make up a good sportsman. But so what? You can be big. You can be strong. But if you have no heart, you might as well not bother. And from what you've wrote, I can see you have absolutely no heart and determination. Throwing in the towel even before you try. What kind of spirit is that? Where did you learn that from? Tell me where.. so that when I have kids of my own in future, I will make sure they avoid the path that you took.<br><br>Oh by the way... did daddy teach you how to kick a ball? I guess not. How sad.</div>
