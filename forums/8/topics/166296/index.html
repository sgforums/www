I am different cuz I come from the era where cane is prevalently used by parents and teachers. During my era, teachers already can use cane. Caning is not an exclusive act to be done by the discipline master or principals.<br><br>Look at our era kids, didn't we grow up to be more obedient as compared to the present crop of kids who dare to challenge teacher to fight and verbal abuse and threatening suicide etc etc methods?<br><br>I believe cane should be reinstated to instil law and order.
