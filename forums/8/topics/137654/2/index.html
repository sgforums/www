Most people know that long aerobic exercises like running is catabolic (muscle loss). That is why long distance runners areÂ….skinny. HIIT will burn your fats and yet not losing as much muscles as other cardio exercises. All sprinters incorporate HIIT in their training program and they are muscular and yet having very little body fat.<br><br>HIIT is performing a cardio exercise such as running at a very high intensity then at a lower intensity and repeating the cycle again and again. It can be very gruesome and beginners are advised to take it slowly at their own fitness levels until they build up better stamina. You can perform it on a stationary bike, StairMaster, mountain bike, treadmill etc. But the most efficient for fat burning and stamina building is running.<br><br>A common interval training program is the slow jog-fast sprint interval training. Warm up and stretch thoroughly before you commence HIIT. Then start out with a 1 minute jog / 1 minute sprint as fast as you can. For beginners, you can try 2 min jog then 1 minute sprint or adjust the cycle to suit your stamina. For more challenge, try to sprint up hills or inclines and slow jog down. Or use the 30sec/30sec cycle instead of 1 min each.<br><br>Perform HIIT 4 to 5 times a week for 20-30 minutes and watch your fats melt away fast. Do weight lifting exercises in between HIIT days and eat correctly for greater results and a fantastic body.<br><br>Remember, it has to be intense during the sprint phase for it to be very effective. Otherwise, it will just be another cardio exercise you see people doing day in and day out without any real results. You should be extremely tired, sweating profusely, huffing and puffing when you are done. If you are not, you have not been performing HIIT correctly.<br><br>As your stamina improves, you can lengthen the time on sprinting and shorten the time for the slow jog. For variations, you can adjust the timing and speed frequently. You can also prevent boredom by choosing different locations for a change of scenery and freshness rather than be on the treadmill all the time.<br><br>Interval training is a fun and excellent way to burn fats while building endurance. It beats the monotony of jogging and yet getting much better results.<br><br>You are advised to get your doctor's clearance before you start doing HIITs for it can be very grueling especially for the beginner. But when your stamina builds up, you will enjoy the power that HIIT exercises can give you.<br><br>Try it! You can almost see the fats melting away right before your eyes. <span style="font-style: italic;">SFO</span><br><br>Author: Chris Chew<br><br><a href="http://www.sgfitnessonline.com" rel="nofollow">www.sgfitnessonline.com</a><br><br>[/url]</div>
