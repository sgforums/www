That's just 20 years of HIV we've lived with. Humans haven't really changed much since then.<br><br>I'm just saying, when you take into account the long period of time humans have managed to stay sane without HIV keeping them from humping the nearest mammal compared to the last 2 decades of HIV scare, you can pretty much predict in all certainty that the elimination of HIV will not destroy the basic family structure as boka claims.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I think Boka, you are not thinking ahead. You are only thinking about the current issues, which is people is having casual sex. However, have you think about this?<br><br>Our younger generation nowadays are having sex at a younger age and this younger age gets lower each year. When I'm talking about younger generation, I'm not only talking about Singapore but the world.<br><br>So, if X gets his/her first sex at the age of maybe 17, what's make you think he/she will not have another sex maybe a few months later? If X were to have sex at such a young age, the risk of getting infected with HIV will become higher as the time goes.<br><br>Think about this, if majority of our younger generation do this, in future, every people you see on the street will be infected with HIV and the thought of it is indeed frighteningly.<br><br>This problem can no longer be controlled, scare tactics like HIV is no longer working effective on this young generation. Schools recognised this problem thats why they started to teach their students about condoms and other protective measures, in the past this were considered like a taboo and not taught in school.<br><br>Younger generation this day do not think about consequences before they act and the problem is even after doing the act, they still do not reflect about the consequences.<br><br>You mentioned that if a cure for HIV were to be found, people will start to have casual sex without giving a thought for consequences.<br><br>However, I would like to point out that it might not be what you think it is. Why? I presume that the cure for HIV would not be like cough syrup, where you can get it over the counter. I also presume that the cure for HIV would not be cheap AND the cure for HIV is not 100% effective.<br><br>If your idea is to use HIV for sex deterrence, with or without cure it would still work. Why? The availability of the cure, the price of the cure and the effectiveness of the cure. No cure is perfect, the disease might still come back.<br><br>Plus, think about those innocent newborn babies who gotten HIV from their mothers, don't you think they deserve a chance to live in this world for they done nothing wrong?<br><br>Also, think about those people (man or woman) who got HIV because they are raped? Do you think they deserve it? Do you really think they deserve to be raped?<br><br>What about those who got infected with HIV because of blood transfusion?<br><br>Boka, your mind is only set to see what you can see in front of you, you should broaden your mindset, look further away and not just HIV for sex deterrence. A cure for HIV = save many innocent lifes.</div>

Sick ppl die, Healthy ppl develop the immunity AFTER they recover and pass it on. Your precious society is the one that's been preventing the latter from happening. We stopped evolving in most ways a long time ago. Go look up the basics of evolution first, k?<br><br>[boka]Time and time again u proved to be an idiot.<br>HIV is a natural thing that would happen if humans partake in casual sex.<br>The reason why HIV is here is because casual sex among humans was not meant to take place in the beginning.<br>If causal sex is ok and what nature wants us to do and as u said for gene diversification then why is mother nature infecting humans with a deadly virus when her sole purpose from your point of view is to diversify the race?<br><br>Nature immunity and artificial immunity is different.<br>Again u compares apple and orange.<br>Evolution is about being better IN THE NATURAL WAY.<br>If sick animal dies and strong animal lives in a natural competition then that is called evolution.<br>However, when u inject and animal/human with a vaccine and they live,u consider them STRONG?<br>Like I said u are stupid.<br>If I were to help a lion bleeding to death and it survive, IS THAT CALLED SURVIVAL OF THE FITESS?<br><br>WE STOPPED EVOLVING A LONG TIME AGO?<br>DO U KNOW THE TRUE MEANING OF EVOlVING?<br>EVOLUTION IS CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE AND IT EVEN NOW WE HUMANS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION.<br>THERE ARE NO RESULT OF EVOLUTION BECAUSE IT TAKES PLACE CONSTANTLY.<br>WE EVOLVE TO ADAPT.<br>AS THE EARTH WARMS UP AND ENVIROMENTAL CHANGES OCCUR,WE HUmANS WILL EVOLVE TO ADAPT TO THE ENVIROMENT[LESSER HAIRS AND LARGE SWEAT GLANDS IN SOME WAYS]<br><br>GO READ UP ON BIOLOGY 101 IDIOT.<br><br>[deathbait]<br>--Because a cure will lead to an increase in casual sex, fuck the HIV infected. We don't need no stinking cure.<br><br>What cult are you in again?<br><br>I shall repeat my points for sake of clarity.<br><br>1) casual sex is not a bad result in the bigger scheme of things. It leads to diversification of the gene pool, which is always a good hedging mechanism.<br><br>[boka]WOW!<br>IF PEOPLE PARTAKE IN CASUAL SEX FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIVERSIYING THE GENE POOL THEN WHY ARE THEY USING CONDOMS AND OTHER CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS TO PREVENT PREGNANCY?<br>TRY TO PULL THAT OFF IDIOT!<br><br>2) On the family level, you have no need to worry about cures of HIV leading to casual sex unless your family is already unstable. In which case, the existance of a HIV cure is the least of your worries<br><br>3) Societies with strong family ties(arguably stronger than the current era) have been built in the past with no threat of HIV at all. To suggest that the elimination of HIV will break down the family structure of society is to deny all existance of proof readily available.<br><br>[me]This is more than just family ties.<br>We live in a society and not just within our family.<br><br>4) The monogamy is/was not always the only family structure in the world. Just because your society practices a system of monogamy does not mean it is natural, nor does it mean it has to stay that way lest civilization as we know it collapse around us. In fact, monogamy is an unnatural result of humans having outgrown their primal needs.<br><br>5) you are an idiot. Stop worrying about how to deny cures to the terminally ill and start worrying about your mom's infidelity. I assume that's why you're so insecure about family ties. No? In that case, just stop worrying.[/b][/quote]<br><br>[boka]Personal attacks?<br><br></div>

I also presume that the cure for HIV would not be cheap AND the cure for HIV is not 100% effective.<br><br>If your idea is to use HIV for sex deterrence, with or without cure it would still work. Why? The availability of the cure, the price of the cure and the effectiveness of the cure. No cure is perfect, the disease might still come back.<br><br>Plus, think about those innocent newborn babies who gotten HIV from their mothers, don't you think they deserve a chance to live in this world for they done nothing wrong?<br><br>Also, think about those people (man or woman) who got HIV because they are raped? Do you think they deserve it? Do you really think they deserve to be raped?<br><br>What about those who got infected with HIV because of blood transfusion?<br><br>Boka, your mind is only set to see what you can see in front of you, you should broaden your mindset, look further away and not just HIV for sex deterrence. A cure for HIV = save many innocent lifes.</div></blockquote>i'm making a darn simple point here.<br>My fear or issue here is not the increase in no. of HIV carrier if the cure is not found.<br>My issue is there will be more people discarding morality and having casual sex because the risk if no longer there.</div>
