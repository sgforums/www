            <div class='col-md body'>[Posted by deathbait]<br><br>Â…..<br><br>This is how evolution(in this case, natural selection) works. Sick ppl die, Healthy ppl develop the immunity AFTER they recover and pass it on. Your precious society is the one that's been preventing the latter from happening. We stopped evolving in most ways a long time ago. Go look up the basics of evolution first, k?<br><br>[boka]Time and time again u proved to be an idiot.<br>HIV is a natural thing that would happen if humans partake in casual sex.<br>The reason why HIV is here is because casual sex among humans was not meant to take place in the beginning.<br>If causal sex is ok and what nature wants us to do and as u said for gene diversification then why is mother nature infecting humans with a deadly virus when her sole purpose from your point of view is to diversify the race?<br><br>Nature immunity and artificial immunity is different.<br>Again u compares apple and orange.<br>Evolution is about being better IN THE NATURAL WAY.<br>If sick animal dies and strong animal lives in a natural competition then that is called evolution.<br>However, when u inject and animal/human with a vaccine and they live,u consider them STRONG?<br>Like I said u are stupid.<br>If I were to help a lion bleeding to death and it survive, IS THAT CALLED SURVIVAL OF THE FITESS?<br><br>WE STOPPED EVOLVING A LONG TIME AGO?<br>DO U KNOW THE TRUE MEANING OF EVOlVING?<br>EVOLUTION IS CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE AND IT EVEN NOW WE HUMANS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION.<br>THERE ARE NO RESULT OF EVOLUTION BECAUSE IT TAKES PLACE CONSTANTLY.<br>WE EVOLVE TO ADAPT.<br>AS THE EARTH WARMS UP AND ENVIROMENTAL CHANGES OCCUR,WE HUmANS WILL EVOLVE TO ADAPT TO THE ENVIROMENT[LESSER HAIRS AND LARGE SWEAT GLANDS IN SOME WAYS]<br><br>GO READ UP ON BIOLOGY 101 IDIOT.<br><br>[deathbait]<br>--Because a cure will lead to an increase in casual sex, fuck the HIV infected. We don't need no stinking cure.<br><br>What cult are you in again?<br><br>I shall repeat my points for sake of clarity.<br><br>1) casual sex is not a bad result in the bigger scheme of things. It leads to diversification of the gene pool, which is always a good hedging mechanism.<br><br>[boka]WOW!<br>IF PEOPLE PARTAKE IN CASUAL SEX FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIVERSIYING THE GENE POOL THEN WHY ARE THEY USING CONDOMS AND OTHER CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS TO PREVENT PREGNANCY?<br>TRY TO PULL THAT OFF IDIOT!<br><br>2) On the family level, you have no need to worry about cures of HIV leading to casual sex unless your family is already unstable. In which case, the existance of a HIV cure is the least of your worries<br><br>3) Societies with strong family ties(arguably stronger than the current era) have been built in the past with no threat of HIV at all. To suggest that the elimination of HIV will break down the family structure of society is to deny all existance of proof readily available.<br><br>[me]This is more than just family ties.<br>We live in a society and not just within our family.<br><br>4) The monogamy is/was not always the only family structure in the world. Just because your society practices a system of monogamy does not mean it is natural, nor does it mean it has to stay that way lest civilization as we know it collapse around us. In fact, monogamy is an unnatural result of humans having outgrown their primal needs.<br><br>5) you are an idiot. Stop worrying about how to deny cures to the terminally ill and start worrying about your mom's infidelity. I assume that's why you're so insecure about family ties. No? In that case, just stop worrying.[/b][/quote]<br><br>[boka]Personal attacks?<br><br></div>

Mother nature is a fairy tale told to kids. Nature is red in tooth and claw. There is no grand plan. We will die out to HIV, or evolve to survive. If we are to evolve to survive, gene diversification is how to do it. Get the cycle now?<br><br>2) Because we're not looking to diversify our genes. The goals of the herd is not the goal of the individual.

Which, in simple term, also means you are using HIV as a casual sex deterrence isn't it? After all, this sentence of yours appear in this HIV thread.<br><br>Regarding your worry, I already addressed it in one way or another. Anyway, I will quote it out for easy reference.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by furb:<br>Our younger generation nowadays are having sex at a younger age and this younger age gets lower each year. When I'm talking about younger generation, I'm not only talking about Singapore but the world.<br><br>So, if X gets his/her first sex at the age of maybe 17, what's make you think he/she will not have another sex maybe a few months later? If X were to have sex at such a young age, the risk of getting infected with HIV will become higher as the time goes.<br><br>Think about this, if majority of our younger generation do this, in future, every people you see on the street will be infected with HIV and the thought of it is indeed frighteningly.<br><br>This problem can no longer be controlled, scare tactics like HIV is no longer working effective on this young generation. Schools recognised this problem thats why they started to teach their students about condoms and other protective measures, in the past this were considered like a taboo and not taught in school.[/b]</blockquote>This I'm trying to tell you that whether is there HIV or not and more people discarding morality or not, casual sex is already happening and it is showing sign of increase. So it doesn't really matter will there be more people discarding their morality or not because even with HIV, more and more people are doing it and can no longer be stopped.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by furb:<br>However, I would like to point out that it might not be what you think it is. Why? I presume that the cure for HIV would not be like cough syrup, where you can get it over the counter. I also presume that the cure for HIV would not be cheap AND the cure for HIV is not 100% effective.<br><br>If your idea is to use HIV for sex deterrence, with or without cure it would still work. Why? The availability of the cure, the price of the cure and the effectiveness of the cure. No cure is perfect, the disease might still come back.[/b]</blockquote>Regarding about people have casual sex because risk is no longer there, as I mentioned above, with or without cure, there is still a risk and most likely the cure would be costly. Taking a cure is like taking a gamble, 2 outcomes, either you win or you lose. People still die from having fever when there is cure for fever, do you see what I mean? So, if X's mind is set to have casual sex, it doesn't really matter is there HIV or is there cure for HIV.<br><br>X can always use a condom, it also help reduce chance of getting HIV. After all, what is the difference between chance of getting HIV when using a condom and chance of cure failing when you have HIV? Its the same, all in all, it is still risk. So, it doesn't matter is there cure for HIV, no cure? Use condom instead!<br><br>P.S - I'm not pointing out is cure for HIV good or bad, I'm just trying to point out that Boka's decision about cure for HIV is bad because of the above reasons is, how should I say it, pointless?<br></div>
