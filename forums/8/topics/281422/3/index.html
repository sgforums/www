You see.. "..protection of(for) those who can't protect themselves.." How do the law protect? Infringement of law leads to punishments.. Existence of some punishments acts as a deterrence for potential wrong do-ers.. Fear of getting caught.. Hence, "never" shouldn't be used there..

            <div class='col-md body'>with or without HIV, people will still engage in casual sex as long as there is demand, there will be supply. Yes, with the cure for HIV, i definitely feel that the numbers of casual sex will go up, but as long as it does not affect others, I dun see whats wrong with casual sex. Currently casual sex is deem as wrong because,<br><br>1)STDs are on the loose<br>2)Unfaithful to life long partners<br>3)Certain moral values/religion<br><br>For 1 and 2, it directly affects another person. e.g. the husband went out to have casual sex and contracted HIV. Without knowing, he spreaded the virus to his wife and family the next day through blood or sex. Does his family have to pay for his wrongdoings? If the husband or wife are not faithful to each other, even if there is not HIV or STDs, they will engage in casual sex with others. The deterrance should lie in the commitment and love for each other and not fear of having HIV.<br><br>For those who object the cure of HIVs, do you mean you currently do not engage in casual sex because you're afraid of getting HIV? You do not cheat your husband/wife/bf/gf because you fear HIV?<br><br>The invention of dynamites is widely used for construction, demolishing buildings to construct new ones, making those inaccessible accessible and many others. People in the past walk around or climb mountains to get over the other side, this is time consuming and dangerous, the use of dynamites flattens the mountain to provide direct access which used to be the other side of the mountain.<br><br>At the same time, it is also used by terrorist for suicide bombings and laying the groundwork for war. Like the cure for HIV, is the invention of dynamites should not be invented at all?<br><br>Just some food for thought and pointing out certain important questions to consider. Please do not get agitated over this.</div>

If you wanna assume, make sure assume correctly..<br><br><span style="color: red;">Why would you want to carry a HIV around? It just leads to discriminations and many more social effects. If you'r an employer, would you hire an HIV carrier? Are you able to choose a higher path when you found out the person you love has HIV? Prostitution whether female or male is driven by desperation due to lack of money and jobless, having HIVs totally block off your only other way from earning money besides begging considering the law of Singapore.</span><br><br>Find a post of mine in this thread which explicitly says that I am against a cure for HIV..<br><br><span style="color: red;">You do not need to explicitly say "I love you" to let the other person know you like him/her. Actions, signs such as a little extra attention and care to the other person would be enough(this usually also includes a few passerbys who can tell you like that person). Thus, you do not need to explicitly say "I'm against the cure" to let me know you are because we humans can analyse and infer. If I'm wrong about you, then I'll apologise now in advance.</span><br><br>I merely state the possible effects of such an event.. Whether it should be allowed, that is is all about cost benefits my friend..<br><br><span style="color: red;">Understood..</span><br><br>There are people who live on a normal life with HIV by the way..<br><br><span style="color: red;">Yes, but given the availability of a cure, would you want to live a normal life with HIV or normal life AND HIV-free considering the effects I've stated above?</span><br><br>It is a cruel world that we live in. Nothing in this world is perfect. That actually makes up the colours of life..<br><br><span style="color: red;">Very agree, but we should also strive to do our best knowing it wouldn't be perfect, but the very least, be the best. If we have the ability to cure HIV, we should do it. Even if like someone just said, a cure found may lead to many more new disease, if we stop now, we're letting those with HIV now, just rot and die. Would you like it if you had HIV now and people can cure you but they choose not to because that will allow others to go on a sex rampage? As long as we continue to strive to do our best, nothing will be too great for us to take on. This should be the colours of life.</span><br><br>What if there is a cure for every disease in the world, and an elixir of immortality had been developed. Hmm.. hmm??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: red;">A cure for every disease looks great to me, but we do not just die from diseases. We will still die to accidents, age or if we kill ourselves, it is just 1 less way to die, 1 less thing for our loved ones to worry about which is supposed to mean its good. The elixir of immortality may take away you form the jaws of death, but there is something call the 'living hell'. I wouldn't really want to live forever if I'm a bankrupt especially in Singapore. The Earth will be overpopulated, since no one dies and no HIVs to curb the high sex drives if you like to think it this way, else food, air, clothes and etc will be insufficient. I know you won't die from hunger or cold because you have no clothes to block the wind, but certainly you do not want to live forever feeling cold everyday or hungry(I'll miss the good food). Therefore, these will be the places we will working on if the elixir of immortality is invented, that should be our colors of life by then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br></div></blockquote></div>
