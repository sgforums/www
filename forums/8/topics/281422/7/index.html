It smacks of religious fanatism. HIV is not a punishment brought on us by defying laws set by some mysterious entity. It's a virus. They occur naturally in the wild. How hard is it to understand.<br><br>2) i can't reply because your statement here is absurd. Why can't both be mutually true? To say that HIV cannot occur if casual sex were not the natural way of things is to say that broken limbs simply cannot happen because we were meant to run around. Repeat after me. The existance of HIV has nothing to do with humans. It's an epidemic, and much like flu, we have not found a way to shut it down yet. If HIV is indeed a punishment for casual sex, what's flu? A punishment for breathing?<br><br>3) The reason this has spanned so many pages is because you refuse to acknowledge that diseases can happen naturally. It's not a punishment from . Vulnerability to a viruses is not uncommon. This just happens to be pretty deadly. As a species, gene diversification is good. How hard are these things to understand?<br><br>4) I have thus far simply refused to reply to your questions because they make no sense in the first place. Please apply some logical thinking to your points before you post them.<br><br>I'm not sure what your qualifications are, but i'm pretty sure you never took the biology 101 you keep bringing up.</div>
