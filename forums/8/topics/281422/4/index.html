Unfortunately , you are 1 voice. So instead if u want to make changes , spread your word out. Gather you support and be in position of power. if a cure is really found and that u are still alive , and if not.. ur thoughts echoes in the minds of millions of like minded people like you ,then u can speak up n stop this cure from reaching the tens and millions infected HIV kids around the world who never had a chance to stop themselves being born with it and denied the cure... that is found. But u may think they will die anyway and perhaps go to heaven , but during the time of thier suffering till death ?But well, thats that for the cure of HIV issue.<br><br>We will always try to save another life. Science will try to overcome the near impossible. I say near impossible , because if its impossible , i wouldnt even mention it. Like all disease there will be new STD diseases, more deadly.. and it will forever be there , and inflict the fear . So in the end , we cant stop casual sex , our principles or what is right and wrong and what was once banned now allowed is changing.<br><br>Well, u have explained urself well enough to why you dont want the cure of HIV , as it will cause social degradation. But i can tell u.. the cure when its out .. its gonna go public. And $$$$ can buy cure.<br><br></div>

They can explain everything away because when things start to not make sense, they claim it's all god's plan.<br><br>ok let's tackle this slowly. Complex ideas seem not to penetrate your skull, so let's start small.<br><br>1) you spoke of animals not getting stds. Let's do a quick google and find out if what you said was true. SURPRISE! Your claim was false. Why am i not surprised.<br><br>2) "Humans have a tendency to take things for granted i am very sure humans will begin to discard morals standing.<br>"<br>Oh this one is a winner by itself. You wish to deprieve dying ppl of the cure just because YOU are sure of what will result from it.<br><br>3) "I hate to believe in a superior being but it seems that it make sense that in the bible,GOD made it that humans stay faithful to their spouse. "<br><br>God did nothing of that sort in the bible. Are you even allowed to misquote the bible?<br><br>4) "Scientifically,if making multiply sex partner to diversify our gene pool seem logical then why hasn't evolution and mother nature allow our body to be immune to the HIV virus?<br>U don't make sense. "<br><br>This is how evolution(in this case, natural selection) works. Sick ppl die, Healthy ppl develop the immunity AFTER they recover and pass it on. Your precious society is the one that's been preventing the latter from happening. We stopped evolving in most ways a long time ago. Go look up the basics of evolution first, k?<br><br>5) "In nature,ethinicity doesn't count. "<br><br>ok this is so stupid i don't think i need to elaborate. Diversification...ethnicity...these two words...can you possibly link them together?<br><br>6) "In truth,Mother nature doesn't say to a Kitten to bonk another white creamy colour male kitten just to have a more beautiful off spring.<br>Rather it tells the kitten to go for the Alpha male.<br>"<br><br>Wrong, in domestic cats, there is no alpha male. Not all animals have a social ladder.<br><br>I gotta hand it to you. Your supposed beliefs seem to tend towards this idea:<br><br>--Because a cure will lead to an increase in casual sex, fuck the HIV infected. We don't need no stinking cure.<br><br>What cult are you in again?<br><br>I shall repeat my points for sake of clarity.<br><br>1) casual sex is not a bad result in the bigger scheme of things. It leads to diversification of the gene pool, which is always a good hedging mechanism.<br><br>2) On the family level, you have no need to worry about cures of HIV leading to casual sex unless your family is already unstable. In which case, the existance of a HIV cure is the least of your worries<br><br>3) Societies with strong family ties(arguably stronger than the current era) have been built in the past with no threat of HIV at all. To suggest that the elimination of HIV will break down the family structure of society is to deny all existance of proof readily available.<br><br>4) The monogamy is/was not always the only family structure in the world. Just because your society practices a system of monogamy does not mean it is natural, nor does it mean it has to stay that way lest civilization as we know it collapse around us. In fact, monogamy is an unnatural result of humans having outgrown their primal needs.<br><br>5) you are an idiot. Stop worrying about how to deny cures to the terminally ill and start worrying about your mom's infidelity. I assume that's why you're so insecure about family ties. No? In that case, just stop worrying.</div>
