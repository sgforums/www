The existance of HIV has nothing to do with humans.<span style="color: red;"> It's an epidemic, and much like flu, we have not found a way to shut it down yet.

They found the SIV to be very similar to HIV-1.   The theory was that hunters in Africa hunted and ate chimpanzees which is infected with this virus, and the SIV which came in contact with humans, began to mutate or adapt, and became HIV.  If you read the literature on HIV, one of the reasons why scientists are having a hard time finding a vaccine or cure for HIV, is that the virus mutate very quickly to overcome any kind of vaccine or cure they came up with.<br><br>This is what the scientists are fearful of virus in animals that are yet to attack humans.  Virus is good at mutating or adapting itself, and thus when humans come in close contact with animals, it may mutate and infect humans.  One example was SARS virus.  The virus does not kill the civet cats, but when humans come in contact with them (they eat civet cats in China), the virus infect humans, mutate, and became a very infectious and deadly disease.<br><br>Now the scientists are worried about the bird flu.  In the beginning, the H5N1 virus was not able to cross from birds to humans.  Now some strain are able to do that.  We are lucky that the bird flu virus has yet to mutate or adapt to cross from humans to humans.  When that happened, it is going to be deadlier than SARS.</div>

I thought for SARS, the mortality rate is 10% for those under 65, and up to 50% for those over 65.<br><br>It is true that flu kills 22,000 in the US every year, 400,000 worldwide, but SARS is a far greater potential threat, because of its higher mortality rate even though in most cases it is not as highly infectious as in superspreaders.<br><br>Perhaps now scientists are more familiar with SARS and able to contain it if it appears again.  But whenever there is a new disease, the potential for it to be a killer is very high.   For example, the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 killed more people than the first world war. Estimates vary but some believe as many as half a billion people were infected of which 30 million died.<br><br>This is what makes bird flu so worrisome; if it mutates and gain the ability spread from humans to humans, it could be the next big killer disease.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome<br><br>from the article:<br><br>Mortality by age group as of 8 May 2003 is below 1% for people aged 24 or younger, 6% for those 25 to 44, 15% in those 45 to 64 and more than 50% for those over 65.<br><br>actually, whenever there is a new disease, the potential killing power is low. It's just that most of them pass by unnoticed. The occasional failed mutation(which kills ppl fast) gets the most notice because they actually kill their host.<br><br>Worrying about new strains of disease is a losing game. You never know when the next fatal one will come, and even if you do, prevention can only take place AFTER the fact. Which is why solving existent problems should be at the top of our priority lists.
