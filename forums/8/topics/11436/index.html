Changing is difficult for most people, if you can find someone who can really change to suit you, then you better treasure him/her. Otherwise, either you're willing to compromise, or you just have to end the relationship.<br><br>As for your question about whether guys can be less possessive? A simple answer would be yes, but very rarely, simply because it is difficult to change.<br><br>One thing I do observe is sometimes, if a guy do that, then he's being possesive, if he doesn't do that, he's being uncaring. So, I guess it depends on the girl. Some girls want more attention, some want more freedom.<br><br>But I guess your friend's bf IS possessive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

It is of course possible for a guy to change for a girl. I myself have learnt to control my temper a lot because of my love for my gf. But please don't let this distract you from the fact that loving somebody means accepting all his/her flaws and virtues. You love somebody for what he/she is, not what you want him/her to be. Ultimately, imposing your will on your partner will only cause unhappiness for both.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
