            <div class='col-md body'>and here we are laughing at those 3 people who got robbed in JB.<br><br>Even in our own place, we are chickens.<br><br>It is not about eating or drinking in the MRT, it is about rules and responsibility.<br><br>Imagine spilling your coke? or dropping your fries?<br><br>Yes, for a  mother feeding a baby milk, or someone in a cough, taking a lozenges, I am okie, but plain eating. I am just amazed.<br><br>During my time, I was at AMK train stn, and these two St Nic gals came in with bubble tea and they drank it in front of the MRT guy, so this MRT guy just looked away. And he is working in Bishan MRT. I am just appalled.<br><br>What should we do? blow the whistle or not?<br><br>so one day, you got mistaken for someone, got beaten by 10guys, and every one just watched and later some kind souls called the ambulance. 1hr later, police called your family, to ask them to go to the morgue.<br><br>So the question comes, should anyone stand up? Yes or not?<br><br></div>

Usually, examples are taking medicine, drinking plain water from a carrier bottle, baby drinking from a milk bottle, popping a sweet into your mouth etc.<br><br>Anything along that line should be fine.<br><br>Eating breakfast on the train (any form of breakfast for that matter) should not be practiced and should be treated as a violation. (inset: prompting for citizen's duty to tell the errant guy off).<br><br>Worst kind is parents giving food to their kids on the train. These families should be THROWN OUT by their fellow commuters.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
