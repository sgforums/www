            <div class='col-md body'>when i was young, i sat on the bus with a bag of french fries i wanted to bring home and eat. i never open it but the smell of the fries was already in the air! i was hungry and i thought, "just eat one frie and stop!" i ate one. then i couldn't stop.<br>french fries are like that de ma.<br>i think the students you saw also didn't mean to...<br>ok la. but i think the "no food and drinks" in trains/buses is absolutely necessary. if not, our public transport would be so dirty.<br>don't get so worked up over the minority la. and i think it's a really small minority.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We have been debutting over here over the rights and wrongs of eating in the station and trains, but end of the day, it's still up to SMRT and SBST to enforce the "no eating and drinking" regulations.<br><br>It's just like they have security officers doing random checks to bags and patrolling the stations, but most of the times, station personnels and security officers closed one eye on these even they see it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
