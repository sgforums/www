Examples would be more fur, white color... etc... As these animals adapt, their next generation gets modified accordingly... Does what they're exposed to alter their DNA in certain ways so that information could be passed down to the next generations? If so, how does that happen?<br><br>Some background knowledge&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br>Hmm I remember I spent like 20mins composing and typing my answer but it didnÂ’t came out. Anyway there are some things to be made clear first. Genetic mutation is unrepaired damaged DNA. Damage can be caused by anything from UV radiation and chemicals.

In fact if not for the repair mechanism, the process by which DNA is Â“copied?the error frequency would be ard 100 times more often(cant remember the exact figure) the mutation can be very minor, some unable to cause physical damage . why is this so, I will explain if u ask.<br><br>When an animal is first exposed to a new env condition, it tries its best to survive by hiding in shelters,etc. now, as u probably know, sperms and eggs(ova or ovum) leads to development of an offspring in animals. Lets say human DNA, there are 23pairs of chromosomes, 1 pair frm father 1 frm mother. In the process of meiosis, sperms/ova are produced but since they need to fuse for life to be created, each only contain 23 chromosomes, and during the process, there would be some Â‘twisting?of the 2 strands of the double helix DNA.<br>Imagine this, u have 2 rules of equal length. 1 metal, 1 plastic. Cut a 5cm portion in the center of each ruler and swop the postions. This is an analogy of what happens. It is Â‘swopping?of regions of DNA that leads to genetic diversity between the offspring and explains why no 2 childern are identical unless genetically-identical twins, not to mention the world.<br>So what happens is out of the 4 offsprings, only 1 has more fur to survive a cold climate. 2 are normal, the last 1 has a gene defect, dies within days of birth. This means that the 1 with more fur would be able to survive to fish or have enuf fat reserve to keep warmÂ…wahtever?when 2 mates goes into mating, there is a selection process, in which only the genes useful for surviving in a given condition will be passed down, useless ones are discared and lost in the past.<br>Of course this does not happen in 3 days, it takes a looooooooooong time. Of course u cant throw a naked human into the artic and hope he will survive for another 10 years.<br>Step 2 of this selection process, when there is a pool of mates, some weaker some stronger, the stronger mates will have their own offspring, this will lead to even better offsprings because of the genes u have for selection. Something like,  u ask 2 tailors to come down. 1 sells silk suits another sells sarong. Comparing to 2 tailors, 1 selling silk suits and another selling gucci pants. Which would look better?<br><br>So answer to yr question part 1, yes but not directly. Genetic material is not 8 Days. U cannot change things as u like in a matter of minutes.<br>Now this is known as survival of the fittest in the evolution. Nothing can be spared from it . The ones that are spared from it are dead already.<br>Sidetrack abit ( or maybe I already sidetrack), the reason why u and I are born to this world is to propagate our species, in short, u are born and designed to produce more children.<br><br>Sometimes things could be as simple as gene regulation. there are some genes present in yr body tht is not switched Â‘on? Why? Simple, producing every protein structure encoded in yr genes are a total waste of energy, time and building materials for yr proteins(amino acids) then if something stimulates the production of such a protein, then it will be built. Ok in the case of blind croc, maybe for a long time there is no light, so 2 crocs, 1 normal 1 blind. The normal 1 cant seeÂ…dies..cant find food. The blind 1,relies on senses since it knows it cant see. Hence more sensitive to others. Soon it realises?hey I donÂ’t need eyes?switches off some genes for the eyes.yes u still have eyesÂ…but not functional.<br><br>To sum it all up, if u are exposed to harsh conditions and it mutates yr genetic material, u will try to repair it. If cant repair, start praying it is a positive change and it is for the better of yr species.<br><br>2. Some plants grow by the seasons... How does that happen? Is it much DNA related?<br><br>Thank god this question didnÂ’t appear in my exams last sem. Anyway u must understand when seasons change, it does not mean a change or wardrobe, to the plants it means a change in environmental conditions like temperature, amount of sunlight, amount of water,etc<br>To be honest, for this topic, I didnÂ’t learn frm lectures, so maybe whistar can explain it better<br>All these are stimulus.

Feel free to ask, because my favourite module is molecular biology.<br>Actually maybe u can post what u know abt genetics,DNA etc. then we know what to say and what not to go into detail since u already know.<br>DonÂ’t be shy to say u dun understand anything I have said, everyone starts somewhere. I was blur like hell last year.<br></div></blockquote>wa.... you are great ... Are you  alway first in class?</div>

(assuming that it's of a much bigger size like example a human...) My real question all this while is... Would such a response trigger a change in the DNA nature of an individual? And this is what I meant by a more 'constructed mutation' and not through a rather random mechanism? One more point to add... It seems highly unlikely that crocodiles which lived in the same swamp would result in more or less the same kind of mutation if it's a 'random mutation'?<br><br>~~Ok this doesnÂ’t relate much to the crocs but in nature mutations can be classified as random and induced.<br>I believe yr questions are asking is would environmental changes have an effect on DNA mutation. Yes,like UV radiation and mutagens(ethidium bromide), I am not very confident of answering the Q on the response part.<br><br>for the mutation in a swamp of crocs, it could be induced. I cant be sure because I only have learnt 3 types of gene regulation and those are in prokaryotes, which are simple organisms compared to humans and crocs,etc the human/animal version of gene regulation is far more complex.<br><br>What do u mean by constructed mutations?<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes it is inhibitorsÂ… or ratherÂ…repressors/co-repressors<br>anyway there is another type of control. Called attenuation. This is very diff to explain using words. Check out Â‘ attenuation of the trp operonÂ”<br><br>Is the attenuation you're referring to some inhibitors or such which would regulate the overall concentration of certain substance (eg. other inhibitors)?<br><br>Is seems quite unlikely that such inhibitors would be there doing their job for such prolonged period of time... Or would they?<br><br>~~Yes.<br><br>~~Why not ? it is this that controls the production of enzymes and other protein products in the first place. A lot of times, yr cell donÂ’t want to transcribe and translate every single gene in yr DNA because that will be a total waste of ATP and amino acids. And some are only produced in times of needs. Overproduction could be detrimental.<br>In the case of lack of iodine, yr goitre would swell. Why? Because it involves 2 hormones(proteins), cant remember the names. But the first hormone requires iodide ions to be functional. If 1 has a lack of it, it is incomplete and its production is regulated when its level reaches a limit and another Â…Â…Â…ends up yr thyroid gland keeps producing non-functional hormones = swollen goitre.<br><br>Copied?  Isn't there one RNA polymerase which also aids in the repair of the DNA strands?<br>RNA polymerases Â‘readÂ’ DNA and makes a transcript of it, ( something like making a complementary copy of the DNA template strand,except a T nucleotide in the transcript is replaced by a U nucleotide)<br><br>~~Repairing and copying the DNA strands are done by the DNA polymerase enzyme. Although may not be the same, for humans I am not sure.<br><br>Sidetrack abit: my met bio lecturer told us the enzyme is always named after or something related to the substrate( donÂ’t pass this around)<br><br>Not really?  Mutation probably would happen in only one tiny segment of a DNA strand don't know out of how many thousands? (or should be more? Can't remember the figures..  ) So if they get information from the other DNA strands... By comparison should be easily ruled out?<br><br>~~By comparisonÂ…what do u mean?<br>The frequency of mutationsÂ….u are rightÂ… 10e -5 or 7<br><br>DNA.... Mainly of the phytochrome? Is that the only main thing which determines the seasonal characteristics of the plants?<br><br>~~ this 1 I not sureÂ…sorry..sorryÂ…<br></div>
