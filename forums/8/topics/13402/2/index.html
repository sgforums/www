Then god punished the snake to crawl using his belly, that is why snake has no legs. To me, this snake is definitely not the fallen angel lucifer, but christians like to link these 2 "serpent" together.

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly I am not sure exactly because up till now I have not seen any references in the bible to explain His intention of placing it there. Again I may have overlooked them (maybe blurblop has an idea or rapture). As far as Im concerned, the only thing I can reason it off is that the LORD gives man a choice to exercise his free will. Simply because love demands it. And really it was Adam and Eve's mistake. I mean afterall they have seen with their eyes, the world, the LORD Himself walking with them, the glory of the creation and YET they did something as foolish as that. It is not God but the silly mistakes of Adam and Eve that caused the Orginal Sin.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Firstly..as what obiwan has said...why is it that in the first place..if GOD does not want adam and eve to eat the tree of knowledge...why did he created it in the first place....<br></strong></blockquote>Basically each person must be accountable for his own sins as stated very clearly in the Bible in the New Testament. He told the truth, but still he committed the sin of disobedience by eating the fruit. He knew the LORD's commandment regarding the fruit but he ate it still. If I murdered someone, although incited by someone else, and confess, it does not erase I have did wrong. Its the same.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>then again...what sin did adam commit when he told GOD that eve is the one that gave her the fruit??isn't he telling the truth to GOD??<br><br>It is the fallen angel - Satan. Obiwan was contesting against that claim, so I was trying to explain it was Satan.<br>[QUOTE][B]<br>thirdly..what is the serpent that you are talking abt in the postings above??isn't the snake the fallen angel??Lucifer??<br>Thanks...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></strong></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from Obiwan's last post. I will not challenge his views on Christian's stand on the Bible. But will comment on his "thots" since it cause confusion on teachings.<br><br>First and foremost, God does not tempt man, and nothing is further away from the truth to suggest God indirectly tempt man to sin. It is written and recorded in the New Testament of the Bible that God is no tempter of man. (I cant get down to the exact verse now because I dun bring my Bible to work    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">). God would have wished man did not sin and enjoy relationship with Himself, then Christ would not have to die, then man would not have to suffer. But God is fair to man by giving him a free will to exercise his choice. Also note God has already told them beforehand the consequences of sin, but still...you know the rest.<br><br>Sorry I had not have time to answer why God hid the tree of life from man after the fall. Realise it is after the fall he hid the tree of life from man, NOT before the fall. There is a reason for it which I have not had the time to look into yet. Any1 who knows feel free to explain.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>this is something i never get to understand either. if god is so mighty and knows all things, surely he will knows that the snake and the things to come, why leave the snake there to temp adam and eve? is it that god already has a plan or a motive?

And the tree of life? why he has to hide it from us?<br></strong></blockquote>As to why I know its Satan, look at my prev posts.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>To me, this snake is definitely not the fallen angel lucifer, but christians like to link these 2 "serpent" together.

And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. <strong>And God saw that it was good</strong>.<br><br>--------<br>God created all things that were good, even including the tree of knowledge. He only created things that were good,this included the creation of Man with the knowledge of Good only.<br>[Come to think of it : without knowledge of Evil, there can be no definition of what is 'Good' actually.]<br><br>Though the fruit is good for knowledge, it was for gaining the knowledge of Good and Evil. However it was not created for Man, because Man will gain the knowledge of Evil when he eats the fruit and from there sin and evil enters the world especially when Man cannot resist the temptation to sin or do evil.<br><br>Genesis 2:16 - 2:17<br>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;  but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die."<br>--------<br><br>For your info, without the Knowledge of Evil doesnt mean Man is stupid. Man was still very intelligent, maybe much more intelligent than people today. Imagaine God did ask Man to give names to <strong>all</strong> the animals that were created.<br>How difficult it will be for you or me alone, to give meaningful names to ALL living creatures?<br><br>Genesis 2:19 - So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.<br><br>--------<br>But it was the freewill of Man to eat the fruit.<br>Imagine how much better the world will be if there is no knowledge of Evil.<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br><br>==[Special Thanks to Blurblop.]==<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 31 January 2002).]</div>

I tend to see it as a good book, it teaches me how to live life, but it didn't give me the answers to everything., or most of the things.<br><br>I believe there are gods, and there is a force, something which i dunt understand. i believe maybe earth is created by god, but is he the only god? i do not think so.<br><br>As for the answer both of you have given me, i believe it is correct and just in your faith. But for me, there is something misssing. the whole picture is not there, you didnt explain clearly why god dont want adam to eat the fruit? As for the serpent, he is definitely not that old ancient serpent, i can't imagine he has a role to play. you mean it is like a drama?<br><br>As for the tree of life, the answer i dun really understand. In that case, why god created man in the first place if life is suffering? and since god is all knowing, he should know what will happened when he first created adam and eve? Is it god is putting adam to test his loyalty? When god created us, why dun we have any knowledge? Have you think about it clearly, is god creation a joke? or to test human?<br><br>All this which i can't find the answer, i find it in my faith.

Then as I grows older, and after watching the little buddha, i focus my mind on tibetian buddhism, the lamas, and from then on, i kept my faith there and zen.<br><br>Now I only read 1 scripture that is the heart sutra, and most of the time, I do mediating in the night. I did not sit and "nian jing", but only focus on my mind, and my thots and some subjects that the books sugguest. Although I can't said I am good, but at least I can relax and free my mind. Sometimes I did have feelings that the book said, slow breathing, blood hot flush and stuffs like that, and sometimes bad things like fear, rapid breathing...<br><br>As for the question about jesus, I think I better leave to duck and rap to said, it is quite sensitive for this question.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rapture, the question was why did the LORD stop man from eating from the tree of life after the fall ( by hiding it from man )?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Rapture:<br><strong><br>To Obiwan, Doom and Duckie<br><br>When God created plants, God saw that they were good.<br>Please read below  :<br><br>Genesis 1:11- 1:12<br><br>And God said, "Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth." And it was so. The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. [b]And God saw that it was good</strong>.<br><br>--------<br>God created all things that were good, even including the tree of knowledge. He only created things that were good,this included the creation of Man with the knowledge of Good only.<br>[Come to think of it : without knowledge of Evil, there can be no definition of what is 'Good' actually.]<br><br>Though the fruit is good for knowledge, it was for gaining the knowledge of Good and Evil. However it was not created for Man, because Man will gain the knowledge of Evil when he eats the fruit and from there sin and evil enters the world especially when Man cannot resist the temptation to sin or do evil.<br><br>Genesis 2:16 - 2:17<br>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;  but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die."<br>--------<br><br>For your info, without the Knowledge of Evil doesnt mean Man is stupid. Man was still very intelligent, maybe much more intelligent than people today. Imagaine God did ask Man to give names to <strong>all</strong> the animals that were created.<br>How difficult it will be for you or me alone, to give meaningful names to ALL living creatures?<br><br>Genesis 2:19 - So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.<br><br>--------<br>But it was the freewill of Man to eat the fruit.<br>Imagine how much better the world will be if there is no knowledge of Evil.<br><br>[/B]</blockquote></div>

Jesus came as man although He is at the same time God. This is really the beauty of it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> He came as a man, with the emotions of a man and notice His selfless act when He said in Matthew 25:39, that the Father's will be done instead. He knew the seriousness of His coming and what it meant for man. He let himself be killed so that all who believe in that sacrifice may have their sins all forgiven. It is also written that Jesus understands all our heartaches and pain because He was once a man. He is more than able and willing to help us if we ask of Him, because he understands what it is to be human. Really, we do not have a God who condemn us saying "why cant you do this right or do that better" but rather one who came to our level, shared our pain, heartaches, experience humanity himself, gave His life away for us, resurrected to complete the promise of a renewed life to all who believe. This is the love story of Jesus, God to man.<br></div>
