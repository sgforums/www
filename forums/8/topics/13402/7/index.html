As you know, I have say catholics is the actual christian faith that was passed down since jesus had left them. All the disciples of jesus were in fact all catholics, and the pope himself is a a direct pass down from the previous one. My friend told me the line goes back all the way to the old times.</div></blockquote>The true history dates back to old Roman time, when the Caesar wanted to unify his people with religion, because there were too many different races and languages. If his empire were to last, his people has to unify. So he forced people to worship him.<br><br>He persecutes those who believed Jesus. He crucified them, burned them and feed them to lions. Those who dont worship the Caesar will be tortured and killed.<br>But millions of people who believed in Jesus never gave in to the Roman Empire.<br>Therefore the Roman Empire sees it as not a solution to kill and torture, in the end they established the church and gave up forcing people to worship Casesar.<br>But still the Roman government manipulated the Church with trades, buying and selling, and implement things  such as giving benefit of trade to those who join the church or having a "higher class citizenship". They also decorated the church with beautiful structures and statues.<br>In the end countless people joined those churches just to get benefits from the church, in fact they did not believed the gospel.<br><br>And these were the Catholic churches.<br>However there are still many people in Catholic churches who believed in Jesus.<br><br>the history was very long, but i know you wont believe. But if you insist to say Catholic was the main stream, I hope you check history book first before you finalize on it.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 04 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Is Christianity the spiritual fountainhead of western civilisation? A faith that is apparently based on transcendental ethics? Of course it is, but then, there is no greater error than to consider western civilisation as an outcome of Christianity. The real intellectual foundations of the modern west are to be found in the old Roman conception of life as a purely utilitarian structure without any transcendental considerations. Indeed, it can be expressed as such: "Since we do not know anything definite-that is, provable by means of scientific experiments and calculations, about the origin of human life and its desitiny after death, it is better to concentrate all our energies on the development of our material and intellectual possibilities without allowing ourselves to be hampered by religious ethics and moral issues based on assumptions which defy scientific proof."<br><br>Throughout long centuries, the spirit of Europe was oppressed by a religious system that embodied the contempt of human nature. To ascribe, therefore, the practical achievements of modern western civilisation to Christian teachings is not accurate. Christianity has contributed very little to the powerful scientific and material development in which the present western civilisation of the west excels all others. Indeed, these achievements rose out of Europe's age-long intellectual fight against the Church and its historical hostility towards science. The history of the Middle Ages is full of the bitter struggle between the genuis of Europe and the Church.<br><br>Galileo was forced, on pain of life imprisonment and later, exile, to recant his views that the Earth orbited around the sun. Church authorities at that time believed otherwise because of a verse in the Bible:<br><br>"So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day." (RSV Bible, Joshua 10:13)<br><br>The ancient Library of Alexandria, amongst whose ruins were found the practical designs for the building of space ships, was burnt down by a mob very much motivated by priests who condemned the scientific blasphemy that was promoted by the library.<br><br>In America, parents have consistently lobbied to block all teaching about natural selection and the theory of evolution in schools, while almost all scientists in that great country hold the theory to be absolute truths.<br><br>I admire the faith and dedication of Christians, and I have the greatest of respect for my Christian brothers and sisters.<br><br>"...nearest among them in love to the believers wilt thou find those who say, 'We are Christians': because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced the world, and they are not arrogant." (The Quran, 5:82)<br><br>but objectivity should always be the rule of the day.<br><br>peace<br><br>[This message has been edited by pulse (edited 04 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Doom, I have not sure how old are you.

But dun be despair, the time will comes when you will hear and know what you want.

Look at how duck, Rapture, blur and me talks, you will know. You can see that although what the 3 of them believes in is the same, but the attidude, comments, feelings are somehow different. And for me and other buddhists, mine is different as well. And for your other christian friends, they are different as well.<br><br>I guess you have to listen to your own heart and feelings, god will definitely speak to you. All of us can give you advise, sometimes good, and sometimes make you more confused, but in the end, you still have to make your own choice. Sometimes, it is not us that chooses god, but god has chooses us first.<br><br>1 thing that i find it meaningful for me that i hope it will for you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Many men has failed to uphold the teachings in their respective religion. It is true for the faithful followers. Who dare say here right in this forum that he/she has uphold the utmost truth and principles in their religion in their daily life? How many have incurred the displeasure and anger of another non/believer while trying to educate them about their religion?<br><br>It is easy to say you have strong faith in your religion, and it is the most difficult to maintain daily discipline based on your religion. I still see many preaching about the greatness and goodness of the religion, and yet, actions prove them wrong.<br><br>When people become proud, or think they know all that is to their religion, personal agendas and principles overrides their faith and thus sufferings existed. This is common in all religions. It is the one sided view saying that their religion is the most "encouraged" for practice and embrace that the danger becomes very much alive between opposite camps.<br><br>Doctrines have been laid out in the past by the religions which they think most suitable, but few people stick exactly with the doctrines, and as years, centuries go by, it is being modified to suit the modern man. Many likes to hear praises about their religion but fewer will accept comments or lectures of what is shown to be the weakness and loophole. Anything they do not understand, they do not accept or they find thousands of reasons to try to defend. This, exactly is what has happened in this dissusion thread.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>great thought  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I believe everyone of us has our weaknesses. Some are excellent in certain areas, others are still growing. Even chrisitans, we cannot escape that there are times we do wrong, or that there are still habitual sins we do struggle with. But here's the difference ... as much as I fail or other christians like myself stumble on everyday issues, salvation has already been guaranteed to us. Irregardless whether I offer my seat to an elderly, or give to the poor, or volunteer myself for needy people it does not minus or add to our salvation. My point is simply this : christians are not working towards doing good so that we are saved, but we are working towards "doing good" because Jesus has already saved us. Out of a life of graditude to a loving Father and Jesus, we want to do good to others - that includes sharing the gospel of Christ.<br><br>To me, it is not important for me to show others if I have followed a good teachings of the bible. More importantly to me is the basis Im doing them. It should flow out of my life as naturally as my biological system works. Most of the time Im not even conscious of what I do, because I know of what I have received from the LORD.

I only pointed it out because I've studied the Semetic languages extensively, and you did point out that it was important for us to read the scriptures in the original languages.<br><br>In an English-speaking society, it's hard for us to understand the necessity for a "special" kind of plural, but I assure you, it's common in the Middle-Eastern context. Ask yourself this, the Jews possessed the Old Testament for several thousand years, and yet not once in their history have they had a problem with Genesis 1:26.<br><br>Furthermore, in ancient China, it's common for the emperor to give dispensations such as this:<br><br>"Zhen(4) rang(4) ni(3) qu(4) che(4) suo(3)."<br><br>Translated literally, it means. "WE allow you to go to the toliet."<br><br>In the Quran, God also speaks likewise:<br><br>"We have made the Quran easy to memorise; yet will anyone memorise it?" (Quran 54:40)<br><br>The WE word that is used in the Quran is similar to the original Hebrew word that is used in Genesis 1:26. Do pick up the "Bible in Hebrew and Greek" written by Rev John Schonfield (found in Broders), and you will see what I mean.<br><br>And please don't be mistaken, rubberduckie. I'm not out to bring down Jesus' godhood.
