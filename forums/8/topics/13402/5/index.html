My very first life on Earth, am I born with good or bad Karma?<br>If my very first life I was good person why do I have to suffer from Karma? Did I do something bad that caused me to suffer from Karma? If my very first life I choose to do bad things that's why I ended up with bad Karma , isnt this just the same as the 'freewill' to choose to do good or evil?<br><br>And can you list me the things that if I do I will end up with bad Karma?<br><br>you want to reborn as a human to come back and save them, and who knows instead of saving people you may choose to do things wrongly again this time and end yourself up in reincarnation again. Dont forget after reincarnation, you no longer have memory of the past lifes. Then instead of gaining enlightenment, you end up in reincarnation once again this just goes on and on and just wouldnt end.<br><br>I'm not sure why you think that the reincarnation will go on untill everyone is saved. But to believe that the 60 billion people on Earth will be saved and attain enlightenment, this, is also a kind of faith that you need to put your heart in. You cannot just assume as you want that all people will be saved one day.</strong></blockquote>karma means action, activity, function, according to the doctrine of karma, for every morally determinate thought, word, or action, there will be corresponding karmic compensation, if not in this life, then in some future life. As a man sows, so shall he reap. of course, there is much more.<br><br>As for your first life on earth, you first must understand that you are not you, who is really you? the moment you are born into the first life, you have karma already, be it good or bad, if not, why you are born in the first place?<br><br>yes, we have freewill to do good or bad.<br><br>bad karma is any thoughts that is sinful or evil, although this is a simple way to put it, there are much more to it.<br><br>Yes, who knows, even i myself will not know, but since in my this lifetime, i can be a human, then all the most, I must make use of it. and for me to be born in singapore, it is very lucky for me. and to be able to know buddhism, it is more than lucky.<br><br>true, reincarnation will sweep away your memories, but that doesnt mean that that i will end up in reincarnation forever. that is why i practise my faith everyday, and hope to have more good karma than bad, until one day, all my bad karma is gone, then i will get enlightened.<br><br>sorry, i assumed again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but that is our faith, to save all lifeforms, be it will happen or not, but to save all.<br><br>------------------<br><br>Once there was a Tibetan merchant named Norbu Zangpo, who lost all his money in his business. Due to his failure in the business, he felt very upset and disappointed and wanted to quit. Feeling so depressed, he lay down on the ground and he noticed that an ant was trying to climb a blade of grass. Halfway up, it fell down. It tried again and again many times and the merchant counted 79 times of the ant falling. At last on the 80th time, it managed to climb on to the tip of the grass. Suddenly, the merchant realised that without constant effort, one cannot succeed in anything. From then on, he put a lot of effort and hard work into his business and he succeeded. He became the richest and most successful businessman in Tibet. The tiny insect Ant gave that inspiration to him.<br><br>The story reminds us to exert effort constantly and not to be afraid of failure. In the process, even one does not succeed initially, one needs to practice until one succeeds. We all lack mindfulness and constant effort. We expect immediate results without exerting much effort. This is not possible. Dharma is mental training and cannot be bought or transferred. It is very simple if we know how to apply dharma to act as an antidote to purify defilement. If dharma becomes supplementary to one's pride or defilement, that will develop a negative effect against oneself. If dharma is practised through proper application, it will become the antidote to defilement. That is to say, with right implementation, one can reduce one's defilements like hatred, ignorance, desire, and all other kinds of confusions.<br></div>

I have in fact read about this many years ago.<br>These beings are called  "Guang Yin Tian".<br>This theory did not exist in Shi Jia Mo Ni's period.<br>Anyway, if you can disbelieve God create Adam and Eve, I wonder why you prefer to choose the theory of "Guang Yin Tian".<br>If you ask if God create Adam, who created God. I can ask you this too: If human come from Guang Yin Tian, where did Guang Yin Tian came from ?<br><br>As to the theory of Karma, I have only one thing to say:<br>It's so unfair that I am born with a bad Karma when I want to do good all my life.<br>It's just unconvincingly unfair.<br><br>Worse still, according to you, my very first life on Earth I can be borned with bad Karma even without doing wrong things when i was still a Guang Yin Tian. It's unfair, really unfair.<br><br><strong><br>true, reincarnation will sweep away your memories, but that doesnt mean that that i will end up in reincarnation forever. that is why i practise my faith everyday, and hope to have more good karma than bad, until one day, all my bad karma is gone, then i will get enlightened.</strong><br><br>Which is exactly why I say when you practice your faith, you gain enlightenment. Once you are in enlightenment, then you can only save yourself, you cannot save others and you have to leave them to suffer through reincarnation. Nor can you come back as human to save them because once you reincarnate as human you will never ever rememebr your past life nor your objective to save people.

If you read my thread regarding this beings, I was saying that there is a story that how man come to earth. but i did not say if i believe it or not. Personally, i did not believe it either. The explaination is simple, buddhism has been for so long, there are bound to have mistakes and misinterpretation. It is always up to the believer to take in all the good things, and discard the bad. And buddhism is cater for different ppl, some ppl believe in the statue of buddha, and hope for many things, that is why the status exists, but is the buddha there, nope.
