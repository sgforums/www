            <div class='col-md body'>For your information, Christianity was spreaded to China during the Qin Dynasty (dynasty of Qin Shi Huang, first emperor of CHina)<br>But instead of being called Ji Du Jiao (Christianity) it was called Qin Jing Jiao. (Qin ==&gt; Qin dynasty,  Jing ==&gt; as in feng jing). It was being spread to China, but was rejected by the emperor and the government, and people who believe have to gather the church underground.<br><br>Hundreds of years later untill the Tang dynasty, Christianity reaches out to China once again. But it was too late. Buddhism was already accepted by the emperor and he rejected Christianity again.<br><br>This is what I found out.<br>Believe or not I leave it to you, but I  wouldnt know the actual truth too.<br>but I got to believe what I have read about this, or else there is no point reading the newspaper everyday , because I can also choose to disbelieve the newspaper too if I can disbelieve a book I have read.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 01 February 2002).]</div>

As you know, I have say catholics is the actual christian faith that was passed down since jesus had left them. All the disciples of jesus were in fact all catholics, and the pope himself is a a direct pass down from the previous one. My friend told me the line goes back all the way to the old times.<br><br>What they practise now is in fact the actual things that held during the old times, like eating of the biscuits and drink of red wine and the mass. One thing that is wrong to say is that catholics pray to Mary. My friend told me they have never pray to the mary, the statue that is there is just for respect, out of respect that mary has done a great thing in raisng jesus and being god mother.<br><br>Their bible is a bit different from the protestant christian. Protestant christian, as the word imply, they protest against the roman churches and come out and form their own style of faith because they believe the teachings of the churches that time is wrong.The catholics bible contains a few, i think is 2 more authors, which is taken out from the christian bible now.<br><br>Another difference is the way that see the end... but i can't really remember it clearly. Of course there are other differences, but I might not know it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
