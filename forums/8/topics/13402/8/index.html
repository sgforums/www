Ask yourself this, the Jews possessed the Old Testament for several thousand years, and yet not once in their history have they had a problem with Genesis 1:26.<br><br>Furthermore, in ancient China, it's common for the emperor to give dispensations such as this:<br><br>"Zhen(4) rang(4) ni(3) qu(4) che(4) suo(3)."<br><br>Translated literally, it means. "WE allow you to go to the toliet."<br><br>In the Quran, God also speaks likewise:<br><br>"We have made the Quran easy to memorise; yet will anyone memorise it?" (Quran 54:40)<br><br>The WE word that is used in the Quran is similar to the original Hebrew word that is used in Genesis 1:26. Do pick up the "Bible in Hebrew and Greek" written by Rev John Schonfield (found in Broders), and you will see what I mean.<br><br>And please don't be mistaken, rubberduckie.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok here's what I re-discovered from my little study  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. In Gen 1:26 "God" in the hebrew is translated as Elohim. El, if I remembered correctly means God ... other names El-Shaddai means God Almighty (I think  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">). Elohim in the ancient refers to gods but in this context is used of the supreme God. El-ohim is specifically in the plural sense.<br><br>A cross references with other versions NASV, NIV and Darby are all translated as the english word "God". Anyway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, whatever the case this is a minor since we both agree of the trinity.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pulse:</div><div class="quote_body"> Hi rubberduckie, it's interesting that you should bring this up. The verse you quoted is this:<br><br>"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the sea." (NIV Bible, Genesis 1:26)<br><br>I have to calrify that even though the Book of Genesis is essentially a Hebrew scripture, the Jews themselves have never seen this as evidence of Trinity.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because in the orginal Hebrew and Aramic (the language that Jesus spoke), there are two different forms of the plural. One is the conventional plural that is used to refer to a collection of items. Another is the plural that is employed to confer majesty and authority. This kind of plural is also common in the Mandarin and Malay languages. Emperors in China frequently referred to themselves as Â‘zhenÂ’, or Â‘weÂ’.<br><br>The hebrew word that is used in Genesis 1:26 is the plural of majesty and not of multiplicity. Hope this helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Words are often not enough to describe something no matter in whatever language. And because it has passed down from so long time ago, some original words have lost their meanings, or part of the meanings.

Poems, books are so much different in the ways they expressed than now.<br><br>The other problem with some words is that sometimes it cannot really say out the actual meaning, it can only give a rough guide, idea of the things that the words want to express. For eg this word in chinese "Nie Pan" or "Nirvana" in english, we know what it means, but do we really know what "Nie Pan" is, the answer is No. Unless we experience "Nie Pan", if not we can never know what it actually means, or how it feels.<br><br>Then another problem is that words can only describe something we humans know in our context, to what we think it is.

But I like to give you 1 word of advice, hope you dun mind....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Maybe you are like many of us b4, maybe you are at your cross road right now, thinking which way should you go, left or right, up or down. I have been through this b4, therefore i know how you feels if you are indeed at your cross road. Seem like everyone here has something that is part of the truth, or for some ppl, they are the truth.<br><br>Hehe...actually i am not confused abt which path i would like to follow or which religion i woul;d like to practice..since a long time ago..i have already decided on one religion to follow and pursue..Buddhism..i am posting so much questions its just because i am curious abt christianity..being brought up in a catholic school..i see that the teachings of both Christianity and Catholic are almost the same..yet so much difference.i mean..their bible teachings are abt the same..and that the things they do..<br>the most cvonfusing part of these two religions for me..is that there are alot of christians telling me one story..and the other group telling me that itsd not true..those contradicting parts loe...<br><strong><br>I guess it is really difficult to choose between right or wrong, since there is no right or wrong, but just purely faith in what they believe. But dun be despair, the time will comes when you will hear and know what you want. Or maybe you already know, but just want to confirm more. 1 thing is that ppl will always tell you different things, because it is their own views and they have different concepts in life. Look at how duck, Rapture, blur and me talks, you will know. You can see that although what the 3 of them believes in is the same, but the attidude, comments, feelings are somehow different. And for me and other buddhists, mine is different as well. And for your other christian friends, they are different as well.<br></strong><br>Thats the point..that there are many different people around..hence..i would like to understand christianity from other people's point of view..there are lots of christians around..kind and patient types like rubber here..and there are impatient types like Hitsquad..<br><strong><br><br>1 thing that i find it meaningful for me that i hope it will for you. In buddhism, we teaches this:<br><br>Dont stay in the past, rather stay in the present cos the past has already gone<br>Dont worry the future, rather be contented in the present cos you will never know the future<br>What is a life? A life is but 1 breathe away...<br><br>I hope you can find what you want to know 1 day....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></strong></div></blockquote><strong>well obiwan..thanks for your advice.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but as i have mentioned above..i have decided on Buddhism since a long time ago and i have not decided to convert and things like that... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and like you.,.,i too find the teachings of Buddhism very meaningful but i did not practice if as much as you do... :p<br>Whatever it is..i still strongly think that up there...there is only 1 heavenly being that is controlling everything here..other may percive HIM as God..we Percive him as Buddha..and the Muslims percive him as Allah...but all are the same... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></strong></div>
