Eve is actually made from adam left ribs, that is why a woman tends to walk on the left side of a man which is nearer to a man heart (just for your info)<br><br>Actually if you really read the bible, you will find a lot of things that is not clear or maybe left out.

If you search it enough, seek it hard enough, you will find your answer. I just realised that I made a mistake when I sorta agreed with Hitsquad. There couldnt be other humans the Lord created. Simply because only the lineage of Adam will be saved thru Christ ( recorded in Romans 5 in the New Testament ). Also another indication is Adam named the woman Eve because she is the mother of all living things - Genesis 3:20 Meaning all people are decendants of Adam and Eve. And again in Genesis 2:20 Adam cannot find his own kind when naming all the animals. So really these are good indication there Adam and Eve were the first humans and none others. As I said always, Im not engaging in debate, only to clarify the stand.<br>I feel there is nothing wrong in raising questions ( not to question the authority of the religion, simply to understand whats it abt ) about particular religion as long as there are no attacks on any1. Moreover if it spurs discussions I think its great. Of coz discussions not dissent.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To start I am not disputing any person's religion   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I am definitely now contesting any1's belief. I am simply answering your question. If you observe I try not to bring out names of other religion as much as I can unless for identity. So hope this is established.<br><br>From below, your verse if Im not mistaken is taken from the words of the serpent (Satan himself). His role, the serpent, is to deceived the woman into eating the fruit. So the claim God does not want humans to be like Himself is utter rubbish   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> To give some proof of this...Believers of the good gospel is elevated with Christ to be kings and priests. Bible equal our relationship with Jesus as his brothers -&gt; family. In the end, we will rule with Him. Why would He go one big merry-go-round, not to mention all pain of seeing the Son Of God crucified and and seperated, to eventually make us like himself? He has made us (Christians) like Himself. In fact the Holy Spirit promised and given to believers is to teach us ALL things as stated in the New Testament. The LORD is not angry with us per se, but angry with the sin in us that causes us to be seperated from Him. I am being vague here abt sin because there is the Original Sin and the sins that we so often helplessly fall into untill the time of Christ.<br><br>I dun have the time to look into your second claim abt God keeping us away from tree of life JUST because He does not want us to live forever  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I mean now with the redemptive work of Jesus, we live forever with Him, overcoming "death". I meant the death that seperates us from God. Although I know its in the Bible...I dun have my sword (Bible) with me now since Im at work. But I will answer what I can now and move on to the ones I can pull it off my head.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>For example:<br><br>god is angry because not only we disobey him, but if you look at it another way, god is angry becuase we have knowledge which made us humans become like "them".<br><br>he also banish adam from eden, becos he is careful not to let us eat the tree of life in which we will have eternal life like "them".<br></strong></blockquote>Ok think of it, if God created our world, and He himself proclaimed it to be good, which includes the serpent...what else could have contaminated it? Its not a supposition but I will revisit it when I get my sword   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br><br>And the serpent which ppl come to think as satan actually in the bible is just a creation of god. god created creatures, one of them is snake which is the most cunning. But ppl always link the serpent to the fallen angel...<br></strong></blockquote>Here's just of the many verses I know that readily answers your questions abt who made angels   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> -&gt;<br><br>Col 1:16 "For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him."<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>And angels, since when did god said he created them, the bible said about them, but didn't really said how they come about.<br><br></strong></blockquote>Alot of times, we need to look into the original hebrew or greek to better understand the context from which the writer writes a particular phrase. The english translation might not bring out the richness of the original language.<br><br>[This message has been edited by rubberduckie (edited 30 January 2002).]</div>

Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?" 12 The man said, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate."<br><br>--------<br><br>You see, that's the first sin: he blamed Eve that she gave him the fruit to eat. Actually he himself want to eat the fruit also. In Chinese this is called :" Tui Xie Zhe Ren"<br><br>People think sin is only evil actions like murder, theft, rape.  But actually sin includes irresponsibility too - even as we see today, people beat up and toture cats and dogs instead of taking good care of them.<br><br>As for the tree of life,<br><br>Genesis 3:20 - 3:22<br>Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever"<br><br>-------<br><br>Many people complain life is just suffering.<br>I think so too.

You say you know Buddhism well, you should know this.<br><br>Shi Jia Mo Ni was a prince in India. He could have enjoyed his luxurious life in his palace.

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess the two of u take the bible as it is, of course it is correct in your sense. but to me, i tend to understand the bible in a sightly different way, that is why i said the <strong>concepts</strong> is different. All in all, i did not said i do not believe what the bible say, but i look at it in a differerent way. I tend to see it as a good book, it teaches me how to live life, but it didn't give me the answers to everything., or most of the things.<br><br>I believe there are gods, and there is a force, something which i dunt understand. i believe maybe earth is created by god, but is he the only god? i do not think so.<br><br>As for the answer both of you have given me, i believe it is correct and just in your faith. But for me, there is something misssing. the whole picture is not there, you didnt explain clearly why god dont want adam to eat the fruit? As for the serpent, he is definitely not that old ancient serpent, i can't imagine he has a role to play. you mean it is like a drama?<br><br>As for the tree of life, the answer i dun really understand. In that case, why god created man in the first place if life is suffering? and since god is all knowing, he should know what will happened when he first created adam and eve? Is it god is putting adam to test his loyalty? When god created us, why dun we have any knowledge? Have you think about it clearly, is god creation a joke? or to test human?<br><br>All this which i can't find the answer, i find it in my faith. I am not try to convert or said anything to make you change your mind about your own faith. I am just telling both of you why i left christ.<br><br>As for both of you, i guess you too are also good ppl in their own faith, which i sincerely and thankfully thank god for saving 2 souls. Keep up your own faith and spread your good news to ppl.<br><br>------------------<br><br>The buddha is not unhappy with his life, he wanted to find the truth and to show humans the path, in order to do it, he has to do it himself first.<br><br>You are correct, life is suffering, if a person couldn't get out of the wheel of life, he will be always suffering. Of course I do not want to live forever and suffer forever, that is why i practise my faith everyday.<br><br>As for my life everyday, i am really happy and contented, i dun find working boring, although i sometimes too will have emotions, but i am really happy that i am alive and well. btw, i am working now, i like my job, i love my life, i love my wife and my dog.<br><br>The reasons that you find life boring, burden is that you couldn't understand life itself. maybe that's why your faith relates to you very well. you hope for eternal life and enjoy in paradise with your heavenly father. But for me, i think i can't imagine life is only like that, and to enjoy eternity while both my parents suffer in hell is something i can't imagine. Although you are rite about the soul thing, but i still have compassion in my heart, i couldnt leave any soul in hell, if that is the case, then i will be very cruel. Imagine while you enjoy in paradise, ppl is suffering in hell. For me, it is too cruel.<br><br>life itself is not a fault, it is a test and karma. have you wonder why you hate your job, and i like mine. have you wonder why bill gates is so rich and why you are not. have you wonder why babies dies young? have you wonder why you are in singapore, and others is in africa?<br><br>------------------<br><br>Religion always have the same motive, but the intrepretion is different, but the end result will be the same<br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
