            <div class='col-md body'>In Judaism, Christianity and Islam, God is eternal and was never created by anyone else. Lest people think that this is an illogical presumption, let me clarify that scientists have asked themselves the question: "How was the Universe created?" for a very long time. The Quran states:<br><br>"Do the unbelievers not realize that the heavens and the earth used to be one solid mass that we exploded into existence? And from water we made all living things. Would they believe?" (Qur'an 21:30)<br><br>When scientists stumbled upon the Big Bang Theory, they went on to ask: "What caused it?" Many opinions have been advanced but Stephen Hawking (that brilliant but handicapped theoratical phycisist) has come up with the most poignant explanation of all. He believes that since the Universe had not come into being yet, all physical laws that we know of today are not relevant in the time before the Big Bang. There is no measurement of time because there is no time. There is no length, breadth or height because space had not yet come into being. All there was was the cosmic egg, full of potential energy that was about to unleash itself into existence. Today, of course, the universe is continuously expanding.<br><br>"And it is We who have built the universe with our power; and, verily, it is We who are steadily expanding it." (Quran 51:47)<br><br>The popular train of thought is this. The Big Bang was the untimate beginning, and all questions that progress to a time before that stupendous event is rendered irrelevant and meaningless.<br><br>Life proceeded from a Creator, One Creator, because all around us, we find evidence of a pattern that is oddly consistent with each other. This may sound cliched, but I have to resort to an old arguement that everything has a cause, or a creator. This may be offensive to some people, especially to Buddhists because they believe that life and the universe emerged from nothingness. But to those who believe in a Being who created all of us, here is a point to reiterate the fact that there can only be ONE Creator.<br><br>"He is the One who created the two kinds, male and female, from a tiny drop of semen" (Quran 53:45-46)<br><br>Modern genetic studies have shown that all life possess the same blueprint for life. That means we are even related to the vilest species of weed in your backyard. Our DNA is composed of only 4 chemical bases:<br><br>adenine, expressed by the alphabet A;<br>thymine, expressed by the alphabet T;<br>cytosine, expressed by the alphabet C; and<br>guanine, expressed by the alphabet G.<br><br>This language is universal to all life on Earth. If there had been many Creators, then there would be a variety of lifeforms. Of course, we may yet find other lifeforms in the universe that are made up of different components, and what an exciting discovery that would be!<br><br>"Is it not a fact that there was a time when the human being was nothing to be mentioned?We created the human from a liquid mixture, from two parents, in order to test him. Thus, we made him a hearer and a seer. (Quran 76:1-2)<br><br>"And God created every living creature from water. (Quran 24:55)<br><br>"He is the One who perfected everything He created, and started the creation of the human from clay. Then He continued his reproduction through a certain lowly liquid.<br>He shaped him and blew into him from His spirit. And He gave you the hearing, the eyesight, and the brains; rarely are you thankful. (Quran 32:7-9)<br><br>"He is the One Who created you in stages." (Quran 71:14)<br><br>Disclaimer: This post is a general support for the existence of a Creator, and not a propogation of any creed or religion, although I have provided the view from an Islamic perspective (and to some extent, Judaism's and Christianity's). Will not respond to any flames..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by pulse (edited 01 February 2002).]</div>

This questions are only my doubts, not to put you all down and i support you all too, remember i always tell you ppl to keep up with your faith. this is merely a discussion only, so it is ok and let it live as long as we dun slam each other faiths, i hope Ah_Nic wont close it.<br><br>I know you all have pulled out the answers from the bible, it is not that i dun believe you, but it is not convicing to me. For example, god is like a father to us, he will punished us, and give us free will. Ok, we have sinned, we went our bad way. then out of love he sent jesus to save us, and to those who believe will be saved, and those who choose not like my parents, grand parents will all go to hell, rite.<br><br>But i find it really very conditional, fundamentally. if you dun accept him, he will throw you in hell. if you accept him, he will excel you into the heavens, to me, this is a real problem. How can a god that who love all his creation have to condemn his naughty sons into hells. For example, my father will punished me even if i did something very wrong, he will sent me to jail or whatever. but god is god, he should be more loving. But like what you said, he also did the same thing. Ok, let say i really really bad, but to condemn the souls to eternal hell, is it really loving. dun he feel sad, dun he feel bad? it is forever, rite... once i am in hell, forever i will be there.<br><br>Anyway, this is just my doubts, i dun think as a god, he should punished his sons to eternal hell.<br><br>As for the questions you answer, i find it hard to asborb not becuase it is that i dun believe, but is not convincing. I understand what you are trying to tell me, fundamentally, you are saying that god is like a father to us, he will punished, he will save, he is like a father to us. as for adam, eve, satan. it is their fault, they brought it to themselves and god has given us free will and jesus to save us.... and stuff like that. and god is perfect, his creation is perfect...<br><br>But the cruical point i am saying is that if god is all almighty, one who knows all, the beginning and ends to come, why didnt he stop it? why did he still create man since he knows man is going to sin. did you understand my question now...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> maybe i am a little bit poor on my english.<br><br>As for my faith, i guess ppl sometimes also misunderstood the real meaning behind it, but unless ppl ask me, i will not dig into it. There are many kinds of buddhism and cater to many types of ppl. My faith thinks that all religion is good and that is why we dun argue with ppl, we dun try to convert ppl into our faith and make them more doubtful in life. we believe in karma force and saving yourself is only through yourself. If sometimes i go around and slam you ppl, it is not my faith fault, it is my fault...<br><br>I always said i believe in what the bible said sometimes, becuase in my faith, different words can be use for different meanings. For example, you said ear, in japanese, i will said mi mi. you said hand, i will say te in jap. so in the bible, sometimes i look at it in my way of faith, that is why i say <strong>concepts</strong> is different. But of course i know, to you all, bible has only one meaning, and so be it.<br><br>i guess i can clarify as much as to you all, as you all try very hard to me too. as for believing in your faith, it is very diff for me as  for you to believe in mine, rite? i am not to slam you ppl, but i hope to answer as many doubts as Doom as in my faith.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>

My faith thinks that all religion is good and that is why we dun argue with ppl, we dun try to convert ppl into our faith and make them more doubtful in life. we believe in karma force and saving yourself is only through yourself. If sometimes i go around and slam you ppl, it is not my faith fault, it is my fault...<br><br>I always said i believe in what the bible said sometimes, becuase in my faith, different words can be use for different meanings. For example, you said ear, in japanese, i will said mi mi. you said hand, i will say te in jap. so in the bible, sometimes i look at it in my way of faith, that is why i say [b]concepts</strong> is different. But of course i know, to you all, bible has only one meaning, and so be it.<br><br>i guess i can clarify as much as to you all, as you all try very hard to me too. as for believing in your faith, it is very diff for me as  for you to believe in mine, rite? i am not to slam you ppl, but i hope to answer as many doubts as Doom as in my faith.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[/B]</blockquote>I have the greatest respect for Buddhism. Their pacifist philosophy is something I think most faiths would benefit from.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>peace.</div>

But in response let me say ...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by obiwan:</div><div class="quote_body">To rapture, doom, blur, duck<br><br>dun worry, i am more calm nowsdays... I am not rejecting your faith at all.

I hope I have brought somethings into perspective in my prev posts. Here's another go at it. The LORD did not and is not sending any1 to hell, basically we send ourselves when we reject his solution. Its almost like someone bridges two very far away cliff and offers any1 who believes in his bridge to use it. But there are people, some out of disbelief and others(alot) out of pride, chooses to cross the cliff another way when there is no other way. Many of them perish. So, did God send those who disbelieve to hell? Nope. But hell is a direct consequence of sin, it is never a plan for man. It is written in the bible that hell is meant from the beginning only for fallen angels. But when man fall, it automatically open its ghastly doors to man too. God has made that bridge thru Jesus, its as easy as to believe...thats tat.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I know you all have pulled out the answers from the bible, it is not that i dun believe you, but it is not convicing to me. For example, god is like a father to us, he will punished us, and give us free will. Ok, we have sinned, we went our bad way. then out of love he sent jesus to save us, and to those who believe will be saved, and those who choose not like my parents, grand parents will all go to hell, rite.<br></strong></blockquote>It has to be conditional. Because there is no other way we can repay our sins except thru the sacrifice of another who has no sins to start with! Written in the bible, it said of Jesus to be one who was tempted in EVERY WAY yet without sin. Although conditional I agree, but He made it so simple. His condition is not based on what we can do - whether I can live a day without committing a wrong or 10 years without sinning is irrelevant. Simply because He knows after the fall, it is IMPOSSIBLE to do right, the only simple condition is for us to believe that Jesus Christ die for our sins and accept Him as the one and only person who can cleanse us of all our sins. Its as simple as that and the person crosses from an eternity of separation from God to reconciliation to the Father. So simple. Its even simpler than going pri sch ... no exams, no criteria we have to work with our hands, nothing...its as simple as a prayer. Our salvation is only a breath away.<br><br>God is a loving Father, at the same time He is a just God. Every single crime has to pay! And instead of allowing us to go to hell, Jesus went there for us...that is real love. For one to give Himself so all who believes can escape this abyss of no return.<br><blockquote><strong><br>But i find it really very conditional, fundamentally. if you dun accept him, he will throw you in hell. if you accept him, he will excel you into the heavens, to me, this is a real problem. How can a god that who love all his creation have to condemn his naughty sons into hells. For example, my father will punished me even if i did something very wrong, he will sent me to jail or whatever. but god is god, he should be more loving. But like what you said, he also did the same thing. Ok, let say i really really bad, but to condemn the souls to eternal hell, is it really loving. dun he feel sad, dun he feel bad? it is forever, rite... once i am in hell, forever i will be there.<br></strong></blockquote>He cant stop even if He wants to because He has given the gift of free will to man. God is one who gives and not take back - every call and gift as written in Romans 9 is irrevocable.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But the cruical point i am saying is that if god is all almighty, one who knows all, the beginning and ends to come, why didnt he stop it? why did he still create man since he knows man is going to sin. did you understand my question now...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> maybe i am a little bit poor on my english.<br><br></strong></blockquote></div>
