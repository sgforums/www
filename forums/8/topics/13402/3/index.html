Time being a component of our universe then must also start at some point. So who created Time or rather how Time first began? If Time was triggered by something or someone then it must also be greater than God, in another words whatever that lived outside of time must be the true God. If that is so, the true God is timeless. The bible states that all things ( including time, space, everything that defines the universe) were made through Christ and for Christ. Albert Einstein once stated that if once can break the barrier of the speed of light it will be timelessness. That spurred the possibility of time travel. It is significant God lives outside the dimension of time simply becoz when Christ died, He died for the past, the present and the future. When he said "It is finished" He meant everything that was faulted from the beginning of time - Adam and Eve till the end of time, He has provided the remission by His own death.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>wrongly??)..but..what is the start of all things??no dis-respect..but how can GOD just Poof out of no where??</strong></blockquote>[This message has been edited by rubberduckie (edited 01 February 2002).]</div>

They had taught us, warned us, instructed us all our lives to live good lives.

So it is the parents' fault?<br><br>God does not want to punish us. Suffering is the direct consequence of disobedience. Everything that was created was good, but breaking the cycle by sinning automatically opened the door to all the bad things, which are happening to us now. But God provided a solution to bring us back to Himself - Jesus, right from the beginning as stated in the New Testament. The solution has already been provided for us all, it is only the question man accept it or hit away the hand of God and say "I dun need you, and I dun believe in you."<br><br>[This message has been edited by rubberduckie (edited 01 February 2002).]</div>

Still you got to preach peope about your faith, so are you doing it already? Have you preached your neighbour about your faith already?<br>Why does Christians seem more hardworking than you in preaching have you ever wondered? Or even more hardworking than all other religions.<br><br>You say In buddhism there is nothing that is forever, everything changes. You're wrong. The 18 Levels of Hell, A pi di yu, yong bu chao sheng is forever. Attaining of enlightenment is forever too, you should realise this. and when you attain enlightenment , you disappear from the universe. You can only save yourself, not others.<br><br>Furthermore, how many people on Earth really can attain enlightenment?  I dont think there's many. I can tell you most Singaporeans will never gain enlightenment in this life, looking  at the way we live. Not to mention people from other countries who never practice Buddhism.  Therefore judging by this fact, I can see many people will still continue to suffer the forever reincarnations on Earth. You can never save them from these sufferings.<br><br>And when you say if they can understand the path and the tao, they will get enlightened, just like jesus, buddha, gandhi, mother teresa and so on... How many people can really reach their standards???<br>Furthermore, you're just assuming all these by yourself that they all attained enlightenment. You're not the creator of this unknown "Force" in the universe, there's no way you can judge them that they have already understand the tao and where they have gone to after they die.<br>PLease dont assume all these by yourself especially they come from different religious backgrounds.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 01 February 2002).]</div>

God's creation is perfect, but He gave Freewill to Man. Have you ever heard of this "Loving someone is to give them freedom and not to control them" ? But at the same time he warned Man in the first place not to disobey him or he will die.<br><br>2. The serpent was created by God as a beautiful Arch Angel. But because he was beautiful, his freewill got him jealous of God. God did not allow the serpent to tempt Man. Instead the Serpent betrayed God (like how Adam and Eve disobeyed God) and wanted to destroy the God's creations.<br><br>I can really quote alot and give you lots of explanation on these 2 questions. BUt I know you'll still reject the answers.<br>I just give two brief answers for you to show that the Bible has the answers to your questions.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 01 February 2002).]</div>
