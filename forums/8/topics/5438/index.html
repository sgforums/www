            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>I'm just posting this in part due to what I read on Firewire's emotional "What tha Fuck!!!" post. In it he brought up a very interesting aspect of S'poreans: all talk and no action (well...not pharased this way..but the meaning is close enough).<br><br>I would think this is more true of the so called more "educated" ppl that make up our society.  What I am about to say is based largly on my experiences during my NS stint.<br><br>But, allow me to give some background information before I proceed further. I was an A level student. Upon completion of my A Levels, I began my NS life at BMTC2. Unlike many of my contemporaries in NS, I did not make the cut for OCS or SISPEC, and was posted to the hellhole know as 30SCE as a Pioneer.<br><br>As you all probably know, operational ready units like 30SCE have mono-intakes that are made up of largly people who stop their education at the O Levels (some even drop out before). Natuarally there existed some gap between the more "educated" ones who were posted along with me, and the mono-intakes. But being in the same platoon meant that we had go though any shit with them, whether we liked it or not. As such, I was able to work with them not as a superior (as a result of my supposedly higher education qualification) but rather as an equal.<br><br>One thing I noticed is that for the mono-intakes, action is done in a blink of an eye and on the conclusion of a statement. There is no room for talk. Either you join them in doing what they are going to do; or you just stay out of it - simple as that.<br><br>This is quite in contrast to "educated" people like us who tend to talk over it, evaluate, discuss, blah blah, jabber jabber, often leading nowhere until someone finally gets pissed off and DOES somehing.<br><br>I supposed being "educated" means that we are supposed to be able to analyze issues and tasks objectively and such, but I noticed that often the discussion is more about impressing and protecting one's own interest. Just like the clowns who participate the UN, WTO or other global/regional forums, its all about self interest. Ok, perhaps this is a bad example because of the social and political implications involved as a result of these forums, but the point is that discussion/tok among individuals with self interest never gets anywhere.<br><br>You would probably notice that self interest is given greater emphasis on people with higher education where the stakes are supposedly greater.  No doubt the stake is greater (in terms of absolute value) but the comparative value of the what's at stake is pretty much the same. Put simply, the pain experienced by a rich man losing $100000 dollars would probably be the same as that of a poor man losing $100, even though the values vary by a geat amount. Hence I think it is unfair to say that lesser educated people have any less to lose.<br><br>Which brings me back to my earlier point. Most of the mono-intakes I worked with were very helpful individuals. Helpful in the sense that they would be willing to step out of their job scope to lend a helping hand in order to finish the collective task earlier. Even those who were appointed I/Cs (on a rotational basis) chipped in their effort on the ground level.<br><br>This was in stark contrast to some OCS cadet trainees (all who were either A level or Diploma holders) with whom I had the "honour" of working under during the construction of the Grandstands for NDP 99. The Cadet I/Cs were essentially supervisors, doing the usual "all tok, no action". The other cadets meticulously did what they were instructed to do, but few willing to overstep the scope of their task. Perhaps this was expected of them as part of their training as future officers *shurg*.<br><br>Meanwhile AETC, the other unit who was building the grandstands concurrently on the other half of the field finished the same job in a timing quicker than us by a day. It might be interesting to note that AETC was comprised mainly of mono-intakes. No doubt experince did play a part, perhaps the main difference was that the ICs there were willing to to help out rather than just order from the sidelines.<br><br>This is true with the mentality of the "less educated" people -- action speaks louder than words. Respect and support is given to those who do the most action, and not the chap who speaks most charismatically, which sadly, is what most of us excel exceeding well to various degrees.<br><br>On an ending note, please note that I am not agianst the quality of the SAF NSF officers (but if you want to I can easily open another topic on this) or any other group of  individuals,  I'm just relating them as living examples of what I have observed.<br><br>The bottom line (in case you fell asleep reading halfway through) is that "all talk no action" seems more predominant in the higher educated people than lower educated people.  I understand my scope of observation is limited to the army. But by the time we enter this phase in our lives, most of our habits, mannerisms, outlook, preferences and such are already fixed to such a degree that we are unlikely to change radicaly for the remainder of our lives. Thus I suppose it would be quite an accurate reflection of S'poreans even after they have left the service to pursue their civilian lives.<br><br>Just thinking out loud only  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Oh! I also sincerely apologise for the length of the post (in addition to any breakdown and inconsistiencies in my arguments...I haven't written that much for a long long time...).<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i definitely agree with this, but it's pretty much evident throughout sg. all of us have frens who come up with all sorts of grand schemes and ideas, but mostly, it's all hot air. but instead of just commenting on it, how abt doing somethg? i'm lucky enuff to be in a class where we're more all action no talk, ie we just do first, thk later.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> yes, we do get into alot of trouble, but hey, isnt tt part of the fun? the ironic thg is, we spposedly the "smartest" class in the level......<br><br>throughout the rest of our existance, esp if you're planning to live in sg, we'll meet up with a lot of this kinda ppl. just nod, listen to them, then do your own stuff. if they insist on analysing again and again, then take charge! it's better to sound bossy and rude than let them ruin your day..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ataraxia:<br><br>Good for u to have such a nice bunch of ppl to hangout with. Unfortunately most of my old clssmates tend to stick to the talking side (there's this class outing being planned since early 98 and nothing has come out of it yet...2000 approaching liao...). Luckily most of my NS buddies (a good mix of A levels, diploma and O level) are more spontaneous!<br><br>Haha! Sound advice  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Think I'm quite guilty of that but sometimes it IS the only thing you can do (hmm...better not push my luck too far), but to the credit of my frenz we still get a long fine!<br><br>Eck:<br><br>Great to meet a fellow pioneer. Actually I only did my CEC in Alpha Coy there, was posted to Plant and then SOCE, where I served out the remainder of my NS dayz.<br><br>Dun get me wrong, I kinda enjoyed my stay there.

            <div class='col-md body'>Braveheart<br><br>I think in every individual group, there has to be one in charge, definately! I tell u maybe SG ppl are more prone to procrastination which seems to be a vulnerable part of all of us. It is always so hyper and interesting to talk about gatherings especially if u all din meet before. I do also have the experience being stood up, really fed up but what to do they are your friends. Just that in this society, u have to be real firm to get stuffs accomplished.

            <div class='col-md body'>Riona:<br><br>Yups, definitely. Guess its always easier to be led than to lead. When you lead you shoulder everything; when you are led you just complain with all the others. But life's like dat! Nobody ever said leading was easy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Procastination is part of the planning phase, but with the number of "what if's" that pop up, seriouly I think its better not to plan that much in informal outings of large groups. Better to rely on spontaneity in participation. After all, it IS impossible to cater to everyone's whims and fancy. Going through the list of "What ifs" is good reason enough to discourage any outings in the first place.<br><br>Hmm...with reference to the outing, I did not really follow much of it (I'm not in sg anyway...) but I suppose the whole event sure could do with better organisation. As you said, one can even be stood up by friends, let alone a couple of strangers! All the best to the next outing u ppl!<br><br>PS: I've replied to your reply, but I replied to that before replying to this, so writing this may seem a little odd...<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BraveHart<br>You know what, the thing is that we SG ppl from overseas seemed very concerned of what is happening over in SG, even though we are not physically there. I mean though I did not personally got "played out", I do feel frustrated. It is the attitude that one potray. Though this might only be a mass outing, but who knows when all of us, overseas students were to actually join the crowd, it might be an overwealming experience. I dun want to put too much expectations next time, but for sure I will get all the contact numbers to make sure you all are there!<br><br>I think the more educated one is, the more self-centered and egoistic one becomes. Not trying to generalise but if u see the past postings lots of ppl are so enthusiastic aboout the outing. All the hype, in the end what happened.*sigh*...<br><br>I think primarily it is becos the ppl in the forum have not known each other that well yet. Maybe the next outing preferbly maybe another 2 months later, so everyone is really "committed" and responsible to one another.<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Riona:<br><br>Hmm...you've got valid points there. But it still puzzles me how come basic things such as pg/hp numbers were not taken. If I'm not mistaken such items are possessed by nearly every sg'rean. Past experiences with group outings do show that these communication tools do come in very handy.<br><br>I agree that the attitude was quite disturbing. But such is the fickleness of interacting in cyberspace. Not knowing anyone in the forum personally does not create the need for a responsibility to turn up. I did a quick scan through some of it and noticed that those who met seemed to know each other in some way or another.<br><br>If, say, I knew you and we were to go, I'm sure we would have no problems meeting at the outing. But most of these people don't even know who's who! Recognising someone by a nick is very different from recognising someone in person.<br><br>But ultimately the organizers should get their act together first (I believe even they did not get to see each other). Thus even if the whole thing does screw up, a quick drink in the pub together is much better than going home empty handed.<br><br>Besides, from past accounts, turnouts for channel outings are never known to be that grand anyway...<br><br>PS: Oh!

            <div class='col-md body'>No, I cannot agree on the theory that "the more educated one is, the more self-centered and egoistic one becomes". Two people may go thru the same things in life, the same education, the same family life, but it will not guarantee that the two people will have the same attitudes, the same self-conscious levels, and the same ego size. It all depends on CHARACTER. Different people react to a bad incident. About the outing stuff, well I've not been here for a while, but regarding that stuff about people agreeing to appear and not do so, it's simply because either 1)we all don't know each other yet, well, most of us 2)Certain "objectives" will not be met if they go to this outing. What "objectives", you ask? Well that depends on each person of course.<br><br>------------------<br>"And when my love for life is running dry, you come and pour yourself on me"--- David Gates</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>theychosenone:<br><br>Yup, I agree when all else being equal, character is the defining factor. But the fact is that not every one goes through the same thing. Even most twins do not grow up in the exact same environment as his other counterpart.<br><br>Education is, in my opinion, a very important factor. Education not only involves academic aspect but mental aspects. Thus the difference from a school dropout O-Level student, A-Level Student, Degree/Diploma holder is the discipline and analytical skills. The higher your education, you are more aware of aspects in your field.<br><br>When we first start out learning chemistry in secondary school for example, we are taught only the basic properties which mainly involves memorising. As we proceed on to higher levels of education, say JC, we are taught the reasons behind their properties. Who knows what they teach in the polys or unis. But the bottom line is education is the systematic building up of knowledge. it is a learning process that continually expands our horizon. It opens up avenues of thoughts that are otherwise unavailble to "lesser" educated persons.<br><br>What we are saying that this additional analytical ability is does give you the ability to find and exploit loopholes to one's own advantage. Knowledge is power in today's context, an asset most are proud to hold. Our status in the social ladder is often based on our education system. Thus egoism is proportional to the position of that ladder. Its just that some show it more than others.<br><br>Call me cynical but I believe everyone does something for a reason that benefits oneself. The selfish ones do it for short term gains; a selfless one does it for the long term.

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed,<br>My point is that you cannot generalise that EVERYONE will become selfish, too analytical, egoistic, and in army terms, become more "keng". More education for a person does not imply that he/she will always think about what will benefit him/her when a job is given. I do agree there is a sort of "overall" impression that the so-called "hokkien bengs" have more cohesion in their work, and don't really think too much about it before doing it. They just follow the instructions,and at the end of the day, they will be the ones who will please the "masters" in the army. My former CSM did bring up to us this point about "the more education, the more likely you will think too much about working". In terms of an "overview", I do agree. I too have worked for different people, in BMT I had the chance to meet up with the Obese Hokkien Bengs from another company, cos I was from the supposedly "more educated" obese company. That was 3 years ago..(I lost over 20 kgs in the army btw). I did have more fun and morale while working with the bengs, cos they do their job straight, and most of them do not complain a bit about how difficult the job was.<br><br>Nowadays people may ask for "thinking soldiers", but we should not be thinking up till the extent of pondering whatever jobs we are given will be of use to us or not. This can also be applied to life in general. And no, I do not preach a society of "Yes-men"(or yes-women of course...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>------------------<br>"And when my love for life is running dry, you come and pour yourself on me"--- David Gates</div>
