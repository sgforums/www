I've been there personally and I've heard from people who've been there too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> Have you been there, tho?<br><br>All they did was to keep giving me medication, and even though the medication worked, the problem came back again after I stopped. First they gave me doxycycline. Then something else, then erythromycin, then Bacterin (or Bacterim forgot). They wanted to give me Roaccutane but I was a minor back then and since it causes possible severe side effects, I required my parents' consent and they weren't around then.<br><br></div></blockquote>I went to nsc for treatment of my acne few yrs back.. seriously, it help to improve my pimples a lot.. the doc prescribe me anti biotics (which i have stop a yr back), the normal ance cleanser ( white bottle , cost around S$ 6 ) and this deferrin pimple cream. i have been using that cleanser for around 2 yrs.. and one bottle can last for nearly 6 months.. although ur skin will feel oily a few hours later but consistent use can actually get rid of your pimples.. now i stopped using that cleanser already cos i didn;t went back for consultation again as i think that my skin is better now.. for the differin cream, it actually works! if u have a pimple, jus apply it at nite b4 u sleep. but a pity is, this cream cun be sold outside, u nid a doc prescription. but i bought it in malaysia pharmacy, there don require doc presciption.</div>
