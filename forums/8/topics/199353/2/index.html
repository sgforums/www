Do not over-blot as it will cause your skin to produce even more oil.<br><br>Change your pillowcase regularly (or put a towel over it and change the towel).<br>Ensure your living environment is clean e.g. free from excessive dust.<br><br>To try to salvage the harm that has already been done, remember to take Vitamin C as they will help in your skin renewal and scar healing. Some flowerpodders recommend eating a kiwi a day, as kiwis contain a high amount of Vitamin C.<br><br>DOXYCYCLINE : side effect is nausea, so always take it after food, and not just a bit of food. Better to be a meal. If you still experience nausea, umm, I used to take anti-nausea tablets like metolon or that small yellow tablet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to remover pimple scars? Scars that have been there for years? Dark Blemishes on the face? Also the pores on my face are quite visible. Quite big. My face also oily always. As for Acne/pimple, its like occasional one or two in random spots on my face. I learnt not to squeeze them already so they would go away after sometime. But the really huge pimple would become dark and become like a dark spot on my face. How to get rid of the scars and dark spots? So many years already. I wash my face with facial wash morning and evening. During day, occasional wash with water. How leh? Any good skin care product out there which can regenerate the skin?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
