            <div class='col-md body'>1. do not scrub (excessively). it will irritate ur condition. making e pimples more angry looking.<br><br>2. avoid the sun, as it will irritate it further. also, some medication will make ur skin more sensitive to e sun. e.g AHA that u mentioned. others include anything tat contains retinol. if u have oily skin, u shld avoid it further, as it will cause more sebum excretion, as to make up for e dry skin.<br><br>3. drink lotsa fluid. more fruits, esp tomatoes. great for skin.<br><br>4. do not stop e doxycyline. i used to have more severe ache than u do. i was stuck on it for 6mths. a guideline, have to take it for at least one month. as mentioned, it will cause e bacteria (p.acne) to develop immunity towards doxycyline. this antibiotics itself is v safe and lesser side effects compared to tricyline and others....<br><br>5. rest well. hormonal changes can trigger ance too. (in my case, i was on e verge of breaking down during exams period.)<br><br>6. see a doctor. can try going to GP and refer you to NSC, or if u cant wait (like my case) i went to dermatologist in paragon.<br><br>7. always follow doc's instructions.<br><br>8. go for facials after ur acne attack: to maintain clear pores. acne occurs due to cloged pores and bateria infection.<br><br>it took me 2-3 weeks to develop acne, covering up to 80% of my face.<br>2-3mths for e pus pockets to go off<br>2-3mths for e red marks (normal pimple scars) to go off<br>till today, still having scars (pit like), freckles (from using AHA and retin-a) on my skin<br><br>medication does not work immediately. so give urself some time. patience is needed, as skin conditions are not acute. plus, it takes at least 2-3 weeks for skin renewal.<br><br>good luck</div>

(ie. wash your face regularly, change your pillow covers, dirty hands touching your face, etc)<br><br>2) Eat healthy.  Don't go to greasy spoons.  Don't eat greasy food.<br><br>3) Drink alot of water.  Water makes wonders.<br><br>4) Be Worry Free.  Stress causes acne.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>k,maybe you can try this.Stop taking in dairy product like milk,cheese,chocolate<br><br>I have read about this years ago on some health magazine,tried it out and it really stopped all the heavy acne i still had until my mid 20+.I used to have lot of acne the size of 5-10 cents coin large popping up all over my face since puberty and once i cut off almost every food item that contain a substantial amount of dairy product,they disappeared as well.Doing a simple test,i start taking in milk and such as per normal and they are back even till now when i am around 30<br><br>And i remember back in my early secondary school days,i used to love chocolate milk so much and drank quite a bit everyday,so zzzz they were the cause of much of my suffering and i was still happily drinking my daily poison.So well you can try this,but it is actually not that easy as it means giving up lots of stuff,no more stuff like milo(yes a major component of milo is from a dairy source),chocolate,pizza even cakes as tons of such food item uses milk or cheese.<br><br>Here are some articles link from the internet on this,or you can also just go google for dairy product/milk acne and you can get a pretty amount of links for info on it.<br><br><a href="http://www.milksucks.com/zits.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.milksucks.com/zits.asp</a><br><br><a href="http://www.soya.be/messages.php?message=dairy-acne" rel="nofollow">http://www.soya.be/messages.php?message=dairy-acne</a><br><br><a href="http://www.drweil.com/u/QA/QA356213/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drweil.com/u/QA/QA356213/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.acnehelp.org.uk/dairy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acnehelp.org.uk/dairy.htm</a></div>
