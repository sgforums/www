Thus, we climb down to rescue her. once we did, we started climbing back up, with the lady on my back. When we reach the top, we have to climb over a fence. When I did, I realised that I cant see my friend. He was nowhere in sight. Thus, I climb down again with the lady again to the stuck lfit.<br><br>Then I saw my friend. Please imagine someone in a bloody mass who had just committed suicide from jumping off something like 50 storeys or something. I was shocked. Very. The lady when crazy and started torturing herself and committed suicide by some very disgusting means. (I cant remember how she died). I was standing there, too shocked to do anything.<br><br>I woke up.<br><br>Lol.... Still got many dreams....<br><br>Do you guys go back to sleep when yo wake up from a dream?! I do!!! I always like to go back and sleep to continue the dream, it happened before and it was amazing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
