              <p>don;t believe in these slimming centres when they say they give free trial it is just a sale gimmick to get you there and force you to sign up package.   They are unprofessional and sickening.     May be you want to find out from people who have gone for chinese physician for slimming and decide if you want to go to them.    I have seen a fat ex classmate of mine went to chinese physician for slimming and I see the great difference in her before and after.    When I asked her the contact for this chinese physician, she refused to give, she is very selfish.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You will get slim in no time, Slimming centre are nothing but a place to breakdown their psychological blockage for those who thot that they cannot get slim by themselves. I guarantee that they will give u the same advices, and in the end, u will find that actually, you are the one doing the slimming yourself.</p>

              <p>Treat this as a lesson to learn, don't sign up without finding out more about any slimming centre.    YOu have paid for it unless they are willing to refund you, if not there is no way you will get your money back.    Learn from this bad experience and not fall into any trap set by any slimming, beauty centres in future.    I know how you feel as I have been thru.    I found out I was conned by Cenosis after I signed up, I wanted to give up but I refused to allow my money to go to waste, so I attended all the sessions.   In the end, they could not deliver what they promise and told me that it is difficult to get rid of the fats on the arm.    When they were talking me into signing up they said a different thing.</p>
              <p>Most slimming centres are cheaters, be very careful.    So far good comments I heard about slimming centre is Marie France.    Those who went for treatment said it is effective but expensive.   </p>

              <p>If you desperate going to slimming centre for help, go ask those you know who have gone to Marie France for comments.   If they all said good, effective, worth the money paid for then you can consider.    I may wanna try Marie France since I heard no bad comments about them.</p>

              <p>i went to london weight management for a trial.. but they like keep forcing me to sign up for the package instead of givin me a trial 1st,actually for my body size i do not need any special treatment as my body size still ok ..(not overweight) i thought to go for a free trial, end up force to sign up for the package cost $400.(5sessions) and i regret that why im sign up even im insisted that i do not want for this kind of package. their consultant keep pushing to selling the package instead of telling me what's the  treatment is included for trial session. i understand that theres no such a $$ refundable frm them, and i paid by credit card, there is no cancellation can be done since i had agreed the payment. any idea can help? (i havent start a treatment yet)</p>
