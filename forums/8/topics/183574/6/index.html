But somehow the reality in schools differ from what they look from the exterior. Top schools may give much more bad influence as compared to neighbourhood schools.<br><br>And so what if the PSLE scores are high? My sec school used to have a 265-er and ended up dropping out of school after being retained for 2 years.<br><br>3 -&gt; Dont forget some 220+ and 230+ schools are becoming better such as AMK, Fuhua and Jurong sec<br><br>4 -&gt; Above 265 can secure a place for sure.

            <div class='col-md body'>the importance of psle score is getting more significant.. especially with ip and stuff.. so it's better to study hard and score well for psle, as it could possibly affect the rest of your life. Most of the time, you'll be better attended to in the better sec schools (better teachers etc.) so it kinda acts as a foundation for your route to uni (if u wanna go there la..)<br><br>but not saying even if you score badly in psle = die. many ppl wake up and work really hard in sec sch days and they make it in the end also.. and possibly even outshine those who did well in pri sch days  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I took my PSLE last year. The top student last year was my classmate.<br><br>I seriously cannot give you any advice. Because I slacked off, I never really studied...so exams I panicked a bit. I'll bet last year quite a lot of people failed Maths. Cos I left out about five questions for Section C and I got a shock to know I received A*. Another shock to find out that my Malay, which I was pretty good at, was A.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Weird.<br><br>If you wanna know, my aggregate was 264.

            <div class='col-md body'>PSLE is perhaps what determines you next 6~8 years of education and to some extent your uni days and your future life.<br><br>Get a good PSLE score and get into a good school which offers IP and you do not need to fret for O lvls. Last time there was O lvls for those who did not really score well for PSLE to have a 2nd chance. Now with IP the places in the top JCs have reduced by quite a lot.<br><br>I am not going to pass judgement on IP cos I am one of the lucky ones that are in the first batch of IP students. PSLE is still important IMO. The hard work that you put in now will give you sweet rewards later. I personally did not regret studying for 3 months prior to my PSLE. Looking back, I am amazed at myself and still wonder if I can repeat the feat.<br><br>Maybe the best I can say is that PSLE is not for anybody but yourself. It does not matter whether your secondary school is one of the elite few top ones or those that are just slightly below them. What matters is that at the end of the day, you can get a job that you like and lead a hopefully more comfortable life. A good PSLE grade will just give you that nice start you need to fulfill your dreams.<br><br>It is a realistic world outside.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
