I think money can buy any form of happiness, at least most happiness. From what I see, without money, you cannot survive well. Without money, you cannot do things you want. Without money, you have to stress yourself with all sort of problems.<br><br>People say money cannot buy happiness, but from what I see, hear and feel, I think money can buy majority of happiness. Right now, I'm only 18 lah, maybe my opinion may change. What I feel is, I don't need to be the most wealthy people, I just need to be someone which can support my own needs without any problems.<br><br>I think because of this, the decision I made are always realistic. My friends also say I'm too realistic. Realistic in the sense that I always make the choice which will benefit me or at least not put me at a losing end, makes me do not dream anymore, for example, not making a choice and hoping that it may go my way.<br><br>From young, my parents always remind me this is a dog eat dog world and as I grow older, I begin to realise what my parents means.
