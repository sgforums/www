              <p>And TS, ppl ask u simple question to clear this mess up by not making story of the party OWNED by you fucktard? The fuck already got 3 ppl at least can prove that the party is organised by company event and u got nothing but your own shit and u still dont wanna answer the question, how old r u ? No one teach u to answer properly ?</p>
              <p>FOr the reporter i dont know what the reporter post, but wataever it is , its the reporter's mistake , that i agree.</p>
              <p>But for posting ppl's picture and saying its a party organised by her/himself is totally like an idiot. Why make stupid story like that and involving ppl in the picture?</p>
              <p>For now i believe the 3 of them rather than u. If u said they are clones. Dont u think u would like to create another clone to help u support your so-called bullshit party ?</p>
              <p>Well, if u got so many evidences then show it to us !!! Dont turn this story upside down and threatening ppl like this. Where the fuck u coming from ?</p>
              <p>Where did u get the picture anyway ?? U cant even answer this simple question !!</p>
              <p>Nvm we shall wait what more bullshit u will talk unless u prove us evidence.. So do the 3 of the involved party..</p>
              <p>Fucktards, one kiasu , another wan to make things right. which one? Fuck Bitch.</p>
              <p>Better come up with evidence. Then we will know whos the bitch creating this stupid story and make fun of the picture. Censored? U can still recognised the face feature. Jus why dont censored the whole face?</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Hello all,</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Had read the starting of this thread, the Wan Bao and my gosh, 25 pages and running in this thread! Just like to share my view as 'a member of public' and I'm coming it as objective as possible.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">For val's part, yes, if she's out to ruin the couple's life, she would not have even need to cover the eyes already. Not only that she could have outrightly name the individuals involved.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Whether is this a single's game or a company christmas/birthday game, it's quite difficult for me to decide. Because each side has their stories to tell.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">However, if this is a company event thing, I'll like to tell the parties involved, that you can say no to it. I mean, we are grown ups, and as kopiosatu had stated, it is really a stupid game. And anything that is taken down as picture and/or video, will always have this opportunity to get circulated out of your so-call internal circles. So knowing that this game is stupid, knowing that there will be pictures taken, and yet getting yourselves involved, who can you blame? Maybe, the reporter for spinning the wrong tale (as the parties involved would have claimed) or the photographers or the company who organised this lah! If it's really organised by the company, you should feedback to your management and asked them to clarify the matter, then case close liao mah.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">When I was in Brunei, I was instructed to kill a quail as part of a training. I refused. I said I will kill a real enemy in war but not a defenceless bird. I got ridiculed. Tired, in the hot and humid jungle, got my integrity, courage and religion ridiculed, I insisted my belief. I was under regimentation that time and defying an order could get me into trouble.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Now you're out working, what has it got to lose to tell your company 'no lah, I don't think I want to play this game 'cos I think it's embarassing for me.'.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">What's so hard in saying that?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">And if the couple wrapped together is really a couple, then also nothing 'cheap' to speak of what.</span></strong></p>

              <p>you can even come up with "im the one who organised this event" kinda crap.</p>
              <p>then can i ask for more photos from the event? why is it that you only post up one photo?</p>

              <p>ms val.</p>
              <p>i think what needs to be done here is a very simple clarification to the poeple reading this forum. like i have said since last night, i am not the alex that you believe to be the one in the picture. seriously, you've gotten this all wrong. you have caused unnecessary problems for both me and the girl.</p>
              <p>this in the only thing that i hope you can do. if you insist that the guy in the picture is alex, i really can't do much unless you are willing to meet up with me and alex. this is a major misunderstanding on your part. but that's just one part.</p>
              <p>i believe that the seriousness of this whole thing is that you have fabricated a story. you made people believe a picture that has absolutely nothing to do with your on-going propaganda. if you insist on sticking to your story then you are just lying to yourself and the others reading. and the worse lie a person can make is to one's self.</p>
              <p>think about it val. you have already buried yourself knee deep into your own bag of deception. like i said last night, errors can be salvaged and corrected. people forgive and forget. yup. if you still refuse to come clean with this, i am left with no choice. i have to protect the girl as well as myself.</p>
              <p>i really hope you will clear this matter with me. thank you.</p>

              <p>Maybe should get parliment enact a bill . Close - proximity for
              muslims n non-muslims alike is an offence punisheble by DEATH. then
              no problem liaw.</p>
              <p>everyone can refuse on the grounds that its an offence.</p>
              <p>Sometimes i think its not good to reject on the grounds of
              embarassment. If u reject because of ur inability to perform
              approprietly and by its supposed standards , then fair enough. Work
              games etc.. there is a reason there are activities like this. Team
              building , team bonding.. erm.. singe party =P or whatever. Think
              should be o.k to participate. But regardless of all that , pictures
              taken , nothing we can do. we can only confront when we find out
              that the pictures were mis-appropriately used and demand an
              explaination. Or u can start suing. To keep ppl in thier place.</p>
