              <p>and my point of meeting you is to clarify this matter. to show you who i really am. to let you see that you've really gotten it all wrong. i'm not the kind to beat somebody up. not for this. cos it's actually a misunderstanding on your part.</p>

              <p>if this is what you guys wana know. yes.<strong> i'm the one in the picture</strong>. and it has seriously affected my relationship with the girl. i'm not asking anyone to be sorry for me. but i just need everyone to know that the picture is not some silly party games that our ms val has organised. to add on, i was clueless when i saw the article. why you may ask. because<strong> i'm not chinese</strong>. it is a big deal to me and her.</p>
              <p>i understand that it wasn't your intention that to get it to the post. but it has. and you don't need a table to apologize. just say it and mean it and come clean, with the truth.</p>

              <p>Maybe should get parliment enact a bill . Close - proximity for muslims n non-muslims alike is an offence punisheble by DEATH. then no problem liaw.</p>
              <p>everyone can refuse on the grounds that its an offence.</p>
              <p>Sometimes i think its not good to reject on the grounds of embarassment. If u reject because of ur inability to perform approprietly and by its supposed standards , then fair enough. Work games etc.. there is a reason there are activities like this. Team building , team bonding.. erm.. singe party =P or whatever. Think should be o.k to participate. But regardless of all that , pictures taken , nothing we can do. we can only confront when we find out that the pictures were mis-appropriately used and demand an explaination. Or u can start suing. To keep ppl in thier place.</p>
