              <p>No lah, I think what surfer meant was, the next time you post a photograph, think before you act.</p>
              <p>Especially without the consent of both subjects, it could lead to dire consequences. In this case, casting the girl in rather negative light very publicly.</p>
              <p>Games with intimate physical contact are very common, this one just happened to make it to the headlines.</p>

              <p>Like u said it common, so why are ppl making a big deal abt it? and there's nothing i can do now. Burnt SPH? burnt all newspaper?</p>

              <p>i'll come clean if you will. i just want to know where you get the pictures from.</p>
              <p>anyways. about the lift, isn't it a totally different circumstance? and i believe someone rational wouldn't want to get into a lift that full.</p>
              <p>why not we end this?</p>
              <p>if this is what you guys wana know. yes. i'm the one in the picture. and it has seriously affected my relationship with the girl. i'm not asking anyone to be sorry for me. but i just need everyone to know that the picture is not some silly party games that our ms val has organised. to add on, i was clueless when i saw the article. why you may ask. because i'm not chinese. it is a big deal to me and her.</p>
              <p>i understand that it wasn't your intention that to get it to the post. but it has. and you don't need a table to apologize. just say it and mean it and come clean, with the truth.</p>

              <p>you're missing my point. the picture is a picture. it's the way you portrayed it. the content mattered. it's all about the content. and fyi,i am the guy. i'm merely doing all i can to protect someone i care very much about. isn't that human nature?</p>
              <p>as i was saying. you made it seem that the 2 of us were strangers and then binded together. that is totally not true isn't it? and yes, i directed fabrication here cos fabrication wants to know what all this is about.</p>
              <p>but then again. what will you be trying to prove by posting more photos? you're telling me that you have all of the 50 odd photos we took that day? i used to look at those photos laughing, but now i look at it at a totally different light. the same light that you have shed onto the girl.</p>
              <p>so you still think you're right?</p>

              <p>Distasteful tabloid news.</p>
              <p>Still too early to pin the real consequences but even if the public forgets this article in time, something tells me this will cause (or already has) distress to the 2 featured kids, especially the girl.</p>

              <p>What you can do now is make an attempt at clarifying what actually happened in the picture objectively. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
