              <p>whatever it is.</p>
              <p>all i'm trying to do is to protect the chastity of the girl. in normal circumstances, guys can take a truck load of crap. but girls are much more gentler. i don't think any girl, be it open minded or not, can take in such a forum. it's an insult to the girl.</p>
              <p>the truth.</p>
              <p>the girl in the picture knows the guy. and the guy knows the girl. very well. this is not 2 strangers getting tied up for the purpose of knowing each other. both of them has bypassed that stage of getting to know each other. they are more than stangers to each other.</p>
              <p>to say this is a scandal might be too harsh but this is what it is. it is something disgraceful to the victims. some of you might have knocked yourself out believing such a thing actually exists, but it does not.</p>
              <p>val. i'm thankful that you apologise. but i don't think you're really sorry. you still think i'm making this up. i really think that you lack of integrity. i won't post up the other 2 photos cos as i've mentioned it's for internal circulation. and i HAVE the uncensored photos. what do you gain by doing this? do you relish at others misery?</p>
