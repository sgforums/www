              <p>Firstly I will like to say this first, yes I know the 2 person in the picture, secondly yes i was at the place where it happened, thirdly i can even say this out loud that i was one of the person that wrap them up, lastly no surfer did not ask me to come post here I'm here on my own cause i can't stand looking at my friends getting all this.</p>
              <p>What i would like to say is ms val you dun get the choice of "playing" this so call game, which dumb person will be willing to get wrap up and slap around like nobody business. Will you ms val be willing to be wrap up like this? I don't think so. How will you feel if you are the person in the picture? Touch your heart when you think about it.</p>
              <p>As for your so called event, I will give you the benfit of a doubt that you really have it, but sadly the picture you used is not from your event. Not only you are lying to the people in this forum, you are lying to yourself.</p>
              <p>My advise to you is next time when you want to use a picture, please use something that is yours from your event and not something that you leeched from somewhere else. My final words for you will be, go back to your so called singles party and play with your singles there and stop destorying the life of others.</p>

              <p>the way you post your comments gave me that tinge. have i ever done anything wrong to you for you to do this? honestly, i don't think i know you. but somehow i believe that you're somehow close enough cos you were able to obtain the picture.</p>
              <p>as for SPH, i have already spoken to them. my aim here is to actually clear the air and to find out from you where did you actually get the picture. so why not you just tell me? wouldn't it just end everything? let's make it easier for both of us.<br> thanks.</p>
