            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Submitted by: Hairil Zainal<br><br>From: Sengkang<br>Title: Terror Tekong<br><br>Well the 5 month i spent in Tekong were the greatest you must think i am crazy to say that but hay its a cool place [during the day i mean] you really feel in touch with nature there. Oklah lets start my story. Its nearly 4 am in the morning so forgive my spelling.<br><br>When i was at 2 bts or better known as Pulau Tekong in 95, the place wa really creepy at night. The total silent you hear yourself breath and whats more worst doing guard duty at night. What even worst doing it on a week end when theres no body there. Theres this one time that i never forget. We were told by the guard commander to patrol the perimeter of the camp and one such area was behind the bunks. For those who have been there and know camp 3, if my memory serve me well, was a 7 level barracks like a flat. It is said that [oh man my hair standing just thinking about it] The corner toilet 2 level next to the stairs were haunted the toilet doors were nailed shut. It is said to be the nest of a pontianak. Some say a soldier kill himself there. As we were walking behind the toilet which was above, me and my buddy heard one of the toilet doors slam hard [by the way this happen on a week end no body around] Both my buddy and me frezze on the spot. He was 5 meters away from me. He was looking at me. His motion me to look out to check out where the noise came from[in my heart gila ke budak ni / siow ah want me to look up] I shake my head and motion with my hands to keep calm and move on.<br><br>By now we were walking side by side fearing for what we gonna encounter next. As we reach the officer bunk, it got cold and really dark behind the officers barrack. To our left, a few meters away was the jungle. At the end of the bunk, there is this one corner where they throw old desk and chairs. Its like a dumping ground. Its also suppose to be the most haunted spot in the area. As we walking to one of the check point which pass the spot, our lights died. My face was pale as hell so was my buddy. Lucky for me, my buddy was the kiasu type. He got spare light with him.<br><br>As we reach near the spot, my buddy was walking to check point to sign in. I was standing there waiting for him as he turn back walking to me and facing the dumping area, he stood in his tracks. His eyes wide open. He was saying something like [siam! siam! the idiot me heard he was saying mee siam mee siam, where the hell we gonna find mee siam at these hour .. in tekong some more siow ! siow! i say back] But as i got near to him [shoot hair standing again], i could see fear in his eyes and he was looking something behind me. Only than i heard something sounds like grunting gerrrrr gerrrrr. In my mind, i was thinking that it might be a warthog u know like [phumba and timon the cartoon] but if it was, it have charge at us by now. I start to smell something bad, something rotten as my hair stood up. I know what my buddy was looking at. Scared as hell, i know it was a pontianak.<br><br>By then, my buddy was shaking. I grab his arm. I call his name 2 times then he look at me. I told him shut your eyes and trust me. He nod his head and shut his eyes. After a few prayer with my back facing the dumping ground, i side step and pull my buddy along with me. It was like leading the blind. After we cleard the area, we ran all the way back to the guard post.<br><br>I asked him what he saw. He just shake his head [tell u when we go home tomorrow on the rpl] That what he told me. On the rpl next day, i asked again with a pale face and a shaking voice. He said he saw a women sitting on a desk. She was naked with cuts all over her body, dirty as corpes. Long hair cover her face, covering a blacken face with red blood eyes looking at him. Whats even worst, she was eating something ..... What? What? was .......she eating...It..look..it..look..like she was..eating ...a ..baby [ohhh god thank god i did not look cause i might freeze too] She was coverd in blood. Blood dripping every where and when i look at the floor, she got no legs. Man, no freaking legs that was the last we ever talk about it. May be some of u guys know the spot that i talk about. Those of you who were in Tekong in 95.<br><br>Well guys, that it. I hope after reading my story, all of you will have a good nite sleep. I know i won't. Good morning guys, god be with you. And for those still in Tekong, i pray that u wont encounter what my buddy and i did.<br><br></strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<img src="http://www.the-exorcist.co.uk/pictures/pics/exorfc2.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Little Evil Creatures<br>by Kok Heng<br><br>Hougang<br><br><strong> All my encounters happened late at night and only on Hungry Ghost month. I never knew why I would wake up, but when I did I saw some very disturbing things. Every time it was the same thing: short (about 3-1/2 ft.) and fat creatures walking quickly up and down the hallway. Being very dark I could only see their outlines. The closest thing to compare them to are trolls. They never paid any attention to me; they seemed to be very busy - at what I don't know. I would get the feeling that they were taking something that belonged to me and knew I had to stop all of them and get it back. When I would try get up, I was always paralyzed and unable to speak. I would try to yell but could only get out little grunts. I had this experience about 20 times in a three-year period.<br><br>The only time I wasn't paralyzed was the first night. I was asleep on my sofa, woke up and saw the first creature. Of course, I didn't believe my eyes, but then three more went scurrying by and I jumped at them. I forgot about my coffee table and fell over it smacking my shoulder into the door jamb (better than my head, I guess). When I landed, I saw about 10 of these things 10 feet away. They walked away farther down the hall and vanished.<br><br>After 9/11, I wanted to find out more about the Muslim religion, but I thought I should read the Old and New Testaments of The Bible first. I was reading for three nights about four hours a night. On the third night I woke up with the feeling that the little guys were back, but I didn't see anything. I closed my eyes, briefly opened them again and saw a taller, dark figure peering at me, leaning its upper body around the door frame. I jumped up and was surprised I wasn't paralyzed, and so was the figure in the door. My heart was beating so fast and I felt strong. I chased the figure down the hallway toward the top of the stairwell. I saw the back of figure the whole time I was running down the hall  until it vanished into the outside wall. I still don't know what was in my apartment, but I think they were evil, and reading The Bible gave me strength that I never had before. I have yet to decide what religion I want to practice, but I feel as long as I keep studying them I have protection.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.zombienews.com/leprechaun04.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">Visitors across the causeway !!!<br><br>This is another famous story that was circulated around Singapore at least twice.<br>The first time I heard this tale was way back in the early 80's. That was when I was in primary one. It was rumoured that a Malay woman from across the causeway was so obsessed about becoming beautiful that she went to see the bomoh for advice. (Well blame it on the media, our society, culture and men for promoting these stupid ideas) The bomoh told her that, to become beautiful she had to drink the blood of 100 young virgins and that was how she started her blood sucking spree. What I can't figure out was why did she come all the way to Singapore and how did she develop her fangs! (hahahah)<br><br>This lady was said to be wearing only white and she would only come out after dark. The rumour really scared all of us out of our skins at that time because we kids used to believe anything. The worst part was, my then classmate's friend's, friend's mother's friend's daughter, (don't give me that look) was victimised and had to be hospitalised for a serious blood transfusion. I heard she nearly died. The press later issued a warning statement.<br><br>A few years ago in 1996(thereabouts), another spate of this rumour started. Similar story (from J.B and all) but this time it was another woman who only wanted young Malay virgin's blood. I heard this from my ex-colleague who told me that her friend's friend's cousin was victimised. According to her, this girl was alone at home when the pontianak came. She was hypnotised against her will and so she could not fight back.<br><br>Hours later, her mother found her pale body lying on the floor with two distinctive marks on her neck. She was hospitalised and kept in a secluded part of a ward to prevent the public from getting alarmed but the story got out anyway. The press issued another warning to squash the rumour which immediately died out again. When I asked my friend, she told me that her friend could not be contacted.<br><br>There are still no clues as to whether vampires really exist or not but if you're reading this in the dead of the night and can't sleep already, here are some tips on how to live a vampire free life.<br><br>(1)Wear a string of garlic around your neck because pontianaks can't stand the stench.<br><br>(2)The only way to kill it is to drive a stake through its heart so always carry a sharp object like a pencil with you.<br><br>(3)Wear plastic pincers on your nose as pontianaks are known to have bad breath.<br><br>(4)Lastly, if any of these don't work, don't blame me, blame hollywood.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Abu never believed in ghost and some times he would laugh at my friends and I when we were talking about ghost. All that changed on that fateful night when we were discussing about some flute music coming through the walls late at night.<br><br>The story has it that there was a couple who were deeply in love with each other. They even vowed to live and die together. For some reason or others, the girl hanged herself one day. The boy was very sad and he played his flute every night while thinking of his love. Several nights later, his girl's spirit came back and asked him to fulfil his vows. The boy was in a dilemma. He loved her so much but he really didn't want to die yet. However, the girl kept haunting him and finally he gave in. He hanged himself at the same spot the living couple always meet. Since then, some flute music could be heard occasionally in the night. we can hear the flute music.<br><br>Abu heard our stories and said, "If there really is a ghost in this hostel, why until now it is only scaring other guys but not me? Is the ghost afraid of me?"<br><br>We tried to stop him for fear of upsetting the ghosts. However, being too sceptical a person he is, he wouldn't take us seriously.<br><br>That night we all went to bed at about 11pm. As usually I perform my prayers and then go to bed. At about 2am in the morning, Abu were screaming so loudly that everyone near us came rushing into our room. I got up and switched on the lights.<br><br>Abu looked very pale and his body were shaking in his shock. We tried to calm him down. Then, we tried to ask him what's wrong but he didn't want to talk about it. Everyone left afterwards and Abu insisted that we keep the lights on for the rest of the night.<br><br>In the morning, Abu told us what actually happened to him. He was sleeping soundly when he heard a girl calling out to him. He woke up and realised it came from outside. He looked out the window saw a very beautiful girl floating in mid-air. She was still calling out for him as she came nearer and nearer to him.<br><br>Abu was afraid but he refused to believe it's true. So he kept staring at the girl until she's right in front of him. Abu could literally breath into her face then. At that moment, she stopped calling his name and her facial expression changed immediately. Her look was full of anger and hatred, its eyes were raging in fire.<br><br>Then, she asked, "Sekarang percaya tak (Do you believe now)?"<br><br>Abu stared at her in shocked until she vanished. Then, he started screaming on top of his lung.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~harleyd/images/headspin.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Leave Him Alone!<br><br>That hostel in NUS was of three storeys high and there are rooms being occupied by male students of all ages. Some of the older boys can be a bully at times to the younger boys. One of the older boys learnt his lesson one day when he met something not so pleasant as he was trying to bully a younger student.<br><br>It was past midnight, Min was at his friend's room on the second floor for a chit chat. Before long, he realised how late it was and asked wish his friends good night as he leave to go back to his own room. It was a hot night with occasional breeze. The whole place is quiet with exception of the familiar sound of insects outside the building. It was just another usual weeknight when many tend to go to bed earlier.<br><br>Min was walking slowly towards the room on the ground floor. As he was getting towards the first floor, he saw a boy sitting down at the end of the staircase. Min did not recall seeing that boy around before. Maybe it's just one of those studious students who never mix around with them. He looks much younger than Min himself.<br><br>The boy had his arms on his knees with his face buried on his arms. From behind, he looked as if he is sleeping. As Min got near, he can't help but to disturb the boy.<br><br>"Hey boy! What are you doing here? Crying? Oh, cry baby! If you want to cry, go to your room and cry. Or go to your Mummy and cry. Don't sit down here and block my way!"<br><br>The boy ignored him and just stayed still. Min was annoyed because the boy doesn't seem to be scared of him, who is very much bigger in size and in age. So, he got nearer to that boy and gave him a slight kick on his legs. "Come on! Get lost!"<br><br>Then the boy sat up straight and slowly turned his face towards Min. As he turned around, Min could see that the boy has got no face. There's just a plain piece of skin without a mouth, nose or eyes.<br><br>Min was motionless for a moment. He stared straight on the boy's featureless face. He doesn't know what to do for once. He wanted to scream but the voice never came out. His mind gone blank.<br><br>Then the boy started to move again. He was trying to stand up. Suddenly Min started running away. Before he knew it, the boy was chasing behind! He ran as fast as possible while kept looking back. All these while, he could see that boy chasing behind. He got into his room, slam his door real hard and rush into his bed. He quickly covered himself up with the blanket and shivering with fear. He was still in a shock and stayed under his blanket praying.<br><br>Then he heard someone opening the door and walked a few steps in. Then the door was shut. Min was petrified but dare not get up and see who it was. He could sense the person walk straight up to his bed and stand right next to the bed. His fear got the better of him and he may have fainted there and then. The next thing he knew was it was morning already and he was sweating under his blanket because of the heat. He realised he was not in his pyjamas and recalled what had happened the night before. He told his friends and since then, never dare walking back to his room late at night when everyone's off to bed.<br><br></strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<img src="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~harleyd/images/barf.gif"></div>

Oddly enough, my school organised a parents-teacher meeting that night to discuss some matters pertaining to the school.<br><br>My school is big and old. It has a lot of hidden places that only few students and teachers know of. One of our favourite spot is this slopy open area at the back of the school. We nicknamed it "hao san", literally "back-hill". We often go there to have a little picnic during lunch hour but we had never been near it at night. There were stories from the seniors that a girl hanged herself there in the past and had since haunted the place at night. To go there, one has to go through a series of steps and through a gate. The place is not lit at night and on a moonless night like that night, one could easily get lost inside.<br><br>Anyway, Brad chickened out, saying that the story was true and that he won't go up. However, my sister suggested that we tie ourselves to one another with a long rope and got up there together. It sounded like a good idea. After all, not many believed the story. So, we found a rope and we were all set to venture into "hao san" in the dark.<br><br>We walked carefully up the stairs. No doubt all of us were had our fears but nobody dared to say anything. It was so dark we could hardly see each other. After passing the gate, I realised the knot of the rope was untied and I've lost everyone! I was really scared by then. I didn't know what to do but know better than to venture further into the dark. So, I quickly turned around and headed back down. Just as I was about to leave, I heard a voice saying, going so soon? The voice was so eerie and spooky. I knew it couldn't have been my friends so I just ignored it and climbed down the stairs. While descending the stairs, I could sense a strong smell of burning candles.<br><br>I ran to the basketball court hoping that the rest would be there waiting for me. But there was no one there. I was too petrified to go back into "hao san" to look for them so I decided to wait for them there.<br><br>A few minutes past before Joe came back followed by my sister, Brad and Jenny. Apparently, everyone was separated once we passed the gate and no one knew where Krissy was.<br><br>We were worried for Krissy. We decided to go near the stairs and shout for her. We were too afraid to go inside again. Krissy only showed herself almost an hour later. When she came down, she was so pale and so scared that she was shivering in a state of shock. None of them heard any voices even though everyone smelt the burning candle. Krissy, however, encountered the ghost of the girl who hanged herself there.<br><br>Krissy told us her story later.<br><br>"We had just passed the gate when I realised I had lost you guys. The rope was like cut and it was totally silent in there. I called out for you all but nobody answered me. I was getting really scared by then. I looked around in the dark and all I could see was a bright red glow near a tree. I didn't know what to do and I thought you guys might be there. So, I headed towards the light.<br><br>"I got to some bushes near a tree but I couldn't found the source of the red glow in that area. Then, I suddenly felt some water dripping onto my face. I thought it was raining, but when I looked above, I saw a girl hanged to the tree with a noose on her neck and she was staring down at me, smiling an evil grin! The water dripping down on me was actually blood!<br><br>"I was so scared I just ran away. I kept turning to look behind and she would always be near. I wasn't sure if she was chasing me or I just never moved a bit even though I ran with all my might. A short moment later, I think I tripped over something as I remember I fell to the ground and fainted. When I woke up, I heard people calling me from afar. I was hoping it was you guys. I walked towards the noises and soon I came upon the gate. And yes, as I was climbing down the stairs, there was this strong and peculiar smell, like something being burnt...."<br><br>Brad interrupted, "It was the smell of candles burning. We all smelt it too but no one saw anything."<br><br>"Anyway, I was too afraid to give it much thought then. You couldn't imagine how relieved I was to see you all then," Krissy was clearly terrified.<br><br>After that incident, we no longer venture into "hao san". Nevertheless, we did some research and found out from some teachers the story of the girl who hanged herself there. Apparently, she was pregnant with her boyfriend's baby. Feeling completely lost and helpless, she hanged herself there one afternoon. Some three months later, her boyfriend was killed in a car crash. His face bore a horrified look; his eyes wide opened, as if he had seen a ghost....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.zombienews.com/frightnight203.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Story by Nazreen<br><br>As my dad was a policeman, we got to travel a lot around Sabah. One day, we went to Kota Belud, a small, cowboy-like town in Sabah. We were having a great time as it was indeed a beautiful place. Nevertheless, our wonderful experience there were shattered by an incident that happened to me just before we left Kota Belud.<br><br>Before arriving, my dad already warned my brothers and I to recite some verse from the Quran and to say "Bismillah" each time we were about to do anything while we were at Kota Belud. I thought his direction was a bit strange, but we just obeyed anyway. Furthermore we were still young and have been taught well not to question the elders unnecessarily.<br><br>On that fateful day, my dad brought us to a restaurant for lunch before we go home. As we sat down, I noticed an old man was staring at us. The strange thing was he looked at us with a straight face and eyes that gave me the creeps. I noticed he didn't even blink his eyes once. After a while, that old man smiled at me, and to my horror, his face slowly changed! Then, there it was, a gory looking thing, with sharp fangs on his mouth and blood all over his face. I was petrified but I was still staring at him. I couldn't move a muscle and I just sat there numbed. The old man then slowly stood up and walked towards me. However, he disappeared into thin air after a few steps.<br><br>I gathered back my senses and turned around. I started crying uncontrollably and told my father what I had just witnessed. My dad, appearing calm, immediately ordered us to get into the car, and took off. He drove so fast I was afraid we might skidded off the road. However, I was still in a state of shock and would rather prefer to reach home sooner.<br><br>Once we got home, my dad asked my brothers to go to their bedrooms, while he took me out to see an old lady friend of his. She was supposed to be pawang, a traditional witchcraft doctor. She told us that the 'thing' was sent as a warning to my dad, telling him to leave his position and to go back to Peninsular Malaysia. Apparently, there was a man who wanted his job for a long time and was so frustrated when my dad got the job on a transfer from Peninsular Malaysia. I wasn't even supposed to see the 'thing', but strangely, I did. My dad then told us why he was speeding all the home home earlier. He said, through his rear view mirror, he saw a headless man chasing after us trying to jump onto the car. He thought the best way to lose it was to drive as fast as he could! The pawang said the 'thing' wanted to follow us home, in order to get to me, who saw it at the restaurant earlier that day.<br><br>I was scared to my wits, I didn't make it to school the next day. When I told my friends about it, they said that Kota Belud was indeed famous for being the 'darkest' area in the whole of Sabah. They said that they should have warned me before going. Now, I would appreciate it if someone could verify this.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><img src="http://www.zombienews.com/frightnight206.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chamenos!! Highway story.<br><br><strong>This story went public the first time when someone called in to the radio during a ghost story programme. What make this story even more interesting are the several calls later from witnesses and relatives to verify that the story is true.<br><br>The incident happened on a Malay couple with a small baby. They were driving along the expressway on a late night. It must have been past 2am then and there aren't many private cars at those hours. As they got near the tunnel, their car broke down. Perhaps it is the hilly road, which put a lot of stress on the car, that caused the car to broke down more than anything else.<br><br>The man stopped his car along the emergency lane and got off the car to see if there was anything he could do. His wife was sitting at the back of the car with their baby then. He got off the car, opened up the engine and apparently was doing something there. The wife just waited in the car with their baby since she is the type of people who has the slightest idea about cars.<br><br>As the engine cover was turned up, the lady could not see what her husband was doing in front. Then, there was no noise at all. She started to get worried. Perhaps more worried about not being able to get out of there than if there would be anything wrong with her husband. Then the baby started crying. She carried her up and tried to calm her down. However, the baby kept crying and crying.<br><br>Afterwards, she noticed two police cars drove by. They slowed down as they past her. As she thought they would stop, the police cars suddenly sped off. Then she heard a shrieking break of the police cars ahead. Apparently, the police stopped their cars under the lights of the tunnel about 100 metres ahead.<br><br>Then, she started hearing the policemen shouting at her. They shouted at her and asked her to get out of the car and run towards them. She got panic upon hearing that. Then, worry about her baby's and her own safety, she grabbed her baby, got out of the car and started running as fast as she could towards the policemen. As she was running, they kept shouting at her to hurry and asked her not to look back. As she almost got to where the policemen were, she suddenly thought of her husband. She turn her head back to take a look while continued running.<br><br>To her horror, she saw three 'pontianak' (see notes) with lots of blood on their mouth. She saw one of them holding her husband's head and licking off the dripping blood while two others were busy sucking the blood from the man's body.<br><br>Two policemen, fearing that she may stop running upon seeing that, rushed to her and dragged her into one of the police car. They shot off as fast as they could after that. Seven policemen witnessed this incident. When the police got there, the man was lying there headless and 'bloodless'. The police, after interviewing the widow and the seven policemen who witnessed the incident, decided to close the case.<br><br>In the radio programme, someone called up later to say that he was one of the policemen there at that time while another called up claiming to be the victim's uncle. He said he refused to believe the story and had applied for the case to be reopened for investigation. He believes it was a murder case. Another caller said his sister, the widow, was distressed after the incident and he appealed to all listeners to believe that the story is true and be more careful on the highway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></strong><br><img src="http://www.fortunecity.com/lavender/mockingbird/124/mutilator2.jpg"></div>
