            <div class='col-md body'>At Maria's house we started this ouija thing, the board typed out that something named GP was following me and would continue to do so until I stopped using the board. I thought about it and decided Maria HAD to be pulling one over on me.<br><br>This went on for weeks.  I would go over, we would play, we would get freaked out, etc.  I started to pick up a presence when using it.  More startling, I would pick up this presence away from the board.  This was bad because around this time I was doing a lot of seances for people.  I couldn't have something following me around.<br><br>I decided to go see my priest.  I told him what I had been doing and the presence I was sensing. He said he did not believe the board had anything to do with it.  He said it was my imagination.  So, later that night, I asked my Christan Education teacher.  She had a different view.  She asked me first if I ever blessed the circle before I did a seance?  Did I put a ring of protection around the circle?  I said no.  She said try it and see what happens.<br><br>My next seance was at Maria's house.  (Convenient eh?)  Well, what happened there was an event which would leave 12 people completely terrified.  When we began the seance, I put a ring of protection around the circle.  I then felt the presence and it felt extremely annoyed.<br><br>I looked over at Maria and asked where the Ouija board was.  She replied that it was in her closet.  I was a little worried about the presence being related to the board, but decided to continue anyway.<br><br>Immediately, Maria began to feel very ill.  Her older sister did, too.  I told everone not to break the circle for any reason because I was going to have to rid ourselves of this presence.  They said they would not break, but everyone said they felt terrible anxious.  I told them whatever was here was very angry and it was making them feel concern.<br><br>It was here where I detected a strange odor, like burnt paper.  I looked at my hands and saw there were black ashes on them.  I then asked the group if they had anything on their hands.  (I made sure not to say what was on my hands, so as not to plant anything in their minds.)  Everyone responded, ASH.<br><br>I don't know what made me do this, but I had this vision in my mind to act. I jumped up from my chair, raced to the sink and drew a bowl of water.  I then made a drawing of what I believed the presence to be.  The eyes were what got to me.  They were almost like a serpent, but I had a feeling this was a man who only wanted me to believe I was dealing with a serpent.<br><br>I burned the picture and tossed it into the bowl of water, which I had placed within the center of the table.  Here, one by one people started to lose control.  Maria was weeping in her chair.  She said she felt awful and scared and that something was making her upset, but she couldn't stop it.<br><br>Without warning, the screen door next to the table burst open.  This was followed by the main door.  The doors came crashing close and with all of us watching, each lock was turned!  Then, the doors began to vibrate and pound as if someone was outside trying to get it.  The door shook for over a minute.<br><br>The next morning, a porcelain angel on the shelf behind mother came out from BEHIND a pair of salt and pepper shakers and smashed at my feet. Maria's mother gasped.<br><br>I was truly shocked.  Without thinking, I raced to Maria's closet grabbed the Ouija board and tossed it into the cellar.  Both Maria and her mother told me I was overreacting.  But, I didn't think so.  Her little brother decided he would go into the basement to retrieve the board.<br><br>As soon as he was five steps down, he started yelling at the top of his lungs.  He came racing up the stairs and slammed the door shut.  He hollered through the door for Teresa to stop throwing tennis balls at her. Teresa then joined him where he was standing,  from behind the door.  He screamed, "Who threw all those tennis balls at me?"<br><br>We then decided together the entire family would walk into the basement to retrieve the board.  It was NOT at the bottom of the stairs.  We all looked at each other.  How had this thing moved???  Maria's father, mother, sister and brother were all upstairs with me, so none of us had moved it, nor had a chance to.  We were in sight when the brother started down the stairs and Maria's mother had seen the balls being thrown.<br><br>We searched together.  I looked under a work table.  (Bad decision.) Suddenly, Maria's brother and mother were shrieking.  "Hold up your hands!" I instantly put my hands up. The drill attached to the table was falling over.  It was too heavy for me to hold so thank the Lord her brother reached me in time.  It took her mother, brother and myself to heave this back onto the work table.  It was one of those enormous drills which was used for serious woodwork!  When her father came over, he said to me, "This drill had been attached to this table for years.  Look, all the screws are out!"<br><br>My nerves were shrieking.<br><br>Suddenly, Maria declared that she had found the board buried under some other games.  Her mother grabbed the board, escorted me upstairs and showed me to the door.  She said it was nothing personal, but I would not be<br>allowed back at her house.  I went home determined to lose the board.  I literally hurled it into the garage when I got home.  I went upstairs, opened my closet door and grabbed a hangar for my coat when the entire shelf collapsed. I had moved just in time not to get hit. Funny thing is my sister's art project was on the shelf.  She had been working with two huge cement--what I called "tires"--spheres.  I stepped back and looked at the mess.  I then went back to the garage, walked to a friend's house and gave them the board.  I told them everything and they said, "No problem."  When I next saw them and asked them if anything had happened with the board, they made no reply, but later told me they no longer had it. What happened to them, I wonder? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://209.150.105.49/imageofhorror/720c.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>This story happened on 12 October 1984 when we had a gathering at our school hall. BM Secondary School is, in fact, a very old school and had seen itself through various misfortunes especially during the times of war and communist threat.<br><br>It was about 10pm, the sky is clear and the weather is just nice. Everything seems perfect and everyone was having a great time until Ah Ming left out a scream and collapsed on the floor. He was struggling to scream for help. He was obviously in pain and he kept holding on to his neck. Apparently, it looked to us as if he was choking or being strangled.<br><br>My friend and I rushed out of the hall to get help while another stay with Ah Ming to see if he can help in any way. One of our teachers heard our cries for help and rushed to the scene. When he saw the state Ah Ming was in, he was unusually calm and started saying some prayers. A couple of minutes later, Ah Ming recovered but he was obviously in a state of shock.<br><br>We asked Ah Ming what actually happened to him after he managed to calm down. He told us he felt a presence behind him as we were talking. So, he turned around to see if anybody was there. As he turned around, he suddenly felt a pair of hands reaching to his neck and started strangling him. He tried to shout for help but he felt a very deep pain on his neck and he could only manage to give out a scream. The pair of hands, though invisible, pushed him down to the floor and continued strangling him. He felt cold, dizzy and unable to breathe. After the teacher chanted some prayers, the ghost or whoever was strangling him gave him a hard push and suddenly, the pain disappeared.<br><br>We were shocked to learn of Ah Ming's experience. Seeing the worried expression in us, our teacher assured us that everything is all right now. He went on to tell us that the school hall is haunted and many unexplained incidents such as this had been reported by students and teachers alike. He also told us that there is a secret passageway beneath the stage that leads to the art room (which is the prayer's room in the hostel now). He advised us never ever try to explore into the passageway and avoid being inside the hall alone at night. </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.drippingblood.com/images/bordb004.jpg"></div>

I had no idea she was at such a desperate point. I wanted her to stay with me. She threw herself from her eighth-floor balcony. Her final view was of a gigantic cross on the Catholic school across the street. From the impact of the fall, her watch was broken off her wrist, as well as the gold chain around her neck. On the chain was also a cross that fell from her.<br><br>I held the key to her apartment afterward. One day I went in and nobody had been in there, but a glass angel from her wall unit was smashed on the carpet.<br><br>After that I had many dreams where my mother was chasing me. I didn't want to hear what she wanted to tell me. She insisted that she was running out of time and that she had to tell me something. I kept refusing to listen because I was angry for her leaving us the way she did.<br><br>Finally, she grabbed me by my shoulders. I closed my eyes and plugged my ears like a little kid so I couldn't hear her. She showed me her teeth and told me she would bite the cheek off my face if I didn't listen. Her voice was inside of my head. She said, "I don't work for God anymore. I work for the other." These where her exact words, and that was what she wanted me to know. After this, many happenings occurred. Typical doors opening, strange candle flickerings, misplaced objects to be found in ridiculously obvious places and the like. I think she visits from time to time now. In many of the pictures I take of my children, and my brother's children there is a dark shadow sort of in the corners. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/vampface.gif"></div>

It was also the place where  they release kwee kias(little demons) when they were out of use. The belief is that these demons cannot cross water.<br><br>Then there were also stories of pontianaks. Those that the heads will be detached from their bodies searching for blood, either from humans or animals. To destroy them, one has to find the body when their heads were not around and burn them. When the head returns and cannot find its own body, it will then roam the island searching until daybreak which they wither from sunlight.<br><br>I have heard tales of flying coconuts from NS boys. These coconuts were cursed and some have voodoo needles inside. They flew to find their victims. These are the works of the bomohs when paid by someone to curse another.<br><br>Legend had it that trainings were banned on Thursday nights long ago as there were uncannily high accident rates such as overturned vehicles, soldiers getting lost or falling into ravines or trapped in deep mud and water. There were also cases of possesions. I personally saw one in the sick bay. That soldier was brought there in a delirious state and was struggling furiously with many medics and his platoon mates screaming hysterically. In the end he was evacuated.<br><br>However, the ban was lifted sometime already. I supposed when they evacuated all the residents and and turn the whole place into millitary training ground, the bomohs too fade away.....but once in a while, there were reported cases of soldiers hearing pontianaks wailing and shrieking.<br><br>Believe it or not?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<img src="http://www.freehorror.com/animations/3/worlds.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>We contacted a spirit with the initials "E.D.F." on the ouija board. His favorite answer to the question "why?" would always be "because."<br><br>After a while, he became serious. His predictions were very strange at first, but now some have come true. He predicted my sister having a baby girl. He told us things only one of us would know.<br><br>Being the curious people we are, we asked for proof that he was indeed in our presence. He told us he would make things happen but to go to our furnace. The same time he was telling us to do this, my sister for no reason went to our furnace. We heard a scream and she came running back to us. We asked if she saw anything, but she said she hadn't. She didn't know why she screamed.<br><br>E.D.F then told us to go into the attic. He said he was in our attic. None of us were brave enough to go. We told him to stomp three times on the floor above our head. We waited only seconds before we heard three distinct thumps. We told him to do it again. We heard three thumps again. We blew out the candles and ran to our beds.<br><br>. He enjoyed to make noises and visit us in the night.   The noises persisted for three weeks and were scaring me.<br><br>We had a friend with a gun. He brought it over one day. We put it in my room and I locked my bedroom door. Before he left, he was going to show me how to use it. But when we opened my door with the only key, we found the gun was gone.<br><br>We turned the house upside down, but no gun was found. After that the noises started in the attic. We would hear footsteps and banging.<br><br>Things also kept turning up missing. My pager disappeared one night. When I tried to page it, we heard the beeping upstairs in the attic. My sister went there to look for the beeping. She couldn't find it, but she heard footsteps behind her. She turned to see if it was me, but no one was behind her. She got scared and started to cry. She felt a cold hand on her shoulder.<br><br>We went into the front bedroom and closed the door. We were both frightened by now. We could see lights going on and off. We checked the light switches and they weren't moving. Then we heard the water running in the bathroom.<br><br>Making sure the lights were off, we locked the doors behind us. About an hour later we went back inside since our nerves were calmed down. We opened the door and found all of the lights in the house turned on. We decided to pull out the Ouija board to talk to our spirit.<br><br>He told us that he was doing it and was just trying to have fun with us. But, he doesn't always try to scare us. Some nights when I'm scared and unsure about things he visits to make me feel better with his cold touch. Some nights I have awakened to feel him sitting on my bed. Like it or not, he is here to stay. So, I make the best out of his games. Now, he doesn't scare me. In fact, as I read these stories and tell you mine, I feel his coldness over my shoulder.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/ghostdance2.gif">[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It was before I was born at my kampong, before PAP came to power, there was only a dirt path going up to my kampong (sits on a hill), midway from the main road to my kampong, there was a cotton tree next to those common toilet (bucket system, where you can see all the shit).<br><br>It was said that the cotton tree has a pontianak, after 8pm, no one would walk the path, and the path was not lighted. The people at the kampong know about this, and as soon as it gets dark no one will go to the toilet. There was this case of a man who came to our kampong to look for his relative, it was about 9pm when he walk along the path. When he was close to the tree, he saw a woman carrying a baby crying there, he asked her if she was OK, she did not reply, so he went closer to her. As he lays his hand on her shoulder, and asked her if she need help, she raise her head, and under the moonlight, he saw those burning red eyes and distorted face, he immediately spring back. The pontianak said I need a young man like you, with mouth wide and drooling. For a moment he was frozen, and then he garner all his strength and run as fast as he could up. According to my Grandpa, that guy face was all green when he came up to our kampong.<br><br>He fell sick for the next couple of days, after they brought a medium to him, he was ok. The cotton tree was struck down by lightning and burnt one day, then lights were installed there when PAP came to power, as a promise LKY made to my Grandpa. After that nothing<br>was heard about the pontianak. BTW, the pontianak never kill anyone, maybe that is the reason no one was called to destroy it. There were hauntings during the Chinese seventh month behind the toilet, they said the hungry ghosts went to feast on human manure.<br><br>I have seen the spot where the cotton tree once stood, now Novena square is on top. </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/stories/novena/kampong01_th.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/stories/novena/kampong02_th.jpg"><img src="http://www.spi-sg.com/stories/novena/novena_sq02_th.jpg"></div>

According to  an old pamphlet, he departed leaving two parishioners dead at their prayers and another 'as shrunken as a piece of leather burned in a hot fire'.<br>Demon dogs have haunted different parts of England, and particularly East Anglia, for over a thousand years. In the eastern counties, the spectral hound is generally known as black shuck; shuck being derived from the Celtic scucca, the Anglo-Saxon for demon.<br>Unlike dogs of this world, black shuck seems more attached to places than to people. he has always walked alone, loping along river banks and lonely roads, or leaping over churchyard walls and vanishing amongst the tombstones. The appearance and characteristics of black shuck vary from place to place. he seems to emerge only at dusk, and is usually described as a shaggy creature the size of a calf, easily recognisable by his saucer sized eyes ( or sometimes eye) weeping red or green fire.<br><br>In Suffolk, black shuck is believed to be fairly harmless if left alone, but when challenged he has been known to strike his aggressor senseless, and death usually follows. At Clopton Hall, Stowmarket, where he guards a hoard of gold, his appearance is especially frightening, for he has the body of a monk and the head of a hound. Often, in Suffolk, he can only be detected by<br>the touch of his rough coat as he passes.<br>The Norfolk shuck is a more sinister hound, more akin to the werewolves that<br>supposedly haunted this area in the middle ages. He is an awful creature, as black as ebony, whose fiendish howls have been heard above the shrieks of the wildest gales. Terrified people have sensed black shuck padding behind them and felt his icy breath on the back of their necks. Even today, motorists have reported swerving to avoid him whilst crossing the road.<br>There is a popular belief in Norfolk that no one can set eyes on black shuck and live. In east Anglia generally, when anyone was dying, people used to say 'the black dog is at his heels'.<br>The Essex shuck, however, is a kindly hound and has been known to protect travellers on lonely roads.<br>The Cambridgeshire shuck, like the Norfolk counterpart, is sinister. He is sometimes seen between Wicken and the marshes of Spinney Abbey. Those who encounter him should look the other way, since his appearance is said to warn of death in the family.<br><br>The black dogs are heard of all over the British Isles, especially on deserted roads. They are roughly the size of a calf and they move in utter silence, except of the clicking of their claws. The chill despondency and despair these dogs cause is the reason why there are no detailed descriptions of their appearance. While a companion is no guarantee for safety, since one might see the dog and the other not, it offers a better protection than walking alone. It is said that the best companion is a descendant of Ean MacEndroe of Loch Ewe. He rescued a fairy once and in return he and his descendants were given perpetual immunity from the power of the black dogs.<br><br>A monstrous dog with huge teeth and claws from the area around Yorkshire, northern England. It only appears at night. People believe that anyone who sees the dog clearly will die soon after the encounter. In Wales, they have the red-eyed Gwyllgi, the Dog of Darkness. On the Isle of Man it is called Mauthe Doog. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> duH<br></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.nzghosts.co.nz/images/awil2t.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> I am a grown man, but I am weeping at my keyboard. I have been able to sense spirits pretty much my whole life. I have found that if I let my eyes go out of focus and I relax that I can make them out sometimes, but it's fuzzy . . . .<br><br>I was visiting my dad in the hospital, and as anyone who can sense spirits will attest a hospital is a busy place. It is full of people who don't always realize they are no longer living.<br><br>My dad has been in for a week now, and I am just now getting used to the extra, uh, patients. I was not, however prepared to have the experience I had today.<br><br>The wing my dad is in used to house the pediatric department of the hospital before it was remodeled. From the time I got off the elevator on his floor, I felt the spirits of children. I had a difficult time even getting off the elevator but I made it to my dads room and managed to block most of the sensations.<br><br>That is until I sensed a little girl in the hallway.<br><br>She would be walking from the nurses station back to what was her room. She had such a strong presence that I could 'see' her as if she was alive.<br><br>She was about 8 years old, very thin peach-fuzz for hair on her head, and wearing a hospital gown. She seemed very tired, and a little sad. It broke my heart. Over the last two days, she walked past about 5 or 6 times, yet always left to right from the nurses station to her room. I had never seen her leave her room and go towards the nurses station -- I had only witnessed her retreat to her room.<br><br>Several times I left my dad's room only to watch her disappear into her room down the hall.<br><br>My mom gave me a tour of my dads ward. At the end of his hallway is a dining area for the patients to eat. As soon as I walked in, I knew that this had been a play area for the children. I felt the presence of so much joy and sadness all at once, I almost broke down into tears.<br><br>I didn't say anything to my mom, and I don't think she noticed.<br><br>On the way back to my room I saw the little girl and she looked at us and I looked back at her. About 15 minutes before my mom and I were going to leave for the night, I heard the little girl speak clearly to me. I have never had the hair on the back of my neck stand up so fiercely in my life.<br><br>"Hello? She said. "E-e-e-xcuse me . . . "<br><br>She had a very quiet and typically high child's voice.<br>"I . . . well, uh, I'm sorry to bother you, Mister, but can you help me? I can't get the nurses attention, and everyone else, well they are ignoring me."<br><br>I told her as gently as I possibly could that I didn't think she was going to need the nurses anymore, but she insisted . . .<br><br>She told me, "But I am supposed to be going home tomorrow and I was wondering when the doctor would be in so I could go home!" ... Her eyes pleaded with me.<br><br>I asked why she thought that she'd be going home and she told me that she heard the doctor tell her parents that they had done what they could, and that she could go home. I didn't know what else to do except tell her that I would see what I could do for her, but that she would need to be patient. She smiled and turned to walk towards her room . . . as I had witnessed her do so many times before.<br><br>As we were leaving the hospital only one thought came to my mind. There is nothing sadder than the death of a child. I spent most of the night trying to come up with some way to help this little girl. I went back to the hospital with no idea what I was going to do if I saw her again.<br><br>I was in my dad's room visiting with him for about 15 or 20 minutes when once again I felt her presence in the hall.<br><br>I excused myself from my dad and went into the hallway. When she saw me her eyes lit up.<br><br>"I've been waiting for you," she said. "I didn't think you were going to come back, either."<br><br>I told her that I meant it when I said I wanted to try and help her. One of the nurses aids kept going up and down the hallway and I didn't want her to think I was talking to myself so I asked the little girl if she could walk to the end of the hallway with me. She gave me kind of a frustrated look as she said, "I'm not that tired."<br><br>I walked slowly with her down the hall until we got into the room at the end of the hall. The lights were off, and the blinds were open letting the sun stream in. I couldn't believe my eyes, I guess I expected to see through her but she looked as solid as a living person in the morning sunlight.<br><br>I sat down in a chair towards the back of the room and leaned forward, my elbows resting on my knees. I told her my name and she told me hers. Her name was Sarah, and she was seven years old.<br><br>I told her that I had something extremely difficult to tell her and that I wasn't teasing her or trying to be mean. I told her to forget about seeing the doctor and about going home for just a second. Look around. Tell me what you see. She didn't seem to understand, but after a second she looked around and started looking confused. "What is this? Where are we?"<br><br>She looked at me and I told her that she is free to go home whenever she wants. She looked directly into my eyes and said, "You mean, I can go home now?"<br><br>By now, I was crying like a baby. I told her that all she had to do was understand that she needs to let go of this place and she was free to go.<br><br>"I'm going home," she said. "I have to say good-bye to my Mom and Dad."<br><br>She was crying what looked like happy tears now. "Thank you. Can I give you a hug?" I told her I would love that. When she put her arms around me I was expecting to feel something. All I felt was Love. No physical sensation whatsoever.<br><br>And she was gone.<br><br>I sat for about five minutes trying to regain my composure.<br><br>I don't know why I was the person she reached out to, I just hope that she is now able to rest. I was with my dad for about four more hours today, and I never sensed her.<br><br>I hope Sarah is happy, at home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/tubbie4.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Three of my girlfriends and I booked into a chalet in Changi - this was many years ago and those chalets, the old bungalow types, are not there anymore - and that was when we had the fright of our lives.  We aren't superstitious people and since that incident we have tried to explain away what happened, but that night you couldn't blame four teenage girls for being scared to be alone in a chalet in lonely Changi with hardly anyone else around.<br><br>I remember that we asked the keeper if the place was haunted, because it looked so creepy from the outside.  He never made any reply, making it all the more creepier.  It made us a bit more sorry that we hadn't invited any boys along to stay with us - this was supposed to be a sort of pajama party.  Anyway, we managed to settle in after a while - no barbecue, we had decided that by consensus, and we were starting to get chatty and beginning to make some noise when one of the girls said she heard the front doorbell ring.<br><br>From where we were in the living room we could see the porch outside.  There was no one there so we thought she must have been mistaken.  She too said, yes, we were right, she must have imagined it.  We were chatting away again, chewing the cud, rather loudly I might add, when she said, "There it goes again."  This time we were all quiet and looking hard at the porch from where we were.  There certainly was no one there.  We could see the porch clearly Mom where we were.  If there were anybody out there ringing the doorbell, we should have been able to see the person for sure.  So what could she have heard?  Then all of us heard it.  Loud and clear.  It was the doorbell.  One of the girls screamed but we quickly hushed her.  Then we heard it again, and again and again, each time getting louder and more insistent as if someone was angry and demanding to be let in.<br><br>We didn't know what to do.  Everybody froze.  All our eyes were fixed on the empty porch where the buzzer was.  After a little more of the insistent ringing, the bell stopped.  Then we heard it.  The back door was creaking open.  All of us screamed and ran out through the front door.  We didn't stop running until we reached the next chalet.  We banged on the door, thumping away without caring about anybody, afraid like hell.  The man who opened the door was in his pajamas and he looked a bit nervous.  All of us pushed past him and stumbled into the living room.  There were four other men there, all of them also like the one who had opened the door.  They were seated around the table and they clearly had been gambling.  "Uncle, uncle," we cried, explaining what had happened and begging to be allowed to stay in this chalet with them for the night.  They looked at each other as if they thought we were mad, but finally one of them said, okay, we could stay.<br><br>I can tell you, that night we hardly got any sleep.  When one of the girls wanted to go to the loo, she forced me to go along and stand guard outside.  From where I was, I could hear her singing Amazing Grace to give herself courage while doing her business.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></strong><img src="http://www.cavernsofblood.com/11ft/ANIhauntedHouse4C.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>  Mysterious creature, half-human, half-ape, allegedly living in the remote forests of central and southern China. It is also known as Yeren and Xueren (also the name of like creatures in the Philippines).<br><br>The creature is said to stand an average of six and a half feet tall and to be covered in thick brown or red hair. It is bi-pedal and has a hefty abdominal region as well as an ape-like muzzle, large ears and eyes like that of a human, leaving behind large footprints, up to sixteen inches long, with five toes, four small toes held close together and a larger toe that points outward slightly.<br><br>According to Chinese folklore, the creature eats people. Coming across a human, it grips his or her arms tightly, making escape impossible. It is apparently so overjoyed by trapping its prey that it faints with mirth Â— but without losing its hold. When it returns to its senses, it kills and eats its victim. Thus travelers in the mountains were advised to wear a pair of hollow bamboo cylinders on their arms. If a Wildman caught them, they could then, while the creature was in swoon, slip their arms out of the cylinders and escape. Reports of the creature go back to as far as 2000 years.<br><br></strong><img src="http://www.occultopedia.com/images/bigfoot1.jpg"></div>
