            <div class='col-md body'>Quote:  At a English malay wedding preparation day at jurung west which i forgot the exact location.<br><br>It was around midnight and i was playing poker with a few friends, until at a point it was so bored i decided to do other things. Me and two of my freinds decided to take a walk. We went to the playground just round the corner but was dissapointed because there were already someone also part of our freinds sitting there. So we decided to change location and go to the rooftop instead. You know sometimes the rooftop door was not lock and we can actually go up there. But luck was not on our side and it was so frustrating when we reach at the top the door was lock. One of the guys decided that we should go to our wedding friends unit which on the 5th floor and find a place to sleep since it's already around almost 3am and we had a frustrating time not getting what we want to do. All of us agreed and we start our journey down the staircase.<br><br>When we reach the 6th floor, it came to our mind that we actually did not know exactly which unit it was, but we only knew it was on the 5th floor. So i decide that we split into two groups and meet up at the 6th floor again when found the unit. But my friend decide that we should look for it together, and we start from the other end of the block.<br><br>While we were walking in a straight row, i notice something on the next block which very near and visible. It was a lady dress in black and she had a very long hair, i could not tell whether she human or bla bla bla but it was a scary sight because she was holding on to the maingate just standing there and her hands are all black too. Suddenly my friends in front of me gave me a shock, he also saw it and was whispering to me ."Hey did u see at the next block?" I quickly told him told him "shhh keep quiet, just walk". It always been told that when you see something unusual, just keep quiet and walk. But the silence did not last long when my another friend suddenly with his' big mouth ' said, "Hey hey see there see there you see or not " pointing directly at that particular thing. And naturaly both of us look and what we saw was really chilling. The lady in black was actually scratching the door of that house violently and was also looking at us while doing it. The next thing i knew i was running to the staircase leaving my friends behind and i could hear one of my friend shouting or actualy crying "Tunggu, tunggu jangan tinggal aku!!!" in English "Wait wait don't leave me!!!". But i was running down like a flash.<br><br>When we were at the ground floor, we headed straight to the playground where most of our friends were and surprisingly when we reach there, everyone seems to look scared and were close together. Before we could tell them what happen, one of them told us that they saw someone looking at them from the rooftop, looks like a lady with long hair swaying and suddenly vanish just like that. The three of us just look at each other and then we told them we just saw that thing on the 5th floor at the same block. Just imagine if we were at the rooftop and the that thing is there too.............!<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br></div>

I got interest researching Chinese, Malay, Indians, Japanese and Western ghost.</div></blockquote>Singapore Ghosts:<br><br>Toyol<br>This is a spirit which is kept in a jar with a foetus and some special liquid to preserve it. The toyol is kept by people to do their bidding, but the price for keeping it is you HAVE to feed it your own blood EVERYDAY. Some toyols have special 'needs' as well. If the spirit is that of a child, you'd usually have to provide it with a couple of toys to play with. If money goes missing and white ants (or termites) are found where the money should have been, the toyol has just done its bidding for their master.<br><br>Pontianak<br>This is perhaps the most frightening of all ghosts and ghouls of South East Asia. It is said that the pontianak is the spirit of a woman who died of childbirth. Sometimes she can look very beautiful, but most of the time she has razor teeth and stalks the night in search for men or pregnant women (it is said she could not bear the thought of other women being able to enjoy motherhood)to suck blood from (sometimes eat the flesh of babies ripped out from their mothers). There are many stories of the pontianak, but perhaps the scariest is the one which happened on the Malaysian highway.<br><br>Kum Kum<br>The Kum Kum is an old witch who attacks young virgins in her attempt to regain her youth and beauty. According to legend, she got her name as she cannot say the whole Malay greeting and can only say these 2 syllables.<br><br>Hantu Tetek<br>Loosely translated from Malay, Hantu Tetek means 'Ghost Breast'. This ghost is female (DUH!) and has huge breasts, which she is said to use to suffocate her victims (who are men. DUH!)<br><br>Bomboh<br>This is neither ghost nor ghoul, but a man practised in the arts of magic. He is often the man locals will turn to with a 'difficult' problem to solve and he will do it, often for a small fee. Don't worry though, it's money fee. Hee hee...<br><br>Jiang-Shi<br>Jiang-shi is the Chinese vampire. Does the same thing as Dracula and sucks blood, but they can only hop around with their arms outstretched. They don't talk at all &amp; you can escape them by throwing a handful of glutinous rice. The grains will hit the Jiang-shi like little firecrackers, giving you time to make your get-away. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From: S'pore lar<br>Title: Pocong In Our Bunk<br>Hi there, I was a secondary school student who loves to go camp. But not all the camp experiences are pleasant.......<br><br>I went to OBS which was located at Pulau Ubin, I was having so much fun with my new friends. That night, we were extremly tired, so we retire to bed.<br><br>It was about mid-night when I heard someone jumping around in our bunk, I open my eyes and I saw a human figure with bandage like mummies, hopping around in our bunk. I heard my Malay friends told me that, it was a Pocong!!!<br><br>I was so scared that I cover my head with pillow, I couldn't sleep that night. I told my bunk-mates what happen, they told me that it was common to experience things like that as many people died here during Japanese Occupation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>DuH<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Age: 14<br>From: yishun<br>Title: yishun park is haunted<br><br>My Story: One day, i went in my bicycle to buy a vcd. The vcd was all about GHOST! While i rode my bike back home, i encountered something truely, really, and extremely scary. From my house to the vcd shop, it was about 20 minutes walk and 10 minuets ride. (O.K)here come the serious matter.<br><br>While i was riding my bike in the darkness of the yishun park, my bikes tire busrt. So i pushed the bike back home. On my way, i heard some sound in the forest so i got scared. I started 2 run. Then suddenly my mind told me to look back. Then my heart turned cold. My hands very sweaty and the goose bumbs stood. Cus i saw an old lady with blood on her pure white dress, stood infront of me to ask help. She had long hair and a rotten face.t Then my mind went(*7^%$#@#@???) i didnt know wat 2 do. So i threw my bike aside and ran through the park. For the folowing week, i had nightmares and had high fever.<br><br>So dont look back if u feel something fishy in a lonely place...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  DuH<br><br><img src="http://homex.coolconnect.com/member3/a_sf095/ghostpix/mermaid2.jpg"></div>
