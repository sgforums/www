            <div class='col-md body'>Succubus<br>by "Zai"<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Here's a story based on my experience during my Outward Bound Singapore course, which was just last year. For your info, Succubus is a female devil which seduces a man for his spirit. This story is for u boys who feels like you're James Bond. Please look twice in a woman's eyes for she might take your soul away.....<br><br>I went for OBS on the 20th November 1998. I was just 15 then. It was my first trip of shore and OBS was held on an island called Pulau Ubin. Just for your info, Pulau Ubin used to be a military stronghold and I have heard of stories of it being a very unholy place. What can a teenage guy like me do? I'm one helluva hyperactive guy who has been through a lot!! Including ghost experiences! Ok, so it was a pretty fun camp, lotsa things to do until I met this girl during lunch...she is soo beautiful...her eyes and body and her hair...could make you float!! She is like the most beautiful girl! I had to do something to make her mine....but I was soo scared to tell her...I could not say a word...so I made this 5 day camp, into a 5 day hunt for her.<br><br>Meal after meal, i looked at her, and i do believe that she knew I liked her. On the 3rd day of the camp, my friend told me of that same girl, wanting to see me at the "tripod" at 8pm. The tripod is a huge training facility with 3 huge woods standing as high as an 8 storey high buliding.<br><br>So at 8pm, I met her at the tripod...she was sitting there....alone, with no friends to disturb. Such a quiet and peaceful night and a bit creepy because surrounding me are thick forests and a huge tree, the size almost like a redwood tree...So I loked at the red dressed beauty and..I felt so lucky so I apporached her. She turned as I say hi and I could see in her face...a much more beautiful girl i have ever seen. She looked at me and gave me a passionate kiss on the lips....soon then...she wanted to take of her clothes...and so did I....i felt something was controlling me and suddenly, I opened my eyes and saw an ugly creature kissing me!!! Her face was all rotten and maggots was moving on it....I stepped off and moved back..afraid that she would eat me up...<br><br>And in a coarse and ugly voice she told me, "Don't worry? Why are you afraid? You're not afraid are you?" I wanted to shout but not the slightest voice could come out. I also couldn't run...i was stuck...i couldn't move i prayed hard and finally i could run...i ran as fast as i could towards my room and told my friends about the whole thing...all the say was: "Girl? What girl? We were laughing at you kissing the tripod. Ooh...you're so romantic? You had a girl in mind?" And they laughed....but I knew that something wasn't right so i decided to ask my instructor.."Oh u mean Lina?", he said. "Lina is a regular here....she looks out for man and steal his spirit. No man has ever lose from her grip. But you my friend, is a lucky one." I asked how Lina became a regular and he simply said." Well son....she's my daughter....."   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/usamakid/unreleased/trippics/ghoul.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> In the summer of 1990, police in Russia found a resident in a block of flats in the Ukraine area dead on the floor of an elevator. The man had two holes in the side of his neck - which was badly bruised yellow and blue. At the post mortem, the coroner discovered that the man in the elevator had died through shock and loss of blood. About 1.5 litres of blood were missing, yet there had been no bloodstains in the elevator. It was as if a vampire had sucked the blood out of the dead man, but the Russian police couldn't go for that outlandish explanation.<br><br>A month later, police were called to the same block of flats because a girl of thirteen was trapped in the elevator, which was stuck between the fourth and fifth floor. Residents heard the girl screaming frantically, and when the police arrived with three members of the local fire service and gained access to the elevator, they found the girl lying on the floor of the elevator. The girl was dead, and two small puncture marks were later found on the girl's left breast, which was heavily bruised. The residents refused to use the faulty elevator, and were convinced that a vampire was at large in the block of flats.<br>Police started to play down the seemingly unsolvable deaths, and one former KGB propaganda minister named Leonid Keerov suggested that the girl had died after injecting heroin into herself, but the dead girl's parents threatened to sue the official, because their daughter had never taken drugs and no syringe was found in the elevator.<br><br>To get to the bottom of the matter, a Russian detective and a sergeant entered the lift and rode it continually up and down. The two men were armed with  pistols and carried  flashlights and two-way radios.<br>Three days later, the lift was travelling upwards when it halted inbetween the fifth and sixth floor of the building. The lights went out, so the men switched on their torches and two-way radios to alert their colleagues who were playing cards in a police van in the street below.<br>The two trapped men waited, perhaps wondering if some ghostly vampire would appear. There was a long silence for about three minutes; then they heard something scuttling above their heads. Something was moving along the roof of the elevator. The detective noticed a black square - almost a foot across - set in the roof of the elevator where an access panel had come away. The lift was so old, the panel had probably fallen off because of rust. The detective shone his torch through the square hole in the roof, and the beam from his torch lit up the lift shaft above and the steel cables supporting the lift. Something peered through that hole that made the detective's blood run cold. A small black hairy head the size of an orange with a bunch of black eyes the size of grapes looked in at him.<br>The sergeant was terrified by the freakish-looking animal and raised his revolver at it, but the detective told him not to fire.<br>'What is it?' said the petrified police sergeant, trembling, and almost dropping his torch with nerves.<br>'Turn your torch off.' the detective said to the sergeant.<br>'What? No way sir.' the sergeant protested, sweating heavily.<br><br>'That thing doesn't like light.' said the detective. 'You keep your torch on then and I'll turn mine off. Don't make any sudden moves, and tell the men downstairs to stand by.'<br>The detective switched off his light, and watched the thing slide further into the lift. Suddenly, the sergeant's nerves got the better of him, because he had three phobias: fear of the dark - fear of enclosed spaces - and arachnaphobia; a fear of spiders, and that horrible thing hanging through the hole in the ceiling looked like an overgrown spider. So the sergeant just freaked out and dropped his torch, and his nerves cost him his life. The torch hit the floor and smashed. Before the detective could switch on his torch, the enormous hairy black spider dropped into the lift with lightning agility and bit out at the only thing in the lift that was moving excitedly. The spider bit the unfortunate sergeant's face and hung on as it drew out his blood. The detective switched on his torch and saw the whole nightmarish drama. The sergeant was screaming, and the spider was like something from another planet. Its body was the size of a jack russel dog, and its six hairy legs were almost 3 feet long. The freak insect's mouthparts were embedded into the sergeant's face, and as it sucked out his blood, the spider's body turned red. The detective took aim and shot twice at the spider. The first shot missed, and the second bullet blasted one of the spider's legs off, but when the bullet ricocheted off the wall, it bounced back and smashed the torchbulb.<br><br>The lift was once again in total darkness. The sergeant stopped screaming and his body hit the floor with a thump, and the detective could feel the bristly hairs on the insect brush against him as the huge spider ran past and climbed back up to the hole in the elevator's roof.   When the police and firemen opened the elevator, they found the dead sergeant, whose terror-stricken face was bruised and bloody - and on the floor in the corner, sat the traumatized detective. Nearby on the elevator floor was a long hairy black leg of the spider still twitching. The detective remained speechless for a while then blurted out the incredible story. The authorities quickly hushed up the incident, but news of the story got out via the internet, and a version of the story also appeared in a Turkish newspaper, but was quickly denounced as an exaggeration. It was claimed that the giant spider was a deformed black widow spider that had been mutated by the radioactive fallout from the recent Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster. Later reports on the internet said Russian troops had destroyed the spider with a flamethrower, then discovered the insect had laid eggs at the top of the lift shaft.<br>Before you turn the light out tonight, you'd better put the<br>plug in the bath...you don't know what's crawling about nowdays...<br></strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/spidercrawl.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Ancestors<br>by Patrick<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I was raised in Laos by my mother and her family. Since my parents had always had a bad relationship they divorced shortly after my birth, and since my father was a foreigner I never had more than a passing relationship with him or his family and that fact sometimes made me sad.<br><br>In my hometown I would often pass by the house of a certain friend and when she wasn't there I sometimes saw an old couple that would smile kindly at me and wave. A detail I remember well about the woman is that she always wore a pair of coral earrings shaped like roses. I was very small and although I was curious about the old couple I assumed they were my friend's relatives and didn't worry too much about them. I remember I once asked my friend about the couple but she didn't seem to know what I was talking about and I didn't worry too much about it although their faces made an impression on me.<br><br>When I was about five years old my uncle sponsored my family and we were able to move to the United States where we settled in El Monte California. The strange thing is that I continued to see the old couple every once in a while. I would see them sometimes at the market or taking a walk but each time I saw them for one reason or another I wasn't able to speak to them they were always a little bit too far. I thought I must be seeing things or that maybe the old people had common faces that I was mistaking everywhere. Anyway, after a certain age I no longer saw the old couple and I stopped giving them thought until many years later when I visited my father's sister in Chinatown for the first time and immediately noticed an elaborately framed photograph of two young people on their wedding day.<br><br>The sight of the picture made me catch my breath. The woman was wearing the same earrings that I had seen on the old woman and she had the same expression in her eyes. My aunt says that it's a picture of my grandparents and I guess I'll always wonder if my grandparents spirits felt sorry for me because I didn't have a father and if they watched over me as a result.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://homex.coolconnect.com/member3/a_sf095/ghostpix/ponti3.jpg"></div>

It was what he thinks he saw when he headed outside to look early yesterday that floored him.<br><br>"It was this object, this light-blue object, traveling at a phenomenal rate of speed," Rogers said. "This Air Force jet was right behind it, chasing it, but the object was just leaving him in the dust. I told my neighbor, 'I think those jets are chasing a UFO.' "<br><br>Military officials confirm that two F-16 jets from Andrews Air Force Base were scrambled early yesterday after radar detected an unknown aircraft in area airspace. But they scoff at the idea that the jets were chasing a strange and speedy, blue unidentified flying object.<br><br>"We had a track of interest, so we sent up some aircraft," said Maj. Douglas Martin, a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado, which has responsibility for defending U.S. airspace. "Everything was fine in the sky, so they returned home."<br><br>At the same time, military officials say they do not know just what the jets were chasing, because whatever it was disappeared. "There are any number of scenarios, but we don't know what it was," said Maj. Barry Venable, another spokesman for NORAD.<br><br>Radar detected a low, slow-flying aircraft about 1 a.m. yesterday, according to a military official. Controllers were unable to establish radio communication with the unidentified aircraft, and NORAD was notified. When the F-16s carrying air-to-air missiles were launched from Andrews, the unidentified aircraft's track faded from the radar, the military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br><br>Pilots with the D.C. Air National Guard's 113th Air Wing, which flew the F-16s from Andrews, reported nothing out of the ordinary, NORAD officials said.<br><br>"It was a routine launch," said Lt. Col. Steve Chase, a senior officer with the wing, which keeps pilots and armed jets on 24-hour alert at Andrews to respond to incidents as part of an air defense system protecting Washington after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.<br><br>Rogers remains convinced that what he saw was not routine. "It looked like a shooting star with no trailing mist," he said. "I've never seen anything like it."<br><br>Â© 2002 The Washington Post Company</div>

External Appearance<br><br>This body was observed to be in a state of profound deterioration.  It<br>had not been preserved but was delivered in a container of rubberized<br>canvas, to which some of the tissue had adhered.  The cadaver was 36<br>inches long with a weight of 8 pounds.  The external appearance of<br>this cadaver was not of a human type.<br><br>The skin appeared smooth and a dark bluish-gray in color.  There was<br>no clothing on the body.  There were no genitals and no was of<br>determining sex, if any.  The nose consisted of two slits, the mouth<br>was a small opening that did not appear to be supported by an<br>articulated law, and there were holes in the position of ears.  The<br>cranium was round and large in proportion to the body and the eyes<br>were almond-shaped.  The eyes were closed and could not be opened<br>without damaging structures, due to condition of decaying tissue.<br><br>Arms and wrists were very thin.  The hands displayed a three-digit<br>arrangement without thumb.  The arms extended to approximately three<br>inches above the knee. The three fingers extended directly from the<br>wrist, with no palm.<br><br>2. Dissection<br><br>The body was opened from crotch to chin.  A green liquid emerged from<br>the incision.  The skin was not backed by fascia, and the bone<br>structure appeared to be a cartilaginous substance of light green-blue<br>color.<br><br>Internal organs were observed but their function was unclear.  The<br>thoracic and peritoneal cavities communicated and there appeared to be<br>no respiratory system and no stomach.  The esophagus was vestigial and<br>dissipated before reaching another organ.<br><br>There appeared to be two multi-chambered hearts and it was surmised<br>that body fluid could be pumped rapidly.  There was an extensive<br>circulatory system that involved three different types of vein.  Some<br>material was extracted from one of these systems and suggested<br>possible waste, leading to the notion that waste may have been exuded<br>through the skin.<br><br>The fluid removed from the body was analyzed under the microscope and<br>found to be a vegetable substance, chlorophyll-based.  It is possible<br>that photosynthesis was the means of obtaining energy.<br><br>The cranium was dissected and it was observed that a ridge of<br>cartilage separated the brain into two completely isolated components.<br>The brain was severely deteriorated, but appeared to be extensively<br>fissured and divided into numerous lobes.  Because of the<br>deterioration the degree of bilateralism of the two halves could not<br>be determined with any accuracy.<br><br>This cadaver exuded an unusually foul odor.<br><br>3. Conclusion<br><br>This is not a cadaver of a kind previously observed by or known to<br>this pathologist.  It appears to be a form of creature utilizing<br>elements of both the animal and vegetable.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Hills/2549/ufo-3.gif"> UFO passing Kennedy Airport.<br><br>Friday July 3 ,1998, about 5:20 - 5:40 PM, I was outside barbecuing dinner when I head a low roar and knew it was the sound of a low altitude helicopter heading my way, this is not very unusual, I am right next to a parkway and they fly over to check traffic. I had the camera ready, I had already taken some pictures of Orbs during the day, some I  noticed near the moon and others near the air traffic over my area . The helicopter was heading west  directly over the Belt Parkway, Knapp St. / Sheepshead Bay at exit # 9.  As I waited for the helicopter to enter my field of view I started to notice bright flashes in the area I was expecting to see the Helicopter enter from, the helicopter was entering my field of view as I noticed flashes and what looked like a big muffin shaped light form with what looked like an exhaust funnel under it, I took some pictures as fast as the camera would take them. The helicopter turned toward the north a few seconds after it left my field of view, then it continued to circle around and came back into my field of view in about the same location as before, it then headed south in what appeared to be the same  general direction as the Plasma Crafts were seen in.<br><br><img src="http://www.visitations.com/ufos/UFO11.jpg">Flying to intercept a mysterious radar reflection, an unknown French Air Force pilot photographed this craft with his gun-sight camera. The UFOpaced the plane for several minutes before speeding off past the maximum velocity of the French airplane. This UFOappears to be of the same type that appeared in McMinnville, Oregon over the farm of Mr. Paul Trent.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH[/img]</div>

Since you like...yucks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ...the above single alien so much, I will introduce you a girlfriend as follows:-<br><br><strong>What Is A Banshee?<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The Solitary Fairies<br><br>The banshee , from ban (bean), a woman, and shee ( sidhe, a fairie), is an attendant fairy that follows the old families, and none but them, and wails before a death. Many have seen her as she goes wailing and clapping her hands. The keen (caoine), the funeral cry of the pesantry, is said to be an imitation of her cry. When more than one banshee is present, and they wail and sing in chorus, it is for the death of some holy or great one.<br><br>An omen that sometimes accompanies the banshee is the _coach-a-bower_ (coiste-bodhar), an immense black coach, mounted by a coffin, and drawn by headless horses driven by a _Dullahan_. It will go rumbling to your door, and if you open it, according to Croker, a basin of blood will be thrown in your face.<br><br>These headless phantoms are found elsewhere than in Ireland. In 1807 two of the sentries stationed outside St. James's Park died of fright. A headless woman the upper part of her body naked, used to pass at midnight and scale the railings. After a time the sentries were stationed no longer at the haunted spot.<br><br>In Norway the heads of corpses were cut off to make their ghosts feeble. Thus came into existence the _Dullahans_, perhaps ; unless, indeed, they are descended from that Irish giant who swam across the Channel with his head in his teeth. -Ed. </strong><br><br>(from "A Treasury of Irish Myth, Legend, and Folklore", Ed.

Wanna pay her a visit?<br><br><strong>What is the Planet X Scenario?<br><br>The supporters of the theory argue something like this:<br><br>In June 2003 'Planet X' will get close to Earth. Its magnetic force will stop the Earth rotating for several days; it will cause huge earthquakes, volcanoes, Tsunamis and hurricanes all over the planet. Crops will fail, millions will stave. 90% of the planet's population will be die. The force of it passing will cause the Earth's magnetic poles to shift.<br><br>What do they claim Planet X really is?<br><br>They say Planet X is the tenth planet in our solar system. It is not really a planet, actually a brown dwarf; a small, failed star. They give it a size of 4x that of Earth, but a density of 20x. It orbits our Sun and also a second star in our solar system that they claim exists.<br><br>Are there more than 9 planets in our solar system?<br><br>Planet X is the name given to the 10th in our solar system, if one exists. For nearly a century, astronomers have been searching for it. Now, Nasa claims they have no evidence for it existing, but admit it is possible. .<br><br>Dr. John Murray, of the UK's Open University, claims he has found a 10th planet 30,000 times the distance from the sun that Earth is - 3,000 billion miles away.<br><br>The normal way in which planets are discovered is by looking at the orbits of other planets. As planets have gravity, they affect the orbits of all the others. For decades, people have claimed that the orbits of the three outermost planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are 'wrong' - that something else is influencing their orbits, another planet.<br><br>This is what Gerry Neugebauer, chief IRAS scientist, had to say, in 1982:<br><br>"A heavenly body possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this solar system has been found in the direction of the constellation Orion by an orbiting telescope. All I can tell you is that we don't know what it is".<br><br>Since then, Nasa has denied the existence of the planet and claimed that the orbits of the outer planets are in fact correct.<br><br>What do the Sumerians have to do with this?<br><br>Planet X was first recorded by a civilisation called the Sumerians, who were around about 6,000 years ago. They called it 'Nibiru', meaning 'Planet of the Crossing'. They suggested it had a 3,600 year orbit. You may be wondering why so many people are putting so much faith in the observations of civilisation that lived thousands of years before telescopes and computers. The answer is that the Sumerians were incredibly advanced scientifically, correctly calculating the orbits of many planets in our solar system.<br><br>The Sumerians definitely knew about the first 5 planets - Mercury, Venus, Mars, Earth and Jupiter, and this suggests they knew of more. However, it would be virtually impossible for the Sumerians to know about Pluto, as it is smaller than any planet's moon and billions of miles away. It was only discovered during the last century, thanks to accurate telescopes observing the orbits of the other planets. It is completely invisible to the naked eye.<br><br>People have also objected that the relative sizes of the planets appears to be inaccurate. This hardly seems fair, considering that the Sumerians were working without telescopes. The planets they have identified do seem to have approximately the correct size.<br><br>If you accept that this is a depiction of our solar system, a the number and size of the planets suggest that it is, then you have to wonder why there is another large planet. Such a scientific civilisation as the Sumerians would surely not invent a planet. They even gave it a name.<br><br>It was the Sumerians who gave it an orbit time of 3,600 years. This is one of the most controversial parts of the Sumerian evidence.<br><br>Why do people believe Planet X will cause so much devastation?<br><br>In June 2003, they say Planet X will finally start to near Earth after it's 3,600 year orbit, passing just 14,000,000 miles from Earth (in space that is not far at all). It would definitely exert a gravitational force on the Earth, but they also say there would be a magnetic force, what they call 'repulsion force'.<br><br>As the planet passes these two forces will be opposite to those acting on the Earth from the sun. This would leave Earth as the rope in a tug of war game between the two. This would make the Earth's core, which is the magnetic part, rotate. However, the crust, which is not magnetic, would not be affected. This would make the core rotate, changing the position of the Earth's magnetic poles. This would set off virtually every volcano on Earth and choke the atmosphere with so much ash the sun would be blotted out.<br><br>These forces on the Earth would also be so great that the Earth would stop rotating for three days, leaving half of the Earth in darkness and half in day. However this would be gradual - or else no one would survive. For this to be true you would expect a slowing of the Earth already<br><br>Are we seeing increased geological activity and is the Earth slowing down?<br><br>If changes this severe were caused by Planet X, and this is approaching, we would expect to see more earthquakes and a slowing Earth already. This is happening.<br><br>The Earth's rotation is slowing, a phenomenon recognised as scientific fact. It is caused by the friction of the tides. To counteract this, the US Navy, world's central timekeeper, is inserting leap seconds into the clock every few years. This keeps it running as normal. However, this means that if the Earth were slowing for a reason other than tidal friction, such as Planet X, they could disguise this by inserting more leap seconds into the clock. Sound like a Hollywood movie?<br><br>The years 1995-2001 had by far the most tectonic activity of any over the last 30. The effects of Planet X were meant to be appearing in the seven years before it past, which would be mid-1996.This data seems to support the Planet X scenario. However, it's worth pointing out that this could merely be chance, and that 2001 just a third of the earthquake energy was released that was released in the year 2000.<br><br>It would be interesting to see statistics for volcanoes as you would also expect an increase in volcanic activity.<br><br>Did ancient tribes record the last passage of Planet X?<br><br>Reports from many ancient tribes refer to an event that sounds very similar to that of Planet X passing. The Choktaw Indians, Hebrew, Mayas, Hindus, Persians, Sumerians and Egyptians, among others, all refer to events such as 'long days', hurricanes, huge waves and the sun stopping in the sky during the passage of a massive comet. These events are all predicted for the crossing of Planet X. Joshua described a long day. The west Coast Indians, apparently, described a long night. This fits exactly with the Planet X scenario, as when the Earth stops rotation one half would be left in light and one in darkness.<br><br>The data shows how the planet would speed up very rapidly when it neared our sun, which would explain why we cannot yet see it: at the moment it is supposedly more than 20 billion miles away.<br><br></strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.karinya.com/images/9920x.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Japanese Ghost?<br><br>One night she entered her bedroom and was startled to find this very woman standing there in the corner, weeping pitifully. Immediately she sensed that this was a ghost, and she waited quietly to see what the spirit would say. However she never spoke, but only stood there weeping.<br><br>This person was so accustomed to witnessing supernatural phenomena in her life, that the site of a weeping, remorseful ghost - even standing in the middle of her own bedroom - was not especially disturbing to her. She got into bed, with the ghost still there, and simply went to sleep. In the morning the ghost was gone.<br><br>The following night the ghost appeared again. This time she had something to say.<br><br>"I didn't mean to do it," said the woman's ghost.<br><br>"I don't understand what you mean." Said her friend. "Didn't you commit suicede?"<br><br>"I didn't mean it." Wailed the ghost over and over.<br><br>Her friend began to ask around about this woman with people who had known her just before her death. She found that this woman had had a terrible fight with her husband that very night, and shortly later he had found her body hanging in the room. It became clear to her, that this poor woman had  only pretended to hang herself , believeing her husband would follow her to the room and stop her. The husband didn't arrive in time, and she accidently killed herself instead. Her friend never told those things to the grieving husband.<br><br>Every night, at the same hour as her death, the ghost came to her room, weeping and lamenting. "I never meant to do it!"<br><br>So my friend gave her a mantra(1) to chant which should lead her to Heaven eventually.<br><br>My friend told me that the ghost chose her, because of her unique ability to see things through her spiritual vision, or "clairvoyance" as it is called in the west. The ghost desperately wanted to communicate to someone her last thoughts on earth.<br><br>This ability to see things spiritually is not hereditary, it is rather a gift given to those who have suffered a great deal in life. This is the case with many of Japan's most famous shamans like Itako in Aomori, who lives in the northern part of Japan.<br><br>Her friend had suffered a great deal when she was young, and her spiritual senses became opened enabling her to experience clairvoyance, and the ability to hear the dead speak.<br><br>There is an ancient shrine in my neighborhood called the "Konohana" Shrine. According to legend, this is the place where Princess Konohana Sakuya Hime married Ninigi no Mikoto, the ancestor of the family of Emperor Tennoh who was said to have descended directly from heaven. She gave birth to three princes here. She is said to have bathed her princes in the same well which still exists in the precinct today.<br><br>The well at Konohana Shrine<img src="http://www.harapan.co.jp/Miyazaki/Sanpomichi/Kibana/Sakuragawa_2.jpg"><br><br>I visited this shrine once with my husband and my two children. There was something very mysterious, and sacred about this place and I instructed my children not to take souvenirs away from there, not so much as a leaf or a pebble. I was afraid things from a sacred place might contain some mystic power.<br><br>I told my friend about this, and she said that her clairvoyant friend had said the same thing to her. When her friend visits shrines she can "feel" if there is a god or goddess there. She told her that there is such a goddess even now living in the Konohana shrine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.harapan.co.jp/Miyazaki/Sanpomichi/Kibana/Kibana_Sh.jpg"><br>Konohana Shrine<br><br><img src="http://www.theblackmoon.com/Ghost/spirit.gif"><br><br></div>
