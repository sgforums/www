Though mine's not as obvious as you, it happened during the lunar 7th month too... As I was chatting away on my PC I suddenly felt temperature dropped and as though a presence of something staring into my screen...

Anyway, I've got my own form of fear for ghost lah.... But can't really remember liao..? Anyway, have to be careful with it I remember... From my own understanding, it might be explained SCIENTIFICALLY in a sense... Though MANY of the things are still UNKNOWN (quantum science), but I believe that it can inflict harm... Just like if got an object come flying your way, though you might not be really afraid, but that doesn't mean that you should be an idiot and just stand down there and don't move right...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

We felt something was following us. As we were about to cross a road, one of the lamp post closest to us suddenly went off. After crossing the road, the lamp suddenly relighted. While we were walking under a shelter of a bus-stop, we heard from on top of the corrugated roof of the shelter like someone was holding a metal bar and brushing on the roof. We ran for our lives man. The noise was deafening and eerie. As we were making our way to the seven 11, there was a cat which walked along with us but it did not look at us. Normally cats are suspicious of humans fearing they might disturb them. This cat didn't, it glared at an empty space behind us. sheesh. Our legs were all wobbling, we decided to go back to the coffeeshop and showed more respect to "them". As they was an alter there, we offered incense and even my free thinkers friends kept quiet and prayed solemnly. After that, everything went smoothly. phew.</div>

Quite a long time back, when the shophouses around Chinatown area were still undergoing great renovation works, many of the shophouses are DARK and EMPTY....<br><br>Me and my EX happened to be waiting for a bus at the bus-stop... Then I noticed something STRANGE...? There were a group of cats (scattered all over in one of the shophouses) staring particularly at a spot in the VERY DARK inside of the shophouse (basically we can't see what's inside except the few cats around the entrance of the shop)..... And the shophouse is just facing the road with so many cars running by and so many people... NONE of the cats were interested in that... They were all looking at that particular spot and not moving at all.... When I walked closer to try and see what they're looking at, one of the cats just turn around and saw me... Uninterested, slowly turned back to stare at the spot.... Totally no expression...? Gives me the feeling like it's under some sort of spell..?<br><br>That's when we decided that it's kinda errie and just move away from the shop... 'Uninterested'.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm...talking bout moths and cats, the following might interest you....<br><br><strong>. First Sighting of the Mothman?<br><br>Not quite so clearly visible, but still definitely man-shaped, was the figure standing in the middle of the road ahead of a woman driving her father along Route 2 in the Chief Cornstalk Hunting Grounds of West Virginia, USA, in the 1960 or 61. As they got closer, the driver slowed the car. The two apprehensive witnesses saw that the grey figure was much larger than a man. The driver later reported what happened next: A pair of wings unfolded from its back and they practically filled the whole road. It almost looked like a small airplane. Then it took off straight up, disappearing out of sight in seconds. We were both. terrified. I stepped on the gas and raced out of there. We talked it over and decided not to tell anybody about it. Who would believe us anyway?<br><br>Who indeed? Although she did not know it, she was possibly the first witness of a winged, being later nicknamed Â‘MothmanÂ’, which in late 1966 plagued the area of West Virginia called Point Pleasant. First to see it at that time were two young local couples, Mr and Mrs Roger Scarberry and Mr and Mrs Steve Mallette. Later on the night of November 15 they were driving through the Â‘TNT areaÂ’ where there was an abandoned wartime explosives factory. As they passed an old generator plant, they saw in the darkness two bright red circles, which looked like eyes. As the circles moved, the couples saw a man-shaped figure between 6 and 7 feet tall, greyish in color and with big folded wings; it was shuffling along on two legs.<br><br>Roger, who was driving, quickly turned the car in the direction of safety and they drove off at speed. But they saw the creature, or another similar one, standing near the road and as they went past it spread its batlike wings and began to follow them. Even though they accelerated to 100 miles per hour, the Â‘birdÂ’ kept pace with them, without flapping its wings. Mrs Mallette could hear it squeaking Â‘like a big mouseÂ’. When they reported their experience at the sheriffÂ’s office, the deputy could see they were scared and he drove straight to the TNT area, but saw nothing strange.<br><br>The story was publicized and Point Pleasant immediately became a focus of attention for monster-hunters. Armed men searched the TNT area but did not find their prey. However, Mothman was still around: on the evening of November 16th he appeared to Mrs Marcella Bennett who was visiting friends living in the TNT area. She was sitting in the parked car when she noticed a figure in the darkness. Â‘It seemed as if it had been lying down. It rose up slowly from the ground. A big gray thing. Bigger than a man, with terrible glowing red eyes.Â’ Like the two couples on the previous night Mrs Bennett seemed hypnotized by MothmanÂ’s red eyes. As she stood there staring at it, she and her baby daughter were grabbed by a friend and dragged into the house.<br><br>During the following days, numerous people saw Mothman, or believed they did. How many of the sightings were caused by the Â‘contagionÂ’ of news stories, we shall never know. The writer John Keel went to the Point Pleasant area to investigate at first hand. From the many reports he collected, he established that Mothman was between 5 and 7 feet tall, grey or brown in color and man-shaped but without any arms or head. It had luminous bright red eyes where a manÂ’s shoulders would be. The wings were folded back when not in use, and the wingspread was about 10 feet. The majority of sightings were made in November and December 1966; then Mothman was gone.</strong>DuH<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><img src="http://www.legionofterror.com/images/lot_dageronthm.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Philippine White Lady<br>by Marvin Llavore<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>While I was in Philippines during my vacation, I stayed with my relatives in the province, country-side. One night I was walking around the woods trying very hard not to stare at the dark forest. As I was walking along, I encountered a lady in a white dress. I asked her if she needed help or directions. I asked if she was one of my aunts or cousins, but she gave no response. I went up to her to look at her face, but it was covered by her hair. So I looked closer and closer at her face, and I still couldn't see it because the darkness also covered her face. So I decided to return home.<br><br>As I proceeded back to my house, she started crying, and then she ran into the dark forest. I was about to follow her, but I heard my Mom calling me from the house. As I got there, my relatives all gave me a weird, terrified look. I asked them what was wrong, and my Mom said she saw me talking with the white lady. I really didn't care until she told me she was a ghost.<br><br>The story of the white lady goes like this....The white lady lures you into the forest at night and gets you lost, and you will never be found again. The story horrified me because I was so close to following her into the forest. I thanked my Mom for saving my life..the end.<br><br><img src="http://www.legionofterror.com/images/lot_morpheusthm.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone ever experienced this?<br><br>It seems that a langsuyar originates after her death ( still living ) while childbirth. The 'attacking' method is far more different than a pontianak. Langsuyars usually prey on man .<br><br>But the most interesting part is they charm the man with her spells and magic. The man would run after her just to be with her. ( Unless if he notices her long nails - which look like those worn in Thai or Balinese culture dances ) Automatically, he inserts her long hair into a deep hole in her neck so that she looks like a normal woman and acts like them.<br><br>Langsuyars are known to born elfin children. Always, the relationship between a human and a langsuyar always come to a tragic end ( What kind of end? suicide? kills?).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~harleyd/images/Zombie3.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I started messing w/ a ouija @ age 14 just playing around for fun. It told me that my future husband would be 20 when we met soon to be 21. His job would make him travel. And his initials would be TNT. It also said that after dating for a while he would travel north but soon realize that he loved and move back home to get married. We would have a son. Sure enough months passed and I met him. Everything held true to what the LOUISA said. I was aw struck. Before getting married and having a child I continued to become addicted to the board. Especially when my boyfriend (not yet husband) Tom moved to Michigan for a job. The board became evil.<br><br>A spirit named Zack was obsessed w/ me. He said I was his wife (Kate) in a before life. He became VERY aggressive. He said he would do what ever it took to gain control so that I would once again be his. Even if it were through Tom (boyfriend). Tom moved back home and we went to a Christmas dinner. We left very early.<br><br>On the way home Tom started to run stop lights and signs. He looked at me and said "IF YOU WANT EXCITEMENT BITCH I WILL GIVE YOU EXCITEMENT." I was scared to death. We pulled up in front of our house, I jumped out of the car and Tom said calmly but firmly "GET THE HELL BACK IN THE CAR." I did. This was not Tom. There was no expression on his face at all. When we got inside of the house Tom's whole personality changed for the better w/ no clue of what had happened. I pulled out the Ouija and all it would say is "I TOLD YOU SO."<br><br>Upon playing again Zack told me that I would see him in 2 weeks.<br><br>Everyone was out of town about a week later and I woke up to see Zack standing in my bedroom door. I pulled out the board and it said "DID YOU SEE ME". I have not and will not touch another Ouija board. Since then I have a protective ghost that follows me. She shows up for comfort in stressful situations........<br><br>LeeAnn........<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>well, i had a spirit that used to follow me , and when i got ont he board, it would tell me "DIE BITCH, DIE"<br>the light above my head would start swaying back and forth<br>and then the planchet would fly across the room<br>it was always very interesting<br>damn, that spirit was and is quite evil<br>and he has a liking for me<br>or, a death wish for me<br>well, the next time i got on, a different spirit got on and said "This is not a game" very slowly, and very very spooky<br><br>i didnt use another one for about 5 yrs<br>then i got on, and the old one came back and said "DIE BITCH DIE"<br>all over again<br><br>but that time, we were in a big rose garden, and saw this big black shadow figure (that looked big and black in the lightening).......yet it was lightening in a clear sky, no clouds at all.<br>we all got scared shitless, and ran as fast as we could to the car and lefti have tried to banish him, in every single way i or others could think of. i am not sure he is banishable  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://spiritrealm.iwarp.com/REEPER2.JPG"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Two Places at Once<br>from Gustavo Glorioso<br><br>I am a teacher in the Buffalo NY area. A couple of weeks ago my ex-student teacher, Stacy, showed up with this picture and its story. About four years ago she had a bad car accident in her VW Beatle (old one). She loved that car. She fell asleep on the wheel and never knew she had the accident. She later awoke in the hospital with tubes in a bad shape. Recently the young man who bought her totaled car called her to tell her that he fixed the car and would like to show it to her. She agreed and invited him to stop at her family's home. When she saw the car in such excellent shape, she got excited and asked the young man if she could take a picture of him and the car, and he agreed.<br><br>She took the picture, but when her mother saw the developed picture, she asked her what she was doing inside her new car (parked in front of the VW). She asked how could she be inside the car if she was taking the picture!<br><br>I take fashion photography on the side, and she asked me for an explanation of the image. I examined the image several times with a lupe, the negative, the other negatives in that roll, prior and later pictures for a double exposure and could not find an explanation. I took the picture to the store that develops my pictures for the technicians to examine. They cannot find any explanation, but they asked why was the pavement stained. I asked Stacy the same question and she said that the pavement is not stained. She asked me the color of the stain, and when I said that it was yellow she got scared. Then, she told me that yellow was the color of the car when she had it.DuH<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><img src="http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/car_double_lg.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>When I was a child we lived in a old farm house in Punggol. It was a two-bedroom, two-story job with a large yard and several barns. It seemed I was the only one who ever saw or heard anything unusual there. I heard a lady at night: she would hum and had a saying that she spoke. The saying was quite stupid and made no sense, not even now. I never saw her, though. We would go on vacation, and after a day or two she would be there. My mother said it was a dream. I knew it wasn't. I would pinch until I drew blood and still hear her voice.<br><br>There were also the shadow people. It seemed that they moved within the shadows of the night. And at times I was terrified of them. I don't remember why now. The most horrifying experience that I had was this: It was late well after midnight. My parents were snoring in their room. I heard footsteps on the stairs. We lived close to a large city, so I thought it was a burglar. But the steps were only on one side. I heard it come to the top of the steps and stop. I was holding my breath... I was so afraid. I could still hear the snores of the room next door. The doorknob slowly turned and the door swung open.<br><br>It was not a man or even a human that entered the room. It was about six feet tall with eyes that glowed like two rubies. I thought it was the demons coming to take me away. It didn't speak to me then. It stood and stared down at me. I had long hair then and had gone to bed with a sterling silver comb that had been my mother's. She had told me for some strange reason not to loose it. (I had looked at her like she was stupid because I was only going to bed.) It was gone in the morning and was never found. Neither have I seen that thing again.<br><br>Now I live in a different house. I used a chant to see spirits. At first nothing happened at all. Then months went by and little things did happen. I thought it was more me then anything I was cold all the time and the pictures that I took of the house came out weird. They had all these little bubbles in them. Only some were bright and quite large. My cats started at times behaving strangling. They would puff up and hiss at nothing. I have heard things voices almost in the house. Most of the time I think it is my son but he is either not home or dead to the world. There is an immense cold that follows me here. It leaves when my husband is around. So I continue my quest to find what is going on here.<br><br></strong> contributed by Mabel Tang  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<img src="http://www.zombienews.com/londonwolf11.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> We have lived in this apartment  in Toa Payah for about 15 months. My four-year-old started talking about ghosts - one in particular. It was a little girl named Jennifer. She also started talking about a  monster that was in the closet. She said it was mean and that  an angel tried to protect her. Shortly after, I started seeing a male figure around our apartment. I see him in the hall, outside our windows, and I saw him in the girls' room. He would always disappear right after I saw him - just vanish. That's when I realized that it was a ghost, but I never said anything to the girls because I didn't want them scared. Shortly after that, my four-year-old started talking about a man that would wake her up to play in the middle of the night. When she would say no, he would hit, pinch and bite her. I have seen the marks. She doesn't sleep in there much anymore. I can't blame her. I have also been hit and had something try to pull my pillow out from under my head when I was lying down. Everyone was asleep except my husband and I, but he was in the living room. He couldn't have gotten out of the room without out me seeing him.<br><br>The ghost has made things move, He has hit my four-year-old with sticks. She was hit once in the middle of her back by a plastic stick. But she couldn't have hit herself in that spot and there was no one else around that could have done it. When I asked her about who did it, she said that there was no one there. That the stick just came up and hit her. He has made pictures lift up and come off the walls without doing anything to the the nails. He made my 19" color TV fly off my entertainment center and land on my four-year-old who was sitting on the floor two to three feet from the entertainment center. He hides things. You can look for something in one place and it's not there, but if you go back it will be there. My six-year-old has talked about a black thing that would get in the crib with my baby. She would come into our room crying about it. I would check and it would be gone. Last week the baby woke up three or four nights in a row at 2:21 a.m. crying.<br><br>There is a little girl ghost. She is about four. I have only seen her three times. She seems to be very quiet and shy. I have had a team of monks here to investigate. Also the room temp would drop a few degrees in the girls' closet and in one corner of the room. They said that they could do an exorcism, but they would have to come back. They never came back. They made excuses not to. I can't blame them.<br><br>I had tried burning incense, hanging blessed crosses and I have had the apartment blessed. Nothing worked. It just made him madder. We finally got a hold of a medium, who came and got rid of the male ghost by talking to him and making him go into the light. The little girl ghost left when the medium got here. She told him that she was just here to protect my daughters and myself from the male ghost. It has been very peaceful the last week or so since the "exorcism." All I have to say is: NEVER underestimate what the spirit can do. Enough said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.zombienews.com/pariswolf01.gif"></strong></div>
