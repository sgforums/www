            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Giant Thunderbird Returns<br><br>A gigantic bird has been sighted in Pennsylvania. On the evening of Tuesday, September 25, 2001, a 19-year-old claimed to have seen an enormous winged creature flying over Route 119 in South Greensburg, Pennsylvania. The witness's attention was drawn to the sky by a sound that resembled "flags flapping in a thunderstorm." Looking up, the witness saw what appeared to be a bird that had a wingspan of an estimated 10 to 15 feet and a head about three feet long.<br><br>This is the most recent sighting of an incredible creature - most often considered a myth - known as a "Thunderbird." Sightings of these gigantic birds, apparently unknown to science, go back hundreds of years and are a part of many Native American legends and traditions. They have even been blamed for abducting, or attempting to abduct, small children. And now they seem to be soaring through the skies of Pennsylvania.<br><br>On September 25, the witness told researcher Dennis Smeltzer, that the huge black or grayish-brown bird passed overhead at about 50 to 60 feet. "I wouldn't say it was flapping its wings gracefully," the witness told Smeltzer, "but almost horrifically flapping its wings very slowly, then gliding above the passing big rig trucks."<br><br>The witness observed the creature for about 90 seconds in total, even seeing it land on the branches of a dead tree, which nearly broke under its great weight. Unfortunately, no other witnesses saw the bird on this date and no tangible evidence could be found for the bird after the site was searched.<br><br>What makes this story more interesting, however - even plausible - is that other sightings of similar description were reported in Pennsylvania in June and July, 2001.<br><br>On June 13, a resident of Greenville, Pa. was startled by the great size of the grayish-black creature seen soaring overhead, at first thinking it was a small airplane or ultralight aircraft! This witness observed the bird for at least 20 minutes, clearly seeing its fully feathered body and confidently estimating its wingspan to be about 15 feet and its body length at about 5 feet. This bird, too, was seen to perch on a tree for at least 15 minutes before taking to air again and flying off toward the south. A neighbor of this witness claimed to have seen the creature the next day, describing it as "the biggest bird I ever saw."<br><br>Less than a month later, on July 6, a witness in Erie County, Pa. reported a very similar sighting, according to an item in Fortean Times magazine. Again, the creature's wingspan was estimated to be 15 to 17 feet and was described as "dark gray with little or no neck, and a circle of black under its head. Its beak was very thin and long - about a foot in length."<br><br>These were not the first sightings of Thunderbirds in Pennsylvania, as you'll read later in this article. And if these reports are accurate, these birds are the largest flying creatures not yet identified by science. By comparison, the largest known bird is the wandering albatross with a wingspan of up to 12 feet. The largest predatory birds - which the Thunderbird is most often likened to - are the Andean condor (10.5-foot wingspan) and the California condor (10-foot wingspan).<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH</strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chosen<br><br>Story by Keng Wong of Malaysia<br><br>This incident happened to my uncle in 1966, during a time when my mother's family was not well financially sound. Theirs was a family of ten including my grandparents. They lived in a one-bedroom house near Bangsar, which at that time was near railway tracks.<br><br>My mother and my aunt were working as waitresses in the University Malaya canteen. They were used to working until very late at night, at times, even past midnight. Nothing unusual ever happen until one fateful night.<br><br>That night, they reached home after midnight. My mother bathed and got ready to go to bed. Before she slept, she hung her dress above her bed. She could see everyone was already asleep in their shared bedroom. She was very tired herself. She lay down and was half asleep when something strange happened.<br><br>In her dreamy eyes, she saw the whole room became very misty. It was as if a cloud of thick fog flew into the room. She tried to get up or said something but somehow, she just couldn't move or talk. Then, she saw three men with bald head, wearing white robes with brown cloth tied as belts around their waist. Their costumes were exactly like what the Chinese wear in traditional funeral. They were floating in the air and sort of looking for something on the ground.<br><br>A brief moment passed as the three men went looking at my mother's brothers one by one. Then he came down from the air and stood in front of my eldest uncle. My mother couldn't remember what happened after that but she woke up suddenly with panting breath, and sweat all over her body. She quickly got up and offered some incense to the deities, requesting for blessings. Then she went back to her bed. My grandmother was awoke then and she asked my mother to pull the cover over her eldest brother.<br><br>The next morning, my mother asked her younger brother if anything happened last night. He said that he dreamt that their eldest brother was being carried away in a casket by several strangers on a graveyard. My mother knew something was not right but she just kept quiet because she didn't know what to do. She prayed constantly for the safety of her brother and everything went on as usual for that day.<br><br>The next day, my uncle got ready for school as usual. He had his breakfast and then left to board the school bus that took him and one of his brothers to school every morning. On the way to school, the driver lost control of the bus and the bus was wreaked up badly near the Asunta Hospital.<br><br>My eldest uncle died of excessive loss of blood in that crash although his brother was saved. A piece of bar strike his head and he couldn't be saved in time. Everyone was really sad, especially my mom, as she spent a lot of time with this particular brother of hers. This story was told by my mother with most sincere heart, and she could not forget it even until today.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Duh<br><br></strong><img src="http://www.freehorror.com/animations/1/fadingskull.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ghost Answers the Phone<br>by Mary Lim<br><br>I have never been a believer in ghosts, but after what happened to me about a year ago, I can't help but reconsider my position on this. I am a telephone sales representative and at the time of this occurrence I was marketing a phone service. Here is what happened to me about a year ago at work.<br><br>On Thursday, April 26th I made a sales call to an client's company. It started just like any other call. Yes, I need to speak to Mr.. or Mrs. B_____ The woman identified herself as Mrs. B_____ and I continued on with the normal sales call. She seemed very interested and asked a lot of questions, but when I came to the decision making part, she quickly stopped me insisting that I had to talk to her husband. Her objections were the same every time I attempted to close. She explained that she had tried to get him to change phone carriers before but in her words, "he was married to SingTel and refused to make any changes."<br><br>She also quickly pointed out that since his retirement he spent a great deal of time fishing and was not easy to get in touch with and it would be best to try early in the morning, before he left for his favorite hobby. She also indicated that their phone bills were getting out of hand because he made lengthy calls to Australia. I felt that the plan would be beneficial to them. On that note I decided that perhaps this was worth a call back and told her that I would call her husband the next day.<br><br>The next day I made a call that I will probably never forget the rest of my life! On the call back, the husband did answer the phone. I introduced myself in the normal fashion and explained that I had been talking to his wife the previous day and she had suggested that I speak to him. You can imagine the shock and horror, when he distraughtly stated to me, "Lady, I donÂ’t know who you were talking to, but my wife just died and I am not in any mood to speak to anyone!" With that he quickly hung up the phone.<br><br>In a way I was thankful that he did hang up the phone because I honestly donÂ’t know what transition one would use in this case. On the other hand, I would have loved to ask him if he did indeed love to go fishing and if he made lengthy calls to Austalia where their kids are studying Â– call it morbid curiosity!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  DuH<br><br></strong><img src="http://www.zombienews.com/frightnight04.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Nicholas Tse's fans, please don't cry...  This photo was taken when Nicholas was filming a MTV about a year ago (Can't remember the name of the song).  There is also a rumor emerging around that it was the omen contributed to the recent downfall on Nicholas's career.  Believe it or not, the rumor said Nicholas "felt" something when he was about going into the coffin as instructed by the MTV director.  Nicholas is the kind of brave guy who don't give a damn to superstition, like how he oust ghosts in the movie 2002 with techno weapons.  However, the moment before he entered the coffin, he was seen hesitated for a few seconds that is somewhat unusual from his character.<br><br>Rumor also said Nicholas temporarily left his job for a break because he is secretly going to Thailand to seek help from some Masters to help him do a cleansing.  He needs to cast out the negative energy and pick up the good one.  Nobody knows when he will come back nor whether he can come back.  Whichever reason he is having for his leave, we do wish Nicholas to come back well and come back soon.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://100megs14.com/~spiworld/spi/gallery/fod/dead/009/TW65B-ENT03001_th.jpg"></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I have a little action figure. One night Ii lay in my bed having difficulties sleeping. It was a little warm in my house and I sleep better when there is air conditioning, but this time there wasn't any. I managed to fall asleep after two hours of lying in the bed, but I soon was awakened to movement on my hand. At that time, I had a nightstand adjacent to my bed where I kept my crucifix. For some odd reason - I'm guessing because I move in my sleep and I threw my arm onto the nightstand - I felt little small footsteps on my hand. It managed to wake me up, but I was so tired that I ignored it and kept my eyes closed, but I still twitched my hand. Then I grew curious when it continued, so I opened my eyes. To my surprise, I saw my old action figure trying to get my crucifix! Once he saw me open  my eyes, he quickly turned around and hopped of the nightstand and ran quickly away. I know i wasn't dreaming because I felt him and heard his little footsteps scatter away on my carpet floor.<br><br>The next day at high school, I told my friends. Of course, they laughed at me and said to stay off of drugs. Then one day my best friend spent the night. I had already told him the story, so he wanted to see for himself. We both got tired, so I slept on the bed while he slept on the floor. At 3:00 in the morning, he jumped up and woke me. He shouted, "Dude, I saw him! I saw Deadpool (the name of the toy)! I heard his fast little footsteps and I saw him run under your bed!" I said to him, "I told you" and went back to sleep, acting as if it were nothing. He stayed up and watched some movies because he couldn't return to sleep.<br><br>Now that toy rests in the mouth of a preserved alligator head - and I keep a close eye on it.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><img src="http://movieweb.com/movie/smallsoldiers/co6.jpg"></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Carrying Her Own Head<br><br>A lot of hotels are claimed to be haunted one way or other. Ghost stories from hotels are usually nothing scary with some of the victims claimed they saw shadows or figures while others claimed to dream of them or heard ghost cries. Nevertheless, some ghost stories happening in hotels are very scary and terrifying.<br><br>The is this story told to me by a friend, Yeang. According to him, it happened to a security guard of a 3-star hotel somewhere in Southeast Asia. I will not disclose the hotel's name as this may prove harmful to its business!<br><br>The security guard (let's call him James) was relatively a new staff at the hotel. That night, he came in to work as usual at about 10pm. He went on his usual rounds at about 12am and nobody had seen him since then -- at least not until he came in next day to resign.<br><br>The manager when asked James why he wanted to resign in such a hush and he told her what happened:<br><br>I was on my usual rounds at midnight yesterday. As I was approaching the hotel laundry, I started having this cold shiver down my spine. I thought the air-conditioning must have malfunctioned. I did not think much of it until I heard noises coming from the laundry.<br><br>At first, it sounded like someone trying to break something. There were sounds of 'tong, tong, tong' and then there was a sudden loud cry. It was not any usual cry of a person. It was so high pitch and broke the silence in the basement of the hotel. Someone must be in trouble and great fear. I rushed to the laundry entrance and peeped inside. There were neither sign of anyone inside nor the lights were switched on. I decided to unlock the door and go inside to check it out.<br><br>As I stepped into the laundry, I could feel the air inside was even colder than outside. All my hair stood up and I could feel the fear in me. I shone my torch around the laundry and found no one there. I wanted to double check just in case anyone was hiding behind the machines. I gathered all the courage I had and walked further in. I had my torchlight on my left hand and a stick on my right.<br><br>I walked carefully and slowly as I shone my torch around. I still found no one and I decided to turn back and forget all about it. However, as I turned around, I saw something I swear I would not forget for the rest of my life.<br><br>There was this lady, wearing a long white night gown. The horrifying part is that she was headless! I was stunned and I wanted to run but my feet just froze there. This is not really the worst part yet. I took another look at the ghost and I saw her holding her own head by her side. The eyes were staring straight at me! I was in such great fright that I just fainted there.<br><br>I woke up a few hours later and I went straight home. I was still horrified by fear and I think it would be of my best interest to resign.<br><br><img src="http://www.sfogs.withinbudget.net/ghostpix/hantu1.jpg"></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It was a raining and cold when I got out of work that evening. It would soon be dark. I had a long day at work and I hate getting home in the dark. So, I decided to take the short cut, which cuts through a graveyard.<br><br>I grew up in this kampong near Choa Chu Kang cemetry and I've heard my share of queer stories about that graveyard. However, I was a sceptic. I just didn't believe in ghost. I brushed away all those stories claiming they were made up by some people to scare others. I pulled my hood on and started the walk home. The rain had seized by then but the path was still all muddy. I slowly made my way through the graveyard, thinking of nothing but to get home soon.<br><br>As I made my way deeper and deeper into the graveyard, I heard a faint tapping sound. I couldn't make out which direction the sound came from but it seemed to be all over me. I ignored it and kept on, not wanting to be late. Nevertheless, the tapping seemed to gradually get louder as I went on. This became quite annoying for I thought maybe someone is trying to spook me and I definitely wasn't in the mood that evening.<br><br>The noise became louder still and I am beginning to be able to sense where it came from. I decided i had to check it out. Slowly, I find my way through a little path. Then, right ahead of me, there was a white man crouching down in front of a grave. He was busy tapping away.<br><br>Before I could open my mouth and ask what he was doing, he stopped and turned towards me. He didn't look anything unusual or even spook, but there's one thing about his eyes that made the hairs at the back of my head stand. He looked straight at me and said, "They spelt my name wrong," and then disappeared.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/skulltomb.jpg"></div>
