However, there are several contradictions provided by sceptics and scientists to deny their existence.<br><br>In the olden days, people were more superstitious, but their belief in vampires was based on "evidence" which did not seemed to have any other explanation.<br><br>These incidents mostly revolved around cemeteries. Frightening noises were heard coming from graves and often, strange "forms" were seen wandering around the tombstones at night.<br>When investigated, some graves were found open and empty! There were also blood-stained corpses found and even some which remained quite undecomposed. They were thought to be vampires! However, they were more likely to be victims of a "live" burial.<br><br>Premature death was common in the past and present.<br><br>A rare illness called catalepsy puts victims into suspended animation (meaning death-like trance) which could last for quite a period of time. However if he/she is buried in this condition might wake up in the coffin only to die of starvation or suffocation. In a bid to save their own lives, they might had bitten at their own flesh in hunger...perhaps this could explain the blood-filled coffins and corpses.<br><br>As for those corpses that were missing from the graves, they could have been stolen by body snatchers to sell to doctors who wanted them for medical research.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br>[/img]<span class="large"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LONDON, ENGLAND -- October 10, 1997 -- According to Haitian folk belief, zombis are people whose will, awareness and memory have been stolen by a sorcerer. It is believed the sorcerer -- called a boko -- accomplishes this either by casting a spell over a person or by giving them a magical potion. Once the boko has captured a person's spirit, the victim appears dead and is usually buried in an above-ground tomb common in Haiti. The boko then steals and reanimates the body and sets it to work as a slave. According to tradition, a boko can also obtain power over a person who dies of natural causes by snatching the person's spirit shortly after a death before the spirit has wandered away.<br><br>Belief in zombis is widespread in Haiti and in many communities there are individuals who are considered to be zombis not only by their neighbours but even their families. Indeed the phenomenon is taken so seriously the Haitian Penal Code considers making someone into a zombi as a form of murder.<br><br>But in a paper in this week's The Lancet, two researchers, professor Roland Littlewood of the department of anthropology and psychiatry at London's University College and Dr. Chavannes Douyon of the Polyclinique Medica in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, conclude many so-called zombies may in fact be individuals with psychiatric disorders or brain damage.<br><br>In their study, the researchers report on three individuals who were considered to be zombis by their families and neighbours. They found the first individual appeared to have a severe psychiatric condition called catatonic schizophrenia, which can make a person mute and immobile; the second to have brain damage and epilepsy, perhaps due to an episode of oxygen starvation of the brain; and the third individual, a severe learning disability, perhaps due to fetal-alcohol syndrome.<br><br>Such people are commonly seen wandering in Haiti and it is possible that belief in zombis became part of Haitian culture as a way to explain the medical condition of these mentally ill individuals and to integrate them into society, the researchers write.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://loris.net/zombie/expnld.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>This is a real story spread among Singapore taxi drivers.<br><br>It was about 7.30 pm in Chinese New Year's eve. Taxi driver Ah Tan, a<br><br>60-year-old man, lived in Bedok Reservoir Rd, was rushing back home to<br><br>celebrate the family dinner.<br><br>He happened to pass by a remote path somewhere near Punggol. That used<br><br>to be a farm village but has been deserted for a few years. There were<br><br>altogether four bus-stops along the roadside.<br><br>While he was driving along the path, he saw a young lady at the bus-stop<br><br>flagging for his taxi. At first, he wanted to take the lady but he was<br><br>going to be late for his dinner. Being a person particular for punctuality,<br><br>he decided not to take this customer. Then he carried on driving. To<br><br>his surprise, there was another lady flagging him down. This time he<br><br>felt familiar because she was wearing a red T-shirt and black skirt but<br><br>due to fading light, he could not see her face.<br><br>When he passed by the third bus-stop, he felt a bit of horror as another<br><br>lady was flagging him again, in the same red and black clothes! How<br><br>would a lady moves faster than the wheels? The distance between two<br><br>stops is about 0.8 KM away! This time, he really felt horrible and stepped<br><br>the accelerator harder.When passing the fourth one, a lady charged at his<br><br>car!<br><br>He was driving at least at the speed of 100 KM/H! The lady flew over his<br><br>vehicle and dropped inside a drain next to the bus-stop. Ah Tan cried out<br><br>due to extremely horror! The victim once again in red and black clothes.<br><br>Ah Tan felt so bad and had no mood celebrating New Year.<br><br>Finally, he decided to report to the police. The body in red and<br><br>black skirt was found, it was a young Chinese lady aged between 20 to<br><br>25 year old. Ah Tan's horror got attested. The lady's cause of death<br><br>is not by car accident but stabbed by sharp object! She had been dead<br><br>for about three days, the body already started to decay.<br><br>After the police statement, Ah Tan thought of the whole things had been over.<br><br>Of course the police snickered at his initial statement and made him do<br><br>another 'credible' one.<br><br>One week later, Ah Tan's horrible feeling had lessen. What a  coincidence,<br><br>he striked first prize 4-D for his taxi number plate. He won a big sum<br><br>of money, he was so delighted in this, but unfortunately he fell down<br><br>in the bath room and fractured his right arm. He was admitted to Changi hospital.<br><br>In the hospital, he started to have nightmare night after night. A young lady,<br><br>in red and black skirt, kept calling him "Ah Peh, li di si lo lai?"(Uncle, when<br><br>are you coming down?). He really  cannot tolerate to it anymore.<br><br>Moreover, the inflammation started on his wound. Luckily, one of his<br><br>friend who is a Taoist priest suggested to give up his stake's money<br><br>instead of plead for 'safety'. He told Ah Tan that the lady ghost is<br><br>gnawed by serious grievances and has become a ferocious spirit.<br><br>Since she could not avenge the murderer due to some reasons, Ah Tan<br><br>chosen to be the 'scapegoat' for her rebirth'. The 4D winning stake<br><br>is to exchange for his life!<br><br>After a battle of mind, the lady still disturbed him in the meanwhile,<br><br>with a shattered nerves he decided to give up his $100,000 to The<br><br>Charity Community Chest. Strange enough, he recovered from the illness<br><br>rapidly.<br><br>Everything seemed to be over, but a short period after his discharged,<br><br>his wife striked 4-D again, the stake amount is also  $100,000! This is<br><br>because, one day, his wife went market and bought some vegetable, she<br><br>saw the wrapper was the used newspaper which reported the young lady's<br><br>murder case. Strangely, there was four numbers on it,  and his wife<br><br>bet on and striked. After a fierce argument between them, Ah Tan failed<br><br>to convince his wife to donate the money. A deep worry began to burden<br><br>Ah Tan when his wife started puzzle head and like to put on red T-shirt<br><br>and black skirt. She seemed to go mad and the temper got hotter and hotter.<br><br>One morning, she suddenly told Ah Tan that the life is meaningless'.<br><br>This time Ah Tan was decisive, he gave up all the money immediately. He<br><br>brought his wife to the temple and asked the monks to release the young lady's<br><br>souls from purgatory.<br><br>After this incident, he stop buying 4-D or involves in all kinds of gambling.<br><br>Not long ago, he'd also gave up his taxi-license.<br><br><span class="large"></span><img src="http://www.horrorfind.com/imageofhorror/cards/thumbs/bridecard.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>blurblop: sorry hor........been busy the past few days <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> thanks for contributing all the articles and stories.<br>this is something i lifted from some website:<br><br>My Story: Tekong has many tales of the extraordinary, being a platoon commander of bmtc for sometime, i have heard of countless encounters with the third kind from my fellow collegues and soldiers under my care. Here are some of those...<br><br>1: Bmtc school 2 SOC ground, the one that is directly behind bravo company. At nite, those recruits who are not sleeping yet in those companies nearby to that soc ground would claim to see a woman crying and sitting on top of the jacobs ladder (an obstacle made of wooden logs shaped like a pyramid).<br><br>2: All recruits have to go for their range test, and the usual test venue would be the tekong 100m range which is situated further down SISPEC. The funny thing is recruits are not supposed to bring their m16 rifles with them to the toilet when they pee, they are supposed to pass them to their buddies before they go ease their call of nature. In the past, the bringing of rifles into the washroom was allowed but the idea was phased when something tragic happened. Once a recruit stole 2 5.56mm bullets and killed his platoon commander and then followed to shoot himself under the chin in one of the cubicles in the toilet. This resulted in a hole in the zinc roof which covers the toilet from above. From that incident onwards, no one is allowed to carry their rifles with them to the loo, the gaping hole has also since been patched back.<br><br>3: Before reaching the 100m range in pulau tekong, we have to travel along a track which is very long and surrounded by dense vegetation on both sides, where one side is the live hand grenade throwing bay. I was told this story by tekong tonner drivers. They told me that at night when they are shelduled to pick up recruits from the 100m range due to night range, they would have to speed up their vechicles to the maximum, because if they don't do so and travel at a causal speed they would see heads flying and floating in front of the vechicles' window.<br><br>4: There is one part in tekong which is reclaimed from the sea, where most soldiers go for trench digging because the soil there is softer and more loose. There is a a bridge separating the reclaimed land and the original tekong, it's called DOGRA bridge. Whenever a vechicle passes by that bridge, the commuters must never look back because if they do they would have seen old headless soldiers searching for something on the ground, this even happens in broad daylight.<br><br>5: Everytime we are on the graduation 24km route march round the island, we would walk pass a certain area called PERMANTANG, this place is surrounded by countless rubber trees and oil palms, i remembered reminding recruits not to take photos of any of the tress, telling them that they will be charged if they do. But the actual truth is, if you take photos in that area, you will also see some pictures of the third kind in it.<br><br>6: There is this white room in the camp beside the present SISPEC. It was said that before tekong was declared a military zone by the government, many ncc groups used to visit the island. There was once this female ncc cadet loitered into this room in the morning, and she spent the whole day walking and walking to find her way out of the white room. She managed to come out only when it's near 12 midnight that night. This was told my company's storeman and he knew the girl personally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Attack of the massive blob!<br><br>Kenny writes, "This is a screen shot of a small avi that i was making to try out my new "pencam." My brother in the next room over called me out to ask what I wanted for dinner so i got up to talk to him.<br><br>This was sometime after 5 pm. I forgot to stop recording the avi. When I got back, I stopped it and watched my horrible attempts at...kung fu. during my leave to talk to my brother, a ghastly form seemed to seep from out of the air. It was really creepy. The weird form quickly swirled around me almost entirely. Then, just as quickly as it came, it dissipated into the air again. I watched a few times wondering how something so visual on a video could be unable to be seen by the naked eye. After I watched it for the billionth time, I remembered that i could take a screen shot of it. I'm very glad that I did because only a month ago, my power went out while I was playing on half-life. My whole hard drive was erased. I put the screen shot on a disk to give to my paranormally obsessed best friend. That is how I am able to send it to ya'll now. I live in Plano Texas.<br><br>This was during November because I remember that i had my B-Day party the day before this. If you haven't figured it out yet, I got the "pencam" for my B-Day. Please, if you can tell what this is, please tell me because this really freaked out my family and my friends."<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://ghoststudy.com/monthly/jun02/blob.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"></span><span class="large"></span>Apparition of boy in a tree!<br>Topaz writes "This is the very first ghost photo that got me seriously interested in the paranormal.  This photo was given to my father in 1987, when I was nine. It was taken close to Baton Rouge by a nature photographer whom my father knew.  The photo was taken to Louisiana Society for Psychical Research, and the psychics learned that the Cajun boy named Bobby carrying the baseball was missing, and somehow wound up deceased.  The pictures, regular and enlarged, are hanging in frames in my office.  If you look slightly off the upper right hand corner, you will notice something interesting.  You can see the white fingers grasping the white spherical object."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br>This is a great picture of what appears to be the apparition of a small boy. This is not a smudge or anything in front of the camera because it has dimension, meaning the boy is actually behind the branches. There is also an interesting image of a white face to the right of the boy.<br><br><img src="http://ghoststudy.com/monthly/may02/boy.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://ghoststudy.com/monthly/may02/boy2.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A house in Telok Kurau. Story by Xaby.<br><br>"My grandmother was alone with the maid, then she suddenly heard the maid shout from the kitchen,"Hantu! Hantu!" My grandmother then quickly rushed out from her room to the kitchen and asked the maid what had happened. The maid then reaccount in malay that she saw a figure walk into her room and gave her a devilish smile. After saying, the maid then broke down in tears. My grandmother at the moment just dismissed it as the maid's imagination and told her to take a rest.<br><br>Later that afternoon, my grandmother told my auntie what happened earlier, and my auntie who is a devoted christian of course concluded that the maid was lying in order to get some rest. After that, my grandmother sorts of agree to my auntie's explaination and make no mention about the matter anymore.<br><br>A few days passed and everything was looking quite normal, then out of the blue, the maid went to my auntie that she wants to go back to Indonesia. When questioned, she replied meekly that she cannot stand the "thing" disturbing her anymore. She say that since the day she first saw the "thing" , it has been pinching and looking at her when she sleep. Sometimes she would even wake up in the middle of her sleep and looking into the face of the "thing". After hearing the explaination given by the maid, my auntie blew her top and scolded the maid for making up stories. But the maid had already made up her mind on leaving, so on the very next day the maid was send back to the maid agency.<br><br>A new maid from the agency was brought in, but nothing unusual happen to her this time. Instead, it happened to my grandmother.<br><br>On one of the night at about 1am in the morning, my grandmother went to the kitchen to get a drink. But when she was just a few steps to the kitchen, she saw a figure moving towards the kitchen table and crouching behind it. When my grandmother starts walking towards the kitchen, the figure suddenly vanishes, and my grandmother was left alone in the kitchen.<br>So was that my grandmother's and the maid's imagination or is there more to it..."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.singalore.com/home/images/ghosts/redhse/window.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From an email from Francis Teo, an ex-NPCC staff sergeant from a northern<br>secondary school:<br><br>It was during one of our NPCC camp in Ubin and during our second night<br>I lead a group of 6 juniors for a nightwalk in Ubin. As you know Ubin<br>is an undeveloped island and lack most of the basis infrastructure such<br>as lighting. At that night there was no moonlight at all and armed with<br>a torch each we made our way from the camp site around Ubin. Being the<br>superstitious type, I made it a point not to venture near the cemetary<br>which was rumoured to be haunted and headed towards the jetty-approximately<br>3-4km walk from the camp site.<br><br>After a two hour walk, we reached the Pulau Ubin Community Center. As<br>we had a water parade earlier before we left the camp, 3 of my juniors<br>needed to go to the washroom. Thus the rest of us went to the basketball<br>court. One of my junior Wee Keong being a basketball freak started to<br>make attempts to jump and touch the basketball ring boasting that he could<br>dunk. Everyone else's attention was on him as my juniors started teasing<br>each other. Suddenly at the corner of my eye I spotted a white figure.<br>I turned to the side and saw a headless white figure drifting towards<br>us, saying in Chinese, "lai, gen wo wan", which meant "Come and play with<br>me".<br><br>You could have imagine how d*mned scared I felt then and I immediately<br>gathered the rest and told them to head back for the camp without turning<br>back. Within 45 minuted we reached the camp and when questioned, I told<br>my juniors honestly what I saw and it scared the sh*t out of them. Because<br>of this incident, all night walks were cancelled for other juniors.<br><br><img src="http://homex.coolconnect.com/member3/a_sf095/ghostpix/hantu1.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing scary here, just to share something I seldom tell anyone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I was a freak I guess...used to reach school at around 5.30am.<br><br>that morning, I was just sitting at one of the the class benches facing the school field at Hwa Chong Junior College at around 5.50 am, just looking around and enjoying the peace and serenity.<br><br>Suddenly I saw two white figures marching up and down along the school field... gardeners? lovers? at this time? marching? They were moving swiftly, like they were floating, their strides probably too long to be normal...hmm... I watched on, fascinated... but they suddenly disappeared at around 6 am...hmm... Luckily the place was well lit, and they did not come towards me, if not I would have really freaked out I guess, or maybe not...as I said, I was a freak then!<br><br>I used to go Chinese High really early in the morning and walk up the the completely dark slopes alone, enjoying the peace and beauty of the school compound in the dark... the sky would be covered by breathtakingly beautiful red and purple clouds. During class camps at night, I would "excuse" myself and just stroll in the dark all over the school. Of course I sometimes get goosebumps, but most of the time I just get too overwhelmed by the beauty of the dark, believe me, Im not boasting or whatever, sometimes its really beautiful, certain dark places... I dont switch on the lights when I reach the classrooms...just sit there in the dark and be overwhelmed, or inspired.<br><br>Not once have I seen anything of the third kind in CHS. Sometimes when I get scared, I feel sorry for them and actually want to approach them to help them, but of course they never appeared.<br><br>I have changed since,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
