            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.geocities.com/demonjustin/uglyfuck.jpg"><br><br>WARNING: NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED<br><br>Contributed story:-<br><br>I still remember when my office phone rang, my wife was on the line saying that she spotted maisonette in The Strait Time and it was in Jurong West  and the price was attractive. So we arranged a viewing with the agent and bought it on the spot! A little bit of history I'm going to mention so that if you came across similar case renovated extensively and we were told that the owner only stayed for a short while and moved out. When their rented shop unit from HDB arrived, they move to stay upstairs the unit. Indeed, we did found that it was true when we went over to the shop to place a deposit and signed the sale &amp; purchase agreement. But we found out later that the owner had the shop all along and they moved out for some reasons.<br><br>As the owner had bought the flats from HDB direct, they can't sell the flat yet (5 yrs rule) so they moved out to a rented flat and later rented a shop unit. I came to know from neighbours later and that more that 10 families had came &amp; went during these time. So please check with the surrounding neighbours before you purchased a flat which now I learn.<br><br>Ok! Now I will list all the incidences happened during my two and the half years there.<br><br>1) As you know, maisonette go two levels, all the rooms are upstair.<br><br>As I was watching TV in the hall, I used to see several times a black shadow darting at the stairs.<br><br>2) One night after watching TV alone, I think it was about 2.00am and I was walking past the stairs to go upstairs to sleep, I heard a voice(very clear) calling me "Papa!" once and instinctly I turn my head to my left where the voice came from. My whole body went cold then there was nothing there at all!. My wife and only daughter were sleeping soundly upstairs.<br><br>3) It was in the afternoon, my wife was washing her hair in the toilet upstairs. As she was sitting on the stool bending forward holding the shower above her head washing her hair. Suddenly, she felt that someone gave her a hard push above her head. She unable to see that time coz her eyes was covered with shampoo. Then immediately, she open her eyes and call out to my daughter. She found that my daughter was indeed downstairs playing in the hall all the time.<br><br>4) It was when a new neighbours moved in next door and when they came over to get to know us. My wife was at the gate chatting with them. And my daughter and I was watching TV in the hall. The next evening after dinner in the hawker centre, we met them in the lift. Then, during our conversation, they mentioned, "Where is your boy?"<br><br>We told them that we only got a daughter but they insisted that they saw it themselves, my daughter in the hall watching TV and there was a boy at the staircase playing and he was about 5yrs old! Both husband &amp; wife saw that!<br><br>5) There was one evening at about 10.00pm. I was having my bath upstairs then when I turn to face the wall behind me, I got shocked!! There was a transparent figure like a human (don't know gal or guy) moved from one wall to another!. I was shaking like a leave and naturally used the hot shower spray and spray to that direction. Nothing happen at all so I quickly rushed out.<br><br>6) This last one is the final straw we able to take before we moved out to our private apartment which happened the tenancy just expires.(Pls note: can only sell after two &amp; the half years for resale flat). I forgot to mentioned that all this time during the night when we are sleeping in our locked master bedroom, we always heard noises like someone twisting our room handle and trying to open the door. I did checked many times to no avail. Ok! One evening after watching TV, we all went upstairs to sleep. As we entered our masteroom, I wanted to switch on the TV in the room to continue watching the program. We all got a shock! There was a pair of deep-lighted shinning blue eyes on the TV screen. The TV was not even switch on! Just to make sure is not a fault, I even pull out the plug from the socket! The pair of eyes was still there! So all of us rush to the second guestroom and locked ourselves inside. Both my wife and daughter are crying like shit. I was also shivering but had to put up a brave front. While they fallen asleep later, I stayed up till morning. Guess what? We moved that morning!!<br><br>These are true incidences witness by three of us!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/redeyes.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a valley in the Fichtel Mountains a shepherd tended his flock in a green meadow. Several times it happened that after driving his herd home he discovered that one of the animals was missing. All searching was in vain. They were lost and they remained lost.<br><br>Watching more carefully, he saw a large wolf creep out of the forest thicket and seize a lamb. Angrily he chased after him, but the enemy was too fleet. Before he could do anything about it, the wolf had disappeared with the lamb. The next time he took an expert marksman with him. The wolf approached, but the marksman's bullets bounced off him. Then it occurred to the hunter to load his weapon with the dried pith from an elder bush. The next day he got off a shot, and the robber ran howling into the woods.<br>The next morning the shepherd met an old neighbour woman with whom he was not on the best of terms. Noticing that she was limping, he asked her: "Neighbour, what is wrong with your leg? It does not want to go along with you."<br>"What business is it of yours?" she answered, hurrying away.<br><br>The shepherd took note of this. This woman had long been suspected of practicing evil magic. People claimed to have seen her on the Heuberg in Swabia, the KÃ¶terberg, and also on the Hui near Halberstadt.<br><br>He reported her. She was arrested, interrogated, and flogged with rods of alder wood, along with others suspected of magic, but she had denied the charges, and had been punished. She was then locked up in chains. But suddenly the woman disappeared from the prison, and no one knew where she had gone.<br><br>Some time later the poor, unsuspecting shepherd saw the hated wolf break out of the forest once again. However, this time it had not come to attack his herd, but the shepherd himself. There was a furious struggle. The shepherd gathered all of his strength together against the teeth and claws of the ferocious beast. It would have been his death if a hunter had not come by in the knick of time. In vain he fired a shot at the wolf, and then struck it down with his knife. The instant that blood began to flow from the wolf's side, the old woman from the village appeared in the field before them, writhing and twisting terribly. They finished killing her and buried her twenty feet beneath the earth.<br><br>At the place where they buried the woman they erected a large stone cross, which they named the "Wolf Stone" in memory of these events. It was never peaceful and orderly in the vicinity of the stone. The Malicious Messenger (der TÃ¼ckebote) or the Burning Man (der brennende Mann), in the language of the people, still goes about his dangerous business here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/blackdemonhead.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do You Have a Guardian Angel?<br><br>"When I was eight months pregnant with my daughter, I was so tired and disappointed in my two-year-old son. His behavior was different than other kids. Later on, at four years, he was diagnosed with A.D.H.D. with neurological impairedness and defiant behavior, but back then I did not know what was wrong with him. I was so scared that my other child will be the same way. I was so tired because my son hardly ever slept at night, and I had a husband I could not count on. I felt like a failure.<br><br>At around 7 a.m., I heard a knocking at the door, too early for anybody to visit. I got up, but my door was opening already. I got scared because the only two people with keys were my then-husband and the landlord. My husband was working and my landlord would not dare do that. But who did I see?<br><br>My grandfather walking up the stairs smiling. I screamed in happiness. "How did you make the trip?" I asked. "Who brought you here? Why didn't you call me?" The last I knew, my grandfather was sick in bed and that was some days before. He then told me that he came to visit me for a moment. I was upset at that. He then asked, "Where is your son?" I told him he was finally sleep. I told him how I felt so alone and disappointed at motherhood, and scared.<br><br>He stopped me and with a hug and told me to make me some coffee. He told me, "Now it's time for me to leave. I came to bless your son and it is done." When I went to bed, he tucked me in and looked at me with so much love, and then he said, "You will have a girl and she will be fine, and you will be fine." I smiled and then he said, "Come and give me a hug. I love you so much." I did, but then I noticed I was hugging the air. Nobody was with me. My first thought was that my grandpa passed away and I called my grandma.<br><br>Crying, I told grandma what happened, but she kept insisting grandpa was alive and fine. I asked her to check on him. She even put him on the phone. Who came to visit me that morning? Why did he look like grandpa?"<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://homex.coolconnect.com/member3/a_sf095/ghostpix/accide1.jpg"><br>Did this angel saved the accident victim?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://paranormal.about.com/library/graphics/pterosaur_lg.jpg"><br>This picture was supposed to be taken in Africa recently.<br><br><strong>In the Age of Dinosaurs there existed flying reptiles called Pterosaurs. The fossil record suggests that they appeared in the Jurassic and lived into the Cretaceous, about 65 million years ago. There have been some very large species discovered, however: the pteranodon with a wingspan of 27 ft. and the colossal quetzalcoatlus, with a wingspan of 50 ft. (and possibly up to 60 ft.). Some pterosaurs actually had fur, although they were not related to mammals.<br><br>It would seem impossible that these creatures could have survived to the present day. After all, if they existed surely people would see them flying about as they hunted for food. How could a flying population of reptiles remain hidden? There are reports that people have been seeing flying creatures that match the description of pterosaurs for a long time. People have even been, reportedly, killed by them.<br><br>In 1923 a traveler by the name of Frank H. Melland worked for a time in Zambia. He gathered native reports of ferocious flying reptiles. The natives called this creature kongamato ("overwhelmer of boats"), which was said to have lived in the Jiundu swamps in the Mwinilunga District in western Zambia, near the border of Congo and Angola. It was described as having no feathers at all, smooth skin, a wingspan between 4 ft. and 7 ft., and possessing a beak full of teeth. They were usually described as black or red. It had a reputation for capsizing canoes and causing death to anyone who merely looked at it.<br><br>In 1925, a distinguished English newspaper correspondent, G. Ward Price, was on an official visit to Rhodesia. He reported a story that a civil servant told them of the wounding of a man who entered a feared swamp in Rhodesia known to be an abode of demons. The brave native entered the swamp, determined to explore it in spite of the dangers. When he returned he was on the verge of death. He had a great wound in his chest. He recounted how a strange huge bird with a long beak attacked him. When the civil servant showed the man a picture of a pterosaur from a book of prehistoric animals, the man screamed in terror and fled from the servant's home.<br><br>Skeptics suggest that these fantastic sounding tales derived from the fanciful imaginations of natives who were hired to work at archeological digs where fossilized pterosaurs were uncovered in Tendagaru, Tanzania, in the years prior to World War I. These digs, however, took place over 900 miles from Zambia. Why did no reports of living pterosaurs come from Tanzania, where these imaginative natives lived?<br><br>Perhaps the most striking report of living pterosaurs comes not from natives, but from white explorers in the employment of the British Museum. In 1932-3 the Percy Sladen Expedition went to West Africa. In charge of the team was Ivan T. Sanderson, a well-known zoologist and writer. While in the Assumbo Mountains in the Cameroons, they made camp in a wooded valley near a steep banked river. They were out hunting near the river when Sanderson shot a large fruit-eating bat. It fell in the water, and as Sanderson was carefully making his way in the fast moving current, he lost his balance and fell. He regained his balance when his companion suddenly shouted "Look out!"<br><br>"And I looked. Then I let out a shout also and instantly bobbed down under the water, because, coming straight at me only a few feet above the water was a black thing the size of an eagle. I had only a glimpse of its face, yet that was quite sufficient, for its lower jaw hung open and bore a semicircle of pointed white teeth set about their own width apart from each other. When I emerged, it was gone. George was facing the other way blazing off his second barrel. I arrived dripping on my rock and we looked at each other. "Will it come back?" we chorused.<br><br>And just before it became too dark to see, it came again, hurtling back down the river, its teeth chattering, the air "shss-shssing" as it was cleft by the great, black, dracula-like wings. We were both off-guard, my gun was unloaded, and the brute made straight for George. He ducked. The animal soared over him and was at once swallowed up in the night."<br><br>Sanderson and George returned to camp where they asked the natives about the creature. Sanderson asked them, spreading his arms, what kind of bat is this large and is all black? "Olitiau!" was the response. They asked Sanderson where they had seen this creature. Sanderson pointed back at the river. The natives fled in terror in the opposite direction, taking only their guns and leaving their valuables behind.<br><br>In 1956 in Zambia along the Luapula river, engineer J.P.F. Brown was driving back to Salisbury from a visit to Kasenga in Zaire.  It was about 6:00 p.m. when he saw two creatures flying slowly and silently directly overhead. He, bewildered, observed that they looked prehistoric. He estimated a wingspan of about 3-3 1/2 feet, a long thin tail, and a narrow head, which he likened to an elongated snout of a dog. One of them opened its mouth in which he saw a large number of pointed teeth. He gave the beak to tail length at about 4 1/2 feet.<br><br>In 1957, at a hospital at Fort Rosebery (the same location J. P. F. Brown had reported seeing strange flying creatures the year before) a patient came in with a severe wound in his chest. The doctor asked him what had happened and the native claimed that a great bird had attacked him in the Bangweulu swamps. When asked to sketch the bird, the native drew a picture of a creature that resembled a pterosaur.<br><br>Reports of prehistoric looking flying creatures are not just limited to dense swampy regions. There are also reports of giant flying lizards from the deserts of Namibia. In 1988 Professor Roy Mackal led an expedition to Namibia where reports of a creature with a wingspan of up to 30 ft were collected. The avian cryptid usually glided through the air, but also was capable of true flight. It was usually seen at dusk, gliding between crevices between two hills about a mile apart. Although the expedition was not successful in getting solid evidence, one team member, James Kosi, reportedly saw the creature from about 1000 ft. away. He described it as a giant glider shape, black with white markings.<br><br>Africa is hiding its secrets well. If there are living dinosaurs alive today, Africa is a prime candidate for harboring them.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This took place in the old days when the houses in Japan still used paper sheets for walls and doors. A young business man was traveling through town after a day of hard work. He though he could make it back home but it got dark before he knew it. He didn't want to waste time going back to the town for shelter and thought perhaps he could find a house down the road. Lucky for him, he saw a glimmer of light a little ways off the road and decided to try asking for shelter there. He came upon this little hut and knowcked on the door. An old man came out and asked if he could be of any help. "Would you be so kind to let me stay tonight? I will pay you for a room."<br><br>"Nonsense! I'll be happy to let you stay. I don't many visitors out here. Come on in!" Te old man said. He gave the young man food and told him he could have the spare room. While walking to his appointed room, the young man noticed another room right next to his. Saying thanks to the kind old man, the young man went into his room. After he blew out the candle to go to sleep, the young man heard a soft melodic sound from the next room. It sounded like someone singing. Being curious, he crawled to the wall, wet his finger, and poked a little hole in the wall (remember the wall was made of rice paper). He peeked into the hole and saw the most beautiful woman dancing and singing, her long black hair covered one side of her face. He looked away from the wall and thought to himself, why didn't the old man introduce them? He decided to look back into the hole but all he saw was a red glow and nothing else. Maybe he was dreaming, he thought, and decided to go back to bed.<br><br>The next morning, the young man was waken up to eat breakfast. While they were both seated, the young man asked his host who was the beautiful woman in the room next to his last night. The old man was shocked. "There's no one there. That was my daughter's room until she died. She was born with a disfigurement and could never find a suitor to marry her, so she ended her life in that room."<br><br>"What was the disfigurement?"<br><br>"She was born with one red eye."<br><br>She was staring at him with her red eye through the peep hole when he was trying to look at her a second time! The young man decided not to reveal his story. He left as soon as he was done eating and thanked the old man once again for giving him shelter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><img src="http://members.aol.com/hellcatpubs/dkcoatreap.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why make it sounds so complex? i got a simpler explaination concerning human body but its based on the same scientific law.<br>i call it the 'bladder thereom'.<br>whenever your bladder is full of fluid(urine), u can feel the pressure building up inside, straining and 'begging' to let go...(release the pressure). the atmospheric pressure outside ur stomach is weaker than the pressure inside your bladder which is caused by the 'stagnant urine' retain inside it thus explaining why the air below the wings of a plane is higher in pressure(stagnant air) which in term lift up the whole aircraft and allow the jet engine or such to thrust forward the plane.<br><br>vice versa, at the moment you are releasing your urine(motion and rapid force), you can feel the bladder strains lesser which implies the pressure in the bladder is higher than the atmospheric pressure acting on your body. therefore, this explains the rapid thrusting air(same as the released urine) rushing thru the top curvature side of the jet's wings which is lower in pressure than the underside of the jet's wing. the higher beneath will force on the lower pressure on top the wing.<br>for the door case, every time a high velocity air pressure(wind) 'hit n glid' the outside of the unshut door, the accumulated pressure behind the door will push forward and overcome the lower pressure outside thus causing a rusted hinge door to creak forward eerily. once the wind tames down with its pressure released, it will have a momentarily 'stagnant air' which has the same pressure as the air behind the door thus resulting it to return to its formal position but not for long... everytime a wind rushes thru, the whole process will recur.<br><br>science are eerie right? they r the culprit behind the fear of ignorant person.</div>
