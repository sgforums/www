            <div class='col-md body'><strong>What would an Alien Race need to Invade Earth?<br><br>There are four things we must assume for an alien invasion to be realistic:<br><br>1. That there is other life elsewhere in the universe<br>2. That this life is intelligent<br>3. That it has a means of getting to Earth<br>4. That it has a reason to invade Earth<br>5. That it has the weapons technology to invade Earth<br><br>In this article I will examine each of these and assess its possibility or likelihood. If you agree that they are all possible then you must accept that the threat of an alien invasion should not merely be consigned to science fiction.<br><br>How likely is it that there is life elsewhere in the universe?<br><br>In this galaxy there are more than 10 billion stars, of which our sun is just one. There are more than 10 billion galaxies in the universe, many of which are much, much larger than our own. Many of these stars will have more than one planet, ours has nine. According to modern physics, there are also an infinite number of parallel universes. How likely can it be that Earth is the only planet on which life formed?<br><br>Do we know of any other planets where life may have existed?<br>There is a strong chance that life once existed on Mars. There is evidence of flowing water, the most important perquisite for life, and many scientists believe that bacteria have been found on various meteorites from Mars. If it did exist, that would be two planets with life in just our solar system on which life has evolved - maybe it has done on many thousands of planets elsewhere, in this universe and others. It is also thought that conditions on Saturn's moon, Europa, may be suitable for the evolution of life.<br><br>How likely is it that intelligent life has evolved?<br><br>Just because there is life on a planet, it does not have to be intelligent. If a meteorite had not wiped out the dinosaurs, mankind would not exist. Life has been evolving on Earth for 4 billion years, of which we have been around for just 1 million (1/4000th of the time), and civilisation just 4000 (1 millionth of the time). Looking at the rest of this site will tell you how many chance events could have extinguished life. However, out of all the universe, surely we cannot be the only intelligent life to evolve?<br><br>How likely is it that aliens have a means of getting to Earth?<br><br>Even if there is intelligent life elsewhere, it could be billions of light years away. The universe is stupendously large; even one light year is an incredible distance. Light travels at 300,000 kilometres per second. A light year is the distance it can travel in a year, about ten trillion (10,000,000,000,000) kilometres. The nearest star to us, Proxima Centauri, is 4.2 light years away. The whole size of our universe is estimated at one thousand trillion, trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) metres. Journeying across space, even at the impossible speed of light, would take one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) years. Clearly aliens would need to travel faster than light, or interstellar journeys would be impossibly long.<br><br>Why is travelling faster than light so difficult?<br><br>The trouble is, travelling even at the speed of light is impossible, according to Einstein. Imagine a space ship moves towards you faster than light. The space ship would arrive before the light from its origin reached you, so you would see the space ship arrive before you saw it set off, which is impossible. What happens is that as an object accelerates more energy is required, which increases its mass. This means it requires more energy to accelerate further. Accelerating to the speed of light would require infinite energy, which is impossible.<br><br>Is it possible to travel faster than light?<br><br>There are several theories as to how faster than light travel (FLT) may be possible.<br><br>1. One idea is to use parallel universes. In different universes, there would be different laws of physics, so in some the speed of light barrier would not affect an objects speed. A spacecraft would have to be able to transfer itself into another universe, accelerate past the speed of light for its journey, then return to our universe. There are obvious problems in getting to another universe, and then accelerating to a speed greater than 300,000 km/second.<br><br>2. A second idea is called 'folding space'. Imagine space has only two dimensions: length and width, but no height. This would mean it could be drawn on a sheet of paper. Imagine that you could fold this sheet of paper in half. A point on one side of the sheet would then be next to a point on the other. In this way a spacecraft could make itself next to another place, anywhere in the universe.<br><br>Clearly, space has three dimensions (length, width and height), so the idea of folding it may seem strange. But from what I've read, the same idea would apply as for two dimensions.<br><br>3. A third idea is to alter the speed of light around the spacecraft by using theoretical particles called 'exotic matter'. If the speed of light could be altered, objects could travel at higher speeds without hitting the light speed barrier. This idea could also be used to alter the speed of light at the start and destination points of a spacecraft, an idea more commonly known as a 'wormhole'.<br><br>If we do not have this technology, why would aliens?<br><br>The simple answer is that although this technology may be hundreds or thousands of years away from development on Earth, other civilisations may be much older. Closer to the centre of the universe, planets would be millions of years older, so life would have had much longer to evolve. As I mentioned before, intelligent life on Earth has only existed for a tiny fraction of its history, and many chance factors could have led to it evolving millions of years earlier. It is extremely unlikely that if extra terrestrial life did exist that it would be at a level of development at all similar to that of Earth.<br><br>What reasons would aliens have to invade Earth?<br><br>Since on Earth society has become more peaceful as it developed, it is easy to assume that alien civilisations that have developed for thousands of years would not be inclined to go to war. However this easily could not have happened elsewhere, and it is only chance that it did on Earth. Suppose the Nazis had achieved world domination in World War 2, as they easily could have done. If they discovered another civilisation they would not hesitate to destroy it - if they thought other humans had 'impure' blood then what would they think of aliens? So aliens discovering us might simply want to destroy us to racially purify the universe.<br><br>A second idea would be that they needed Earth for something, such as resources or living space. There may be very few planet's in the universe that are capable of supporting life, so aliens from an overpopulated, over-polluted world might seize any opportunity to ensure the survival of their species. It may be that their planet was destroyed, or made inhospitable; perhaps in one of the ways suggested on this site. Similarly, if aliens lacked resources essential to them, if they were available on Earth they might see no option other than to invade.<br><br>Would aliens be able to defeat Earth?<br><br>Despite numerous science-fiction film plots, it is most unlikely that humans could defeat an alien race so advanced that it had faster than light technology. Film plots range from human viruses killing aliens, unlikely since alien invaders could surely think of some sort of protective suit, to humans getting nuclear warheads inside their ship, unlikely since aliens could surely detect us trying. If aliens simply wanted to eradicate humanity, then they could use nuclear weapons or some other technology to kill us without even entering our atmosphere. Nuclear weapons could not be used if they wanted to preserve Earth for themselves, but aliens capable of getting to Earth must surely have some suitable weapon.</strong><br><br><img src="http://anomalous-images.com/images/UFOS3.JPG"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://armageddononline.tripod.com/images/volcano.jpg"><br><br>What is a super volcano?<br><br>A super volcano is the most destructive force on this planet. Only a few exist in the world and when they erupt they do so with a force tens of thousands of times greater than other eruptions. They lie dormant for hundreds of thousands of years as a vast reservoir of magma builds up inside them before finally they unleash their apocalyptic force, capable of obliterating continents. They threaten the survival of mankind.<br><br>What happened during the last eruption of a super volcano?<br>The last eruption of a super volcano was in Toba, Sumatra, 75,000 years ago. It had 10,000 times the explosive force of Mount St. Helens and changed life on Earth forever. Thousands of cubic kilometres of ash was thrown into the atmosphere - so much that it blocked out light from the sun all over the world. 2,500 miles away 35 centimetres of ash coated the ground. Global temperatures plummeted by 21 degrees. The rain would have been so poisoned by the gasses that it would have turned black and strongly acidic. Man was pushed to the edge of extinction, the population forced down to just a couple of thousand. Three quarters of all plants in the northern hemisphere were killed.<br><br>What causes super volcanoes?<br><br>Super volcanoes differ from normal volcanoes in many ways. The stereotypical volcano is a towering cone, but super volcanoes form in depressions in the ground called calderas. When a normal volcano erupts lava gradually builds up in the mountain before releasing it. In super volcanoes when magma nears the surface it does not reach it, instead it begins to fill massive underground reservoirs. The magma melts the nearby rock to form more extremely thick magma. The magma is so viscous that volcanic gasses that normally trigger an eruption cannot pass, so a massive amount of pressure begins to build up. This continues for hundreds of thousands of years until an eruption occurs, which blasts away a huge amount of ground, forming a new caldera.<br><br>Where are there other super volcanoes?<br><br>Not all super volcanoes have been found, but one of the largest is in Yellowstone Park, USA. Scientists searching for the caldera in the park could not see it because it was so huge - only when satellite images were taken did the scale of the caldera become apparent - the whole park, 85km by 45km, is one massive reservoir of magma. The idyll landscpae of Yellowstone (below) could soon explode with devastating consequences.<br><br><img src="http://armageddononline.tripod.com/images/yellowstone.jpg"><br><br>When will it next erupt?<br>Scientist have discovered that the ground in Yellowstone if 74cm higher than in was in 1923 - indicating a massive swelling underneath the park. The reservoir is filling with magma at an alarming rate. The volcano erupts with a near-clockwork cycle of every 600,000 years. The last eruption was more than 640,000 years ago - we are overdue for annihilation.<br><br>What would be the effect of an eruption?<br>Immediately before the eruption, there would be large earthquakes in the Yellowstone region. The ground would swell further with most of Yellowstone being uplifted. One earthquake would finally break the layer of rock that holds the magma in - and all the pressure the Earth can build up in 640,000 years would be unleashed in a cataclysmic event.<br>Magma would be flung 50 kilometres into the atmosphere. Within a thousand kilometres virtually all life would be killed by falling ash, lava flows and the sheer explosive force of the eruption. Volcanic ash would coat places as far away as Iowa and the Gulf of Mexico. One thousand cubic kilometres of lava would pour out of the volcano, enough to coat the whole of the USA with a layer 5 inches thick. The explosion would have a force 2,500 times that of Mount St. Helens. It would be the loudest noise heard by man for 75,000 years, the time of the last super volcano eruption. Within minutes of the eruption tens of thousands would be dead.<br><br>The long-term effects would be even more devastating. The thousands of cubic kilometres of ash that would shoot into the atmosphere could block out light from the sun, making global temperatures plummet. This is called a nuclear winter. As during the Sumatra eruption a large percentage of the world's plant life would be killed by the ash and drop in temperature. Also, virtually the entire of the grain harvest of the Great Plains would disappear in hours, as it would be coated in ash. Similar effects around the world would cause massive food shortages. If the temperatures plummet by the 21 degrees they did after the Sumatra eruption the Yellowstone super volcano eruption could truly be an extinction level event.<br></div>

This post is one of the End Of The world series for your reading pleasure.</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.adopt-a-nytemare.8m.com/nytemare010.gif"><br><br>Biblical Prophecies<br>Predictions of the End of the World<br>Many people believe that the Bible says the Battle of Armageddon, the Antichrist and the return of Jesus will occur in 2007. On this page I elaborate on this prediction and outline the reasons why.<br><br>The Scenario<br>The war will start in 2007. The antichrist will stand in the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem and declare that he is God. The Bible calls this the 'abomination of desolation'. Shortly after this the Arab nations will unite against Israel. Egypt will lead Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan - every nation with a border with Israel - against it. Russia and its allies will join on the side of the Arabs. During the fight the US and Russia will use nuclear weapons against each other. The war will leave 2 billion dead.<br><br>When will it happen?<br>This is a quote from Mark 13:14-28:<br><br>But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. And let him who is on the housetop not go down, or enter in, to get anything out of his house; and let him who is in the field not turn back to get his cloak. But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babes in those days! But pray that it may not happen in the winter. For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of creation which God created, until now, and never shall. And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no life would have been saved; but for the sake of the elect whom He chose, He shortened the days. And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ; or, lo, [he is] there; believe [him] not: For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if [it were] possible, even the elect. But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things. But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.<br><br>The 'abomination of desolation' is the antichrist.<br>The 'elect whom He chose' is the return of Jesus.<br>The reference to those in Judea fleeing is because of the invasion.<br><br>Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near: So likewise ye, (Israel) when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.<br><br>The fig tree is Israel. This is because in Jeremiah's prophecies he used 'Figs' as a symbol of the children of Israel. If figs are the children, Israel must be the father, the fig tree.<br><br>'When her branch Is yet tender' means that Israel will still be a new state (it was founded in May 194<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">.<br>'Putteth forth leaves' could mean when Israel recaptured all of Jerusalem in June 1967.<br>'Summer is nigh' means that the end of the world is near.<br><br>So soon after Israel takes Jerusalem the end of the world will occur. It says 'this generation shall not pass till all these tings be fulfilled'.<br><br>A generation in the Bible is 40 years, so the end of the world will be 40 years after 1967: 2007.<br><br>How will the war start?<br>This passage suggests that the return of Jesus will shortly follow the start of war on Israel. Read this from Luke 21:20-24<br><br>But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then recognize that her desolation is at hand. Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the midst of the city depart, and let not those who are in the country enter the city; because these are the days of vengeance, in order that all things which are written may be fulfilled. Woe to those who nurse babes in those days; for there will be great distress upon the land, and wrath to this people, and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.<br><br>This clearly refers to the destruction of Israel by 'surrounding armies'.<br><br>Who will fight in the war?<br>The attack is described in Daniel 11:40<br>And at the end of time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen, and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them, and pass through.<br><br>The 'King of the South' are the Arab nations, the 'King of the North' is Russia. 'Him' refers to Israel, so the passage clearly describes an attack by these forces on Israel. It also shows how the 'end of time' will occur after this war.<br><br>The nations involved are describe in Ezekiel 38: 5-7<br>Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield and helmet: Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: [and] many people with thee. Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.<br><br>Persia is the site of Iran. Gomer and Togarmah are the sites of Turkey. All of these nations are Arab.<br><br>What will the war be like?<br>Revelation 9:13-16 states that the war will involve '200 million soldiers' and 'slay the third part of men.' This means that 2 billion (1/3 of the Earth's population) would die - a conceivable figure for a nuclear war. Such a war could use 200 million men.<br><br>This is a key passage - Ezekiel 39: 1-6:<br>Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel: And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy bands, and the people that [is] with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and [to] the beasts of the field to be devoured. Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord GOD. And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.<br><br>It says all but a 'sixth part' of the invading army will be destroyed. Israel's army could not do this, but Israel is known to have nuclear weapons so these could be used against an invading force.<br><br>Magog is Rusia. 'Fire on Magog' could easily be a nuclear strike. Those that 'dwell carelessly in the isles' could be referring to the US, as it is isolated geographically from other countries. This then suggests that there could be nuclear war between Russia and America.<br><br>Many scriptures describe the sun and moon becoming dark shortly after the war, eg:<br>Joel 3:14-15: The sun and the moon grow dark, and the stars lose their brightness<br><br>Matthew 24:29 The sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from the sky<br><br>Mark 13:24 But in those days, after that tribulation, The sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, and the stars will be falling from heaven<br><br>This refers to the end of the world. The references to the sun going dark could be describing the Nuclear Winter scenario, where dust from nuclear wars blocks out the sun.<br><br>Conclusion<br>So that is the evidence. In 2007 the Battle of Armageddon will take place, there will be nuclear war and Jesus will return. However, some of these interpretations of the text are fairly loose, so if in doubt read through them again and make your own mind up. Whether you believe in this or not is largely a matter of faith, and either way, we will know in 6 years.<br><br><img src="http://homex.coolconnect.com/member3/a_sf095/ghostpix/fire.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This story was contributed by Vincent Aaron.<br><br>I really like the stories about East Coast. But I would like to tell u a place where I worked during my school holidays.<br><br>Me and my friend, never believed or seen ghost in our lifeÂ…..we went before Bidadari cementery at night Â….but saw nothing.<br><br>It was on Dec 2000 when I started working in this factory located at woodland loop (bus 964). This job was a 12 hours night shift.A few days later after working in this building, I mingled better with the workers in the factory. And the weird thing was that people always tell me that the fourth floor was hauntedÂ…and each of them hear a person's voice clearly when they go upstairs. I got interested in this Â‘ghost storyÂ’ and so wanted them to tell me more.<br><br>(But firstly, let me tell u something ,this factory was rented 2 months before I joined Â…and on the second day of work, the supervisor told all new comers and the old workers that 3rd and 4th floor was banned. No one was allowed to go up because people leave their cans and left-over packed food around this area.)<br><br>Old workers told me during break time that before I came ,people were allowed to go upstairs and eat at the staircase.One malay worker Ah bang told me that he once used the toilet in the 4th floor and suddenly the tap water started running! I thought it was ridiculous!<br><br>Another person told me that once, a worker (name undisclosed) whom already knew that the 4th floor was haunted, went up using the lift and he, trying to be brave, shouted Â“ If you are here, come out lah! Appear before me !Â” Half an hour later, there an accident befell upon himÂ….pallets landed on him and injured his leg!This is the story I heard so far.<br><br>But one more person shocked me! The security guard of this building also knew about the spirit on the 4th floor..he told me that he had to go up and patrol during 3 am everyday on his ownÂ….and each time he went up using the lift he always hear voicesÂ…its sound like crying or laughing of some kids and a lady! Sometimes he heard footsteps very clearlyÂ….and something /someone is blowing cold air into his earsÂ…but luckily they do not harm pple.<br><br>He told me that he always switch on one of the light in the 4th floor but someone always off its during the night. Me and my friend started to be curious and tried to when up but saw nothing.<br><br>The security guard told me to go up when the light went off. This is because when we went up the lights are on. I did not believe himÂ….<br><br>1 week later, I saw the light on the 4th floor went off for 4 secs and then it was on again. I started to believe him because I had already investigated. The 4th floor was empty and that room was locked. I went up by the lift and I heard a lady's voice saying "Nah Nah" at a high peak. I went down quickly.<br><br>Some others things I found out muself and from the old workers:<br><br>There is a Chinese GOD called Guan gong at the third floor. Using the staircase, you can go up the roof and people saw a lady in white at the rooftop. I found 2 other lifts where both of them stop at the 4th level. Both lifts could not be used because their doors are locked.<br><br>I wished that you could go there and investigate for the sake of the readers. Tell the security guard your motive and he will let you in. Now, there are no more night shifts,so go at night with your friend!<br><br>Trust me you will 100% be able to find out something!<br><br>One more thing Â….I saw this in the newspapers that workers in Woodlands have gone insane (the person was posessed by a spirit). Forget the date but it should be around March or April.<br><br><img src="http://www.ghosthound.com/psychicphotos/Harwinton/church1.jpg"></div>
