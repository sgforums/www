            <div class='col-md body'>More  of Chupacabras!!<br><br><img src="http://www.cyberway.com.sg/~orca/chupacabra.gif"><br><br>2001 Santa Clarita<br><br>My friend and i were walkin at around 8:00 at night. We went around the corner and were approaching a section of the street that was dark cuz two street lamps burnt out. We were talking about the goatsucker, and my friend nikki(her nickname) made a sound that she thought was the attack call. I was saying how scary it would have been if the sound would have come right after she made it. Guess what? it did!!! we both turned around when we heard a wierd rasping screech. We had a flashligh, and flashed it at the tree, and saw a wierd creature that looked as if were about to spring. It had red eyes, and when it turned and fled, we noticed its powerful hindlegs. We heard the noise several more times, and some rusling in the tree. We turned and ran. We could hear 1 or two animals also uttering the attack cry. We didnt stop running till we reached my house. This made us sure never to go out in the dark again. This sighting was in Santa Clarita, california, near LA<br><br>Mexico 2000<br>I believe you guys, cause I had a really freaky encounter with this Chupacabra creature. Well, at first I thought you were all a bunch of weirdo's for believing in such a strange creature, but now I swear to god this thing is very real. I was driving to my aunt in Mexico to stay for the week, I was driving a truck that I've since then sold. Well anyway, it was getting late, like 1 or 2 o'clock and I was getting sleepy. It was way dark out but I did have my flashlight with me just in case. As I was driving I saw something strange. On the side of the road was some sort of deer or something like it.<br><br>Though it wasn't uncommon to see roadkill, what wasn't common was all the blood around it. I only got a passing glance at it but it looked like it was bled. I did some hunting in my time so I know what a bled animal looks like. With most roadkill I never see any blood, but with this thing it was everywhere, and there appeared to be no trauma. But after a while I just dismissed it as something that's rare but not unheard of. Or course it could have hit something pointy on a car or something. So I put it out of my mind. Then as if my truck read my mind. (cause I was thinking, "what if a rabid animal killed it.") The tire blew out on my truck. I'm not afraid of the dark or anything so fished the flashlight out of the pile of crap that made up the passenger seat of my truck and went out. Sure enough, the tire was busted to hell.<br><br>It was way to late to change it so I decided to take a nap in the front of the truck till morning. I don't know how long I was asleep, but something strange woke me up. It was a strange scratching sound on the door. I thought is was just some cat trying to get in. (Those little critters are smart.) Pulling out my flashlight again, I took a peek out of my window and saw some movement. Then I turned on the flashlight. What I saw scared the everlovin' crap outa me. There was some strange greenish creature with long spikes down its back scratching at the bottom of my door with at least two inch claws. When it noticed the beam of my flashlight, it looked up at me. It had huge red eyes and long teeth which it bared at me.<br><br>At that point I was scared spitless. I laid down on the seat for the longest time, listening for any sounds, my heart beating in my chest. I must have fallen asleep after an hour or so, and when I got up in the morning, I took a look at my truck. The bottom of the drivers side door was covered in scratch marks, which cost me a tidy sum to fix. Another thing caught my eye when I looked down. There was a trail of tracks on the ground, bloody tracks, leading back up the road. I don't know what kind of animal it was, but in all my years of hunting, I've never seen anything like it. After changing the tire I got the heck outa there. And even today, I never use that road to get to my aunts anymore.<br><br>Missouri DECEMBER 2000<br><br>i live in columbia, missouri, and area that is hardly considered "chupacabra country". i must admit that up until recently i was rather skeptical, until about a week ago. i am an avid bowhunter, and spend a great deal of time pursuing the local white-tailed deer. over the past few weeks, i have discovered three carcasses that were completely drained of blood. the first doe had four puncture marks. one on the top of the neck, and 1 on the stomach. the second one, which was a small buck, had been torn apart by coyotes, but there was no blood to speak of in the snow. the third doe was very fresh. i found her last friday. i was on my way into the woods when i heard what sounded like a deer running up the hill behind me. i immediately dropped to the ground and began to sneak. i spotted it in the brush about 60 yards away. i stalked to within 20 yards only to find that it was already dead. it had not yet gone into rigor mortis and the carcass was still steaming, a sure sign that it was less than 3 hours old. the steam was radiating from a wound that ran from the base of the neck to the top of the shoulder. it was also bleeding profusely from two wounds on the neck about 2 inches apart. i decided i had better get to my hunting location. i sat for a while, and a few deer crossed the creek about 70 yards away, out of bow range. they seemed very jumpy. i stayed until the last available shooting light. i began my long trek back to the truck just as darkness fell. i was about 300 hundred yards from where i had found the doe when i heard a sound in the brush behind my. i thought nothing of it.<br><br>there are many animals one may stir up in the woods at night. i got about another hundred yards before i realized it was following me. i could hear it's footsteps, and they did not sound like those of a deer, coyote, or dog. i stopped and shone my flashlight behind me, but i could see nothing, not even the tell tale eye shine of an animal. suddenly the brush moved on the hillside and i could make out a dark shape moving against the snow, and very quickly. it stopped abruptly n the hillside about 15 yards from me. i turned my flashlight in its direction. i was rather alarmed by what i saw in the shaking light. it was about 3 feet tall, baboon like, with thick, matted, dark hair. the face was baboon-like and the eyes were a little larger than those of a human being. i could not tell color because they reflected my flashlight much the way a deer in a cars headlights does. it ran up the hill. i put an arrow on my bow, and continued towards the truck at a more rapid pace. i heard it again, this time running straight at me. i could make out it's shape about 15 yards away, and coming fast. i blindly fired an arrow in it's direction, and by some stroke of god i hit it and it ran away.<br><br>i then left the woods very very quickly. the next morning i came back, this time with a high powered rifle in case it showed up again. i began trailing it. the tracks were about ten feet apart when it ran, and two feet apart when it was walking. it walked on all fours. i found a few splatters of blood, but it was bright red, signaling a muscle hit, not a vital one. i trailed it for a very long time, almost a mile. it went on to a rocky hilltop where there was no snow, and try as i might, i could not recover the trail. i don't know what was, but this so called "chupacabra" seems like the best candidate.<br><br><img src="http://kingkongvsgodzilla.com/chupa/skeleton.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.dailyrevolution.com/friday/freaky.jpg"></div>

And even today, I never use that road to get to my aunts anymore.<br><br>Missouri DECEMBER 2000<br><br>i live in columbia, missouri, and area that is hardly considered "chupacabra country". i must admit that up until recently i was rather skeptical, until about a week ago. i am an avid bowhunter, and spend a great deal of time pursuing the local white-tailed deer. over the past few weeks, i have discovered three carcasses that were completely drained of blood. the first doe had four puncture marks. one on the top of the neck, and 1 on the stomach. the second one, which was a small buck, had been torn apart by coyotes, but there was no blood to speak of in the snow. the third doe was very fresh. i found her last friday. i was on my way into the woods when i heard what sounded like a deer running up the hill behind me. i immediately dropped to the ground and began to sneak. i spotted it in the brush about 60 yards away. i stalked to within 20 yards only to find that it was already dead. it had not yet gone into rigor mortis and the carcass was still steaming, a sure sign that it was less than 3 hours old. the steam was radiating from a wound that ran from the base of the neck to the top of the shoulder. it was also bleeding profusely from two wounds on the neck about 2 inches apart. i decided i had better get to my hunting location. i sat for a while, and a few deer crossed the creek about 70 yards away, out of bow range. they seemed very jumpy. i stayed until the last available shooting light. i began my long trek back to the truck just as darkness fell. i was about 300 hundred yards from where i had found the doe when i heard a sound in the brush behind my. i thought nothing of it.<br><br>there are many animals one may stir up in the woods at night. i got about another hundred yards before i realized it was following me. i could hear it's footsteps, and they did not sound like those of a deer, coyote, or dog. i stopped and shone my flashlight behind me, but i could see nothing, not even the tell tale eye shine of an animal. suddenly the brush moved on the hillside and i could make out a dark shape moving against the snow, and very quickly. it stopped abruptly n the hillside about 15 yards from me. i turned my flashlight in its direction. i was rather alarmed by what i saw in the shaking light. it was about 3 feet tall, baboon like, with thick, matted, dark hair. the face was baboon-like and the eyes were a little larger than those of a human being. i could not tell color because they reflected my flashlight much the way a deer in a cars headlights does. it ran up the hill. i put an arrow on my bow, and continued towards the truck at a more rapid pace. i heard it again, this time running straight at me. i could make out it's shape about 15 yards away, and coming fast. i blindly fired an arrow in it's direction, and by some stroke of god i hit it and it ran away.<br><br>i then left the woods very very quickly. the next morning i came back, this time with a high powered rifle in case it showed up again. i began trailing it. the tracks were about ten feet apart when it ran, and two feet apart when it was walking. it walked on all fours. i found a few splatters of blood, but it was bright red, signaling a muscle hit, not a vital one. i trailed it for a very long time, almost a mile. it went on to a rocky hilltop where there was no snow, and try as i might, i could not recover the trail. i don't know what was, but this so called "chupacabra" seems like the best candidate.<br><br><img src="http://kingkongvsgodzilla.com/chupa/skeleton.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.dailyrevolution.com/friday/freaky.jpg"></strong>[/quote<br><br>Oh where did u get all tis info?]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Chamenos, I've not heard that version you related. I've got a few highway ones but thought rather mild so never post them.<br><br>Hi Drizzling, just wu lioa search then cut and paste lor.<br><br>Here is another one. Hope you enjoy it.<br><br><strong>This story took place in a small kampong in Eunos many years ago.  People in there lived in houses very near to one another. There were houses built closed together with a mere 5 feet wooden fence separating their backyards.<br><br>Back then they didn't have that great of a refrigerator to keep their meat from getting spoiled. So, the only way for them to keep their meat was to put salt on the meat and store it in the kitchen at the backyard.<br><br>On the night when it all started, the housewife of a family routinely store their extra meat in the backyard. The next morning, as she was making breakfast, she found the piece of meat missing. Furious, she went around asking everyone in the family where or what did they do with the meat. Nobody knew what happened to that piece of meat . The housewife, too, although a bit upset, just went to the market and got more meat.<br><br>That night, she did the same thing again with their extra meat, but this time she kept it in a different shelf to make sure no one would take it away. The next morning, she went to the backyard and checked but again found the meat missing.<br><br>By then, she was very upset. She complained to her husband that their meat was stolen two nights in a row. They decided they should investigate further to solve the problem. The husband suggested that they stay up that very night and keep an eye at the backyard.<br><br>That night, the couple sat by the window overlooking their backyard. They turned off the lights after their children had gone to bed to make sure no one can see them from outside. It was a hot, full moon night with only the sound of cricket and owls howling. Everyone  was already in bed by midnight, except, of course, the couple who was getting more and more anxious.<br><br>It was slightly after 1am when the couple saw the shadow of a person jumping over the fence into their backyard. Under the bright moonlight, they could work out it was a woman. Then, the woman walked closer and towards the piece of meat sitting in the shelf just a few feet away from them. 'Once she got her hands on the meat, we will rush out and catch her red handed,' the wife whispered to her husband.<br><br>As the woman reached out for the meat, the couple slowly moved towards the door, however, they were stunned by what they saw next. The woman was holding on to the meat and eating it raw! Under the bright moonlight , they saw who the woman was. She was actually the old lady from next door. What gave them the creeps was the way she looked. The old lady looked as if she had been possessed. She was taking big bites and tearing the meat apart with her sharp teeth and fangs. After finishing up the meat, she just ran and jumped over the fence like a strong youth.<br><br>The next morning, the couple went over to their neighbour's house to consult with them over what had happened. Of course, their neighbour was shocked to hear what had happened, and refused to believe that it was the grandmother of the family who did it. The neighbour told them that it was impossible because the old lady had been very ill for the last couple of days. The couple thought they have been mistaken.<br><br>That night, the husband and wife went out of town for some dealings. They left their one year-old baby at home with a babysitter.  The couple, however, did not come back until almost one o'clock. Just as they stepped foot into the house, they heard a loud scream from the baby's room followed by an agonising cry.<br><br>As soon as they got into the room and turned on the lights, the parents' darkest fear came true. The old lady from next door was on her meat hunt again. However, there was no meat in the backyard that night. So, she had come into the baby's room and was gnawing at the baby's arm instead! The old woman was clearly possessed by a demon. Her pale face and fangs showed it all. She had no sense of what or whom she was eating.<br><br>The wife gave out a loud scream and the husband rushed towards the old lady to push her away. The old woman fell off the bed and jumped out through the window. The husband grabbed his son and dragged his wife and babysitter out of the house. They yelled for help from the neighbours and soon a few people had come out. The husband explained what had happened while a doctor attended to the baby. The neighbours were equally shocked but they were determined to get the demon. They rushed to the old lady's house but found no one at home. So, they broke into the house, running from room to room looking for the old lady, but she was no where to be found.  One of the neighbours spotted someone on top of the roof.<br><br>The neighbours surrounded the house and tried to get her down by throwing rocks at her. However, the harder they try the louder she would laugh at them. So, they decided the only way to get her down and to get rid of her at the same time was to burn down the house. They moved whatever valuables out of the house and started burning the house from inside. Stubbornly, the demon was still on top of the roof. Everyone was standing around the house seeing it burn down with the old lady on top. As the house was burning into an inferno, the demon is still up there, taunting at them and running around up on the roof. Soon, she was trapped in the fire. As the house collapsed, the old lady fell down with the house. They all heard a blood-curdling scream that is so evil. And then there was silence and that was the end of it. The next day, they searched the burnt down house but couldn't find any ashes. All they found was a very small skull. Nobody knew what happened to that old lady or her family. Rumours had it that they had moved out of town and the old lady had died before that night. What the people saw that night was the demon that had taken over the body of the old lady.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  DuH</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.zombienews.com/bordello02.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok Guys, since you like Chupacabras, here is more.<br><br>Model of a<br>Chupra.<img src="http://www.artbell.com/img/chupa3.jpg"><br><br>Victim of a Chupra. You can see the punture holes for sucking blood.<img src="http://www.parascope.com/en/1096/chupa/goatvic.jpg"><br><br>[b]A consistent wave of UFO sightings, as well as numerous<br>apparitions of a weird creature which has killed<br>livestock and been dubbed the "Chupacabras" [the Goat<br>sucker] by the sensation-seeking media. The creature is<br>apparently responsible for the deaths of cattle, sheep,<br>goats, rabbits, hens, ducks, cats and dogs, etc. After<br>death, the creature appears to extract blood and other<br>fluids from the animals' body.<br><br>Thousands of animals have been killed, and communities<br>now live in fear. Throughout the killings, the<br>authorities have claimed the deaths are due to attacks<br>from groups of stray dogs, baboons(!) or exotic animals<br>illegally introduced in the island's territory. The<br>director of Puerto Rico's Department of Agriculture<br>Vetinary Services Division, Hector Garcia, has stated<br>that, "it could be dogs, that the small puncture wounds<br>observed in the victims necks are similar to those<br>inflicted by the fangs of canines." He also stated that<br>no other unusual features have been observed in the<br>dead animals examined by his division, and this<br>included no loss of blood. Veterinarian Angel Luis<br>Santana, of the private Gardenville Clinic, in San<br>Juan, said, "it could be a human being who belongs to a<br>religious sect, even another animal. It could also be<br>someone who wants to make fun out of the Puerto Rican<br>people."<br><br>All of the above official `explanations' to<br>the enigma, have failed to identify the manner in which<br>the animals died, and the observations made of unknown<br>creatures by serious reliable witnesses all over Puerto<br>Rico. The facts tell a very different story... The<br>animals have been found with many small - perfect<br>circular holes about 1/4" - 1/2" in diameter arranged<br>in pairs of triangular fashion. These penetrate deep<br>into the neck of lower jaws of the victims.<br><br>Dr. Carlos Soto, a qualified veterinary,<br>states the wounds have a regular pattern in many of the<br>cases - into the head of the animal - a hole<br>penetrating through the right jaw bone, muscle and<br>tissue, and straight into the brain: more specifically<br>directly to the cerebellum, puncturing it and causing<br>instant death to the animal.<br><br>This regular type of<br>wound, and the path followed by whatever intrudes into<br>the body, indicates premeditation - and intelligence.<br>Of great interest, the attack reveals a type of<br>euthanasia technique, for this method prevents the<br>attacked animal from suffering. This too revealed<br>intelligence.<br><br>Officia research fails to explain the following:- If a<br>dog or any known animal predator bites to kill a<br>victim, it must first exert pressure on both sides of<br>the head, neck or body. In the "Chupacabras" case<br>files, no trauma, abrasions, scratches, bites or<br>pressure have been observed by the examiners on the<br>opposite side of the wound, and as such, it becomes<br>obvious we are not dealing with an ordinary<br>predator/carnivore species known to science.<br><br>The wounds may be similar in appearance to bites<br>inflicted by dogs or baboons due to them being round<br>and small, but the similarity ends there. Government<br>officers and veterinarians who have followed the<br>'official line' or policy statements, have often<br>refused to reveal data about the wounds.<br>Theyconveniently ignore the fact that whatever<br>penetrates the animal, is at least three or four inches<br>long, and in a few cases, has been known to cauterize<br>the wall of the wound - apparently to prevent excessive<br>blood loss. No known animal species on Earth can do<br>this.<br><br>Some of the wounds of this type appear on the<br>sides and belly of the victim. This penetration usually<br>cuts through the stomach - down to the liver,<br>apparently removing sections of the organ and absorbing<br>liquid from it. Such actions would require an incision<br>of upto five inches - a fact verified during necropsies<br>performed on the animals. The triangular wounds have<br>been noted to enter the body and hit the liver.<br><br>Whilst 'something' obviously penetrates the animal,<br>creating extensie trauma and injury, and leaving<br>strange material inside the tissue, no natural<br>inflammatory processes have been observed in the dead<br>animals tissues. This is extremely unnatural.<br><br>In most cases the victims lack rigor mortis and remain<br>flexible - days after their death. Incredibly in some<br>incidents, the blood which remained in the body would<br>not clot or coagulate for days following death. Several<br>larger holes or cuts have been discovered on some<br>animals. These consist of wounds which range from one<br>inch in diameter, to twelve inches in length. These<br>particular openings have been located in the neck,<br>chest, belly, and anal areas, and appear to have been<br>made with a surgeons scalpel. Clean-cut openings<br>through which certain organs are excised from the<br>bodies. Reproductive, sexual organs, anus, eyes and<br>other soft tissue have all been removed.<br><br>Another official explanation identifies the possibility<br>that someone involved with a religious or satanic sect<br>may be responsible. The sheer number of cases appears<br>to negate this potential. The killings occur everyday,<br>at all hours, and all over the island. The is no single<br>sect which has anything like the resources to conduct<br>such an act. Only the government could conduct such an<br>operation, but what possible reasons would they have to<br>do this?<br><br>[b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>THE CREATURE OBSERVED<br><br>Many of the killings are associated with strange<br>creatures we have called the Anomalous Biological<br>Entities [ABEs]. It is reportedly a cross between a<br>creature known as a 'Grey' alien humanoid, mainly<br>because the shape of its head and eyes, and what most<br>witnesses describe as the body of a bipedal, erect<br>dinosaur, but with no tail. Its head is oval in shape<br>and has an elongated jaw. Two elongated red eyes have<br>been reported, together with small holes in the nostril<br>area, a small slit-like mouth with fang-type teeth<br>protruding upwards and downwards from the jaw. Other<br>witnesses have seen small pointed-ears, but this<br>feature has not been seen by other witnesses. It<br>appears to have strong course hair all over its body;<br>and whilst most observers claim the hair is black, it<br>has the remarkable ability to change colours at will,<br>almost like a chamaleon.<br><br>In the dark, it will change to black or a deep brown<br>colour - in a sunlit area surrounded by vegetation, it<br>changes to green, green-grey, light brown or beige. The<br>creature has two small arms with a three-fingered<br>clawed hand and two strong hind legs, again with three<br>claws. This appears to enable it to run quickly and<br>leap over trees (!) - some witnesses allege over twenty<br>feet in a single bound. According to many observations,<br>the creature's legs look almost reptilian or goat-like<br>[see diagram page 26] (get the magazine - you MUST see<br>this picture). It has quill-like appendages running<br>down from its back, with what seem to be fleshy<br>membranes that change colour from blue to green, red to<br>purple etc.<br><br>A number of witnesses claim the creature<br>flaps (at incredible speed) its tail and appendages,<br>allowing it to actually fly(!). The tail apparently is<br>used to guide its flight only - controlled mainly by<br>the winds - only occasionally seen to flap. First<br>reported in the town of Orocovis, the ABEs have been<br>sighted in the municipality of Canovanas and in many<br>areas of Puerto Rico. Its habits are both diurnal and<br>nocturnaa - as a matter of fact, it has been in broad<br>daylight by several witnesses. One such occasion was<br>witnessed by Madeline Tolentino and her neighbours in<br>the Campo Rico community (muncipality of Canovanas).<br>They all observed it walking down a street(!) at 3.00pm<br>in the afternoon. As they approached it, the creature<br>ran away, 'at a fantastic speed' and escaped.<br><br>The killings are a great loss to farmers, and the<br>situation has prompted the President of the Puerto Rico<br>House of Representatives Agricultural Commission, Mr<br>Juan E.[Kike] Lopez, to introduce a resolution asking<br>for an official investigation to clarify the situation.<br>(opposite is a translation of the document). {to<br>follow}<br><br>At this time, it has been brought to my attention that<br>at least two of these creatures have been captured(!)<br>by Government officers, both from the U.S. Federal<br>Government, and the Puertorican Government.<br><br>They were captured before the 6 and 7th of November,<br>one of them in the town of San Lorenzo, in the<br>centre-east of Puerto Rico; the other in the National<br>Carribean Rain Forest in El Yunque, to the east. Both<br>were alive and allegedly taken to the United States by<br>special personnel. Our government keeps denying the<br>facts, yet our people perceive they are being lied to.<br>The killings and encounters with these creatures<br>continue. It is probably due to the fact that the<br>incidents are associated with UFOs, that the government<br>continues to cover- up the facts.<br><br>UFO SIGHTINGS<br><br>Luminous oval and pyramidal shaped UFOs have been seen<br>in the vicinity where animals have been mutilated and<br>found to be without blood. These have been reported in<br>the towns of Cabo Rojo, Canovanas, Ponce and Naranjito<br>- distances apart. In Barrio Hato, the Rojas family<br>observed a UFO. A horse and several goats were found<br>mutilated shortly after the observation.<br><br>On 18 November 1995, a luminous disc some 40ft in<br>diameter with a row of dark 'windows' around its centre<br>rim, positioned itself over the antennae of Radio<br>Procer, a radio station located in the town of<br>Barranquitas, in the centre of Puerto Rico.<br>Simultaneously, the station's electronic equipment went<br>crazy, dials just went wild. Incredibly, an obsolete<br>piece of equipment from 1957 stored at the station,<br>turned itself on.<br><br>More astonishingly was the fact that the apparatus was<br>not plugged into any power source. This incident was<br>discussed in the media, as many residents in that area<br>saw the UFO as it hovered over the station. Sadly, the<br>TV, radio and news media suppressed the information on<br>several encounters - some by resients next to the radio<br>station. Channel 4 [WAPA TV] and Channel 11 [Tele 11]<br>covered the incident, but failed to mention the<br>presence of creatures during the sighting. This implies<br>a cover-up by the media.<br><br>A female witness also observed the creature in the<br>Canovanas municipality in the early days of November.<br>The ABE jumped or flew and entered a round luminous<br>object over her car.<br><br>GENETIC MANIPULATIONS<br><br>The reports suggest a link between the ABEs and UFOs or<br>alien phenomena. But we cannot discard the possibility<br>that the ABEs can also be the product of highly<br>sophisticated genetic manipulations by human agencies.<br>A Chinese-Russian scientist by the name of Dr. Tsian<br>Kanchen, has produced genetic manipulations which have<br>created new species of electronically-crossed plant and<br>animal organisms. Kanchen developed an electronic<br>system whereby he can pick up the bioenergetic field of<br>the DNA of living organisms and transfer it<br>electronically to other living organisms. By these<br>means he has created incredible new breeds of<br>ducks/chickens, with physical characteristics of both<br>species; goats/rabbits, and new breeds of plants such<br>as corn/wheat, peanut/sunflower seeds and<br>cucumber/watermelons. These are produced by linking the<br>genetic data of different living organisms contained in<br>their bioenergetic fields by means of ultra-high<br>frequencies biological linking. If the Russians have<br>created this technology, then without doubt the US and<br>other powers have too. Therefore, it is quite possible<br>that the "Chupacabras" or ABEs could have been<br>developed by humans.<br><br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>EXPERIMENTS AND BLOOD TESTS<br><br>Puerto Rico has been the site for much experimentation<br>by the United States on the island's population and<br>territory for decades. Examples of this can be found in<br>the experimentation of Talidomida and anti-conceptive<br>drugs on our women, which caused the birth of many<br>malformed children in the 1950s. The lethal 'orange<br>agent' and other dioxine-based chemical agents were<br>tested in several places on the island, as well as<br>gamma radiation tests in our forests. Because of this<br>we can't exclude the "possibility" that someone may<br>well be experimenting with new and advanced genetic<br>products in our country. The ABEs could be the result -<br>and has gone awry...who knows? Perhaps the creatures<br>have escaped and that someone has lost control of the<br>situation?<br><br>We obtained samples of blood allegedly from one of the<br>creatures which was discovered after it jumped over a<br>fence and tripped. This occured at 9.00pm on 3 October<br>1995, in Campo Rico, in Canovanas. Two days before, a<br>policeman shot one of the creatures in Camp Rico which<br>fled the site. The blood could have well been from that<br>ABE.<br><br>We proceeded to take the blood sample to a medical<br>specialist and hopefully for DNA analysis. These tests<br>are currently underway in the U.S. but here are the<br>preliminary results.<br><br>SAMPLE 1. The original blood sample seemed to indicate<br>similar characteristics to that of human A-type blood,<br>with Rh factor. Further analysis was not conclusive on<br>this.<br><br>SAMPLE 2. Other analysis of the blood and matter<br>associated to it in the sample, showed a material<br>content comparable to feces with detritus, E.Coli<br>bacteria y worms, and other parasites. Vegetal cellular<br>material was also found. The content was comparable<br>with that found in cases involving an injured animal or<br>human with open wounds in the intestines, through which<br>a blood haemorhage was issuing. SAMPLE 3. The genetic<br>analysis so far has revealed that the blood is in no<br>way compatible with human blood nor with any animal<br>species known to science. The traces ratio of<br>magnesium, phosphorous, calcium and postassium are<br>incompatible with those of normal human blood, they are<br>much too high. The albumen/glouline [RG ratio] was also<br>incompatible. The ratios found do not allow the results<br>of the analyis to be compatible with those of any known<br>animal species.<br><br>At present, we can't place the sample with any earthly<br>organism. Therefore it could well be the product of a<br>highly sophisticated genetic manipulation, an organism<br>alien to our own enviroment or perhaps<br>extraterrestrial.<br><br>Other preliminary test on sub-types and genetic<br>analysis are as yet inconclusive, but the results so<br>far imply the samples originate from an unknown<br>organism.<br><br>DISINFORMATION AND CONCEALMENT<br><br>Obviously the alien potential would be difficult for<br>the U.S. and Puertorican authorities to explain, and<br>has led to a disinformation programme, through which<br>the government agencies disseminate the 'already<br>discredited' official explanations of feral dogs,<br>baboons, apes and other exotic animals or satanic cults<br>as those capable of these actions. This has been<br>strengthened by certain 'media jokers' who have<br>sensationalized and made light of the situation. In<br>many instances, ridicule has been used as a 'weapon'<br>against serious witnesses.<br><br>Other disinformation and debunking campaigns appeared<br>organised through UFO groups by the US intelligence<br>services. Serious investigators have had their<br>credibility affected. At least two groups disseminate<br>information through the media - spreading panic as they<br>tell of how the "Chupacabras" or ABEs belong to an<br>alien race who 'created the AIDS virus to destroy the<br>human race'. Another body spread fear by explaining the<br>"Chupacabras" belong to a voracious reptilian race of<br>creatures, alien in origin, who have started "devouring<br>the populace." For our part, we have denounced their<br>intent.<br><br>It is clear that someone apparently related to the<br>intelligence community intends to start a panic, whilst<br>at the same time, someone, for reasons unknown, is<br>trying to prevent this alarming situation from reaching<br>the serious parts of the media in the United States. On<br>the one side we have the bogus UFO investigation groups<br>created by US intelligence in Puerto Rico to disinform<br>and intoxicate the media with ridiculous stories. Also,<br>a crew from the US TV show 'Inside Edition', visited<br>Puerto Rico to report on the Chupacabras but it was<br>obvious to everyone here, that they were trying to<br>ridicule one of the witnesses. Jose Soto, Mayor of the<br>town of Canavanas, had a serious argument with the<br>producers, who also tried to ridicule him. Our<br>organisation was also subjected to silly questions.<br>Apparently they intend to air the show to discredit the<br>situation and our research.<br><br>This is not the first occasion this particular<br>programme has affected the credibility of our study<br>programme, many still remember the important UFO<br>sightings in Fyffe County, Alabama, 1990. The<br>television programme grossly ridiculed the witnesses<br>and case files. This should alert investigators in the<br>US. The events in Puerto Rico may provide good enough<br>reasons for discussion, and it is too important to be<br>kept hidden from the public.<br><br>SPECIAL UPDATE<br><br>Graham Sheppard, an experienced aeroplane pilot and a<br>close associate of author Timothy Good, spent several<br>days in January on the island to investigate the<br>Chupacabras and UFO sightings. His research has<br>concluded sightings are occuring both during the day<br>and night. Media interest is now more serious than at<br>any other time, and one newspaper based in Miami has<br>held talks with local police. Sheppard further learned<br>that armed police patrols are now looking for the<br>Chupacabras. The investigator has obtained other<br>interesting data about the creature. The creature<br>appears to be some form of reptile or insect hybrid,<br>and officials are not ruling out the possibility that<br>it may well be some type of dinosaur - possibly unknown<br>to man. Plaster casts of its footprints have been made<br>and reveal three claws, approximately the same size as<br>a large dog. There have been more attacks on<br>dogs(including a Great Dane) and rabbits. These occured<br>some twenty miles north of Cabo Roco in Maya Guez.<br>Sheppard also notes that reports of UFOs and the<br>creature are appearing daily in the local press. "The<br>authorities are in a jam." he commented. US researcher<br>and television producer, Linda Moulton Howe, is now on<br>the island investigating many of the reports. Meanwhile<br>Graham hopes to uncover more information from locals<br>and officials on the island.<br>Credit: Graham Sheppard <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></strong><img src="http://beta.houseofhorrors.com/vault/american/images/aw55.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[b]Miho who lives alone in Johore.  One day,  she was notified that her mother is dying. This news prompted Miho to return to her Kampong.<br><br>She took the train home. As she got off the train it  was getting dark. So, Miho started walking back to the house. Shortly, she came upon a set of railway tracks. Right across her was a little girl of about 12 years old, walking towards her. Miho had a strange feeling that she knew this girl but she just couldn't figure out who and where.<br><br>As she was crossing the track, the girl grabs her arm and their eyes lock for a short moment. Neither mutter a word until the railway crossing signal went off and the gates started to close. Miho broke free and rushed through the closing gate. She turned to see if the little girl had made it but she could not see between the railway coaches. She had a goosebump, worrying if the girl couldn't make it. But the length of the train seemed never ending. Miho tried to convince herself hat the girl was all right and moved on.<br><br>She made it to her mother's house where she met her brother. He had dropped out of school and was working in a fishery to help pay their mother's medical bills.<br><br>Later that night she was awaken by people's conversation. She looked at her clock and it was midnight. She got up and went towards the sound. She reached a den lighted only by the glow of the TV. In front of the TV was that same little girl that she met at the railway crossing earlier.<br><br>"What are you doing in my house?!" Miho yells at the girl.<br><br>The little girl stared at the TV with unblinking eyes and did not seem to hear Miho. This annoyed Miho even more.<br><br>"Hey you little wit! I am talking to you! Look at me when I talk to you!" she screamed.Suddenly the lights came on in the den. Miho turned around and saw her brother.<br><br>"What is the problem? Whom are you yelling at?"<br><br>Miho pointed and said, "This little girr....."<br><br>But there was no one there!<br><br>The next morning Miho visited her mother in the hospital. She knew it might be the last time that she would ever see her mother and that this was the only chance she may have to apologise for going away and losing touch with the family.<br><br>Then she stumbled upon that little girl again.<br><br>"Who are you? What do you want from me?" Miho demanded.<br><br>The little girl smiled at Miho, then turned around and ran up a dirt road. Miho chased after her until they came to an old abandoned school. Miho remembered it was her middle school. She followed the girl inside.<br><br>She could hear banging and little boys laughing and shouting above her. "Stupid! We are going to get you!"<br><br>Miho dashed up the stairs to investigate where the noises came from. She looked around and soon found the boys pounding on a closet and yelling threats in one of the classrooms. Miho pushed past the boys and swung open the closet door expecting to find that little girl inside. But it was empty. She turned around to confront the boys, but to her greatest horror, the boys faces were all horribly disfigured! Miho screamed on top of her lungs and ran out of the classroom.<br><br>Then it was all silent and the little girl appeared in front of Miho again. Miho was still gasping gulps of air, recovering from her shock. The little girl stretched out her arm and touched Miho's forehead, then she muttered one word, "Remember...."<br><br>At that point, Miho was taken back in time. She found herself in that same classroom and the boys, looking no longer disfigured but normal, were up to their same pounding antics on the closet.<br><br>Then from the back of the classroom, steps in the 12 year-old Miho.<br><br>"Stop it" she screamed at the boys as she pushed them aside. "Cut it out! She is new here." The young Miho opened the door of the closet and inside that little girl, frightened and sobbing.<br><br>The scene advanced in front of Miho's eyes. She now witnessed the two girls walking home after school. The little girl told Miho that she was an orphan and lives in the local orphanage. She told Miho that she thinks she is the nicest person that she ever met and from this day forward that they were going to be best friends.<br><br>The young Miho was taken aback by this, because this new girl was not popular with the other girls and if she hung out with her then the other girls would pick on her as well. But the young Miho just obliged unwillingly.<br><br>The scene advanced again to the time the boys were bullying that little girl again. They surrounded her and shoved her back and forth at the top of the stairs. Young Miho walked up the stairs and the little girl called out for Miho's help but this time Miho just turned away. Subsequently, the leader of the boys pushed too hard and the little girl went falling down the stairs. She landed with a thud and her leg twisted rudely!<br><br>Miho having witnessed this screamed for the teachers to come out and help. They sent her to the clinic nearby and she was patched up with a cast. Later, the teachers asked Miho what had taken place. Miho lied and said that she had seen nothing and that most likely that new girl had tripped.<br><br>The teachers believed Miho and scolded the little girl. The little girl was so hurt she crept away on her crutches, crying. She ran away and came to the railway crossing. As she was crossing the first set of tracks her crutch got caught and broke causing her to fall. She tried to stand but her dress was caught on the track as well. At that moment, the crossing signal went off and the gates started to close. She cried for help desperately but no one was around to help her. A train came and ran over her.<br><br>The scene before Miho's eyes cleared and she heard the railway crossing signal again. She found herself lying across the railway tracks where she had first met that little girl. The same crossing where the little girl was killed years ago. The gates are down and the little girl's ghost was standing in front smiling at her. She fade away just as the train came....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> duH<br><br><img src="http://www.creature-corner.com/gorypictures/nov10h.jpg"></div>
