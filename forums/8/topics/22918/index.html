            <div class='col-md body'>Cut and Paste,<br><br>True Haunted Places:<br><br>BISHAN<br><br>There are many Ghosts in Bishan, many years ago before<br>Bishan was developed, the area around RI was cemetery and burial grounds.<br>That's why RI is built on that patch, don't know about the current<br>residential areas though. But there are many reports of wandering ghosts and<br>spirits in Bishan.<br><br>Dunno if anybody remembered a Samsui woman was found dead in a construction<br>lift with her head and body severed by the opened lift door in Bishan? The<br>unit that her head overlooked, there has been a murder of an Indian woman in<br>that very same unit. If you are wondering why I knew so much about Bishan,<br>well, I happened to have a mother that works in that area and she had been<br>seeing "UFO" after the clock hit 6pm.<br><br>BISHAN PARK<br>I've a rumour that if you were to go strolling in Bishan Park in the evening<br>or later, do bring along some sweets. There is this particular bridge in<br>Bishan Park that has a soul of a little child. Everytime someone pass the<br>bridge, the child would ask for a candy. If you don't have any, the child<br>might just scratch your face or show you something bloody.<br><br>LIDO TOILETS and SOME COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS<br>Lido Cinema Ladies Toilets. Documented cases of hauntings! Do a search of<br>Straits Times if there is an online database. If I'm not wrong, this stories<br>applies only to the old Lido, i.e before it was renovated. Word has it that<br>certain rows of their seat are always empty. And you know who they are<br>reserved for.<br><br>18th &amp; 19th Floor toilets &amp; the fire escape staircases, SLF building, 510<br>Thomson Road. Someone regularly burnt incense papers. Don't ask me what is<br>in there, I don't know. Everytime I went to the toilet at night, my hairs<br>stand on their ends. Try it after 22.00 hrs and especially on 7th month. Don<br>t ask what is in there.<br><br>CHESTNUT<br>There's a house in Chestnut near the cemetary and church, corner semi detach<br>(but nothing to do with the cemetary) heard that people shift in, shift out,<br>shift in, shift out. Someone got a monk, but no use. And someone got a<br>priest, but the crucifix broke. Now it's for rent.<br><br>FORT SILOSO IN SENTOSA<br>Another rumour about Fort Siloso in Sentosa. Notice the shape and the<br>position of the fort (shaped in a crescent). A lot of British soldiers were<br>thrown off the fort. It's known that wailing of men could be heard at night.<br>The fort closes at 6pm.<br><br>TEKONG JACOB'S LADDER<br>Saw a female silhouette sitting on the top of Jacob's Ladder at Tekong Camp<br>1 while doing prowling with another platoon mate. Heard about the jacobs<br>ladder too. She was waiting for her husband who went out to sea and hasn't<br>return since. Once in a while, she'll remove her head to comb her hair.<br>Hearsay, didn't see b4.<br><br>TEKONG JAGUAR CAMP 3<br>There was a story about a recruit at Jaguar at Camp 3 who brought a pork bun<br>into the bunk and kept it in his locker. Apparently his locker started<br>shaking violently or he became possessed. They had to call in the Exorcist<br>for this one. One of my section mates' parent bought charsiew rice for him<br>during Parent's visiting day which he consumed in the bunk. Had high fever<br>for a few days. Sometime after he brought dried pork (if you know what I'm<br>trying to say) in and consumed in the bunk, fell sick again, high fever for<br>a few days. Was in 2BTS for my BMT. My sgt told me that he was woken up in<br>the morning thinking that it was time for 5 BX when he realised that the<br>voices were of children playing. Still remembered that we were not supposed<br>to eat anything that had pork inside the bunk. Seems that the bunks at camp<br>1 were built over Malay cemetaries. After BMT, I went back to tekong as an<br>officer cadet for exercises. One of which was nite topo at the oil palm<br>plantation (east of the island) there was a checkpoint known as SQ. It was<br>also known as the Japanese Karaoke point. We heard jap, songs drifting to us<br>when we were there.<br><br>OLD NEE SOON CAMP<br>Some of the army camps here are haunted from what I gathered from my army<br>buddies. Of which, majority thought the old Nee Soon Camp was "extremely<br>haunted. If really need to go there, please bring along full protection<br>against the unearthly beings. Challenge the CO to stay in the building alone<br>if he doesn't believe it. Feel free to contribute if you think there are<br>other haunted camps to look out for.<br><br>LAKIUN CAMP<br>What is tekong compared to Lakiun camp (Brunei jtb)? With several people<br>collapsing inside a certain bunk at different instances (quite a spooky<br>place, I must say), foaming at the mouth and yet the medical officer cannot<br>detect anything wrong with them and they were immediately brought back to<br>Singapore! Finally, the camp commander ordered the place to be out of bounds<br>that even those on guard duty do not have to prowl near it. A bomoh was<br>asked to perform rites and that set things right.<br><br>TEKONG CHARLIE COMPANY<br>Heard of the 3 door bunk of Charlie company of tekong? It was converted into<br>an instructors' office and b4 moving in, a taoist was brought in to perform<br>some rituals. Some experiences - When my mossies net's stick fell on me at<br>3am, I woke up to see "the old man of tekong". He was figeting in front of<br>my buddy's cupboard, I didn't call out to him. Don't ask me why, but I juz<br>didn't. Then I had nitemares till morning as u guys should know, mossis nets<br>is compulsory in tekong, my platoon mates fixed up his net and went to zzz,<br>he woke up in the middle of the nite to find the net neatly tucked under his<br>pillow, he put it up again to find the same thing happen. Once, the whole<br>bunk heard children laughing &amp; running round &amp; round the whole bunk, no one<br>dares to investigate.<br><br>TEKONG LAUGHING TREE<br>Have u guys seen the laughing tree of Tekong? We recruits were brought on a hill to draw I forgotten what u call that, kinda picture to familiarise urself with the surrounding, arc of fire thingie. There, rite in front of us is the laughing tree. Story is that, a recruit while marching laughed at the tree during day time. On their way back, the tree laughed back at him.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>-:[ Kwee Kia ]:-<br>Kwee Kia is also known as the toyol in Malay. The closest English translation will be Little Devil, due to its small figure.<br><br>The Kwee Kia is powered by a young, angry spirit and is normally �adapted� for supernatural purposes, mostly bad ones.<br><br>Like the toyol, Kwee Kia can be used to steal, be it money or other things. It can also be used for minor supernatural threats to scare its owners� enemies away.<br><br>Where IT come from<br><br>It is believed that Kwee Kia was actually a dead foetus, removed from its mother\'s womb. One can acquire a Kwee Kia by getting it fresh from the grave or by passing IT down from generation to generation, from father to son. Of course, this involves chanting and all but since this is evil, it is not encouraged and it will not be discussed here.<br><br>Where does IT live?<br><br>The owner will actually have a special altar in the house for the Kwee Kia. There will be a glass tube-like structure, big enough to hold an ugly, overgrown, bloated, not fully developed foetus. Yes! The foetus itself in the house. The dead baby in a tube! Evil!!!<br><br>The glass tube is filled with a milky solution, something to preserve the foetus with.<br><br>Candles, fruits, food and even toys will be laid before it. These are the necessary offerings. It also includes sweets and candies, anything that a small child would like.<br><br>Come Out n Play<br><br>It is believed that the Kwee Kia comes out at night to play when everyone else is asleep. It will play with its favourite toy among those offered on the altar. Often, it will make some noise but no one shall disturb it.<br><br>Boo IT Away<br><br>The Kwee Kia is actually like a small child so the way to chase it away is to scold it. Do what you would do to stop the children from playing soccer in your void deck.<br><br>Is not known though whether or not the ways to prevent the toyol from coming back will work on the Kwee Kia.<br><br>Since Kwee Kia is allegedly known to be toyol too, these might work for them both.<br><br>Some Tips to Share<br><br>If you often find your money missing from the drawer, place a small mirror in it. Make it the first thing you see when you open the drawer. Toyols are said to be afraid of their own reflection.<br><br>Trap IT. Bait IT. Place some needles beneath your dollar notes. They will cause severe pain to the toyol. They will shriek in pain and by God\'s Will, that will be the last time youll be hearing from them.<br><br>One piece of advise, NEVER indulge in the supernatural. Work your way to success, earn it the right way.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Marathon Man This story was told to me by a friend a few years back. It happened in Kuala Lumpur and the story was as follows....<br><br>It is said that, some people possess the ability to see things from the "other world". It is true in this story in which I am about to tell where the female does have the this perception.<br><br>It so happened that this female and her boyfriend were on their way to a local disco in town and they were travelling along the Federal Highway. They talked and joked as they travelled along when suddenly, a car whizzed past them. Being a teenager with a passion for street racing, the boyfriend wanted to give chase but was stopped by his girlfriend's stern warning. His girlfriend told him to do as she said and that she would explain later. Therefore, the boyfriend did as he was told.<br><br>Further along the highway, the couple noticed there was a big crowd ahead and a traffic jam. They later found out that the jam and the crowd was caused by an accident involving the car that had whizzed passed them just moments ago. The car was smashed and the driver lay dead on the highway. Upon seeing this, the boyfriend was thankful that his girlfriend talked him out of giving chase.<br><br>It was only much later that the boyfriend brought the matter up. The boyfriend was curious to know why his girlfriend did not want him to race that night for it was not typical of his girlfriend. The girl then told him that as the car whizzed by, she saw an elderly man running behind the car by FOOT! It was then that she knew something was wrong thus she told him not to give chase. She also saw the elderly man at the crash site smiling at her as they passed by.<br><br>Well, any believers?</strong>   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><img src="http://www.asianjoke.com/funpage/toilet_guy_md_wht.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large">I always sleep very late, like 3AM - 5AM then I sleep... So, I got many experience. It is true, maybe I suay or something... more than 5 cases... My original experience::<br><br>The last time was in chalet... I booked an Superior room in Downtown East resort, many of my friends come and play, drink, eat, in the day. And most of them left at 10:30 in the night. There were only 5 of us Staying in the room sleeping. Suddenly, I heard knocking sound from the back sliding door. It went louder and louder, I humji don't dare to pull the curtian over and see. The rest of my friends were tired, and went to sleep, some were drunk. ok, sukoru is a humji kia, I closed my eyes and sleep also. After sometime the knocking sound came back... This time I call up another friend who wasn't drunk. He told me not to care, must be some kids from other room, playing tricks on us.<br><br>Ok, it was around 3AM my room was at 1222, the smelly flooding toilet in the whole chalet. I dare not to go to the toilet because of some stingray and chicken wing smell. Because we took the toilet as an kitchen to manage and marinate our food. So, I have to take a break outside, but how?? I can't take off the key, if I take it off, the lights, aircon will go off. So, I didn't lock the room, i leave the door opened and went out of the room myself. It was really freaky, I went to the watercooler to get some water. Soon after, as I return to my room, the door is closed. How to hell am I supposed to get in?? I knock the door few times so that my friend can hear. I guess a gust of wind had closed the door. (was it possible for chaletroom?) So, my last resort was to get to the back sliding door!! As my friend is sleeping near the sliding door, I am sure he can hear me. As I walk back to sliding door...<br><br>It was already opened!! WTF, is was impossible! out of 5, 3 friends were drunk. another friend was deep aslept after the first time I called him up. They were all sleeping inside, So I closed the sliding door, and pull the curtian over, hopfully it don't open itself again. But what actually happened now? In main door was opened! I didn't realised it after I closed the sliding door, I saw light penetrate from somewhere. My hair stood on end, Because I know there were something darn wrong!! I knew it wasn't my friend playing trick on me. They were all aslept, besides, are they so fast enough to open the main door and sliding door as I went from back took less than 20 seconds? I locked the sliding door well, I went closer and closer to the main door... and open it, Guess what happened??<br><br>I saw someone wearing a white piece of clothes with very very long hair... but very blur. In the end of the corridor. Maybe I was wearing contact lenses... I can't see properly... Blur white with long hairs... I guess it went to another people's room.. duhz, I didn't sleep for the whole night, just to wait till morning. The next night was easy, since I didn't sleep on the first day, I was very tired and was able to sleep well in the second day. Some advice to all of you, limit your aircon to 25 degree during the night, I share banket with another friend, so it is darn cold. secondly, DO NOT BOOK room 1222!! And do not went out alone after 2AM.</span></div>
