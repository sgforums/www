            <div class='col-md body'>. I was watching television upstairs in our house, when I felt like I was being watched. When I turned my head quickly, I swear, I saw something, something that couldn't exist, and my mind blanked it out. All I know is that something slammed the door to the room with such force that to this day, it's off the mark and gets stuck in the frame if you close it.<br><br>A little shaken, but not enough to drown out the average 13 year olds need for fun, I called my friend down the street, and asked if he wanted to have a sleep over. Readily agreeing, we started to plan things to do. His family was part of a religion called B'hai, and the idea of the supernatural wasn't even allowed to be discussed. I was a good Christian boy at the time, and I gave ghosts and ghoulies barely even a second thought. Well, later that night, we were both hanging out outside his house, talking about, you got it, sex, the average 13 year old misconceptions about the wonders of the female form, when the hair on the back of my neck stood up.<br><br>It was the same feeling I felt that morning, except much, much worse.<br><br>Turning around slowly, I saw the apparition. The creature was nearly transparent. Standing only about 15 feet from where I was sitting, I could easily make out detail. It was wearing the torn uniform of a naval officer, covered in seaweed, and looking quite the worse for wear. Raising one of its rotting arms slowly, it pointed at me.<br><br>Me.<br><br>Needless to say, I was terrified. With all the courage I could muster, I stammered to tell my friend to look around. He did, and jumped in fright. He saw it too! Leaping up, we ran into the house, screaming like, well, little scared children. Telling his mother what happened, she called my brother to come and pick me up. No way in the world was I going to walk home alone that night!<br><br>As she was on the phone, both of us heard the sound of boots on the tiles leading to the houses kitchen. Strangely, the parents of my friend didn't hear a thing. Cowering in the corner like cattle, my friend and I seemed to have slipped into a kind of shock. Minutes later, my teenage brother, 17 at the time, showed up to walk me home. Smiling in relief that the nightmare was over, I gladly for once, accepted my brothers presence.<br><br>Nothing strange happened until we got home, when he tried to get me to tell him what happened. Our parents were out at a dinner, meeting friends, but would be on their way home soon, after my brother had called them and told them II was freaking out.<br><br>I started to tell my brother what had happened, as I sat on the stairs, looking out the window into our backyard. It was then that the apparition, or creature, or whatever, showed up again, pressing itself against the window. I screamed, and pointed. My brother spun around, but saw nothing.<br><br>Seconds later, the front door, only a short distance away, shook slightly. Going to open it, thinking it was my parents, my brother turned away. I saw the creature smile, and chuckle. Looking out the window to the front door, I saw a strange light.<br><br>I was now screaming, "Matt, don't open that door, don't open that door!" I nearly leaped out of my skin. The creature disappeared, and my parents appeared soon thereafter.<br><br>Fortunately, nothing strange has happened since, unless you count the fact that I felt like the creature was myself, and I have decided to become a naval officer for my career. Perhaps the creature was myself, giving me a warning. I don't know. We will just have to see.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.creature-corner.com/graphics2/fatalframe.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My is a very intelligent woman. She had lived most of her young life in poverty. She struggled to survive, and to make it into the US with almost nothing given to her. That was why I had always wondered why she was afraid of the dark.<br><br>I could not believe that someone as intelligent as her, someone who struggled in hardship, could be afraid of the dark. So one day I asked her, why are you afraid of the sounds of the house settling and of all of the dark parts of the house, and this is what she told me....<br><br>"When I was a little girl, my mother's best friend had dying, stricken with cancer. My mother had promised her, before she died that she would take care of her little girl, she was two years younger than I was. Well the time finally came when her friend passed away and the child came into her custody.<br><br>As any child I became jealous of the attention my mother was giving this child. I would bully her around and threaten her when my mother wasn't around. This went on for about two weeks when it all came to an end. I went to take my after lunch daily nap, and not fifteen minutes had passed when I was awaken by a cold breeze, that chilled me to the bone. It was intensely cold, kind of like a mid-winter blizzard wind, the kind you feel on the loneliest of nights.<br><br>Since I was living in the Singapore, it shocked me wide awake, and hovering two feet off of the ground stood my mother's best friend, at the foot of my bed. Her clothes were mere tattered rags and her nails were long and gnarled. Her skin was a pale white and her arms were long and reaching out, almost as if trying to embrace me, but there was no love in her face. There was only a look of intense hatred and madness. Her eyes, red and burning. I laid there not able to move for ten minutes, my eyes locked and forced to gaze upon her, barely breathing and not able to scream. I thought that I was going to die. After those ten minutes she turned away from me and went through the wall in my room to the outside. I cried for days and never again have I ever wronged another person after that experience."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<img src="http://www.zombienews.com/frightnight204.jpg"></div>
