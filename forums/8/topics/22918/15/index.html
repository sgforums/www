            <div class='col-md body'>whether u believe there r ghost &amp; deities anot is better not to say so much. keep it to yrself if u got doubts cos there r many unexplainable things going on. our mind is only open to vision at only small percentage so dats y some ppl cant sense &amp; see much of these strange unique 'things'. wait till yr mind opens up more then u can feel it all around u. so do not underestimate the supernatural &amp; unknown. anyway i dun think we r capable of hving our mind to work at such a broad band network lah unless u focus without distraction haha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I have always wondered, a few dollars can buy billions of hell money, the inflation there must be terrible. Then where do they keep their money? Got banks meh? Even if got, the banks must have super computers to keep account of the zillions and zillions being burnt everyday. Would the computers crash? Then I oso wonder, how much are the staff being paid because if some one were to burn millions for them, why do they have to work? What about the other races whether no money being burnt for them? They must be very poor and the rest very super duper rich. In that case, crime rate would be very high since there is no currecy regulators like worldbank or our own finance ministry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<img src="http://www.xs4all.nl/~pvroekel/wtx/images/img8.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>This incident happened at one of the higher education institutes in Kuala Lumpur. Sarah was recently granted admission into that institute. She was naturally all excited about it. It was the first time she left her home to live on her own and it would begin another new chapter of her life.<br><br>She looked forward to the registration day ever since she received that acceptance letter from the Registrar. With her baggage, Sarah arrived at the institute for registration and was assigned to a room on the top floor of the hostel.<br><br>As she was looking for her room, she started to wonder who her roommate would be and how is she like. She was all too excited, yet curious, as she walked through the corridors of the place she will spend the rest of her university life.<br><br>Sarah finally found her room on the top floor. She tried to open the door but it was locked. She was a bit disappointed as she thought if the door was locked, her roommate was probably not in and hence she would not be able to satisfy her curiosity regarding her roommate. She opened the door with her keys and walked in to see her roommate sleeping inside.<br><br>Sarah left her alone and started unpacking her things. It is then that her roommate woke up. They introduced themselves and started a short conversation. Ina was indeed a very pleasant girl. She has shoulder length hair with a rather fair complexion.<br><br>Sarah and Ina got along quite well for the rest of the semester. Nevertheless, Ina only showed up after dusk every day and she sleeps very little. To Sarah, Ina must have a well social life and she didn't give it much thought.<br><br>Everything was well until one night. It was a full moon night and the sky was all clear. The hostel was all quiet as it was very late then. The clock showed 3am and Sarah decided she should go to bed already. She asked Ina to switch off the room light and turned on her own reading lamp. Without getting up, the room light was switched off and Ina's reading lamp turned on. Sarah, already lying on her bed felt strange but didn't enquire further. She thought she was so tired that she didn't even notice Ina got off her seat. However, as she turned to look at Ina to say goodnight, she noticed she could see through Ina. She thought she was sleepy and was seeing things. She take another careful look and she realised Ina was transparent! Sarah began to have an uneasy feeling. She covered herself up with her blanket and soon fell asleep.<br><br>The next day, Sarah thought about what happened. She began to feel uneasy with Ina. She recalled how nobody in the hostel know about Ina and many expressed surprised that there is such a person living in the hostel after all. She started to think about the late nights Ina stayed up and how she disappeared by dawn only to reappear by dusk the next day.<br><br>Sarah went to the Registrar's office to check if she could find anything about Ina. The clerk told her she could not disclose any information about anyone.<br><br>After much persuasion, the clerk agreed to look up the files for her. She was, however, told that she was not supposed to have any roommate.<br><br>Sarah was afraid to go back to her room that night. She spent the next few nights at her friend's room and only went back to get her stuff in the daytime. Sarah immediately applied for a change of room and she was lucky to get it.<br><br>Nonetheless, it was still a mystery to Sarah as to the identity of Ina. After all, Ina has been nothing but a nice roommate. Perhaps, some things are better left alone for the truth may be saddening or.... ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></strong><img src="http://members.aol.com/livingstonstreet/terror/01Enter.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>It had been a wild night and I woke up with a hangover that morning. As I walked down the stairs, I saw my grandmother who was suppose to be in the hospital. Surprised, I looked at her and asked when did she come back. She smiled at me as she always did over the years and told me she had just been discharged from the hospital that morning.<br><br>We spent a few minutes talking in the kitchen while I had some aspirin. She looked great that morning. In fact, when asked, she said she has never feel better. Anyway, I told her to get more rest and I walked her to her room afterwards.<br><br>I was wondering where were my parents that morning and why they had left my grandmother alone after sending her back. Before I could reason with myself, the phone rang and it was my mother.<br><br>"Where have you all been? Grandma's all alone downstairs when I woke up just now."<br><br>There was some silence for a moment. Then my mother said, "What are you talking about? We are at the hospital and your grandma just passed away."<br><br>"But mum! I swore she's here," I insisted.<br><br>"That's enough," she ended the call.<br><br>I thought to myself, "This can't be true!" and I rushed to my grandmother's bedroom. But there was no one there. I searched the whole house but she was no where to be found. I rushed to the hospital and my heart broke when I saw my grandmother lying motionless on her deathbed.<br><br>Until today, I couldn't explain the incident but I am glad she came back to see me and to talk to me one last time that morning.<br><br><img src="http://www.horrorgifs.de/gifs/gifs/menschen/exorcistani.gif"></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>I was raised in Laos by my mother and her family. Since my parents had always had a bad relationship they divorced shortly after my birth, and since my father was a foreigner I never had more than a passing relationship with him or his family and that fact sometimes made me sad.<br><br>In my hometown I would often pass by the house of a certain friend and when she wasn't there I sometimes saw an old couple that would smile kindly at me and wave. A detail I remember well about the woman is that she always wore a pair of coral earrings shaped like roses. I was very small and although I was curious about the old couple I assumed they were my friend's relatives and didn't worry too much about them. I remember I once asked my friend about the couple but she didn't seem to know what I was talking about and I didn't worry too much about it although their faces made an impression on me.<br><br>When I was about five years old my uncle sponsored my family and we were able to move to the United States where we settled in El Monte California. The strange thing is that I continued to see the old couple every once in a while. I would see them sometimes at the market or taking a walk but each time I saw them for one reason or another I wasn't able to speak to them they were always a little bit too far. I thought I must be seeing things or that maybe the old people had common faces that I was mistaking everywhere. Anyway, after a certain age I no longer saw the old couple and I stopped giving them thought until many years later when I visited my father's sister in Chinatown for the first time and immediately noticed an elaborately framed photograph of two young people on their wedding day.<br><br>The sight of the picture made me catch my breath. The woman was wearing the same earrings that I had seen on the old woman and she had the same expression in her eyes. My aunt says that it's a picture of my grandparents and I guess I'll always wonder if my grandparents spirits felt sorry for me because I didn't have a father and if they watched over me as a result.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></strong><img src="http://tastydead.com/graphics/clip/haunted1x.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>My mum just passed away a few weeks ago due to breast cancer and I couldn't get over her as I was her most favourite child amongst my siblings. Before my mum died, I was sick and needed a major operation to which I hid the matter from my mum as I was afraid that the news would worry her and worsen her condition.<br><br>My operation was a successful one and due to the medication given by my doctor, I tend to fall asleep easily. However each time when I close my eyes, the flash back of my mum's funeral kept ringing in my mind. I was discharged soon after and went home to recuperate. A few weeks passed and soon it was the 21th day of my mum's death. I couldn't make it to her prayer ceremony as I was still recuperating and very much in pain.<br><br>That same night, after taking my daily dosage of medicine, I went to bed as usual. I had a very strange dream that night. In my dreams, I saw my mum approaching me from afar. She seemed so real, very real. My mum told me that she had came to see me and that she also knew that I have gone through a very major operation a few weeks ago. She asked me how I was and I replied that I was still very much in pain from my operation. I also told her that I missed her a lot. We spent some time chatting on my health and well being. I felt as if I was her little girl again when my mum touched me on my head lovingly like she used to when I was very young. Time seemed to fly very fast and soon morning broke, my mum said she had to go. I was very upset as couldn't bear to see her leave. "MUM PLEASE DUN GO!" I shouted in pain and begged her to stay. I tried to get out of my bed to hold her back but the extreme pain of my womb restricted me from getting up. My mum turned around, smiled at me for the last time before she drifted slowly towards the forested area near my house and disappeared. All these while I was crying and calling out to my mum not to leave but to no avail.<br><br>My husband was awakened by my cries and he shook me up from my sleep. It wasn't a dream I just knew it wasn't. Its my mum. She really did come back to see me for the last time. It has been 28 years since that dream happened and to this day I still couldn't forget about it.<br><br>Mum I Love you.<br><br>True story by Chen Ngi Moy<br>Translated by [G]aTe<br>Edited by Jade<br><br></strong><img src="http://www.davidgwee.mypharmanex.com/images/gwp/px/default_photo.jpg"></div>

Everybody knows that when you turn right, your reflection on the mirror would turn left, and vice-versa. Nevertheless, the mirrors in this hostel would do otherwise. That is, if you turn right, the reflection, as if alive, would turn right as well.

According to them, this phenomenon only happens when you are not looking exactly at the mirror and are not paying attention on it.<br><br>You may argue that it is mere psychological effects and that's what those who had experienced it thought so too, until they came together and realised that so many others experience the same thing.<br><br>Although this is not scary, the mirrors, or perhaps the ghosts, have another trick that would set their victims screaming and crying in fear.<br><br>One early morning, everyone was awoken by a loud scream of a girl. According to the girl, she bent down near to the sink to wash her face. When she stood up straight and looked into the mirror, she saw what made her screamed out in fear.

Her friend convinced her it was only water but not blood.<br><br>By then, everyone has rushed out of their room and gathered around outside the girl's room trying to find out what had happened. One of them later told the housemaster about the incident. The housemaster said there is nothing he could do. However, he did not rule out the story of that girl as ridiculous and, in fact, he advised the residents not to go to the toilets alone.
