            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://armageddononline.tripod.com/images/nuke23k.jpg"><br>What is a Nuclear Weapon?<br>A nuclear weapon is any device that harnesses the immense power of the atom to create a bomb. For all the hype, they are essentially nothing more than extremely powerful bombs, bombs large enough to obliterate vast cities.<br><br>A typical nuclear warhead might have a power of one megaton. This means the power of 1,000,000 tons of TNT, the most powerful non-nuclear explosive. Imagine the size of this much TNT (a cube 300m by 300m by 300m) and compare it to one small nuclear warhead, and you realise the awesome power of nuclear weapons.<br><br>How many nuclear weapons are there?<br>There are more than 40,000, distributed as follows:<br>Â· USA: 12,070<br>Â· Russia: 28,240<br>Â· UK: 400<br>Â· France: 510<br>Â· China: 425<br>Â· India: 70<br>Â· Pakistan: 15<br>This many warheads could destroy the world many times over.<br><br>What would an impact be like?<br>The missile would be denoted above the ground, to maximise devastation. The first effect would be the heat, which would travel out form the bomb at the speed of light, burning everything for miles in 10,000Â°C flames. The air itself would seem to catch fire. Gas mains would explode; anyone seeing the blast from virtually any distance would be blinded. Then, seconds later, the shockwave would follow. This would smash through anything in its path, felling skyscrapers and blasting cars hundreds of feet into the air. It would be like a hurricane, just many times more powerful than anything natural. It would sweep through a city, destroying any structure within 15 kilometres of the blast. The shockwave would be so powerful that the air would not be able to absorb it all, so instead some energy would create an elector magnetic pulse that would destroy electrical circuit a huge distance from Ground Zero, potentially even knocking out satellites.<br><br>Why have atomic bombs?<br>The race to harness the power of the atom started in the World War 2. German and Allied scientists were desperate to develop the bomb, knowing that if the other side developed one first the war would be over. Fortunately, the German scientists abandoned the project near the end of the war, believing it to be impossible. The first atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians.<br><br><img src="http://armageddononline.tripod.com/images/hiroshima4.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://armageddononline.tripod.com/images/hiroshima2.jpg"><br><br>Things changed when Russia developed the bomb in 1949. Now Cold War enemies, Russia and America were locked in an arms race, both frantically producing thousands of warheads. However, it was only America that pursued the policy of MAD - mutually assured destruction. This effectively meant - and still does mean - allowing every American citizen to be held hostage by Russia. It means our only defence to a nuclear attack is one of our own, which does not save the lives of any of the hundreds of millions of people that would die in the strike.<br><br>Russia never pursued this policy - it has always tried to protect its population. All its citizens are trained in how to survive nuclear attacks., Cities have large bomb shelters, unlike in America. There are comprehensive evacuation plans. Food is stored in reserve for the aftermath of an attack. Russia is much better equipped to survive a nuclear war than America. Russia spends around 50 times more than America per person per year on preparing for a nuclear attack.<br><br>How do they work?<br>Nuclear bombs are based on the forces that hold atoms together. When these are broken, energy is released. Also released are parts of the atom called neutrons. These then collide with other atoms, destroying these and releasing more energy and neutrons. This is a chain reaction, which releases a vast amount of energy. This is a simple atom bomb.<br><br>Their power can be increased by adding hydrogen, in hydrogen bombs. When hydrogen is compressed by a vast amount, for example with the sort of energy created by an atom bomb, the atoms fuse together, creating a helium atom - and a lot more energy. The pressure required is greater than that in the centre of the sun.<br><br>Who is known to have access to these weapons?<br>Seven countries declare that they have nuclear weapons - the USA, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India and Pakistan. Israel is also known to have nuclear weapons but has never admitted it. South Africa is the only other country to have developed nuclear weapons but subsequently destroyed them. So we are left with eight nations.<br><br>Which of these threatens the US?<br>In order to pose a threat to the US, these countries need to get the warheads into range. For this, one of four things are needed:<br>1. Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). These have ranges of thousands of kilometres, allowing countries to destroy each other from great range.<br>2. Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs). These are nuclear weapons launched from a submarine. The submarine can be move close enough to a rival to destroy it with even short range missiles.<br>3. Nearby missile bases. America has missile bases in Europe and, until fairly recently, Turkey. The USSR attempted to place missiles on Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br>4. Portable nuclear weapons, for example 'Suitcase Bombs'. These are small nuclear weapons that can be delivered by hand into an enemy's city, and then detonated. Another example would be placing nuclear bombs in trucks and driving into a city.<br><br>Of our seven other nuclear countries (excluding the US), Britain and France are NATO allies. India, Pakistan and Israel lack either a reason or the capability to hit the USA. This leaves China and Russia. They have both the ability and, potentially, the motive to attack America.<br><br>A Chinese missile strike would be devastating. Hundreds of cities would be destroyed, including every major one. But a Russian strike would be far worse. Virtually the entire population of America outside a nuclear bunker would be destroyed. Russia could scorch the entire surface of America many times over.<br><br>To be con't.......<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Which other states have nuclear weapons programs?<br>Prior to the Gulf War, Iraq had an advanced nuclear program. It had a state-of-the-art facility at Al Atheer, near Baghdad. This facility was destroyed by UN weapons inspectors in 1992. A plant was bing built at Tarmiya that would allow Iraq to produce enough enriched uranium to construct a nuclear weapon every two years. Their research was helped by former Soviet scientists. Before Iraq's defeat in the Gulf war, nobody knew of this research, showing how nuclear monitoring is insufficient.<br><br>A CIA report to Congress revealed that Iran is the most aggressive pursuer of nuclear weapons. In 1996 Iran attempted to acquire the required equipment from South Africa. In 1998 the Jerusalem Post reported that Iran had stolen to nuclear weapons from Kazakhstan. A US intelligence report said it was 98% sure that Iran had the necessary components for 2 or 3 nuclear weapons. Iran also ahs the necessary missiles to hit much of Europe.<br><br>North Korea is also believed to have a nuclear program. It has a nuclear reactor at Yogbyon, which uses MAGNOX technology, making excellent for producing weapons grade plutonium. Several more reactors are planned, which would give a total output of weapons grade plutonium of 230kg per year - enough for 40 nuclear weapons.<br><br>How difficult would it be for terrorists to construct nuclear weapons?<br>Many terrorists, like Al Qaeda, are extremely well financed, and fanatical enough to commit an atrocity on this scale. They may also be able to pay former Soviet nuclear scientists, some of whom have helped other countries with nuclear research. The design would not be difficult - in an experiment three physics students were able to design a nuclear weapon using only freely available information. Well-researched terrorist could construct a bomb with little difficulty if they acquired sufficient plutonium. This is not impossible - nuclear reactors produce such fuel and many of these are in countries, such as North Korea that may be willing to sell. Al Qaeda has already tried to purchase plutonium in Sudan.<br><br>Could terrorists have nuclear weapons?<br>Nobody knows, but it is possible. The collapse of the USSR has led to the possibility of many nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands. Many terrorists would dream of creating such a weapon, but it would be cheaper to get ready made devices from the former USSR. The greatest risk from these could be 'suitcase bombs' - nuclear weapons the size of suitcases, which a terrorist could simply walk into a city with.<br><br>Why are suitcase bombs such a great risk?<br>Russia created around 250 suitcase bombs - nuclear weapons the size of suitcases. According to a Soviet defector called Aleksander Lebed it has lost track of more than 100 - each of which could kill more than 100,000 people. Many of these bombs were distributed and hidden in hostile countries. Possibly the worst effect of a terrorist nuclear device would be that it could trigger a nuclear war. If America thought Russia had used nuclear weapons against it, it would not hesitate to retaliate; so one small nuclear device could kill billions.<br><br><img src="http://armageddononline.tripod.com/images/suitcase_bomb.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At Bedok North ave 4, blk 99, there used to be a famous suicide case whereby the boy mother threw her 3 year old sleeping child down the 25th floor. After which she fell to her death too.<br><br>The police classified this as suicide and no foul play was suspected. The family had problems, lots of financial problem. The husband owed the loanshark lots of money, the family was breaking up. The father was seeing another woman and he wanted a divorce. The wife refused and hence they quarelled everyday.<br><br>What's eerie was that at her death, she was wearing a bright red dress, which was her wedding gown. Although there ws no suicide note, something wierd she wrote on the wall would freak most of us out. She wrote "It's not over, darling" in chinese with her OWN BLOOD!<br><br>The truth is, she never did return at all. But someone else did! The husband wanted to sell the house but could not find a buyer, so in the end, his mistress move in and they got married. After a few years, they got a boy.<br><br>One day something spooky took place. Out of a sudden, the boy who was sleeping in the afternoon, suddenly started talking and laughing in the room. The maid went in to check but found the boy simply just smiling at the wall and said "kor kor" which means brother! The maid told the events to the parents that night but they simply said they he was playing by himself.<br><br>That night, the son suddenly cried very loudly and run to his father and said that Kor Kor bullied him. The father simply scolded him and tell him not to make things up. That night, the boy refused to sleep in his room and hence the father got no choice but to let him sleep in his room.<br><br>In the middle of the night, suddenly the boy's room was filled with loud banging of cupboards and loud cries of a child. The crying seemed oddly similiar, thought the father, as though it was his dead son.<br><br>Scared, the father told his son to stay in the room while he and his wife check it out. But when they open the boy's room, nothing was found. Suddenly, their maid screamed! The parents rush back to the room only to find their son standing on the edge of the window. It is not know how the grilles have be pryed open, but there he was, laughing and smiling, waving goodbye to them and said that he is flying with superman, his brother. One final flying kiss, and he leaped to the darkness. The mother and the maid fainted.<br><br>The next day, the police swarmed the place once again for investigation. The father was kinda lunatic at the point of time, the mother was still too distraught to speak. On the walls of the parents room, something even more creepy awaits them. The words "This is for mommy" in chinese was scribbled on the wall in black. The police has classified this case as unnatural death, no foul play was suspected.<br><br>Till today, the unit is still vacant as neighbours would go around telling potential buyers about the history of the house. Rumour was that the night of the incident took place, it was the little boy 3 year old birthday (the one that was thrown down by his mother) anniversary. Many neighbours that night could hear strange errie sounds of a woman crying softly. Many years have past, till today, the present, many people could still hear a boy and a woman laughing in the middle of the night!!DuH<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><img src="http://homex.coolconnect.com/member3/a_sf095/ghostpix/girl2.gif"></div>

First experience happened back in the early 90s at about 4am.<br><br>4 friends of mine were cycling home towards Chua Chu Kang via Bukit Timah road. The Â“thingÂ” appeared walking along the pedestrian path in front of Chinese High School. He/she/it was walking towards the City direction. My friends were riding on the road with the flow of the traffic. Therefore, they are on reciprocal direction, passing each other on the left.<br><br>It was walking with a newspaper in front, holding the papers with open arms, seemingly reading it while walking. It was barefoot and wearing a white pyjamas.<br><br>My friends spotted it from afar, thinking that it must be some crazy guy reading newspaper while walking at this time. So they proceeded in a single file in that direction. Being human, curiosity makes you want to look at it when you come abeam. Surprisingly, the Â“thingÂ” turned his body gradually keeping the newspaper between its face and my friends when they pass each other. With this process, the Â“thingÂ” ended walking backwards and still reading the papers. They just thought that Â“thingÂ” was some crazy butt-hole and ignore it completely and carried on home. They only got scared when they brought the issue up during an intense talk cock session at a pub.<br><br>The next encounter happened sometime in late 96Â’, when 8 of us cyclists were heading home from Scotts Road to Chua Chu Kang. We took Tanglin Road and carried on to a road behind Botanical Garden that will exit out of Cluny Road. I think that road itself is called Cluny Road. Using Cluny Road, you will exit out to Bukit Timah Road near Serene Centre. Try walking along Cluny Road from behind Botanical Garden at about 3am. It is magically fascinating. It makes you bright and fresh.<br><br>It was about 2 plus in the morning and we were riding home with our morale touching the ground. We were really tired and pushing ourselves to reach home asap. Once we hit Cluny Road from Tanglin Road, the entire stretched was deserted. Usually we can see a couple of cars parking at the roadside, where couples are making out. The windows are either covered with blinds or badly frosted. A hand would reach up the window and slight down gently. Reminds me of Kate Winslet in that shipping movie.<br><br>But, that night, not even a wondering car exhaust can be smelt. Just pure cooling morning air going up youÂ’re nose and morning dew condensing within and flowing out like clear mucus. Since it was a broad one way road with no cars in vicinity, we didnÂ’t bother about getting in line. Like some wild hooligans on bikes we reached the first turn which is a left turn. Upon turning, the guys in front started to slow down. Â“Get in twos and stay together,Â” said the front guy. I was confused at the moment but did it anyway. My spine froze and arms hardened when I noticed a white figure appearing ahead.<br><br>The road ahead actually curves to the right, making the Â“thingÂ” appearing without warning. Since we used to claim we were hardcore stunt riders, we held our guts tight and rode forward. Everyone was tongue tight. No words were uttered and we packed ourselves tighter than sardine. Then someone in front said, Â“f**k! canÂ’t be that unluckyÂ” in hokkien. I started recalling the incident that my 4 friends told me. The guy next to me whispered, Â“itÂ’s the same thingÂ”. Â“YaÂ…Â…Â….Â”, whisper came from my back. The guy behind me, next to me and the front 2 guys are the same 4 guys that saw the Â“thingÂ” before.<br><br>We kept to the right side of the road as the Â“thingÂ” was walking on the left in a reciprocal direction. I was on the left of my pair. Making me nearer to the Â“thingÂ”. As usual, the Â“thingÂ” walks on barefoot, wearing white pyjamas and reading newspaper with open arms (partner told me he was reading Chinese newspaper).<br><br>I personally find the Â“thingÂ” looks like a real crazy fellow instead of a lost soul. But I took no chance. When we were almost abeam, the Â“thingÂ” stops. I almost lost my cool and was ready to sprint if anything I deem wrong is going to happen. The Â“thingÂ” stayed put, turned when we passed it. I didnÂ’t bother to secure a glimpse of its face. I just concentrate on its movement; if it so decides to dash at us. Anyway a couple of my friends did tried to peep at his face but to no avail.<br><br>Once we passed the Â“thingÂ”, I kept looking at him/her/it for about 20m to 30m. The Â“thingÂ” just stood there. When I was feeling a little excited and relieved, hell broke loose when the front guys broke the silence with a loud Â“Fuuuuuu*K!!!Â”. I was caught off guard; the front guys veer sharply to the left and sped off. I was confused at that very second, my partner too shouted in a split second and took off in front veering slightly to my front. I took no chance by veering a little to my left to avoid crashing into him. The guys behind were too hot on their bikes. One of them over took me on my right real fast while the other was just behind me. We were speeding like crazy and going Â“AhhhhhhhhhhhhhÂ…Â…Â…Â”. My head was light and my skin was cold, I was a full pledge chicken that very minute. My friendsÂ’ loud vocal really scared me. Something definitely scared the shit out of them for them to let out those shouts. We pedalled so hard as if we were going to jump over an aircraft carrier.<br><br>Once we reached the wealthy residential area, I was feeling much calmer. Needless to say, I wasnÂ’t the last guy either. Once we came out of Cluny Road, we cycled passed Serene Centre and stopped over at the nearest Shell Petrol Station. One guy started to vomit, due to exhaustion. The rest of us had pale facelift.<br><br>The first question I popped was Â“why the hell did you guys runÂ”? One other guy that was behind me was also confused. Both of us were blur like sotong, while the rest saw something, which we missed.<br><br>Both sides of the road are actually trees and bushes. When we passed the Â“thingÂ”, we were actually riding to the extreme right. They saw a figure in white climbing about 2m up a tree while another was standing below with its back facing us.<br><br>Time flies. Nowadays we no longer journey far away for a bike jamming session. We drive down with our bikes.<br><br>Contributed by J.R. Kaiser Wong<br><br><img src="http://www.cannibalmedia.com/images/jpg/10-14-00/cyclops.jpg"></div>

It looks creepier than usual. As i need to do my business, i just went to the toilet.<br><br>There were three cubicles in the toilet. So I choose the middle cubicle. The other two was out of order. As i sat down, i heard a creak from both of the cubicle. I was scared and quickly flush the toilet bowl. To my horror, blood come out from the toilet bowl. I ran as fast as i could to the administration block. As there is only one teacher in the office. I related the incident to the teacher. The teacher went to that toilet. I quickly went home as the school gate is closing.<br><br>The very next day, i get to know that the teacher yesterday were found dead at the toilet. His head were separated from the body and the intestine has be ripped off from his stomach. I swear that from that very day i will not go to that toilet again.

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.nmnh.si.edu/paleo/blast_images/asteroid.jpg"><br><br><strong>Meteor Impacts<br>What is a Near Earth Object?<br>A Near Earth Object is a fragment of rock and ice hurtling through space that passes dangerously close to Earth. It can be an asteroid or a comet, vast or tiny. These constantly bombard the Earth, every day. Shooting stars are caused by asteroids burning up in Earth's atmosphere. This is what destroys most of these, but occasionally one is large enough or moving at such a terrifying speed that it collides with the Earth's surface, with massive destructive potential.<br><br>What damage could they cause?<br>A NEO does not need to be large to devastate. One the size of a small garage would annihilate a large city. One big enough to leave a 10km crater, still nowhere near the size of the biggest (there is a 300km crater on Earth), would have the destructive force of every one of the world's 10,000 nuclear warhead combined. The one that wiped out the dinosaurs was several kilometres across.<br><br>When have they hit before?<br>The most famous example of the sheer power of NEO's was the extinction of the dinosaurs. To do this a large meteor, several kilometres across, would be required. Comets imprinted the face on the moon, which are clearly visible from 90,000 kilometres away. Earth will have sustained many more collisions than this, but erosion here is much greater, masking the destruction caused by these in the past.<br><br>What would happen during a large collision?<br>In 1994 a large comet hit Jupiter. The Hubble telescope recorded the impact with terrifying accuracy. As it entered the atmosphere of Jupiter temperatures reached 20,000 degrees. The impact sent a fireball thousands of kilometres into space.<br><br>The damage of such an impact on Earth could kill all life. Huge earthquakes would streak around the globe at thousands of kilometres an hour, destroying all in their path. It would also trigger volcanic eruptions all over the world. A huge dust cloud would be sent into the atmosphere. Gasses released into the atmosphere would cause intensely acidic rain and destroy the ozone layer. A vast fireball would be sent into the sky. However devastating these would be, the real danger would be from the dust clouds sent into the atmosphere. The amount of debris released into the upper atmosphere would block out the sun, trigger a nuclear winter and potentially kill all life on Earth.  What about smaller impacts?<br>In 540AD, chronicles record the impact of a comet. They say that the 'whole sky seemed on fire' and that there were 'battles in the air'. One chillingly reports that 'real blood dropped from the clouds and dreadful mortality ensued'. These ominous words are backed up by evidence. Tree rings show how much a tree grew in each year, indicating the conditions at the time. In the years after 540AD these rings are remarkably close together, indicating stunted growth caused by a dramatically cold period. This was the result of the impact. But this was just its effect on trees - all over the world such an impact would have caused the famine, crop failures and plague outbreaks that occurred at that time. And this was only a small impact.<br><br>This may sound like the distant past but in only 1908 an asteroid with a 80m diameter smashed into the forests of Tunguska, Siberia. A fireball exploded into the sky with the force of 200 atomic bombs. The blast was heard 1000km away. Millions of tonnes of dust were blasted into the atmosphere. For 2,000 square kilometres trees were flattened. Fortunately Tunguska is virtually unpopulated but the area destroyed is that of size of a large city - the casualties of such a meteor in an urban area are horrific.<br><br>How many are there?<br>We simply so not know. The largest yet discovered are an awesome 25 kilometres in length. Scientists estimate that there are around 1000 asteroids larger than 2km that pass close to Earth. An impact by any one of these would be an Extinction Level Event. Just as terrifyingly, there are more than a million bigger than 50metres across - each capable of destroying a city.<br><br>How likely is an impact?<br>Impacts on this scale occur alarmingly often. An impact similar to the one at Tunguska occurs approximately once per hundred years. Slightly smaller ones, but easily big enough to devastate a city, occur at least 5 times per century, for example Brazil in 1930. Not all these will hit the Siberian wilderness or Brazilian rainforest - sooner or later one will hit a major urban area. Just as bad, one could fall in the sea and trigger a mega-Tsunami.<br><br>Those large enough to cause extinction, 2km in diameter, occur more rarely - approximately once per million years. This sounds to unlikely to be scared about? Scientists estimate that you stand a 1/20,000 chance of being killed by a meteor - much more likely than being winning much on the lottery.<br><br>No large NEO yet discovered is on course for earth - but the total world wide effort searching is just 100 people.<br><br>How can we stop them?<br>If we discovered a NEO was on course for Earth we would have only three options. We could try to destroy the asteroid with high yield nuclear weapons. This would be extremely risky as without detailed knowledge of the structure of the NEO, no one could tell how much it would take to destroy it. Also, there is the risk of incompletely destroying the asteroid. This would results in many small NEOs. Not only would these be much harder to stop, but they could also cause far more damage as the whole of the Earth's surface could suffer impacts.<br><br>The second option is to try to deflect the NEO. The most essential requirement for this is time, as the deflection required is inversely proportional to the time available. However, only small adjustments to the course of the asteroid or comet would be needed to make it miss Earth. The object could be diverted using nuclear weapons or placing 'mass drivers' on the object which, fuelled by substance on the asteroid, could divert its course.<br><br>The third is to try to prepare for the impact. Ground zero - the area of impact - would have to be evacuated. This area could be vast with a large NEO. Nuclear winter would mean that natural food sources would be unavailable for at least a year, the surface of the planet would be inhospitable for an extended period and most infrastructure would be destroyed, delaying a return to civilization.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></strong><br><br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/gallowsnight.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VERY SCARY<br>by Jimmy<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>It happened on a uneventful afternoon, as usual my mum brought me to visit an auntie for a little chat. when I reach there, I realized that the house (Condo) is a well decorated and tidy. The strange thing is the house is dark even with all the lights on, the afternoon sun seems dark.<br><br>Being a very playful kid back then, I search the house for hidden toys leaving my mum chatting in the living room. I open all the doors and search feverishly for my afternoon toys.<br><br>After opening all the doors, well almost . I noticed that one particular door near the end of that corridor was what it seemed to be, a store room. Believing that my prize toy will be there waiting for me to play with, I innocently turn the knob which I wished in my whole life that I hadn't.<br><br>"CRRRRRRRRRRACK......" my heart thumps with anxiety<br><br>In the dimmed 'room' I saw it. It was in a Japanese soldier uniform. I cannot see through him and it looked very solid. However what gave it away was the it's body got no hands and no legs and was floating in mid-air. Then the most frightening was it actually spoke to me...<br><br>"Wo... Yao... Chi... Dong... Xi..." I want to eat something in Chinese...<br><br>"Gui ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!" I screamed at the top of my lungs (=GHOST!!!!)<br><br>I slammed the door hard with all my might and ran towards the living room screaming! Noticing my bloodless white face, my aunt and my mum seemed to be very concerned and my aunt admitted that the 'room' is actually haunted.<br><br>The 'room' actually is a backdoor leading to a staircase that was almost in complete darkness.<br><br>My mum immediately called the so called 'Chinese medium' or the Chinese priest...Strangely they arrived rather quickly and prepare the stuffs. I was carried to seat on a very tall chair and was made to face towards the door...where I saw the ghost. The Chinese medium opened the door<br><br>"CRRRRRRRRRACK" This time there was empty darkness.<br><br>The Chinese medium then slowly burn some yellow papers and thrust the ashes into the bowl of blessed water. He mumbled some prayers he pour the mixture into his mouth.<br><br>He spayed the mixture on to the back of my headwhile I stare blankly towards the empty darkness of evil presence.<br><br>The same process was done with the front door.<br><br>Later that year, by chance a taxi driver who claimed to had some knowledge of the supernatural learned from a master ( SI FU ) in Thailand saw me and my mum. We happened to be his taxi pessengers.<br><br>He told us that I had a half YIN YANG YEN ( eye that can see ghost ) and luckily he said it was not permanent and can be removed. He did some process of using some burning incense sticks to write some 'thing' near my eyes. All I remember is it felt very hot then after that it was refreshing.<br><br>Now I can no longer see ghost, I wondered if I can still catch on at the corner of my eyes...<br><br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/skullripple.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.freehorror.com/posters/thumbs/exorcist.jpg"><br>Here's a story based on my experience during my Outward Bound Singapore course, which was just last year. For your info, Succubus is a female devil which seduces a man for his spirit. This story is for u boys who feels like you're James Bond. Please look twice in a woman's eyes for she might take your soul away.....<br>I went for OBS on the 20th November 1998. I was just 15 then. It was my first trip of shore and OBS was held on an island called Pulau Ubin. Just for your info, Pulau Ubin used to be a military stronghold and I have heard of stories of it being a very unholy place. What can a teenage guy like me do? I'm one helluva hyperactive guy who has been through a lot!! Including ghost experiences! Ok, so it was a pretty fun camp, lotsa things to do until I met this girl during lunch...she is soo beautiful...her eyes and body and her hair...could make you float!! She is like the most beautiful girl! I had to do something to make her mine....but I was soo scared to tell her...I could not say a word...so I made this 5 day camp, into a 5 day hunt for her.<br><br>Meal after meal, i looked at her, and i do believe that she knew I liked her. On the 3rd day of the camp, my friend told me of that same girl, wanting to see me at the "tripod" at 8pm. The tripod is a huge training facility with 3 huge woods standing as high as an 8 storey high buliding.<br><br>So at 8pm, I met her at the tripod...she was sitting there....alone, with no friends to disturb. Such a quiet and peaceful night and a bit creepy because surrounding me are thick forests and a huge tree, the size almost like a redwood tree...So I loked at the red dressed beauty and..I felt so lucky so I apporached her. She turned as I say hi and I could see in her face...a much more beautiful girl i have ever seen. She looked at me and gave me a passionate kiss on the lips....soon then...she wanted to take of her clothes...and so did I....i felt something was controlling me and suddenly, I opened my eyes and saw an ugly creature kissing me!!! Her face was all rotten and maggots was moving on it....I stepped off and moved back..afraid that she would eat me up...<br><br>And in a coarse and ugly voice she told me, "Don't worry? Why are you afraid? You're not afraid are you?" I wanted to shout but not the slightest voice could come out. I also couldn't run...i was stuck...i couldn't move i prayed hard and finally i could run...i ran as fast as i could towards my room and told my friends about the whole thing...all the say was: "Girl? What girl? We were laughing at you kissing the tripod. Ooh...you're so romantic? You had a girl in mind?" And they laughed....but I knew that something wasn't right so i decided to ask my instructor.."Oh u mean Lina?", he said. "Lina is a regular here....she looks out for man and steal his spirit. No man has ever lose from her grip. But you my friend, is a lucky one." I asked how Lina became a regular and he simply said." Well son....she's my daughter....."<br><br>contributed by Zai.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SUICIDE ROAD"<br>by WA<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Ok, this really happened. About 10 years ago, I lived in Vietnam in a small urban town called Thu Duc. One year before that, one of my neighbor (a kid) decided to skip school on a hard rainy day to go play soccer w/ his friends and take a bath in the rain. While playing, he kicked his soccerball into a small puddle so he decided to go after it.<br><br>Who would have guessed, a powerline snapped b/c a piece of roof cover was blowned by the harsh wind and fell on it. The kid was cruelly electrocuted as he ran into the puddle to get his ball, imean, the sun of a gun was literally charred. Because of the sadness for the mother, our town decided to buried the kid where he died and the insider decided to call the small passage where the boy died "Suicide Turn".<br><br>But the story is far from over. NO one from our town EVER use Suicide Turn after the sunset because we all believe that it was haunted for most of us experienced it first hand. If you want to see it for yourself, come to Suicided Turn in Thu Duc around ten o'clock, you can literally see a small child kicking a ball back and forth over to each side of the road not very far from the weed covered tombstone.<br><br>Anyway, one day a man decided to take "the road" to his wife's house because it was a shortcut. Well, he made it. But he is not OK. Right after the short trip, his face swelled up as big as a platter and everyday he sat in the corner reciting "i'm bored, i need my mommy" all over, and over again. Because of the constant worry, his family decided to hired a priest and the priest suggested that it is too late to save the man because the restless and angry spirit of the boy has taken over his body so the only thing that they can do now is to lock him in the cellar and feed him only holy water and bathe him with a little dog blood in the washing water everyday to keep the spirit weak. "Suicide Turn" is no more now, a hospital was built on it last year. even though it is no more, it's legends lives on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.ghost-cafe.com/ghost24.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.cryptozoology.fsbusiness.co.uk/topics/wadephoto/wadephoto.jpg">Jeremy Wade, an ex biology teacher from Britain photographed a strange creature with mystery teeth on its back breaking the surface of an Amazonian lake in August 1993.<br><br>Wade described the creature as to big for a newt, more the size of a caiman , which of course has a tail with a serrated profile, but the movement was entirely wrong and it appeared to have smooth, pink coloured skin.<br><br>"What I thought I saw, 100ft or so from dugout canoe I was paddling on, was a crest, a curving row of pointed teeth, cutting the water surface like the rotating blade of a giant circular saw. It resembled nothing in the natural world".<br><br>The photo has baffled biologists, but the general consensus was that the creature in question was an Amazonian pink river dolphin. The speculation is exactly that and very incunclusive. The most favoured explanation being some form of injury from a net or propellor blade perhaps. But then such injuries normally leave wounds much less precise and regular. A sick minded person having carried out a mutation was another theory, but deemed the most unlikely explanation when also considering the chance of survival would be very low. A birth defect was another possibility.<br><br>Jeremy Wade did return to the location a year after in search of answers and to attempt to film the creature in the hope of shedding some light on its identity. He did hear other tales from locals and fishermen of similar sightings spanning 20 years, but discovered there to be very little background information and folklore.<br><br>Most sightings have come from one bend in the river and the backwaters around it, the most common spot being the deep lake where Wade himself saw the subject. This points to a single individual with a definite home territory.<br><br>Sources Used: Tales From The Bush: The Amazon Nessie in BBC Wildlife June 1996, (Page 106) and Fortean Times Magazine, Issue 99 (Page 24-26), June 1997.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.cryptozoology.fsbusiness.co.uk/topics/giantcongosnake/giantcongosnake.jpg"><br><br>A Belgian chopper pilot called Remy Van Lierde took the photo (pictured left) during a patrol over the Republic of Congo in 1959. The snake he witnessed has been estimated to be anywhere from around 40-50 feet long. It was possible to estimate the size of the snake because of the many features on the ground in the images taken.<br>It was described by the pilot as a dark shade of brown and green with a white coloured belly. The jaws were of triangular shape. The pilot claimed the head was a massive 3 feet wide adding that as he cautiously moved in lower for a closer inspection the snake raised itself in the air as high as maybe 10 feet, looking like it may attack the helicopter.<br><br>After much expert analysis the images taken of this 'Giant Congo Snake' were deemed to be genuine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Duh<br><br>(<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tell u all a quick encounter.<br><br>Yesterday After playing counterstrike, I log on to Sgforums around 2AM. I felt something is behind me, when I turn back nobody. My family members were all asleep. Suddenly I heard 4 knocks on the main door at living room. But how is it possible?? I had bought the corridor space and constructed an Metal gate. Infact, there's no chance of knocking the door with the gate blocking.<br><br><img src="http://homex.coolconnect.com/member4/sukoru/door.jpg"></div>
