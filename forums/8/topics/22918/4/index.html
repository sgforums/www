            <div class='col-md body'><strong>It was during one of our NPCC camp in Ubin and during our second night  I lead a group of 6 juniors for a nightwalk in Ubin. As you know Ubin is an undeveloped island and lack most of the basis infrastructure such as lighting. At that night there was no moonlight at all and armed with a torch each we made our way from the camp site around Ubin. Being the  superstitious type, I made it a point not to venture near the cemetary which was rumoured to be haunted and headed towards the jetty-approximately 3-4km walk from the camp site. </strong><br><br>No, no such thing. Is this story told by you from your senior, or your CI? I heard this type of story many many times liao. It is true that the basketball court is haunted. and have you visited the Community center? There are something really weird inside. I am a regular visitor of pulau Ubin, I went there once per month for past 4 years. I had heard lots of craps about ghost which they have never seen, and anyhow created an story. As you know there are many temples there, Thai temple, Chinese temple, etc.. There is a small path leading to the rocky beach near the thai temple. There is a small hut living an old man selling durian. I visited him twice, and he told me something about Pulau Ubin.. There is also a ruin hut somewhere near the mining quartfield. that is near a chinese temple, in the night, I went near the hut, got dogs chased me off. I think the dogs is helping me to avoid something..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/darkcreature/images/eyes17.gif"><br><br>At Bedok North ave 4, blk 99, there used to be a famous suicide case whereby the boy mother threw her 3 year old sleeping child down the 25th floor. After which she fell to her death too.<br><br>The police classified this as suicide and no foul play was suspected. The family had problems, lots of financial problem. The husband owed the loanshark lots of money, the family was breaking up. The father was seeing another woman and he wanted a divorce. The wife refused and hence they quarelled everyday.<br><br>What's eerie was that at her death, she was wearing a bright red dress, which was her wedding gown. Although there ws no suicide note, something wierd she wrote on the wall would freak most of us out. She wrote "It's not over, darling" in chinese with her OWN BLOOD!<br><br>The truth is, she never did return at all. But someone else did! The husband wanted to sell the house but could not find a buyer, so in the end, his mistress move in and they got married. After a few years, they got a boy.<br><br>One day something spooky took place. Out of a sudden, the boy who was sleeping in the afternoon, suddenly started talking and laughing in the room. The maid went in to check but found the boy simply just smiling at the wall and said "kor kor" which means brother! The maid told the events to the parents that night but they simply said they he was playing by himself.<br><br>That night, the son suddenly cried very loudly and run to his father and said that Kor Kor bullied him. The father simply scolded him and tell him not to make things up. That night, the boy refused to sleep in his room and hence the father got no choice but to let him sleep in his room.<br><br>In the middle of the night, suddenly the boy's room was filled with loud banging of cupboards and loud cries of a child. The crying seemed oddly similiar, thought the father, as though it was his dead son.<br><br>Scared, the father told his son to stay in the room while he and his wife check it out. But when they open the boy's room, nothing was found. Suddenly, their maid screamed! The parents rush back to the room only to find their son standing on the edge of the window. It is not know how the grilles have be pryed open, but there he was, laughing and smiling, waving goodbye to them and said that he is flying with superman, his brother. One final flying kiss, and he leaped to the darkness. The mother and the maid fainted.<br><br>The next day, the police swarmed the place once again for investigation. The father was kinda lunatic at the point of time, the mother was still too distraught to speak. On the walls of the parents room, something even more creepy awaits them. The words "This is for mommy" in chinese was scribbled on the wall in black. The police has classified this case as unnatural death, no foul play was suspected.<br><br>Till today, the unit is still vacant as neighbours would go around telling potential buyers about the history of the house. Rumour was that the night of the incident took place, it was the little boy 3 year old birthday (the one that was thrown down by his mother) anniversary. Many neighbours that night could hear strange errie sounds of a woman crying softly. Many years have past, till today, the present, many people could still hear a boy and a woman laughing in the middle of the night!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> DuH<br><br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/darkcreature/images/eyes26.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://209.150.105.49/imageofhorror/thumbs/02ghoul-t.gif"><br><br><span class="large"></span>I have never believed in the supernatural until 2 weeks ago. Ghost stories? Hah! I had heard too many to dismiss them all the those tales. Not a single chance for me to believe them at all! It was until 2 weeks ago......<br><br>It was around 10 at night and I just came back from work after having to work OT to meet a project deadline. I reached the void deck of my block in Clementi- you know those really old HDB pioneer batch where the walls of along the corridors are actually railings. 10 pm-not too early and late, surprisingly quiet-no regular sorry boys, no children at the usually happening playground. Ai yah! Who cares anyway? I just wanted to go home fast. It was usually quiet for a typical Friday night for my nieghbourhood.<br><br>While I was waiting for the lift, I heard a cat mewed. Turned around but saw nothing. "Ahh! Some stupid cats again!" I dismissed it and placed my concentration on the lift, giving no attention to what was to be the beginning of an encounter with the supernatural.<br><br>I stepped into the lift, hit "8" and "Close", just as the door was about to close fully, it opened! "F**K! Some kiasu aunty must have rushed for my lift and delayed precious seconds off my journey home." However when the door opened, no one came in. I did not care and hit the "Close" button again but once again the lift door opened. This time I was real pissed and stepped out of the lift to investigate. Turned and looked around, no aunties and no mischievous kids. "Must be some damn technical fault with the lift." By this time, the mewing of the cat was getting nearer and more distinct and yet I saw no strayed animals. I was beginning to feel a bit uneasy after seeing some of the burnt ashes and offerings of the dead along the walkways of my neighbourhood 20m away. I remembered it was the Chinese Hungry Ghost Festival. That reminder definitely was not good news then. I went back, hit "Close" again and AH! this time the life took off. PHEW!<br><br>Believe my luck or not the lights in the lift began to flicker as I approached the 5th storey! "No way man! I can't be so unlucky!" I felt the lift rocked a little. "Break down?" I pitied myself. But the gentle rocking contiued, I dismissed the thought that the cables are about to snapped......" This must be how those victims in the WTC buildings felt." However, I felt strange as the "gentle rocking" felt "different". I had experience some 5 lift break downs before and none of which felt this way. "How could it rock?" All of a sudden it occurred to me that some monster must be on top of the lift ceiling, stomping its gigantic feet on the lift. Then I heard the cat's mewing again. This time it seemed to come from the top. "How can that be? No way a cat can get inside there!". Then I heard some scratching along the sides of the lift. It sounded as if someone with real long nails is trying to pry open the walls of the lift and they seemed to be all around me!<br><br>By this time I was getting really frightened! It was too much a coincidence to be anything else but the very supernatural stuff I had always refused to believe! I closed my eyes and prayed to God though I have am a free thinker. But at that time I just prayed to a supreme being that nothing will happen to me. The scratching and rocking got more violent and all of a sudden it stopped! The lights stopped to flicker and what must be the longest 1 minute ride in a lift felt like eternity! The door of the lift opened and never it stopped at the 7th storey, I dashed out, raced up the stairs and went home.<br><br>My mum saw my pale while face and questioned me. It was only then I realized that it was the 14th of the Lunar Ghost Festival which is supposedly the most "siong" day of the Ghost Festival where "yin" energy was the strongest.<br><br>And you bet that from that day onwards I wore a talisman with me.<br><br>I realized that it does not take a visual encounter to believe in the supernatural.

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr. Lauersen, walking his dog on Sunday morning, suddenly saw a strange hovering object which was surrounding its lustrous disc-shaped body with white cloud like vapor. He photographed the object some 250 to 300m distant and 30 degrees above the horizon before it disappeared.<br><br><img src="http://www.visitations.com/ufos/UFO129.jpg"><br><br>In the morning of June 12, 1975, Eduard J. Meier was telepathically alerted and guided to another contact, again being advised that his camera would be permitted. This time he was led around on his moped for over an hour, finally stopping on a dirt service road beyond a field along the paved road from Theilingen to Rumlikon, Between Berg and Rumlikon. He was carrying a loaned 8mm movie camera and tripod as well as his 35mm camera and another 35mm belonging to a friend, because his own camera still had a jammed focus adjustment and a broken viewer. He set up the tripod and mounted the movie camera on it. He readied the 35mm cameras and laid them out in readiness. Then he spotted the spacecraft approaching in the haze in the far distance. After taking a picture of the object he noticed another identical ship higher in the sky, evidently to protect the one posing at low altitude.<br><br><img src="http://www.visitations.com/ufos/UFO158.jpg"><br><br>In Zurich Switzerland this remarkable photo was taken as a Boeing 747 Jumbo liner took off from Kloten Airport.<br><br><img src="http://www.visitations.com/ufos/UFO191.jpg"><br><br>As the bottoms of the low flying clouds began to turn gold at sundown, Sra. Montserrat Batllori, a housewife, seeing this beautiful sunset out her window, obtained a camera and went out to get a picture of it. She observed it for a few moments, and then on impulse snapped the shutter and got this photograph capturing three quite brilliantly luminous golden flying objects over the buildings in dark silhouette.<br><br><img src="http://www.visitations.com/ufos/UFO124.jpg"><br><br>Rancher C. E. Potts found one of his prize bulls alongside of the road one summer afternoon in late July. "We were passing down this road, and there was a thunderstorm a coming up behind us. We smelled this animal as we come by. We came back to check on it, and found it was mutilated. We examined it and its sexual organs was taken out. Its eyes were taken out, and its eyelashes were taken out. Well, there wasn't no predators. Not a predator bothered it since it was dead even. Couldn't have been killed by a predator cause all the surgical work was done by an expert. I really didn't think anything of it till it come home to me. Now I know it was bound to have been mutilated cause anyone who could see good could tell it was," Mr. Potts remembered.<br><br><img src="http://www.visitations.com/ufos/UFO41.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Original: Some of my minor case of ghost experience.<br><br>1. Last saturday, after watching 'the eye' with my friends in tampines mall late night movie. It was after 2AM, they took a cab home, and I was alone walking in the MRT path back to my house. When I came to the void deck of my flat, my hair suddenly stand up for no reason. Maybe I reflect on that show's lift event with ahpek. I went in the lift, and Pressed '6' then I lean back at the corner of the lift. The lift didn't stop at 6th floor... but at 10th floor. I didn't realised it, and went out of the lift. Then discovered I was on the wrong storey... so I pressed the button and waited for the lift to arrive again. I waited for a long time, around 5mins.. but the lift level indicator tells me the lift is still at 6th floor. And I waited for another 5 mins... and the lift arrived with a ahpek wearing sports wear. ( In tampines area, there are people jogging in the park after 2, normally with dogs. ) I was pissed off... The reason is that the lift didn't stop at basement at all, both lift was at the 6th floor all the time. How could that ahpek aboard the lift at 6th floor? Dun tell me ahpek also waited for the lift for a long time, then he climb staircase to the 6th floor and took the lift.</div>

I was living in the 6th floor, and how the hell this piece of ash fly into my toilet? Nah, I quickly finish the shower and Get out of the bath room. As normal, after midnight is Counter strike time.

I close the toilet door tight so that the cat can't get into the kitchen. and hopefully someone will get rid this cat in the morning. I scored around 60 frags and death 14 times. I had finished today's gaming, and went to SGforums to post some craps. It was very quiet.. and I finished all my craps at 2:50AM.. then I off my lights, ready to sleep.. but I can't sleep because I started to hear meow meow sound. Darn it!!

Maybe it was a rape case.. (lol) well, nevermind, I forget it... and carry on sleeping.. but around few minutes later.. I heard another SCREAM!. I felt that this SCREAM was filled with pain. after the 2nd time SCREAM, I was pissed off.. I wore my crucifix and carry on sleeping..<br><br>then I have a dream: (What I have recall)<br>"I heard the 3rd SCREAM from my dream. I wake up and open the door of my house... (I dream that I woken up, infact I was still in the dream). kind of confusing dream I had.. I saw a black face lady, her face was totally black, I can only see the white part of her eye and her yellowish teeth. then she SCREAM at me: "GUO LAI!!" in chinese: "Come over!!" *I tried to wake myself up from the dream, but I can't do it this time* after some chasing events in the dream, I finally woke up! I look at the time, It was still 3AM.. the time when I heard the 1st SCREAM.<br><br>AM I dreaming since I fall asleep?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On Friday, August 25, 2000, a sheep rancher shot and wounded a yellow-furred Chupacabra on the San Lorenzo farm near Tolapa, Leon statde, Nicaragua.<br><br>Three days later, on Monday, August 28, 2000, the skeletal remains of the creature were recovered by a watchman in a cave located about 100 meters (330 feet) from the ranch house.<br>The discovery ignited a firestorm of excitement in Nicaragua and throughout the hemisphere and especially in the UFO community.<br><br>The shooting came at the end of six weeks of sheep slayings in the Cordillera de Marisio hills of Leon state, around the small towns of Malpaisillo, Tolapa and San Claudio. An estimated 120 sheep were killed during the creature's rampage. All of the sheep had been drained of blood.<br>The Nicaraguan newspaper El Nuevo Diario cited "massive sheep deaths resulting from the apparent extraction of blood by an unknown predator equipped with sizable fangs capable of drilling into the victims' necks."<br>The Chupacabra was described as "bold, dog-like and capable of making rapid movements."<br><br>Ranch owner Jorge Luis Talavera said, "It came in search of another sheep on Friday, and I became aware of its presence in the paddocks. I fired several shots with my shotgun until it lost itself in the darkness."<br>"On Monday morning (August 2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">, the presence of circling vultures heralded the existence of a dead animal in the farm's vicinity, which aroused the curiosity of watchman Jairo Garcia."<br>Garcia headed towards "the spot where the carrion birds circled and managed to reach a cave-like structure located 100 meters from the house. Then he found the animal his employer had shot two nights earlier and was probably responsible for the deaths of so many sheep."<br><br>"After having viewed the Chupacabra, some locals, like Milan Rojas, claim that it is neither a dog nor a wolf, but rather the strange product of a number of dog types."  "a hybrid "<br>"'I am familiar with all types of wild animal and this one seems strange to me, given its fur hair, thin and tall, which differs greatly from a wolf, which is quite hairy,' he remarked."<br>Nicaraguan biologist Giocconda Chavez examined the skeletal remains and "noted that the animal had extremely high nails located above its claws which probably aided it in attacking its victims, along with an oversized set of fangs. She further noted that the eye-sockets were somewhat large in comparison with its head, making note as did other witnesses to the site, of several protuberances on the upper vertebrae 'shaped like a crocodile's crest.'"<br><br>What Garcia "found most startling was the lack of bodily hair and very small ears, although the animal had been reduced to a skeleton after the vultures feasted upon it, it is shaped like a long, yellow-coloured dog, given the pigmentation of the remaining fur that was found on the tail."<br><br>Since the middle of July 2000, the Chupacabra had been raiding small sheep farms sponsored by the Xochitl Acatl Women's Centre, a charitable non- profit group. The centre promotes sheep farming as a means of helping low-income people of the region raise their standard of living.<br>"In San Claudio, 25 kilometres (15 miles) from Malpaisillo, the Chupacabra killed two of four sheep belonging to Sra. Lydia Carrera, one of the supporters of the Xochitl Acatl Women's Centre."<br><br>"I was concerned because I own goats and cows and, at any given second, the Chupacabra would turn up and kill my little animals. I hope that it's the last and only one of its kind,' said Maria Isable Lopez of nearby Las Lunas."<br><br>"'We had to kill it. In fifteen days, it sucked 25 sheep'" at San Lorenzo farm, "'and my neighbour lost 35 sheep in ten days. It was an average of five sheep or goats every night,' Talavera explained."<br><br>Talavera also stated that there might be more Chupacabras in the cordillera, at least three more-- one with white or silver fur and two with black fur.<br>Other witnesses in Malpaisillo said the dead Chupacabra had "yellow hair on a short tail, large eye sockets, skin like that of a bat, large claws and fangs," and seven "crest-like" vertebrae on its spine<br>(Editor's Comment: Yellow fur, eh? It sounds like the El Lobizon creature seen in Argentina last June. "'Wolf man' terrorizes town in northern Argentina was the headline"<br><br>The remains were taken to the forensic laboratory at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua-Leon in the city of Leon, located 100 kilometres (60 miles) southwest of Malpaisillo.<br>According to the newspaper La Prensa de Nicaragua, the Chupacabra remains were studied by a team led by Dr. Pedrarias Davila.<br><br>"'We cannot say when the results will be ready, given that some parts are missing. Therefore we will be forced to take some time if it becomes necessary to send DNA samples abroad,' said Dr. Pedrarias Davila."<br>"The skeleton of the alleged Chupacabra was taken to the medical campus at UNAM in Leon in order to determine what species it belongs to,'" Dr. Davila added.<br><br>"'On the record sheet was noted the characteristics of the skeletal system, the number of ribs and vertebrae, nails, state of decomposition, among others, for inclusion into the database,' he explained."<br>Two days later, an official at UNAM-Leon made a surprising statement.<br>"'There is an initial impression that it isn't an unknown animal but merely a dog. Further analysis is still required to reach a final conclusion,' said Edmundo Torres, vice- chancellor for research at UNAM-Leon."<br><br>(Editor's Comment: If it's just a dog, then why do they need "further research?" Here it comes--the Virginia- style cover-up of this phenomenal event.)<br><br>The killing of the Chupacabra has caused a stir in Nicaragua's religious communities, as well.<br><br>"'It's a warning sign, like a traffic light' that's on yellow but could turn red--a sign for men and women to return to God because we've forgotten about him,' stated" Dr. Francisco Ortiz, director of CEPAS (Nicaragua's Pentecostal Assembly) "Quoting from the Book of Daniel which states that in the Last Days there will be phenomena that will cause astonishment among men."<br><br>"In the meantime," Monsignor Juan Bosco Maria Vivas Robelo, the Roman Catholic bishop of Leon, "does not believe that it (the creature) is the result of genetic engineering, admitting his scant knowledge on the subject of the Chupacabra."<br><br>"''I haven't studied the matter in depth since I haven't given it much credibility, but if it is indeed a strange creature, as they say, then the Church may be prompted to take action...but not just yet.'"<br><br>This is a Chupa.<br><br><img src="http://www.cyberway.com.sg/~orca/chupacabra.gif"></div>
