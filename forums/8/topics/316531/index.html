              <p>ya mah, my district here got rich chinese mynmars living and also foreign mynmar workers also having party yesterday at their boss house, i asked them about the cyclone, and they said, hell, dun bother, what can you do, u give money, the govt take and keep, you give foods, they get angry and try to delay your foods, they told me the govt also intend to use the contributed foods to sell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not i am inhuman, but seeing them drinking and partying, i also give up. I mean they should be the one going around asking for contribution, but instead it is the singapore govt, citizen, salvation army etc etc doing it. Yes, for humanity i also contributed money, but the mynamars laughed at me and call me stupid, better to give them then give the govt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So how??</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>u already call shit head junta, what you expect, if my contribution goes into the pocket of the juntas, i think i am in worst position than helping the victims.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The situation here is not something i contributed cos i am humane and do my part just to feel better over it. The situation call for proper legal channel of contribution that can reach the victims directly, whereby your $100, on reaching there will be $100 and not 5 cents. Or your cans of sardine being holdback and put in warehouse, sealed and be under the juntas supermarket list.</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Singaporeans continue to offer support for cyclone victims</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: The scale of the tragedy in Myanmar has moved many
              Singaporeans to dig deep into their pockets, and their contributions
              have enabled the Singapore Red Cross, Mercy Relief and The Salvation
              Army to raise almost S$395,000 so far.</p>
              <p>According to the Singapore Red Cross, it has raised nearly
              S$220,000, while Mercy Relief and The Salvation Army said they have
              collected about S$125,000 and almost S$50,000 respectively.</p>
              <p>Some
              150 students at the Singapore Polytechnic were collecting funds on
              their campus for the victims of Cyclone Nargis on Friday. All the
              proceeds are going to the Singapore Red Cross.</p>
              <p>Christie Iee Phyoe
              Hiet, a Singapore Polytechnic student, said: "I thought I should do
              something for the country. My aunty and my uncles are all staying
              there, so I just want to do my part."</p>
              <p>Other fundraising efforts
              include online publicity and even a click—through payment facility for
              the polytechnic’s staff that will deduct the amount that they wish to
              donate from their salaries.</p>
              <p>Over at the Singapore Soka Association, volunteers have been busy packing relief supplies for the cyclone victims in Myanmar.</p>
              <p>Ong
              Bon Chai, chairman of the Singapore Soka Association, said: "When we
              got news that Mercy Relief needed help, we immediately responded by
              rallying all the volunteers to come down. As long as help is needed, we
              will continue to rally the volunteers."</p>
              <p>A S$60,000 consignment
              has been put together — based on the needs of the ground — by Mercy
              Relief and the Singapore Soka Association.</p>
              <p>Abdullah Tarmugi,
              Speaker of Parliament and a Mercy Relief adviser, said: "(We are
              sending) things like tents, water—treatment tablets, cooking utensils
              and even sanitary napkins because we feel these are the things that are
              needed for hygiene (purposes)."</p>
              <p>This is the first batch of relief
              supplies that the two organisations are sending to Myanmar’s Ministry
              of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement, and they are hoping to send
              more aid packages by the end of next week. — CNA/so</p>
