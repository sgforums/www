By being in a position of power u can educated and hopefully change the mindset.To be a person of power. U will fight against gargantuan corporations trying to stop ur very way. Education and history is the only way to educate and gear the next generaion to have similiar thinkings.<br><br>Using extremism will not further your cause. But to date , capitalism may be one of the ways to ensure development to all , and the monetary system to measure the success or failure of another. Maybe in the future when all become equal and through strife and war will they realise and abolish the monetary system and work for a common goal towards the better of mankind.<br><br>In the future , countries will unite to form superpowers.Borders will expand. Superpowers will cause so much death and destruction that maybe perhaps they will all wake up to thier ideas and unite into 1 earth 1 nation.

Unless it is proven that 100% of the prostitutes are victims of human trafficking and still condoned by the government then please.. by all means.
