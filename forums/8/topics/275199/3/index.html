I do not say u are wrong , but unfortunately we live in a world where the monetory system is pretty plays a universal role in our daily lives and have been for centuries.unltil u abolish that , and follow the trekkie way of no-monetary system and world peace , it's not gonna happen.<br><br>We all have pride , but it depends how strongly u hold on to your pride. Your pride to resist all forms of help in the face of death will surely mean stupidity if u do no value ur own life over pride. No matter how u look at it , there will be the good and the bad. So in the end , the most rich , power can still earn the respect when he uses his richness , power for good , accompanied by a woman who loves him not for his money but you and to also help those in need through you.<br><br>In the end u will talk about how all these things come down to one thing. The morality of the persons... to be either selfless or selfish. Like all great conquerers too , they seek not money but for thier own. Thier own kind. Tell me to date , which war was not fought for the countries own selfishness. But is killing another person justifiable ? Self defence ? for the greater good ?<br><br>Did hitler not see his own anglo-saxon peaople as the Master race ? His ideals may be respectable but in the end he just lost it. Lost the plot. Hitler may have rallied his people under his banner , but for what ? In the end its still for his own people over the deaths of millions.His country has no room for error , unfortunately , he made an error. His pride accompanied by drugs further deluded himself from the rest of his generals.<br><br></div>
