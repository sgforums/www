I do not say u are wrong , but unfortunately we live in a world where the monetory system is pretty plays a universal role in our daily lives and have been for centuries.unltil u abolish that , and follow the trekkie way of no-monetary system and world peace , it's not gonna happen.<br><br>We all have pride , but it depends how strongly u hold on to your pride.<span style="color: red;"> Your pride to resist all forms of help in the face of death will surely mean stupidity if u do no value ur own life over pride</span>. No matter how u look at it , there will be the good and the bad. So in the end , the most rich , power can still earn the respect when he uses his richness , power for good , accompanied by a woman who loves him not for his money but you and to also help those in need through you.<br><br>In the end u will talk about how all these things come down to one thing. The morality of the persons... to be either selfless or selfish. Like all great conquerers too , they seek not money but for thier own. Thier own kind. Tell me to date , which war was not fought for the countries own selfishness. But is killing another person justifiable ? Self defence ? for the greater good ?<br><br>Did hitler not see his own anglo-saxon peaople as the Master race ? His ideals may be respectable but in the end he just lost it. Lost the plot. Hitler may have rallied his people under his banner , but for what ? In the end its still for his own people over the deaths of millions.His country has no room for error , unfortunately , he made an error. His pride accompanied by drugs further deluded himself from the rest of his generals.<br><br></div></blockquote>While fighting for the bigger picture,now or 50 years later,what does it matter?<br>we all die anyway so why sell one's pride just to keep death waiting?<br><br>If the killing of traids,yakuza,silicia mafia for a better place for every individual to experience happiness is needed,then yes,i'm prepared to do so.<br>Infact,i'm prepared and eager for it.<br><br>I do not want to depend on money to change the world because when one day the system is no longer able to keep evil human nature at bay,the downfall of society will begin.<br>Because the only way a world can be perfect is to eradicate impure human standards with zealots holding similar idealogy.<br>The day a utopia materialise is the day where even the good and evil fears the blade that torment the both extreme.<br>Hence,from that day onwards,there will no longer be an extreme ends of right and left.</div>
