            <div class='col-md body'>but, before things get out of hand with all the prostitute comments, hear me out that only God, or whichever religion you subscribe to, is responsible for everything.<br><br>Quoting "Mystery Method"<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Put simply, <strong>nature has not designed you for the world in which you live</strong>.<br><br>Certainly, our physical environment has changed relatively little over the past one hundred thousand years or so. Then, as now, the sky was blue, trees were green, sometimes the sun shone, sometimes the clouds rained. It is our social environment that has changed dramaticaly. Namely we live in the midst of an unprecedented population explosion fueled by innovations in technology and medical science. As a result never in Earth's history have so many similarly designed human machines existed at any one time.<br><br>...<br><br><strong>All humans possess a built in motivation to stay away from people with low or negative social value</strong>. In contrast, we may vastly improve our chances for survival and replication if we proactively seek out and form partnerships, both sexual and nonsexual, with those who offer us a high S-and-R value. These people would include the <strong>rich friend </strong>who loaned you money when you were broke, the socially connected acquaintance who got you into the party, the buddy who protected you from that bully, the physically fit woman who had sex with you, even the mentor who taught you how to pick her up. All are said to have high social value, and we are <strong>hardwired to seek alignment with them</strong>.<br><br>...<br><br>When a woman agrees to align with you sexually, she is agreeing to <strong>trade her replication value for your value</strong>. Such fair arrangements may last many years.</span><br><br>to be truthful, this book has been flamed in a magazine (cant remember, but i read it during my army days, a few months ago). however, people still flame others for saying gals are merely 'hos that want money too. and people still flame others when they say girls want bad guys. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>who flamed the book? if i recall correctly, it was a woman. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>in the words of a hot chick who posts videos on youTube...<br><br>"Good guys are s*ckers"<br><br>so, why dun yall pray to whichever God you believe in and say a BIG "THANK YOU"?<br><br>for the atheists... i dunno wat u r gonna do, so its really up to u.</div>

Last when I travel to America, no white told me off or gave me a racist remark. I got it from my own color - An Asia Made a Very Caustic remark that I was definitely from some back waters and never been shopping. She made it a couple of times and made sure I heard it. Then I got it Again from an Asian manning Burger King counter. The woman utterly was impatient and treated the asian like dirt. I get super service from Indians, Whites, Hispanics, and every other race except yellow skin asia who act more white than whites. They made me seriously dispise them for they had forgotten their own color to do such a thing. They don't even respect their own color and fellow people.
