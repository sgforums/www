              <p>I got. you need the camalla to boost your ego right just like the kids with DSLR <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>photo1: why you need ISO1600 when with Av you already go a sutter speed of shutter speed of 1/16000 sec? Was it you don;t have confident of your 400D enty level? print this one in large size all the noise come out already</p>
              <p>photo1: this one show use a smaller aperture to focus more of the rows of skull but you can only squeeze f/5 as big as possible because no tripod and you pushed ISO 1600 all the way already <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>photo3: at least this is setting makes sense, comparing this on from the rest i tthink you humpthump bolla and really still don;t know what is the desired setting to use after almost 2 yrs since photos taken.</p>
              <p>photo4: this one can use a few stops higher in ISO but its fine to me. its the composition that makes me laff. why you never walk a few steps to the left or right and shoot several minutes laterwhen the sun is higher up in the sky instead of still hiding at the underside of the statue? why trying to shoot the sun upskirting statue issit?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>photo5: this one should increase ISO but you kept at 200. anyway since you intended the phtoo to show more black backdrop then the setting is fine lah. ev-1 step somemore. someone use your cammal or you forget to check ev setting issit? i remember one photo i toook back in 1994 taiwan military traingin that one similar to this when i was a no no brainer. film cammalla someone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>photo6: this one bobiah aperture shouls put smaller to focus more of the scene but your speed at 1/25 already. thing is iso800 why don;t increase to 1600? you can get maybe one or two stops dfaster speed. online posting lah full size this frame sure blurr 1</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>photo7: finally one that makes sense but anyone standing at your side with just a point a shoot can take a photo like that also. your moderate wide 18mm focal length at this angle looks like taken from a 35mm PNS <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all the sky blues nothing special. look at the skyif its blue and you take it with a dslr the results will be blue. so gendagoon i got a lot to comment right? happy? all your photos anyone with a dslr can take lah, and i can tell you from my review of so many photos online yours are travel snap shots lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Yes, yes, I know all about your problem already.  You're just so wounded by your lack of knowledge from the last time (remember calling a 5D a "professional camera"? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">) that you have a pathological need to come back after all these months to try to claw back some credibility. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Besides, you still haven't gotten over the fact that I can afford all these toys and you can't, have you? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Never mind - all is forgiven.  Looks like you've done some hard work trying to build up your pitiful level of knowledge, so I'll be kind and address your misconceptions.</p>

              <p>Oh me, oh my.  ISO 1600 automatically means noise?  The fact that you're suggesting that there will be noise in this picture shows how little you understand noise.  Better go back and read some more. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Yup, you read the settings right, but your assumption that I went with f/5 because I had no tripod shows that you have no understanding of aperture or composition.</p>

              <p>It's not so much your lack of photohgraphic knowledge as your leack of geographic knowledge that sticks out here.  That was sunset, not sunrise.  Again, never mind.  I'm already aware of how little you know, and now you've also shown how little you've travelled, so you're once again generously forgiven.</p>

              <p>Again you don't understand noise.  With the 400D, I could possibly have gone up to ISO400 in this shot before noise became a problem, but since I could rest the camera on top of a wall, I chose not to do so.</p>
              <p>Credit where credits's due, though.  I was annoyed when I reviewed the photos later and realised that I'd left the camera down a stop.  Whoops. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"></p>

              <p>Again, did I say they were anything special?  Anyone with a polariser (didn't pick that up because the only thing you can do is read EXIF data, right?) can get that shade of blue, so why are you making a big deal of it when I'm not?</p>
              <p>Yes, yes, you have a lot to say, but apart from the -1EV point, it's not just meaningless rubbish, it's boring.  I fully acknowledge that I'm still in the process of learning about photography, and the pros who I choose to invite feedback from (yes, the ones who are happy to use a 5D without calling it a "professional camera" <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">) provide useful feedback.  While your effort is touching, it lacks any value whatsoever, so I've wasted as much time as I'm going to by humouring your laughable efforts at photo critique.</p>
              <p>And of course they're travel snapshots.  Did you see me at any point claiming they were otherwise?  Now, it was fun and all dealing with your distraction, let's get back to the point in this thread, said point being that in this wide variety of places, nobody makes any noise about DSLRs, so the TS is KPKBing about a whole lot of nothing.</p>

              <p>ay don't come here show off lah. mayb those green green one will be impressed. but i can tell you your such photos are beginner level travel voyeur photos. come here show okay lah. but only here only. i kpkb because to my eye your snapshots are only so so. if you cannot take my critism and improve you can go on posting and i will go on hiam your snapshots. you need some friends to help say your photos good. seriously if not you tonite cannot slp <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>serioulsy since my last advice i hope you really learn. or see why and how instead of just blindly shoot. to day is lesson two from me. i bet your friends and buddies never giv you hard hard such advice, if not i see your mentors must be sama larggi larggi ones <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lesson three: you don;t need a polarizer to bring out the contrasty blue lah. how i do it i won;t tell. if not all the polarizer glass out of business <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>what i mentioned were in fact your technical difficulties. your photos paris eifel tower and venice landscapr shot could have been better with an ultra wide angle glass, museum internal better when leeser or no one is around, your skulls photo better if you had chot neare and thro the rest of the backdrop out of focus, composition, timing and framing improvments on the liberty statue, and the night shot rabah most o fthe sky already too dark no more details you should have shot a hour or two after sun down but when there are still light, and shot it outdoors instead of begind hotel room. that was lesson four <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i pro one, give technical advices, not like some who only say snapshotsnapshot but never give advice because ethyr ownphoto also like that and they actually also like that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and also 50D is classified under semi-professional grade lah. probably aim for the intermediate users. but there are also professionals using this as main or backup cam. also someprofessinal put others to shame by using really using entry level. but most professionals know never to use compact cams with tiny winnie sensor lah. because they know blow up the images 100% CMI <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> just in case you still champian the tinny winny small sensor as more superior over apsc or full frame i hope you start to wake up or just use a compact for any assignments that require at least A3 printouts and see for yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i am happy that you use so 'pro' equipment but only take take such photos. now in my opinion i think i can do far more over you with equipment of higher grade than yours. keep posting <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not only that you like to stereotype the fact that having 'pro;' equipment makes your ego the better, you also stereotype the phrase 'pro' like its so goldy.</p>
              <p>i tell you straight lah. professional photographer is anyone who makes a living out of it. however the professional photographer can be a real artist or just some goons bluffing their way through. hey if you can pull off paid assignments with a PNS and go around selling the idea that small sensor like small pen** is better than a bigger sensor like bigger pen** by all means go ahead. no teacher will be there to mark you fail <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>like i wrote the term 'prfessional' refers to someone who makes a living, gets their main income from taking photos. really those professionals working for years really don't bother if its just work to them. but the others goon ones just wants to show off. you will notice a alarming incrase number iof such people making believe that they are professionals and art fucks because know taking and making a photo is so easy unlike the old days when you need weeked to get photos processed or have to spend a lot ofmoney to have your old dark room . noe dark room is phtoshop. and just like an iodiot gendakoon who stillneed hardware to get contrast sky ccolors one can do it easily in post processing. trust me many of the DSLR or any cam user dont' really kow what they are doing just go around show off with his gear only. see his photos and my cruitics, so many problems with his shots and he can only come here post show off only</p>

              <p>This shot is the best of the worst. the land of the rising sun upskirting a lady who is at liberty. A classic example of a noob professional with gears wannbe photographr whopdo not understand that sunrise and sunset landscape shots the best require timing, patience, waiting, angle, experiment and some artistic sense. this is a typical go there - take out cam- point and shoot (with a DSLR boosting his ego that it will produce gb etter peektures). its reallly one shot one kill enough already pack up and go. this type of shot anyone can take and there are alot in th internet, and peoiples computer hard disks.</p>

              <p><br>your another one i hurt in the ass? oh and i know a lot about you also. don;t pretend to be saint here okay. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i apologize if i hurt you too. are you another one of those . . you know what i mean . pain in my arse? are you one of those 'true landscape' photographer? go internet and buy books, lots of tips to help you get started on taking proper photos and landscapes. because if your s are those so common and all over the internet then you still show off somemore then its one of those howlian ego threads to me really.</p>
              <p>whao kao photography as an expression of what yousee .. hmm .. chiem chiem siah.</p>
              <p>don;t bull this in front of me lah. why so many people never express themselves in tehn film days? becasue it cost a lot. well some people are rich actually but the film days to 'appreciate an expression of pneself' one needs time, to develop film and the learning curve thus steeper. rich these people are but they realise the y are not invicible. no amount of money can buy time. but now the digital age the time factor and learning curve thus is eliminateed, suppose so. but the learning curve, twisted to some guys with cams is still there. stereotype and a boost dopsgae of ego from prises of friends and forum pals pus h them to the limit o no return, anf like a taste of honey flock the bees so its a pth of no return, scorn all the way and hell to those who dares say the photos are so good. after all the sweet talk and prises from people my photos are already so 'good'. i have some too far to be insulted and judged by others who says my photos not good!</p>
              <p>to keep this thread useful and also to hurt the ego of thos guys with cams i decided to link some good phtoos you can take with DSLR, this column will be updated time to time so keep checking out thie thread</p>
