This is the politician's issue of the hour. They, and scientists involved both have an agenda; your votes and a salary respectively.<br><br>Looking at recorded history, there are many instances where global temperature has risn for no apparent reason. Yet we don't hear the romans (for eg) complaiing of global warming. </div></blockquote>Like many this is how u and many have been molded by this economic world with the word  "MONEY" strongly ingrained. And MONEY is indeed in the minds of many including the scientist and politicians. But don't u put ur life in front of money? Climate change is not just about money, it about loss of lives, a place to live in and much more and it's going to be happening to me, you, your loved ones and many others.<br><br>Many scientist throughout the world has already come to this conclusion. Scientist are mostly extremely smart ppl and agenda of money comes little to their mind. Mingle with scientist and u know that some scientists look little on money when there is more than what usually they can use. Work up the ladder and u will know why there are more and more cases of ppl who retire a lucrative managerial and directorial posts to become kindergarden teachers, social workers, animal protectionists, etc. Scientist value a lot of their work and findings.<br><br>Don't discredit that they are scientist. The issue of whether the recent years of climate change is a natural cycle of earth and interaction with the sun have been considered. The current answer is clearly no.<br><br>Frankly, the world is doomed to brave the coming era of global climate change. Our economic world has been too successful in ingraining the importance of wealth. China, India, Indonesia, Brazil are unlikely to do anything and Indonesia actually is suggesting that the richer nations pay them to do sth. It will take Mother Earth to hit stronger before some nations wake up.<br><br>Go visit our neighbour flood victims and see how worried they are about rebuilding their homes and whether at all they should because the flood is likely to come back again.<br><br>If you also think Singapore is safe? Think again. We are in a geographical safe region but climate change may change that. Flood can hit us when rain gets heavier and sea level rise, drought can hit us and fresh water supply can become a big problem, food can become extremely pricy when global climate affects farming seriously, more new virus will surface which can be deadly to man. What does all these mean?<br><br>While we painstakingly try hard to get lots of money and materialistic gains to live easier at the expense of our environment, we, on the contrary, will end up suffering more in a harsher world that will getting angrier and angrier.</div>
