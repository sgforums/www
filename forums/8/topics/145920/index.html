            <div class='col-md body'>be filial to ur parents, ur lao peh lao bu. coz becoz of them u r in this world.<br><br>&gt;&gt; ONE EYE MOM<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     My mom only had one eye.  I hated her... she was such an<br>&gt;&gt;     embarrassment. My mom ran a small shop at a flea market.<br>&gt;&gt;     She collected little weeds and such to sell...anything<br>&gt;&gt;     for the money we needed she was such an embarrassment.<br>&gt;&gt;     There was this one day during elementary school.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     I remember that it was field day, and my mom came.  I was so<br>&gt;&gt;     embarrassed. How could she do this to me? I threw her a<br>&gt;&gt;     hateful look and ran out.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     The next day at school..."Your mom only has one eye?!" and they<br>&gt;&gt;     taunted me.  I wished that my mom would just disappear from this<br>&gt;&gt; world<br>&gt;&gt;    so I said to my mom, "Mom, why don't you have the other eye?! If<br>&gt;&gt; you're<br>&gt;&gt;    only<br>&gt;&gt;    going to make me a laughingstock, why don't you<br>&gt;&gt;     just die?!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     My mom did not respond.  I guess I felt a little bad, but at the<br>&gt;&gt; same<br>&gt;&gt;    time, it felt good to think that I had said what<br>&gt;&gt;     I'd wanted to say all this time..<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     Maybe it was because my mom hadn't punished me, but I didn't<br>&gt;&gt; think that<br>&gt;&gt;    I had hurt her feelings very badly.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     That night...<br>&gt;&gt;     I woke up, and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. My<br>&gt;&gt; mom was<br>&gt;&gt;    crying there, so quietly, as if she was afraid that she might wake<br><br>&gt;&gt; me.<br>&gt;&gt; I<br>&gt;&gt;    took a look at her, and then turned away.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     Because of the thing I had said to her earlier, there was<br>&gt;&gt;     something pinching at me in the corner of my heart. Even so, I<br>&gt;&gt; hated<br>&gt;&gt;    my<br>&gt;&gt;     mother who was crying out of her one eye. So I told myself that<br>&gt;&gt;     I would grow up and become successful, because I hated my<br>&gt;&gt;     one-eyed mom and our desperate poverty.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     Then I studied really hard. I left my mother and came to Seoul<br>&gt;&gt; and<br>&gt;&gt;    studied, and got accepted in the Seoul University with all the<br>&gt;&gt;     confidence I had.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own.<br>&gt;&gt; Then I had kids,<br>&gt;&gt; too.<br>&gt;&gt;    Now I'm living happily as a successful man. I like it here<br>&gt;&gt;    because<br>&gt;&gt;     it's a place that doesn't remind me of my mom.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     This happiness was getting bigger and bigger, when someone<br>&gt;&gt;     unexpected came to see me "What?! Who's this?!"<br>&gt;&gt;     ...It was my mother...Still with her one eye.<br>&gt;&gt; It felt as if the<br>&gt;&gt; whole<br>&gt;&gt;    sky was falling apart on me.  My little girl ran away, scared of<br>&gt;&gt;    my<br>&gt;&gt;     mom's eye.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     And i asked her, "Who are you?!. I don't know you!!!" as if<br>&gt;&gt; trying to<br>&gt;&gt;    make that real. I screamed at her "How dare you come to my house<br>&gt;&gt;    and<br>&gt;&gt;     scare my daughter! GET OUT OF HERE! NOW!!!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     And to this, my mother quietly answered,"oh, I'm so sorry. I may<br>&gt;&gt; have<br>&gt;&gt;    gotten the wrong address," and she disappeared.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     Thank good ness... she doesn't recognize me.  I was quite<br>&gt;&gt;     relieved.  I told myself that I wasn't going to care, or think<br>&gt;&gt; about<br>&gt;&gt;    this<br>&gt;&gt;     for<br>&gt;&gt;     the rest of my life.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     Then a wave of relief came upon me...one day, a letter regarding<br>&gt;&gt; a<br>&gt;&gt;    school reunion came to my house. I lied to my wife saying that I<br>&gt;&gt; was going<br>&gt;&gt;    on a business trip.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     After the reunion, I went down to the old shack, that I used to<br>&gt;&gt;     call a house...just out of curiosity there, I found my mother<br>&gt;&gt; fallen<br>&gt;&gt;    on<br>&gt;&gt;     the cold ground.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     But I did not shed a single tear.  She had a piece of paper in<br>&gt;&gt; her<br>&gt;&gt;    hand.... it was a letter to me.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     She wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;     My son...<br>&gt;&gt;     I think my life has been long enough now. And..<br>&gt;&gt; I won't visit<br>&gt;&gt;     Seoul anymore... but would it be too much to ask if I wanted you<br>&gt;&gt; to<br>&gt;&gt;    come<br>&gt;&gt;     visit me once in a while?<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     I miss you so much. And I was so glad when I heard you were<br>&gt;&gt; coming for<br>&gt;&gt;    the reunion.  But I decided not to go to the school.... For you...<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     I'm sorry that i only have one eye, and I was an embarrassment<br>&gt;&gt; for you.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;     You see, when you were very little, you got into an accident, and<br><br>&gt;&gt; lost<br>&gt;&gt;    your eye. As a mother, I couldn't stand watching you having to<br>&gt;&gt; grow up with<br>&gt;&gt;    only one eye... so I gave you mine...I was so proud of my<br>&gt;&gt;    son<br>&gt;&gt;     that was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that<br>&gt;&gt; eye.<br>&gt;&gt; I<br>&gt;&gt;    was never upset at you for anything you did. The couple times that<br><br>&gt;&gt; you<br>&gt;&gt;     were angry with me. I thought to myself, 'it's because he loves<br>&gt;&gt; me.'<br>&gt;&gt;    I<br>&gt;&gt;     miss the times when you were still young around me.  I miss you<br>&gt;&gt; so much.<br>&gt;&gt;     I love you.  You mean the world to me<br></div>
