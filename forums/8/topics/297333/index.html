            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">This is for a bunch of folks scattered among us. If you have a conscience, you'll know if you're one one of them after reading this.</span><br><br>I feel nothing but pity and scorn towards the people who exhibit such hostile attitudes towards foreigners, those who are quick to scream Â‘Pinkerton Syndrome!Â’ or Â‘SPG!Â’, and individuals who have nothing good to say about folks from abroad Â– they do not realise how they are making their own flaws obvious in the most unflattering way. Let me address these fellars:<br><br>To those who have said nothing good about your encounters with white folks - you probably have a foul aura that attracts louts to your presence, which must explain why you seem to run exclusively into louts. If it sounds unbelievable, maybe you make them seem like louts because you needed an excuse to make yourselves feel better by putting down other people. Or perhaps you have never met any nice Caucasians outside of your miserable social and internet circles. How pathetic if tabloid articles and one-sided accounts form the basis of your judgment. ItÂ’s worse if you have actually met them, but dared not say similarly curt remarks during your encounters. ItÂ’s even worse if you lust after white people and idolise them in the sporting world, and yet speak ill of their brethren in general at the same time. Hypocrites!<br><br>By some of your comments about interracial dating, which are quick to dismiss girls dating white guys as SPGs, you deny that people have the right to make choices which are morally sound. If you want to stick to your own race, go ahead. Why should you demand that other people stick to theirs? Are you jealous and sceptical when mixed couples succeed where you have had less luck by opening up their options? If they have ulterior motives behind interracial dating, they bear the consequences of their actions, not you. Rather than whine when things donÂ’t go your way, use the time to improve yourself Â– but alas, youÂ’d rather do what makes you feel better about your sorry selves sooner.<br><br>You show how cheap you are if you bandy about terms like Â‘angmohÂ’, Â‘banglaÂ’ or Â‘PRCÂ’ just to attract peopleÂ’s attention or stir up their emotions. When you bring up tired stereotypes, it only shows up your ignorance and narrow-mindedness. I have nothing but distaste for people who are quick to question if the Thai, Japanese or Korean women discussed in these forums are surgically altered or involved in pornography. I hold nothing but disdain for people who are quick to assign the blame to Chinese or South Asian nationals when something bad happens in the news or to you, based on their nationality and not the situation. Heck, a few of you even assumed the free reign to say malicious things about other countries you knew sod-all about because of a spat over a game. How childish can you get? It makes you worse than the people who think Singapore is in China or canÂ’t resist mentioning long hair and chewing gum. YouÂ’re all of one and the same kind and sensible people either get tired of dealing with you or give up doing so.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(Cont'd below)</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By all means take the piss out of other people without ill will; by all means criticise behaviour and attitudes that are uncalled for, but stick to the offending individual without bringing race and stereotypes into the issue. Locals are no less capable of embarrassing the rest of us overseas. To besmirch entire groups which includes the people who write your favourite books and columns, run and sing at the pubs and restaurants, teach and study alongside you in school and in general make an honest living here is just despicable. What did they do to deserve this flak?<br><br>When you assume that only locals form your audience, you forget that people of various nationalities and ethnicities (pure and mixed) view these forums. When you think no one will bother to stand up for them, you forget that there are SÂ’poreans who give a damn because someone they know does not deserve your condemnation. When you bring up one-sided accounts of events and encounters in other countries and with foreigners, you forget too that some Singaporeans, including yourselves, are just as capable of being mean to people of other backgrounds, people who have made alternative choices and even the handicapped. You only make everyone else look awful, like all bad eggs do.<br><br>As you can see, your words and actions say nothing good about you. You wee lot are a discredit not just to your community but to the human race as a whole. You are no better than the twerps who offended you, if any, and the auto-racists who donÂ’t deserve any credit themselves. I want to believe that most people arenÂ’t like you but youÂ’re always vocal with your foul comments and insinuations. You wonÂ’t redeem yourselves until you open your minds and start treating other people objectively.<br><br>If you feel slighted, you should have seen it coming. You should never dare dish out what youÂ’re not prepared to receive. And in the internet, free speech means that if you have the right to show your stupidity, I too have the right to shoot you down.<br><br>Merry Christmas and Happy Go-To-Hell.</div>
