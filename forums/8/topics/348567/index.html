              <p><br>Muslims believe in gaining merits in order to go to Heaven and be with Him. Like many religions, Islam too has restriction to the followers. All followers of Islam are deemed fit to go to Heaven because God loves everyone and doesnt want to deprive anyone from Heaven and that is why, before we transcend life unto Heavens and the next world, we have to gain merits like praying, loving our parents, help the needy and alot of things. There are 5 fundamentals to Islam (Ø£Ø±ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù…) aka 5 pillars of Islam by which Muslim have to closely abide.</p>
              <p>1. Testimony of Faith<br>2. Prayer<br>3. Giving annual alms to the needy.|<br>4. Fasting during Ramadhan.<br>5. Pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
              <p>Alcohol has always been forbidden and frowned upon in Islam because anything that causes Man to be intoxicated and "being not himself" will bring detriment to himself and others.</p>

              <p><br>Muslims believe in gaining merits in order to go to Heaven and be with Him. Like many religions, Islam too has restriction to the followers. All followers of Islam are deemed fit to go to Heaven because God loves everyone and doesnt want to deprive anyone from Heaven and that is why, before we transcend life unto Heavens and the next world, we have to gain merits like praying, loving our parents, help the needy and alot of things. There are 5 fundamentals to Islam (Ø£Ø±ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø§Ù„Ø¥Ø³Ù„Ø§Ù…) aka 5 pillars of Islam by which Muslim have to closely abide.</p>
              <p>1. Testimony of Faith<br>2. Prayer<br>3. Giving annual alms to the needy.|<br>4. Fasting during Ramadhan.<br>5. Pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
              <p>Alcohol has always been forbidden and frowned upon in Islam because anything that causes Man to be intoxicated and "being not himself" will bring detriment to himself and others.</p>

              <p>Jews dont eat pork too, and i believe most religion disapprove of liqour and gambling. As for the non-believers final ending, it depends which is one is right in the end. Thats why religion is called a faith, you must have faith in it!</p>
