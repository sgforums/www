            <div class='col-md body'>Your view is an oversimplified conception that ALL Poly &amp; JC students are like that, in other words, stereotyping them. Not every student don't know life outside school or too immature to realise the real world after ns and adulthood is not easy as pie.<br><br>I think what your trying to say is that the poly &amp; jc doesn't equip you with life skills to prepare you for an adult working life, correct? Either way, can't be helped if there are no institution that would teach better than in an office or a real working environment. But i believe that what you learnt in poly/jc is only to build a rough foundation and qualification before any real life experiences can be gained in future.</div>
