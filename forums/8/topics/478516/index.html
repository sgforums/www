              <p>ok...so according to Chapter 78 (sh*t, so many chapters. Even Harry Porter don't have so many chapters combined)...I will be sent to a Welfare home if caught begging. I would say this is a rather good deal. Got food, got shelter, got shower, got somebody to run errants for you...precisely what i am begging for in the first place.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
