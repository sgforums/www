CAn any guys out there share their experience with me? Frankly, after I broke up with my gf(which was around 1 year ago), I realised that having a gf had many untold responsibility or hidden cost. For example, I didnt know that having a gf means I couldnt be that open or communicate openly with other girls(I had to go through so many break up and patches just becos my gf insisted that I was FLIRTING when I was only talking/socialising) Also, my gf complains that she is always the one calling me, and I seldom call her. Must I call her everyday to show that I love her? Its absurd and a waste of my money on handphone bills. And what do I get at the end of the day? An arguement that somehow involves our parents as well? I was so disillusioned with all this nonsense that I became some sort of girl-hater. But recently I took a fancy to this chio girl in my estate. I can talk openly with her and all that. But I dunno whether I should get more close to her or what&gt;? I like to hear your advise.
