CAn any guys out there share their experience with me? Frankly, after I broke up with my gf(which was around 1 year ago), I realised that having a gf had many untold responsibility or hidden cost. For example, I didnt know that having a gf means I couldnt be that open or communicate openly with other girls(I had to go through so many break up and patches just becos my gf insisted that I was FLIRTING when I was only talking/socialising) Also, my gf complains that she is always the one calling me, and I seldom call her. Must I call her everyday to show that I love her? Its absurd and a waste of my money on handphone bills. And what do I get at the end of the day? An arguement that somehow involves our parents as well? I was so disillusioned with all this nonsense that I became some sort of girl-hater. But recently I took a fancy to this chio girl in my estate. I can talk openly with her and all that. But I dunno whether I should get more close to her or what&gt;? I like to hear your advise.

            <div class='col-md body'>Many a times when one bumps into a problem, one would start looking into whats wrong with "YOU, HIM, HER,THEM" anything but "ME MYSELF &amp; I".<br><br>Try perhaps viewing what could have gone wrong with urself that created such problems as complained, rather than just brushing the matters as the problem lies in her. As said, you have taken a fancy in another lady, if you really liked your existing GF, well guess this thoughts wont have been dancing in your brains then.<br><br>To love someone definitely is a responsibility, though it should not actually be considered as one (contradictory rite?), such as trying to understand, satisfy (i aint talking sexually) your partner, and while at the same time not doing anything to hurt your partner.<br><br>To start a relationship is always easy, to maintain it is always the challenging one. It all boils down to you, your partner, and your communications.<br><br>Back to your question, "Keeping a girlfriend == an investment or a parasite?", lemme ask you back, are u an INVESTOR or a PARASITE SEEKER?

I hate it when men are calculating. every cent spent also want to calculate, make me feel like they are either treating me as some kinda charity or like I owe them something if the whole thing doesnt work out. I also agree with #3, a certain guy I met has told me that a woman should be seen, but not heard. So if she has problem, she is supposed to keep quiet about it, otherwise she will piss the guy off or she would be seen as a problematic freak. It is like, when the guy is lonely and want some company and reassurances, he will go to the woman for all that. But when the woman feels this way, she is not supposed to demand because she will be termed as being demanding and the guy would break it off with her since he now sees her as a burden.<br><br>Fair not fair?<br><br>i.c.y</div>

The problem is that Im always the submissive one in the relationship. I mean I even allowed my gf to humilate me in front of her peers. Do you still think I can even be the suc ker? I admit I didnt provide much for her lah, but thats bcos I was busy working. So I wonder whether I was right to tell her "You cant have love and money at the same time"?????</div>

I dun deserve to be flamed like that you know <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>1) The reason why I used the terms investment and parasite is bcos at that time I was wondering whether this relationship with my gf would bear fruit at all. Its because we kept breaking and patching up till I lost count. And the reason for breaking up would be for trivial things like(for e.g She saw me talking to another girl about homework). Do you know how it feels like to be scolded and falsely accused for something which you did not do? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Its like after spending time with her and all that, she suddenly lets off steam and start ignoring and spiting you. Thus, after all the emotional pain I have gone through, I thought that only a parasite will give you this kind of pain.<br><br>2)You are right about me on this. Yes Im very particular about how I spend my money. Im not some kind of rich saudi prince that can afford to make a call on my handphone and chat for 20hours a day(My ex does this almost everyday with her current bf). And my ex knows tt the reason why sometimes I dun reply to her sms is bcos Im reluctant to pay 5cents per SMS. Im using a prepaid card and I pay my own bills.<br><br>3)I disagree with you on this. I have always respected the feelings and attitudes of my ex even though I may not always agree with it. I have always tried my best to reassure her that Im not flirting and only SOCIALISING. Dont I have the right to do that?<br><br>4)This kinda things.......err....Im not very sure..can you elaborate further?</div>

Of cos I would want a man who knows how to manage his money.

Even worse is those that dare to demand the girlfriend pay them back. I do not want my boyfriend to spend so much money on me either, in fact I think that is what most guys misunderstood about me.

Maybe I might have been a bit judgmental when I used the terms "parasite" or "investment". But thats based on my previous experience. My point is that its a good "investment" if the relationship works out well for both partners and both partners get married and live happily ever after. In this case the amount of time "invested" in the relationship would have paid off wouldnt it? However what if the opposite happens? Like after a while you realise that this relationship is only one sided and only one partner benefits at the expense of the other. Then in this case it would be a "parasite" already or a "bad investment".

Did you tried to stop your gf 'socialising' with guys as well? Or rather, can you take it? It's all about jealousy, no confidence in the r/s and low self-esteem. Once you got involved with a gal, you cannot say that you don't know about the responsibilities needed. And, there is no such thing as 'hidden costs'. There is such a thing called 'Go Dutch' on dates. </span><br><br>I understands that guys normally don't like to chat on the phone. Then, on your part, you can try to make her feel secured by sending her <span style="color: green;">sms occasionally. </span><br>Regarding the chio bu in your estate, i can only say that you are not ready. Since you say you became some sort of a girl-hater, then, let yourself rest first. Why rush into another relationship? The reason why you can talk openly with her coz everything is still new and fresh. Get to know her more first.

Whatever my ex gf do that time, It didnt really bother me. In fact while she was with me, she was seeing another guy as well. She wanted to make me feel jealous in a way lah. But like I said, I respect girls rights a lot. So I didnt give any comment about that matter. Bcos too me, its like since I dun really mind ,I guess its ok for you to two time at the same time lor. Den my ex gf get angry with me??? wth?? I was being nice and then she accused me of not liking her seriously and said I dun like her. And then we broke up??..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">So Im puzzled here...???<br>Responsibility as in what sense?

So if she has problem, she is supposed to keep quiet about it, otherwise she will piss the guy off or she would be seen as a problematic freak. It is like, when the guy is lonely and want some company and reassurances, he will go to the woman for all that.
