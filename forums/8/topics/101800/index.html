            <div class='col-md body'>I was just wondering whether it would be worth it to have a girlfriend. CAn any guys out there share their experience with me? Frankly, after I broke up with my gf(which was around 1 year ago), I realised that having a gf had many untold responsibility or hidden cost. For example, I didnt know that having a gf means I couldnt be that open or communicate openly with other girls(I had to go through so many break up and patches just becos my gf insisted that I was FLIRTING when I was only talking/socialising) Also, my gf complains that she is always the one calling me, and I seldom call her. Must I call her everyday to show that I love her? Its absurd and a waste of my money on handphone bills. And what do I get at the end of the day? An arguement that somehow involves our parents as well? I was so disillusioned with all this nonsense that I became some sort of girl-hater. But recently I took a fancy to this chio girl in my estate. I can talk openly with her and all that. But I dunno whether I should get more close to her or what&gt;? I like to hear your advise.

Its like should I keep this stock or should I trade it off before the price drop further  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Anyway not all girls are the jealous sort who don't allow you to communicate with other girls. Most probably they lack self-confidence or your actions somehow make them distrust you.<br><br>You don't have to call a girl everyday to prove your love. From the sound of it, you seem rather young.  Actions speak louder than words. Nice sweet gestures go a longer way.<br><br>As well,  in a relationship there must be communication and do practice give and take. Pls do not get calculative in a relationship as it will only strain it though you should put a stop if you think the other party is just sponging off you and taking you for granted.</div>

If you just go after a chio bu, then what you get is just a chio bu with all the other attribute she brings which can be anything from heaven to hell. Personally, I think the probability of getting hell with a chio bu is higher since they have no lack of suitors, which means expectation will be higher with less willingness to accept who you are.<br><br>Remember, a girlfriend comes in a package, you cannot choose only parts that you like.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shade343:</div><div class="quote_body">I was just wondering whether it would be worth it to have a girlfriend. CAn any guys out there share their experience with me? Frankly, after I broke up with my gf(which was around 1 year ago), I realised that having a gf had many untold responsibility or hidden cost. For example, I didnt know that having a gf means I couldnt be that open or communicate openly with other girls(I had to go through so many break up and patches just becos my gf insisted that I was FLIRTING when I was only talking/socialising) Also, my gf complains that she is always the one calling me, and I seldom call her. Must I call her everyday to show that I love her? Its absurd and a waste of my money on handphone bills. And what do I get at the end of the day? An arguement that somehow involves our parents as well? I was so disillusioned with all this nonsense that I became some sort of girl-hater. But recently I took a fancy to this chio girl in my estate. I can talk openly with her and all that. But I dunno whether I should get more close to her or what&gt;? I like to hear your advise. IM LISTENING <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>How a gal react is due to the attitude that is been given to her by her bf. Did you tried to stop your gf 'socialising' with guys as well? Or rather, can you take it? It's all about jealousy, no confidence in the r/s and low self-esteem. Once you got involved with a gal, you cannot say that you don't know about the responsibilities needed. And, there is no such thing as 'hidden costs'. There is such a thing called 'Go Dutch' on dates.<br><br>I understands that guys normally don't like to chat on the phone. Then, on your part, you can try to make her feel secured by sending her sms occasionally.<br><br>Regarding the chio bu in your estate, i can only say that you are not ready. Since you say you became some sort of a girl-hater, then, let yourself rest first. Why rush into another relationship? The reason why you can talk openly with her coz everything is still new and fresh. Get to know her more first. Talk things out with a gal before starting a relationship.<br><br>All the best..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
