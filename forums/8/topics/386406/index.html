              <p>Quite true in some ways. I had also googled this pair and all link states that it is highly unlikely that aries and virgos will be together. Mostly will end up in divorce. However if they do work out, it will be beautiful.</p>
              <p>Currently me and my gf is going through a rough patch. She is Aries and I am Virgo. We have planned to marry after 2 years. Sometimes we are loving, sometime we quarrel over nothing. Mostly we quarrel as she over reacted to certain issues.</p>
              <p>Though we do make peace quite fast as well, it is taking a toll on the relationship.</p>

              <p>The key thing about horoscope, is to understand how each other behaves or is behaving.</p>
              <p>Link those behaviours to the zodiac, understand, compromise and learn how to use each other's fault, strength and emotional directions to complement each other.</p>
              <p>Horoscope isnt about just stating you are compatible with each other or not or what might happen in the end.</p>
              <p>Its to help you understand each other's temperaments, likes and dislikes better.</p>
              <p>The strangest thing here about horoscope.  Virgo are fussy.  I am a Virgo, and I nag a lot or I have certain quirks almost like a OCD person.</p>
              <p>Aries are spontenous, that may explain how she might be quarraling with you over what you term as nothing or small matters.</p>
              <p>But if you understand to learn from the horoscope and her likes and dislikes.....there isnt to say that you cannot beat the odds of not being able to complement and be with each other.</p>
              <p>Unless of course, you are only looking for a excuse to end this relationship which you find straining.</p>

              <p>Still, your description does not sound like it got much to do with horoscope.</p>
              <p>Its personality, attitude and handling each other issues.  Try reading up on books like 'Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus' kinda books.</p>
              <p>And since we are asians, you might want to add on the advises of the books with the social, ehtics &amp; communications styles of Asians and our newer generation spoilt kids behaviours.</p>
