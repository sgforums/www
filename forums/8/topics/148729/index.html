            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">LIBRA MAN</span></strong><br><br>A man who has no balance like his Zodiac symbol. He is not the gentle, cool, calm &amp; charming guy like what u see. He has another dark side of aggression, stubborness &amp; he likes to start an argument most of the time. Sometimes, he can be so depressed &amp; unstable. Up &amp; down like he is trying to balance himself most of the time. To many people, he is a friendly guy &amp; always smiles even when he is mad or upset. His voice always gentle &amp; calm. He always sets &amp; combs his hair as if he just emerges from a shampoo advertisement. Most Libra men are good-looking, even the ugly one is charming. When he smiles, it is so bright that the whole world is smiling with him too. When he is in a balanced mood, he is the type of person u want to be with. In other unbalancing mood, he likes to make people argue about something &amp; watched it with fascination &amp; fun. He will wait to be the one who compromise &amp; clear things up. He likes to be in a conflicting conversation. Libra man is lazy in nature. After his tiring day at work, he likes to sit still &amp; look out of the window or read quietly. He likes to be in his own world. After recharging his battery, he will be very energetic again &amp; may even take u out that night. Libra man normally will not do any shocking or abnormal things to be noticed. He likes to be conformed with his crowd, but if u watch him carefully, u will see the difference. If he wears a shirt, it will have to be a zipper front instead of buttons, or a special tie bar. There is always something in him that he will not allow totally conformity to take him over. A straightforward, no nonsense guy. He is careful &amp; delicate in details. He will spend extra time to do it right, than comes back to correct them later. He hates people who boost or exaggerate. He does not like over-dressed woman or make herself a center of attention. He loves to read. He loves poems &amp; art. When he works, he can work like<br>crazy, but after work he can turn on romantic jazzy music &amp; treat u so gently. He loves to give people advice &amp; normally give good advice. If u fall for him, u will be like being trapped in a spider web. If u want to break up with him, he will persuade u a zillion times to stay &amp; u cannot stop him anyway. After he persuades u to stay, or after a big fight, he will be so sweet to u as if he has never hurt your feelings before. He will has his own way to win a girl's love &amp; affection. Once she says yes, he will lay back &amp; wonder if he should go on or ishould he back out. In his teen, he changed many girlfriends because he can't clearly differentiate between loving a friend &amp; loving a girlfriend. He will check &amp; re-check if his match is suitable &amp; compatible with him. Even though he's a romantic man, he can hardly understand the emotion of the one he loves. He is a generous guy even when he sets his life so systematically. He never knows when he makes u unhappy. He never knows how he upsets u. He will never knows what he said wrong. If he is your lover, be prepared for this. A not-so-pretty girl with no brain is not his type of woman. If u are not pretty enough, he will not mind talking to u but he doesn't care to get to know u. Any girls, pretty or ugly can ask for his help, he will be happy to help. He hates to argue by yelling at each other, so u tend to see him argue with his girlfriend seriously but trys his best to be very quiet. He likes to have a girlfriend by getting to know each other like a friend first. If u want him, u have to like the same thing he does. He prefers pretty &amp; gentle woman than a smart &amp; ugly woman. U have to understand his mood especially as he can has many different moods. He is a private person, so when he needs to be alone better let him be.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">LIBRA WOMAN</span></strong><br><br>Most of the Libra woman has an egg-oval facial shape. She has a nice smooth skin &amp; a good figure. She will spend so much efforts to keep her skin clean &amp; pretty. She can be easily allergy to cosmetic &amp; makeup, but taking care of her face &amp; avoid wrinkles is her hobby. She is good at it &amp; tends to look younger than her age. She can be very naughty like a little boy, but yet a fully 100% woman. She looks nice in either jeans or night-gown. She thinks woman is equal to man. Sometimes she can think faster than u, but she will not leave u far behind. She will try not to make u feel like u are competed or defeated in any games she plays with u even when she is winning. She is a little flirt even though she has no idea what she wants. She cannot decide what to do, &amp; what not to do, so she cannot set her schedule very well in all cases. She is gifted with how to dress, &amp; how to match her dress. She likes to dress in black &amp; wears perfume. She likes a mild flowery scent. In any argument, she can really argue. She can argue for hours, &amp; most of the time, win the argument. If it is not a serious argument, she could argue &amp; once a while give u a smile also. She will make a good politician, because she can tell which party will win the election. She always has good reasons, even though she likes to contradict herself. She cannot decide what's right &amp; wrong for her, because everything has pros &amp; cons. Woman in other Zodiac might not care what other people think, but Libra woman care what other people, or what u feel as much as her own feelings. She can adjust to her environment very well, so at work she will be at the top of the ladder. She likes team work in doing things. If u ask her for help or advice, she will help u unless she does not like your guts. She can change u &amp; make u think u change by yourself without her influence. The advantage of being with Libra woman is that she never interferes with your privacy. She will not make u lose face in front of your friends. Even if she cares about how much money she has left in his/her bank account, she will never forget to let u know how much she cares for u. She thinks that taking care of the house is a woman job &amp; she can do it well. But if u expect a Libra woman to fear u, then u are wrong. She is a strong woman even when she looks at u with that sweet innocent baby's looks &amp; may lose u (let u win) in a few poker games. If she is the one u are after, then go step by step. The best way is using her friends to introduce u to her. Do not make her feel or treat her like a bubble head. U have to initiate to get close to her with confidence &amp; security. Show her that u are a kind, polite &amp; a real gentleman. Be a slow hand or else u might get smack!<br><br></div>
