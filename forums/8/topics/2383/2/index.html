CONFIRM stay in wherever u go..)<br><br>if u think u wanna downgrade after becoming man? osso can forget it...<br><br>almost all the units that u go to (if u become rifleman) will KEEP YOU IN THAT UNIT AFTER YOU DOWNGRADE.<br><br>all unit are allowed to keep any downgraded personnel for their own use...<br><br>so u can look forward to STAYING IN in your unit to be a clerk or storeman..<br><br>THE BEST WAY TO DOWNGRADE IS:<br><br>go to ENHANCE bmt... (that way u serve only 2 yr 4 months)<br>DO WELL!! Cheong for OCS...<br><br>ONCE U GO OCS, get ur medical letters and DOWNGRADE&gt;.<br><br>OCS is the best place to downgrade... coz likelihood is they will POST YOU OUT.....<br><br>of coz got chance that u kana posted to stay in unit,<br><br>but at least got high chance of posting to stay out unit...<br><br>once u are a downgraded in a stay out unit,<br><br>ur life is shiok.<br><br>everyday 8-5 shiok shiok...<br><br>some pple say clerk / storeman over worked...<br><br>Who cares???<br><br>ur work lasts 8-5.. at most do it during that time!<br><br>after 5, take bus home, relax watch tv... take a nap, go out with ur pals, come home at 10...<br><br>next day, 8am report to camp...<br>SHIOK LIFE!!<br><br>just my advice...<br><br>KEEPING LOW PROFILE WILL JUST SCREW U UP..<br>dun listen to the clowns here...<br><br>cheong OCS, and downgrade from there...<br><br>cheong SISPEC can also downgrade from there... but go ocs if u can...<br><br></div>
