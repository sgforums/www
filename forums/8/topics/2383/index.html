            <div class='col-md body'>Keep low profile is the best solution. It doesn't pay to be garang and acting blur will be a disaster.<br><br>Whenever, there is a chance, go for medical review. Any small medical problem you have, don hide but don fake.<br><br>I got a friend who is damn garang during his NS and hence gotten his best soldier award, now he's being recalled for ICT almost twice every year when the rest of his same batch of low profile frn in camp are not even in the list. That's what you get when you are garang. My frn got more extra burden and hence affected his promotion cos he always kena disrupted from major project which he has to hand down to his expat colleagues who have no NS commitment, losing his chance for oversea project placement, losing out in his personal skill training cos he cannot make it when there is a project training. All thanks to his garangness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>want to be slack? first thing, become a clerk. if you fail to be one, you should be very sad. clerks are the elite in the army, which every aspiring NSF with some ideals in their right mind should consider striving to be.<br>if you fail, you should be upset, just as or even more upset than if you failed your A levels. this thing gonna affect you for 2 years, A levels, you can retake 2 times in the army if you are a clerk! for losers and failures out there, you can consider going to "normal" BMT, which isn't normal at all since "enhanced" BMT is for normal people. "normal", or ah-kua BMT allows people to excuse pushups, pullups, running, shoes, depending on your luck.<br>if you still aren't capable enough, you end up in "enhanced" BMT which is what most losers went through. then, hope you end up in a slack company. if you end up in some tough one, too bad. then, when you have interview with your PC, tell him you want to be a clerk, or driver, or medic. Don't ever tell him "I want to go OCS/SISPEC", thinking that PCs and 3SGs in BMT have such a good life. well, if you have good grades, its really sad for you because you'll end up in SISPEC if you keep a low profile and don't megascrewup or get ultra-hated. if you're slightly luckier, whether because you have better grades or better performance, you end up in the longer but less-tough OCS, where its got more beautiful scenery to onlookers, but where the red-tiled floor is the most common scenery most cadets get to see.<br>so, if your grades suck, good for you, you're gonna become a MAN, ie, posted to some unit, maybe become a medic or driver. if your grades are good, the risk of SISPEC is probably too great. so, unless you are absolutely sure you can siam into OCS and avoid the physical torture, better fail everything in BMT, eg your shooting, your SOC, or get hated like crazy and become a MAN.<br>the worst thing to do is to end up COMMANDO. that's it man, you are finished. good luck, good bye, nice knowing you...<br><br>tips to avoid area cleaning:<br>in bmt, instead of cleaning the bunk, just go into the next section to sleep. that was simple!<br></div>

Don't let your 2.5 years go down to the drain working as cheap labour. Take up part time degree course or other enriching course that will help you in your future real career. 2.5 years, your female counterpart had already graduated and you are just starting off. Think about it. Be a loser in the army or be a loser in real life?</div>

U lose yer pride and whatever konwledge that u cant learn from books alone(havent we seen all types of ppl in army?)<br>In my opinion, kenging causes u to really tink those 2.5 years are wasted.

Dont u tink that those chao kengs are looked down upon by everyone?  If yer employer recognises u from army and remembers that u were a ck, u tink he'll employ u?  U lose yer pride and whatever konwledge that u cant learn from books alone(havent we seen all types of ppl in army?)<br>In my opinion, kenging causes u to really tink those 2.5 years are wasted. What did u do/learn in NS? -Nothing- </div></blockquote>So what did you achieve for 2.5 years in NS to help you in your current job application (unless you are going for SAF related jobs)? did you tell them you are a garang soldier in the SAF?<br><br>I agreed, CK will be looked down on. Everything to the extreme will not be good. Did i mentioned about being a CK? You only need to keep a low profile, do only those you are asked to and don't waste too much time in NS.<br><br>If the outside employers recognised your capability based on your performance in the army, then tell him to recruit those garang soldier in SAF instead. Why seek your professional skill? Is performance in the army a measure of your capability in the outside world where thing are taken more seriously and creative by individual instead of regimental? Everyone just trying to pass their time in NS due to conscription. Who would want stay a minute longer in camp after they ORDed? Would you go for NS the 2nd round since you think it is that benefitious?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whatever it is, just remember, make your stand clear. If you want to be siao on, make sure you really are siao on, don't put on an act, later you find that you cannot pretend anymore.<br><br>If you want to be lazy, everything also don't want to do, also can. Do the absolute minimum, don't volunteer for anything, don't take any initiative. You may get labelled, but the bottom line is, you do the least work and still get the same reward. Army is like that, some do a lot, some do nothing, in the end, reward still the same for all, in the interest of "fairness".<br><br>Just don't be in the middle. Reluctant to do things, but still do like crazy because "scared". There are many of this kind of people. They do the most work but get nothing. They are not happy, but pretend to be happy. Half here half there. In the end, get all the shit jobs, and only verbal rewards at most.</div>

It's whether to be a wise or stupid cow. And the definition of wise or stupid also differ from our differents stands i guess. The only same thing is that we are both cows that are forced to labour and work for SAF. Try not to be a cow, at least not the stupid kind of cow who labour for nothing.</div>
