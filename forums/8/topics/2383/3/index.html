Being brought up in a time where national security is not at great risk resulted in weaklings like them. To them, their 2.5 yrs of having fun is more important than a nation.

However, if he is able bodied without any physical impairment, why does he want to "Keng"? Isn't that an obvious case of a mental weakling? Nothing is impossible as long as you have the will power to do that. Look at POWs, how is it some of them are able to survive that long in POWs camp. It is sheer will power and their desire to go back to a place they call home and see their loved ones. Before anyone challenge me on what vocation I am, I am a brigade recce trooper.

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't relate to either sides of this topic becos when I got enlisted into NS (1 cdo bn) i was like, arr wat the fuck as if i have a choice.<br><br>seriously, there are SO MANY things that are beyond our control, and to complain about it just makes things worse. of course, it's good to voice out unhappiness or even get up there and make a change for yourself and the pple who feel that way. but there is no way u can convince the govt beyond a reasonable doubt no matter who u are that NS is a waste of time. there are some things whereby ur complaints may make a difference or invoke a change, but i sincerely believe NS is not one of those things. so with that i say no point complaining about it. well complaining about it is alrite i guess we all do that, but just remember, bite it, swallow, and shit it out, with as little constipation as possible.<br><br>on a personal note, like i mentioned, being in cdo, i had the experience of a lifetime. of course u send me to the battlefield now i'd die instantly, but i'm not talking about the "war skills" i learnt at hendon camp, it's much more than that, and i'm sure a few guys here will know wat i'm tokking about.<br><br>so to conclude, i don't regret doing NS, nor would i choose to not do it if i could turn back time. and believe me, i don't consider myself patriotic nor do i have a huge sense of belonging to this country, as i've been a PR in australia for the past 12 years (coming back only to serve NS to retain a pink IC) and only just returned last year.</div>

POWs endure whatever is thrown at them because of their will to survive, whether be it because they wish to see their families again or because they just won't give up. what is the equivalent source of motivation an NS recruit has? he goes in to spend 2.5 years of his life serving time for the government and country, something which he doesn't have a choice in. after delaying his entry into the working force by 2.5 years, he still has to report back annually for reservists trainings, which further disrupt his working schedule, and take away precious time he could have spent with his family (if he is married).<br><br>even though you mentioned it, your vocation as a brigade recce trooper carries no weight in this issue. good for you that you served proudly in a vocation that had less glamour than the CDOs but had more shitty jobs. just don't expect everyone else to live up to your standards. the attitude one has towards anything (which includes NS) is very subjective and you have no say in it.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mfscrewu:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes, you have a right not to serve NS, but with that comes a price. Price of not having a country you call home. These people will forever be second class citizen no matter if they hold the passports of the country they chose to live in.</div></blockquote>funny how women, which constitute roughly half the population of singapore do not have to serve NS but get away scott free, and still have singapore to call their home.<br><br>having a country to call home isn't as important to everyone as it is to you. different people have different things that they hold themselves up to and live for. when your ancestors first stepped into singapore, they too were second class citizens, when compared to those who were 2nd or 3rd generation singaporeans then. what i'm saying is that there is a first time for everything, including migration.<br><br>in case you haven't realized, migration and immigration is something every country goes through all the time. for every singaporean that migrates to another country, there will be someone else who migrates to singapore. its really no big deal.<br><br>if everyone thought like you and felt that first generation immigrants in any given country were second class citizens, then globalization would never have happened. in reality, 2nd (or higher)generation immigrants in any country are usually treated as "first class citizens", whatever that's supposed to mean. well if it makes you happier, go ahead and envision all singaporeans who have migrated being ostracized, picked on, discriminated against, having their wives raped and their houses burnt down and looted, etc.<br><br>as for me, when my time comes, i'll serve my time just like everyone else who has to. i won't complain, and i won't "keng". i'll do it only because i have to. i'll do what i have to do, and i'll do it with no more or no less pride than i would with anything else i'm forced to do. after which, i'll think long and hard about what i think would be best for my family (should i decide to have kids). i may want them to enjoy greener pastures, perhaps a fresh start, or maybe just a change of environment. once i make up my mind, i'll do whatever i think is necessary and nothing or no one is going to stop me.</div>

My ol' man actually sat me down once in a while in my wee days to talk to me about things like loyalty to one's country, patriotism, honour and sacrifice.  I'm not sure if other dads even do that, but I certainly appreciate what mine did, especially when I see what's going on around me.  He would say to me that a man is determined by the strength of his principles, whatever they may be.<br><br>Well, with regards to rank, I'll say this: Rank is what you wear, respect is what you earn.  That was the bottom line of my company when I was serving.  I still apply it.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Being brought up in a time where national security is not at great risk resulted in weaklings like them. To them, their 2.5 yrs of having fun is more important than a nation. A nation which have nurtured them, provided them a home for more than a decade. I am not one who will mince my words, I despise people like them. To me, they are nothing more than selfish bastards.<br><br>Exactly, what is the reason for "keng"? If it is a valid medical reason, yes, I agree such a person should be posted to a service vocation. However, if he is able bodied without any physical impairment, why does he want to "Keng"? Isn't that an obvious case of a mental weakling? Nothing is impossible as long as you have the will power to do that. Look at POWs, how is it some of them are able to survive that long in POWs camp. It is sheer will power and their desire to go back to a place they call home and see their loved ones. Before anyone challenge me on what vocation I am, I am a brigade recce trooper. Not as well known as CDO, but most of the time doing even a lot more shitty jobs than them.<br><br>Yes, you have a right not to serve NS, but with that comes a price. Price of not having a country you call home. These people will forever be second class citizen no matter if they hold the passports of the country they chose to live in.</div></blockquote>Recon Scout??

            <div class='col-md body'>NathanG5<br><br>Thanks for the compliment. It just a quiet vocation with no glory I guess. Not at the same level as the "quiet" professional, if you know what I mean. But I do enjoy my stinct in my NS. Learn a couple of valuble skills and of course a few friends.<br><br>What about you? Have you finish your NS yet? Would like to know some other people from the recce community.<br><br>One thing I notice about NSFs especially those who "keng" are usually the ones in rifle company (excluding CDOs) or some other units where the men have to fight at company level. For troopers functioning in team levels and with high degree of autonomous ability, this trend is a lot lesser. Maybe it could be the espirt de corps which was instilled in us during our training or it could be something else.<br><br>Still, give me my carbine and motorbike and I will be off to no man's land of course with the extra "make-up" on my face. Won't want to change my vocation for anything else.</div>
