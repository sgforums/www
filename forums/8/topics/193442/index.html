In particular, when I was his client, he had all of his facts and materials on hand, and supplied me with more useful information than what I requested - he's a real pro.  On top of that, he knew his company and product's limits and had no problem saying no to requests that could not be reasonably asked.  Those are the precise qualities that I'm looking for in a manager.<br><br>If I've done enough homework to find out that his company's not in good shape, why would you think that I haven't also gotten the scoop on this guy and how he works?  In this particular case, I've traced his history back and already checked up on him in his roles prior to 2001.<br><br>Anyway, back to the main point.  I've seen how this guy works and from that I already <strong>know</strong> that he's got the right stuff for this job, personal <strong>feelings </strong>aside.  Why would I want to take my chances with a complete stranger?  It's tough luck for other people that I haven't seen what they can do, but that doesn't necessitate a conspiracy theory.</div>
