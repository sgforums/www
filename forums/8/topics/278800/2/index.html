Ran and that thing flying chasing me with hysterical laugh ! I met an old man while i was running. I tot i will be saved.. Help me ! got ghost chasing me !! Old Man: Who? Is it me? He suddenly turned into that ghost..<br><br>Damn i ran and ran and ran till i got so tired almost no more energy to run..<br>Bad day, i saw a herd of dogs running towards me barking like wanna eat me.. damn shyt i kneel down , too terrified and begged the dogs to let me go.The dogs ignored me then they chased the ghost..<br><br>When i woke up.. my whole body sweating and i can still feel the trembling and my leg felt so weak that i couldnt even walk properly..<br><br>It just felt so real..</div>
