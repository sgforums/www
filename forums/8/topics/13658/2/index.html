I believe we can correct our own brothers and sisters if they did wrong.... as it is stating in the bible..<br><br>matthew 18:15 "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."<br><br>we correct our own brother and sister for THEIR own good...<br><br>But santa never correct...he just curse and curse...and if ppl making mistakes, he never advice nicely...but calling them devil's incarnation, dumb, loser...and when others try to correct him...wat he did? he never accept ppl advices..<br><br>Secondly, yes. John the baptist do preach to the sadduces and pharisees in serious speech. telling them that the ax is already at the root of the tree...whoever does not repent will be chop down and throw into the fire....that is serious and gain respect from ppl. so did other prophets who did the same thing. i had read the old and new testament since young and never do come across a single case that says john curse the ppl or elijah calling ppl names coz they dont want to follow god. or John forcing ppl to repent...he leaves it to them....<br><br>i respect you coz you are brave in announcing your faith, thats why i withdraw most of the messages i had posted for you...editing it again and again...and had alot of christian faith to share with you and even hope to do bible study with my own brothers and sisters in this forum. but seeing ppl scolding us and other "claim-to-be" christians adding to the fire and coz more problem....hurts....do you sense my sadness?<br><br></div></blockquote>sigh... Altough i am not a christian and in no position to advise you, but here are my thots for you.<br><br>If you really wanted to share, by all means. just post it, your job or duty is to spread the gospel, and not recuiting ppl. i hope you understand that in the bible, jesus only ask all of you to be fisherman of man. The harvest, god will take care of it, just like the saying:<br><br>jiang tai gong diao yu<br>yuen zhe shang gou<br><br>jesus did not said, you must have a harvest of 500 fishes in order to go to heaven, he said believe in me and you will be saved. The rest leave it to god.<br><br>I guess ppl here dun really hate christians, they attack the postings becos it is very disrespectful and they are not happy with the ways the 2 fishs, santa ... is posting, even i get angry sometimes. As for the "claim-to-be" christians, i guess it is quite sad that you have this type of thinking... they didn't said jesus is bad, they didn't scold christianity, they just have different ways of approaching ppl to receive christ.<br><br>what is more important, saving 1 soul or to chase away 500?<br><br>think about it, which of this postings contains love and care for ppl? which of this postings is really empower by the holy ghost? if jesus is love and have walk into your life and your heart, wouldn't you have love instead of anger?<br><br>think about it, what would jesus do if he read all this postings? Would he scream and curse and replied with anger, arrognorant posts? Would he condemn his brothers?<br><br>It is quite sad that not many christians really understands what jesus is all about.. often there are ppl who sings highly, praise highly of god, but in real life, they walk a path of sins...<br><br>what is christianity?<br>to believe in god and walk the path jesus has laid<br>to show ppl that jesus is love and spread the gospel<br><br>i hope god will help you and take away your saddness, and hope you understand that god never plan a difficult life for you... if you really believe in god, god will sent his angels to help you...<br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
