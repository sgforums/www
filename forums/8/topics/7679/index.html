            <div class='col-md body'>I think dreams are what make people want to go on in life.  Writers make so much big fuss over it and in stories the people often want something so bad and then achieve it and be happy.  Some people have no such dreams.  They don't want to be anything, not engineer, not doctor, no profession enthralls them.  There isn't anything they particularly want to do before they die and somehow admitting this causes some to twitch in shame.  Is it because ambition and driveness are extremely attractive traits and everyone ought to have an ambition?<br><br>Do you have dreams?  Are you getting there?  What if you don't?  Dream another?  Does everyone should have a dream?  Will the world be a better place without people who contribute none whatsoever and merely consume  resources?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maya:<br><br>Does dreaming of you count?  :p<br><br>Well, I beleive that dreams are what sets directions in life, they allow you to find purpose. To me it is the driving force, the energy in me to carry on, I tried for a while not to be ambitious, not to dream, not to plan, and basically not to achieve. I felt like I am better off dead. I cannot imagine my life this way, I stopped immediately and resume a life which some of my friends call, unrealistically ambitious and hectic. But hey, that's the way, I like my life to be, to have a constant challenge, to have a direction, and every step towards it, gives me more strenght to carry on. such is my views on dreams and ambition.<br><br>I am also very attracted to people that are capable and a even more so if they are ambitious, I click with them, and if the other party is a lady, you can find me buayaing her every chance I got. *laffs* To me, these are the people who I feel energise me, who understands what life is all about. A lady who is ambitious, who thinks about her future, turns every bit of my hormones into overdrive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Likewise, I do not feel comfortable with people who lqcks drive, I can mix with them, but some how deep in me, I can't help but wonder how they compromise on a life without knowing where they want to head. Is there no dreams that they dare to dream about? Is there no ambition that they want to fulfill? To be crude, I think if it is so, then are they not just taking up space in this world? Why do they even want to carry on living since there is no purpose to live? *ponders* Of course it does not applies to everyone, and I will force the thought on others, but such are the thoughts that run my mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And yes Maya, after I watched MI2 Last night, I can't help but think of you. Somehow The Character of Thandie Newton, the lady in the movie, reminds me of you, yes, I miss you oredi. *smiles* And I am not buayaing you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well maya, I dreamt of becoming a comic book artist when i was very young. I was very fascinated with drawing cartoons... reading comics... blah blah blah...<br><br>When i was much much younger(ard Primary 4) I even drew my own little comic strips in a little excercise book.<br><br>Come to think of it, I didn't know when I lost sight of this dream. I started conforming to society... taking up sciences when i know i should have taken arts... went to study computers when i should have taken graphic design.<br><br>I would say it was a pretty dark and confusing period then.<br><br>Now I am taking the much conformed path of a computer science student again. But recently I have discovered somewhat a small part of me that enjoyed drawing and started doodling again.<br><br>While I will probably not pursue my childhood dream as a comic artist... I think its a part of me that liberates me when I feel tied down, and motivates me when I am down.<br><br>Yes, this dream is important to me even though I might not be able to acheive it at all. Its a light I see within myself even if others don't  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear MayaJade,<br><br>Originally, I was thinking of reserving my 700th post for the Singles thread if it ever hit 699. But your thread was really so alluring that I decided to stop writing my 1st year report for a while and write down what I think about the issues. So I will make it very long since it is my 700th post.<br><br>I always believe in dreams. They keep me alive, and it is the only thing which keeps me going. If I have to put it in thoughts, my dream is in an ascending order : the longing for love, the search for knowledge and finally having the faith that there exists altruism and hope for this world. Believe it or not, I once dream that I would be a martial arts instructor by nite and car mechanic by day, and I would riding my motorbike with my long hair dream gal sitting behind me. Now, it become so different.<br><br>It is always a test to one's life that my dreams would be challenged. I know that I made many dreams come true in my life, and what really hurts me most is to be no longer part of the dream which I originally started. I recalled that I once started something really big that in the end, I have to be forced out of that dream by unforseen circumstances and perhaps my own folly. Yet it is always surprising how small a part of life is taken up by meaningful moments. Most often they are over before they start even though they cast a light on the future and make the person who originated them unforgettable. Everyone should have legends, they allow us to dream. In the same light, I think that dreams have dominated most part of my life. Because I have been freed of some dreams which I once wished to be, I have to start new dreams and I manage to start new ones now, perhaps in other things which I seek to fulfil now.<br><br>I have always believed that life is a dream, love is a dream, and half our lives wasted, just for one dream. A flicker of yesterday, a spark of today, a man's rise and fall,  only till death do we recall.<br><br>Having dreams and achievements based on ambitions are not something really worthwhile. If I will to look back, I find myself making so much achievements and now I will be moving even more. But as I go along, I realise that it does not really matter how much achievements, fame and glory I do own. If you ask me, I am willing to give up all my dreams and achievements to be with that someone. I find that the more achievements made me feel more lonely and difficult to move on and more incomplete as a whole. Perhaps it is the longing for love. Yet, this dream of mine is never within my dream. If patience is really the issue, then I have been very patient till the point now, I have decided to stop seeking. It is love what matters to me most. If you ask me, I feel that I managed to achieve my dream for 2 years in my life, when I was with my ex-gfs, and they give me the encouragement and inspiration to make dreams come true. Yet, they do not realize that they are part of my dreams and for them to leave me, it was like taking away my dream as well and that is what hurts me the most.<br><br>I have goals and fulfilled all of them, after looking at my own little list of goals. I think that to dream is to start with small goals. I remember telling myself a year ago, that by today next year, I must know how to dance, work in the bar and a couple of things and I made it. If you call that small dreams, I guess I did manage to make it work for myself.<br><br>So, what more can I say? I will encourage people to dream, and it is like seeing the stars in the sky. Sometimes, when I am walking home in the middle of the night, and since the town I stay gets very dark, I will look up in the sky and find the constellations hanging in the sky. It made me feel so minute and yet, it give me hope and most importantly, it give me dreams to carry on the next day.<br><br>Do take care.<br><br>yours,<br>the prodigal<br>2/6/2000<br>3 pm in UK time<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, since my good ol pal has posted here, I think I should too. But of course, I wouldn't be able to put in something as artistically profound as my pal.<br><br>Hmm...... dreams. Food fuels one's physical body, as in religion fuels one's spiritual body, but it is dreams I believe that fuels one's mental body. And within these dreams would be all the possible good things that might happen to a person. Finding bliss with his beloved, getting the ideal job, hitting a high in his career at a very young age, gathering all possible knowledge under the sun, surrounded by his good friends and loved ones. There are plenty to dream about, and it is these things that really keep a person moving in this walk of life. A man without dreams is like a walking zombie. It does not matter whether these dreams will be realised or not, that is never the case. Life is never so perfect. But it is that strive towards this perfection that keeps us going. With dreams, there are hopes, there are goals, and there will be directions. And like Proddy, I was a teenager who used to dream a lot. What I am at present is the result of those dreams. Right now, I have many more dreams, and hopefully in the future, I will be able to fulfil each and every of them. Some might be a little far fetched, some, slightly easier to achieve, but no doubt, that would be the direction I will be heading for, and that will be what I wanna see myself 10 years down the road.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a practicel person maya.I will persue dreams that is achievable to me i.e within my limits. Ppl nowadays think big and often do not know their limitations and their environment that they are in, so in the end disappointment set in.Of course there are some exceptions and luck plays an important part too.<br>I am not saying having dreams are no good.We still need them for directions but set realistic goals or else everything would just be a dream.<br><br></div>
