              <p>For goodness sake! Think, men, and spare our kids!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is the purpose of kindiegarten???? Is it compulsory? Is it necessary in the first place? Shouldnt kids be allowed whatever that's left of their childhood - to play and be kids instead of being pressured into formal schooling????</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And WHO will pay for such subsidies except us - THE PEOPLE??? AND FOR WHAT??? - TO SATISFY THE DESIRE OF PARENTS TO PUSH, FORCE THEIR KIDS TO STUDY INSTEAD OF CHILDHOOD PLAYS???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No, let those who want to push their kids do so at their own costs. No kid will lose out, for it is only when kids start growing at 6 years old then would they be capable of better comprehension, which our national subsidised schools and graduate teachers will be more effective to train and mould them, and offer them the opportunities to a life based on merit.</p>
              <p> </p>
