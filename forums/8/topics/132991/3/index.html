It's either a pass or a fail.. unlike RMIT when projects and tests can pull you through even when you don't do well for the exams... but you'll be very busy...have to attend school like 4 days a week, and sometimes even night classes I heard...<br><br>For UOL if you are lucky you can pack ur schedule to a 2 day week...but very unlikely bah.. usually people go to school 3 to 4 times a week...12 hours of lectures a week.. 3 hrs per module per week.. 4 modules a year.. and it comes with consultations once in a while...they don't really bother about attendence...whether u wanna go sch anot it's up to you... it's dependent your own initiative ...<br><br>Slackers like me always play the skipping game... then study 3 days before exams.. hahah will I pass anot? Stay tune..... LOL<br><br>Anywayz, good luck to the peepz who are still taking the UOL exams.. esp tomorrow's FR paper.. please let it be EZzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

One arm, mainly business courses with RMIT, UOL etc. These courses are mainly targetting at fresh school leavers, full-time students, both local and foreigners. I said mainly because there are also part timers - smaller.<br><br>2) The other arm, mainly targetting at the working adult. The more popular courses are comp sc, psychology, engr, nursing etc. The universities are the Open uni - uk, Sydney uni etc. These courses run in the evening part time.<br><br>3) Each prog has its own entry requirements. For example, if you are doing engr, the entry requirements will be different from comp sc.  The entry requirements for many prog, I would say, are lower than say NUS or NTU. But you have to bear in mind that their students (the part timers) are not fresh school leavers. These students are mature working adults with working experience.<br><br>4) You can suka suka come in if you have their basic entry requirements. The problem I saw is like that- some (but many) students thought part time means easy, easy will do. They want degree but are not willing to work hard.  From my experience, SIM do have certain standard which they want to maintain. Some of my super good classmates (part timers) sweat for 8 years before they got their good honour degree (no short cut), some just play, play. After some time, they just disappeared - waste money never mind but also waste time. </div></blockquote> I think it is wasting time n money to study in SIm bcos i spent 16K got a degree n i came out nobody employ, i use my degree i cant get a job but if i use my diploma i can get a job, or may be it is my age, i am over 40, hard 2 find job</div>
