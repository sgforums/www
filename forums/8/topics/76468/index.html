            <div class='col-md body'>got this off todays ST. comments?<br><br><blockquote>The NKF: Controversially ahead of its time?<br>Controversy stalks the National Kidney Foundation, with critics lambasting its fund-raising methods, brazen self-promotion and work practices. Is the NKF just a cutting-edge charity ahead of its time, or is there more to those rumblings?<br><br>By Susan Long<br><br>A RETIRED contractor who wants to be known only as Mr Tan used to be a National Kidney Foundation (NKF) donor until he was hired to install some bathroom fittings for its new headquarters at Kim Keat Road in 1995.<br><br>'I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. Who were we to play God?' - NKF chairman Richard Yong on how the foundation ran dry in 1986 and had to choose among its 32 patients who should continue with dialysis, and who would have to be sent home with morphine to die.<br>Inside chief executive T.T. Durai's office suite on the 12th floor of the $21 million building, he says he 'lost it' when he had to install, among other things, a glass-panelled shower, a pricey German toilet bowl and a gold-plated tap.<br><br>'I started screaming my head off. The gold-plated tap alone cost at least $1,000. It was crazy. If you're Bill Gates and own your own multinational, whatever you want, fine. But you're a charity, using donors' money,' he huffs.<br><br>After his outburst, he was told to 'just do' his job. The shower stall remained, but the taps he eventually installed were 'scaled down' to an upmarket chrome-plated model.<br><br>To this day, the 54-year-old belongs to NKF's die-hard detractor camp, unmoved by its shining success in social entrepreneurship and its track record in saving lives. As he puts it: 'After that day, not a cent from me. I'm not going to pay for gold-plated taps.'<br><br>Asked for its response to the contractor's story, the NKF's public relations arm sidestepped the details and said yesterday: 'Since you can't give us details of the contractor... it is difficult for us to give an answer to enlighten your readers.'</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think 52 cents of a dollar goes to the patients is too little liao. I tink now I donate to Ren Ci hospital better. At least that monk is willing to come out and face challenges in raising funds. He really felt for his cause. NKF that Durai like sit in office blow air con ask other people perform antics to raise funds. His salary how much nobody know also. And the NKF building is too extravagant for my taste. Period.</div>
