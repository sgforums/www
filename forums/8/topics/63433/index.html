            <div class='col-md body'>I was just reading patricia's complaint in streats abt a 169 driver who stopped the bus along upper thomson road to get food. (or was it drinks?)<br><br>As a person working long hours, i can understand the difficulty for the bus driver in getting a decent hot meal or drinks at his terminal canteen.<br><br>Personally, i dun blame the bus driver for his actions. However, if i were to have written into the forum pages of our newspapers regarding this issue, i would have said:<br><br>Could TIBS ensure their bus drivers have more coordination between themselves and the food-sellers or coffee uncles so that they are on standby at the bus stop and can rapidly pass the stuff to the drivers?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i disagree<br><br>it's obvious ppl like silvercab do not appreciate the meaning of long hours. Drivers work incredible shifts and earn pennies for their trouble.<br><br>I'm in a long hours job myself at the moment. (like 0730 to 2200h) . When we talk abt professionalism among supposed private enterprises, we should stop to consider the fact that the majority of these drivers are not singaporeans (damned if i can find one anyway) .<br><br>It easy for ppl like us to say that stopping a bus just to get a bite is selfish and attitude unbecoming of a professional. But if we were to go thru similar situations, i believe a little lee way should be afforded to such ppl out of courtesy.<br><br>After all, it's easy to complain rather than to offer a worthwhile suggestion.<br><br>The working conditions of these drivers are poor with little rest and it doesn't help that we have ppl who snap at every mistake they make. These things can only be circumvented when there is a radical shake-up in management.<br><br>That requires a new generation of ppl like ourselves to take centerstage. But how can we assume this mantle if all we do is complain without understanding the full details of such ground problems?<br><br></div>
