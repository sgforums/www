I had finally found a Job after my degree after a 1 years + job hunt.<br><br>my Job is cool however good things for me always come with bad things. I need to go for Reservice during in the 2nd month of my job probation.My company sent a deferment letter to my unit stating that i was under probation. i found out that under new employment, i can request for a deferment if i satisfy this 3 criteria.<br>1) I am newly employed within 3 months<br>2) The company request for the deferment<br>3) the Reservice is more then 7 days.<br><br>my reservice is 21 days. my company sent in the letter, after a long weeks of pending, the result is "DISAPPROVED", sent in another appeal letter, then same letter was sent back to me,just a change in date. no reason of why was it disapproved. I am in the Infantry unit serving my reservist, helding a PES B position. I called my OC, he said he cannot help. all decision is made by CO. they didn't give me his contacts. said it is highly personal etc. it took me 1 weeks asking all around to finally get his contact and i talk to him. He said he won't approve any deferment. he is the CO and his decision is final. only if u r married, new birth, parent/family sick, die then can defer. for new employment even if it took me to lengthen my probation, he won't defer it. and also he said Army will help me if i got sack by the company for reservice.<br><br>do u think army can be trusted? will army really help? my deferment was LOSTED when it was fax over to deferment unit. then i call in, they said i didn't summit. but the fax machine of my company records did recorded the number and date it was sent, and even call in to comfirmed it was recieved. but however, after waiting for weeks and no reply. i decided to call again. and it was gone. asked for the person who confirmed recieved my letter. he said there is thousands of LEE in that place.<br><br>pls give me some advice</div></blockquote>maybe your unit going for ATEC this ICT...so man power is VERY CRUCIAL....<br>that they cannot compromise, or else, the ATEC will be call off. and for you alone, maybe everyone have to come back again some other time.<br><br>But your reasons are valid, AND it is IN the SAF directive also for new employments within 3 MONTHS of probation.<br><br>Solutions:<br>Ask CO again if can "cut-short" your ICT. (it can be done, and i personnal done it before). Like 3 weeks, for you become 2 weeks. Most probably first 2 weeks. or maybe last 2 weeks.<br><br>Write to St.times forum. (but bad, since you got to leave your original name, then also spoil the relationship between you, your OC and your CO)<br><br>Call up SAF hotline and report. This can be anonymous.<br><br>Cheers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>P/S. I am having reservist on 19th Sept.
