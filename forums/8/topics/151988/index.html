            <div class='col-md body'>hello dear singaporeans.<br><br>I am a 30 years old man. I had finally found a Job after my degree after a 1 years + job hunt.<br><br>my Job is cool however good things for me always come with bad things. I need to go for Reservice during in the 2nd month of my job probation.My company sent a deferment letter to my unit stating that i was under probation. i found out that under new employment, i can request for a deferment if i satisfy this 3 criteria.<br>1) I am newly employed within 3 months<br>2) The company request for the deferment<br>3) the Reservice is more then 7 days.<br><br>my reservice is 21 days. my company sent in the letter, after a long weeks of pending, the result is "DISAPPROVED", sent in another appeal letter, then same letter was sent back to me,just a change in date. no reason of why was it disapproved. I am in the Infantry unit serving my reservist, helding a PES B position. I called my OC, he said he cannot help. all decision is made by CO. they didn't give me his contacts. said it is highly personal etc. it took me 1 weeks asking all around to finally get his contact and i talk to him. He said he won't approve any deferment. he is the CO and his decision is final. only if u r married, new birth, parent/family sick, die then can defer. for new employment even if it took me to lengthen my probation, he won't defer it. and also he said Army will help me if i got sack by the company for reservice.<br><br>do u think army can be trusted? will army really help? my deferment was LOSTED when it was fax over to deferment unit. then i call in, they said i didn't summit. but the fax machine of my company records did recorded the number and date it was sent, and even call in to comfirmed it was recieved. but however, after waiting for weeks and no reply. i decided to call again. and it was gone. asked for the person who confirmed recieved my letter. he said there is thousands of LEE in that place.<br><br>pls give me some advice</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I phoned the CO again after my HR manager talk to him, he told my HR manager if he is going to let me defer, all 600+ people will be able to defer because my reason of new job employment simply mean nothing.<br>He also said that even CEO of Big company can't get defer, my lowly paid job why can it be defer? and also, he said he only want to talk to my company's director, not me. tell my company's director to write him an email of explaination. how can i do it?<br><br>The best part is he said he is the CO of the battlelion, and why can't be communicate with the director of my company? he is pushing me to the cliff. how can i even tell my director to write him and explaination letter? i was recruited by only the sales manager.<br><br>he said he might give me days off to work if i come for the reservice. he said he will grant me few days in the first week, the whole of the 2nd week, but the last week i had to stay and complete it. Is it for real? i need to tell my manager to confirm it with him in black and white, using fax or email about the negotiation. i hope i won't be tricked into going to camp and condem inside cannot go out for 3 weeks.<br><br>btw i got a medical review tomorrow. It's about Hepatitis B downgrade. is Hepatis B able to be downgraded? i think only after tomorrow, i will know the answer</div>
