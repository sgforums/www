Also, you are shooting at an intruder not a mad man running on the loose with a iron rod in hand. And issit it so obvious that the police are trying to incapaciate the mad guy but to no avail. The gun shot wounds proves that. A shot on the hand was obvious made to try to stop the mad man, but he didnt stop, instead carry on charging forward at the officers. When shots to incapaciate the officers are useless, the obvious next move was to aim at other parts of the body.<br><br>Also, think about this...do you think the officers will feel good having caused a life?

            <div class='col-md body'>colette, from this post it is obvious you are using personal feelings. When personal feelings overcome ur logical thoughts, nothing we or the press says can change ur mind.<br><br>THink of this. If that Ah Leh, or whatever his name is, is not crazy at that spur of the moment, why will he continue to charge the officers after being shot. A normal guy will definetely stop after being shot once unless he has commited a serious offence. Back to the point. So if this guy did not commit any serious offence but still charges at the officers after shot, what do u think of his mental state. Is he not obviously <strong>MAD</strong>? Any angry man will not charge after being shot. Do you know how much it hurts to get shot? Even with a .38, the pain is more than u can imagine.<br><br>------------------<br>The Prince Of Darkness...<br>______________<br>| |Ã” NiVleK Ã” | |</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally.. I think the shot was not really justified. The officer was not carrying a baton when he got out of the patrol car even though they had spotted the man carrying the rod earlier. Moreover, if the man was shot once or twice, he would be weakened even though he was still charging at the police officer. The police officer should retreat and wait for the man to drop down. They should have approached the man in pairs rather than the officer alone. However, if I were in that situation, I would be shocked and would most probably do the same thing. But personally... I still think its not really justified.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NiVleK,<br><br>yes, personal feelings were involved and maybe i canÂ’t see clearly at the moment. but the fact is there were no warning shots fired, 4 bullets were pumped in Ah LehÂ’s body instead.<br><br>you will know someone is mad by observing the way the person talk, especially if he/she is agitated, Ah Leh is mad and obviously mad even though our government doctorÂ’s deemed him fit and recovered and discharged him from the mental hospital, I think not more than six months ago, at the very most it was a year ago, what was it that we used to call it in this forum? oh yes, the Hougang chalet. without medications and home support, a former mental patient has no hope in hell of actual full recovery, it would be simply a matter of time before he suffers a relapse.<br><br>iÂ’ve been thinking, the first shot fired, was it at his hand or chest or abdomen? if it was at his hand, surely the impact and pain of the bullet wound would have caused Ah LehÂ’s hand to relax his grip on the metal rod and thus allowing it to fall from his hand? he is merely mad but just as human as the rest of us, capable of feeling pain. could they then not overcome him?<br><br>to be frank, before i knew the dead manÂ’s identity, i already felt that the police were in the wrong and maybe the man was looking to die. where else would you have a man advancing you steadily, provoking you along the way with a weapon? even then, i feel that the police should have fired warning shots and not let the situation become so dangerous that he was only 1.5 m away from them.<br><br>and way before Ah Leh was that near to them, the guns would have been drawn, unless if i am mistaken, the policeman had to cock his gun and open fire, imagine having no time to fire warning shots but he has time to repeatedly cock his gun and put four bullets in someoneÂ’s body. the police justified the killing because it took four bullet to subdue him, so it means that Ah Leh was a very dangerous man, which we will never know if that is indeed the truth. as i was not there, i do not know but the times when i met him and spoke to him on the phone, he was a friend, who unfortunately could not handle stress well and went mad, he was not violent at all, perhaps because he knew me?<br><br>anyone out there know what that first bullet went to? if it went to his abdomen or his chest, Ah Leh, although mad would know that he will surely die and perhaps that was why he continued to advance forward towards the 2 policemen? if the first shot went to his hand, donÂ’t you find it strange that the rod did not drop from his hand and him to his knees in agony? like you have written, can you imagine the pain?<br><br>i just do not like the way the police justify their killings although such instances are really very, very rare in Singapore, but even if it happens once, it will be once too often for this is real life, whoever is shot dead does not get the chance to get up to play the game we know as LIVING again.<br><br>i just worry for all the mad people out there, if they ever behaving belligently and slightly violently, death would seems to be their only option now. and yet ironically, almost everyday, you would see angry mad patients at the Hougang mental hospital behaving aggressively, and how is it that none of them are shot dead yet? isnÂ’t that an amazing fact? or it is just that our nurses and doctors are better at handling mad aggresive people than the policeman?</div>

First, he <strong>may</strong> be weakened but he is still charging at the officers, which causes immenient danger to the officers. It is then justifiable to shoot.<br><br>------------------<br>The Prince Of Darkness...<br>______________<br>| |Ã” NiVleK Ã” | |</div>

Next, he is mad. Warning shots are pointless. A madman wun even care about warning shots, it is just another loud blast of sound.

And thats the fact. He DID NOT STOP.<br><br>I know madman are still humans but if you know, a madman do not think. They dun care about any thing in this world. If you care about things in this mortal world, you will be mentally weaker. This madman attack on the officers and is bent on assaulting him or even killing him. We dun know. Do you realise the power of human determination?<br><br>Why have none of the mad people been shot dead at Woodbridge? Simple. Woodbridge hospital is an instuition meant for insane, unsound people. If you have ever been to woodbridge you will know that the very very unsound people who are bent on violence are kept in a special room which is padded.For the others, if there is a slight hint of violence, doctors will strap them a leather jacket before anything drastic happens.<strong> In woodbridge, all patients are monitored carefully.</strong> &lt;---This might be the answer that you are looking for. All violent prone ppl are kept in some kind of restraint. So, how can they cause any injury to the staff or visitors there? Then, of course, there will be no deaths.
