            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by NiVleK:<br>colette:<br><br>First of all,if i am not wrong, warning shots are not supposed to be fired unless there is a big group of people causing massive chaos. Next, he is mad. Warning shots are pointless. A madman wun even care about warning shots, it is just another loud blast of sound. Warning shots are meant for sane people, if there ever is a warning shot. </blockquote>Not all mad people are that mad until they do not know the difference between life and death, I think they may not care if I live or die but surely, they are not stupid to want to die themselves, they are just mad, not stupid.<br><br><blockquote>Also, the number of shots made doesnt mean he is a very dangerous man. 4 shots are fired cos he did not stop. And thats the fact. He DID NOT STOP.</blockquote>Alamak, who can run faster? An injured man or two healthy policemen. Very lao kui meh, if they just back off? The road is long and kind of deserted, with his injuries, even if he wanted to run after the cops, he can't run very far, he is mad, not superman.<br><br><blockquote><br>I know madman are still humans but if you know, a madman do not think. They dun care about any thing in this world. </blockquote>You're wrong, they do care about things but way too much until they are obsessive about it and cannot think through their obsession, somehow that developes into mental illness when they can't cope. Once they start behaving strangely in public, the public will be ever so kind to inform the police and the police will come and pick them up, the first thing the police will do is send them to the loony house for a check up.<br><br><blockquote><br>If you care about things in this mortal world, you will be mentally weaker. </blockquote>Er, sorry but I have to write: Choy! Choy! Choy! for I care about a lot of things and people in this mortal world.<br><br><blockquote><br>This madman attack on the officers and is bent on assaulting him or even killing him. We dun know. Do you realise the power of human determination? </blockquote>Sure or not? All we have now is the police's version against a dead man. And dead man tell no lies. I am not saying or implying that the policeman/men are lying but no one will ever know the truth except the three of them. Perhaps it did happen the way the policemen said, but still he should have aimed for non-fatal parts of the human body instead of fatally wounding him. 4 shots some more! You tell me how far an injured man can chase after someone and being in tip top shape, surely the 2 policemen can run faster right? Long straight road, few cars, why? Lao kui to be seen running from an assailant, so kill him lor, is it?<br><br><blockquote><br>Why have none of the mad people been shot dead at Woodbridge? Simple. Woodbridge hospital is an instuition meant for insane, unsound people. For the others, if there is a slight hint of violence, doctors will strap them a leather jacket before anything drastic happens.<strong> In woodbridge, all patients are monitored carefully.</strong> &lt;---This might be the answer that you are looking for. All violent prone ppl are kept in some kind of restraint. So, how can they cause any injury to the staff or visitors there? Then, of course, there will be no deaths.</blockquote>You would be surprised at the type of people who are in Woodbridge, most are young gals and guys whose love lifes went haywire, which is really a pity. Yes, there indeed many really mad people, that I do not deny.<br><br>For any person of unsound mind, anything can tick them off and the vistors' stools and chairs, benches, flower pots, etc can become deadly weapons instantly but the doctors and nurses try cajole the patient in hope of subduing him/her, I have witnessed this maybe once or twice. Yes, I have been to Woodbridge Hospital before, as a visitor I mean.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> And my ex-neighbour is a nurse of Woodbridge Hospital.<br><br><blockquote>FYI, those patients you see in the common wards without any restraint are tame mad people.</blockquote>My friend Ah Leh, belonged to this category when he was institutionalised. He actually roamed the grounds of the Hougang premises without supervision and outside of the wards too, with access to public roads and public buses, how dangerous is he? Unless I remembered wrongly, for I remembered meeting him once on the ground floor of the new hospital in open grounds. Of course, we don't know the state of his mind that day. Well, I still find that it was unjustified, that's all.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 19 May 2000).]</div>

Try putting yourself in the situation of the police officers.<br><br>Also, the police are not trained to run away from situations at hand. We are trained to handle them. A death of cos is very unwelcome. But if the police officers did not shoot at him, they might have lost their lives too.<br><br>Think of this...shooting at two rapidly moving legs...do you think it is possible? What if u miss? police officers are not James Bond, they dun have that accuarcy as portrayed in the movies. If you miss, that madman will have already reached a striking distance. Then you think of what the consquences will be...<br><br>Again, like i said the bullet wound on his hand already proves that the police officers tried to disarm him but to no avail. Like the legs, the arm is swingly and do u think it is very possible to shoot at the hand?

            <div class='col-md body'>WOWwoW! Seems that my thread is invoking a lot of passionate speeches here!  :p<br><br>Anyway, there can be two points of view to this matter.<br><br>Colette, u're NOT wrong about the whole matter. There can never be a definite RIGHT or WRONG side abt this matter. We, as human beings, should treasure life and not juz waste the other individual even though he may be mentally disturbed. You may ask, "WHY WOULD THE POLICE TAKE 4 SHOTS TO BRING MR LEH DOWN?? WHY NOT AIM AT OTHER NON-FATAL PARTS OF THE BODY??"<br><br>1.5m may sound a great distance to one, but to a person whose life is on the line and might get killed anytime, every millimetre counts. Armed wif a 2 foot long metal rod, all it takes is juz ONE lunge at the officer to break his skull.<br><br>At this point, you may think that the officer should resort to unarmed combat instead of drawing his sidearm. Being a practitioner of martial arts myself, learning martial arts and APPLYING it in real life are totally different things! As we all know that a mentally unsound man does not think rationally, it is IMPOSSIBLE to anticipate any of his moves! He might juz turn tail at the last minute, lunge at the officer or even draw out a concealed weapon to stab the officer!!<br><br>A person learning martial arts would anticipate the next expected move his opponent would use, thus he would be able to subdue him easily.<br><br>The first shot was meant to bring him on his knees. But the man kept advancing without any signs of him dropping on the ground, the other only choice available would be to kill him.<br><br>Personally, I feel that 3 shots to kill a person is simply too much. Imagine a bullet tearing into yur body 3 times??? 9mm handguns are also too much to bear. Perhaps it's time that the police force should get one gun wif a overkill.<br><br>As they say in Chinese: Chang(2) Tong(4) Bu(4) Ru(2) Duan(3) Tong(4)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just want to clarify that iÂ’m just airing my personal views and not flaming anyone or whatever. perhaps i cried as much for Ah Leh as for myself. recalling my happy idyllic childhood when we were more innocent and purer in intentions is one of my escape mechanisms when iÂ’m feeling lonely, stressed out by the pressures of work or when the betrayals/backstabbings of so-called friends take place as an adult.<br><br>Ah Leh was a huge part of my childhood, i spent my childhood in two places, during the day with my parents at an army base and later in the day with the kids of the kampong, i remember Ah Leh because i hero worshipped him and he dotted on me. i remember all i needed to do when rambutans are in season was to tell him that i would like some and he would pick some for me from their rambutan trees while i wait at the base of the trees. i remember him teaching me to play marbles, the electric circuit, the wonderful and gruesome sight of a duck with its head severed and yet still walking around. i remember him showing me how the feathers of a chicken were removed by boiling it in water. i remember climbing up a tree and not daring to climb down and it was him who brought me down to safety. i remember watching free movies at the open air sites with him and the other kids, there were many things, like my first taste at camping, hours of exploring the kampong, like catching spiders to make them fight, to catch beetles and tie their legs with a thread so that when they fly i could admire their beauty. er, paiseh hor, it is only when i grew up that i realized that those things i did were kind of cruel but when i did them, i was happy and my childhood was the best time of my life because we wore no masks then.<br><br>now, should i be unhappy or feel lonely, it would be almost be impossible to recall them because i would always remember his death, i guess i would have to find a way to come to terms with his death. i wish i didnÂ’t read the newspapers this week. now, if i am unhappy, sad or lonely, one of my escape valves has been taken away from me, i would have to remember only when the times i spent in the army base, those times were happy too but quite lonely as mostly i entertained myself for i was the only child in the canteen daily then, i had to go to another canteen to play with other kids. with his death, not only his family is affected but me too even though i never kept in contact with him when we moved away from the kampong. i guess iÂ’m just selfish, sad and angry at the way he had to die and iÂ’m affected. if he had died of natural causes or even an automobile accident, it would have been different but to die so violently and needlessly, it does mar my memories, his life was so tragic.<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 20 May 2000).]</div>

If the officer was carrying a baton, what use will a baton do in this situation. Its a 2 foot rod for christ sake.

It is then justifiable to shoot.<br><br></div></blockquote>A division officer's baton would not be of much use against a metal rod. A T-baton would be better. When the officer fired the first shot, the attacker was still a distance away from the officer... thus not in any danger yet. I agree that he should fire at the man, but not 4 bullets resulting in death.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kelvin (edited 20 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I seriously dun understand why ppl are questioning the police actions.<br><br>THe potential assailant is at arm's length distance. And about to strike the cops. Sufficient warnings have been given and went unheeded.<br><br>2 shots were fired. And i strongly believe that these 2 hit the arms (justice shots), but it did not stop the assailant from advancing.

            <div class='col-md body'>It can take more than just 1 bullet to bring a man down.<br><br>Contrary to what you might see on TV, it can take up to 10 bullets just to,well, mortally wound a person. You can read more in the April issue of FHM, whereby there was an article on an interview with a Thai Prison executioner. The executioner did say that it can take up to 10 bullets. Why? For one thing, the human body tense up upon the first shot. Pain can be overcome by the mind. Hence it wouldn't be a surprise that it took the policemen 4 bullets to subdue the person.<br><br>Well, here's a new perspective to the whole issue.<br><br>If you've seen Triple Nine, there was an episode in the last season whereby a youth committed suicide by pointing a toy gun at one of the female police officer so as to instigate the police officer to draw her weapon and shoot back at him, thus fulfilling his desire to commit suicide.<br><br>Hence, maybe, just maybe, Ah Leh had wanted to commit suicide (out of depression, etc.) and since he didn't want to disappoint his family/friends, he <strong>could</strong> have planned his suicide by threatening the police officers' lives and sparking a chain of events that lead to his demise...and this discussion.</div>
