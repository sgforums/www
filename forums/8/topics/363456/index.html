              <p>I was stupified as i watched the history channel just now about how Mao Zedong mobilised young teenages, childrens, and army to overthrow the intellectuals, their own parents, their own schools....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And those people and Red Guards, as what they were called, with the little red book of Mao Zedong idealogy, just listened to his words and create havoc in the whole of China.. and this is happening in only 1966 to 1970s.. which is just only recently and is my father's generation...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is such a crazy event... many people were killed within China... around millions... And to think that some of these China people, now should be around 60 plus years old, or maybe even 40 plus are still alive...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those are the people who partake in all these crazy brainwashing events with violence.... Now i finally know why singapore got China people, from falungong sect which like to display tortured pictures of their homeland people....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These brainwashed people who took part in all the revolting exercise is is probably also in Singapore now and it scares me to think whether these people are really non violent people still.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What a scary documentary ... damn scary....most horrific event i have seen for some time since.....</p>

              <p>other scary events in recent times....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>racial riots against chinese in Indonesia - happen in 1998.... this one even more recent... but is still not as large scale as Cultural evolution.... but it is also extremely cruel and inhumane mad event...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to a famous psychologist.. our modern year is the most peaceful compared to past milleniums, or centuries, or decades, or years....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>although we are in 2009 , we are only deacades away from the crazy events where killing is seem to be normal event.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, religion people will claim that mad event of Mao Zedong is thus a example of how atheism also kills many people.....</p>

              <p>Now i fully understand why there are so many corrupt cases and cruel stories about chinese authorities that are still reported in modern times....</p>

              <p>Now i fully know what the current China netizens are so serious about exposing against evil authorities who abused their powers... they have such violent past.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>actually singapore also got racial riots.... and violent periods.... but in modern times... in 2009.. singapore is not so violent already... compared to china... we are also less complicated and less violent..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>their violent struggles amount to millions deaths... compared to us, our death cases are lesser by much.</p>

              <p>My point is that "History" is a propaganda outlet.</p>
              <p>Have u heard the expression "history is written by victors" this phrase alone tells you that different people interpret different events from their own perspective and their own interests.</p>
              <p>And this "History" channel is a very bad channel which doesnt provide balanced views.</p>
              <p>You should watch it a few times more and tell me what you think afterward.</p>

              <p>The Cultural Revolution is more of a political thing than ideological really.</p>
              <p>Mao was getting isolated by the US backed Liu Shaoqi and Soviet backed Lin Biao, he had no actual political power left. However he was idealized by the young and impressionable and he made full use of that fact to gain power once again.</p>
              <p>Mao is still considered a great man by many Chinese. Though they accept that he was just a man with the usual flaws. He did succeeded in keeping China free of foreign influence and being able to forge its own path.</p>
              <p>It's funny how we regard men who kills people in his own country as monsters but hailed as heroes those who invade other countries in the name of "freedom" and "democracy"</p>
              <p>You understand part of it, but i don't think you really understood "fully" what happened.</p>

              <p>It is so easy for an outsider to hail heroes who invade others for liberation and condemn some for the murders of its own citizens, or simply do the reverse - hail murderers and condemn heroes.</p>
              <p>But ultimately, the one who actually suffers or lives with the agony is the common people. Does it matter who is the hero or the murderer when the eventual end is his/her or their loved ones lives and suffering, in the hands of ambitious men?</p>
              <p>The cultural revolution is a reality, hidden with effective suppression of media to the outside world. Millions of innocent dead and for what? Nothing more than an old has-been despot grown used to and clinging on to power, suffering from delusions of grandeur, the mad ambition of personal glory not for the people, NEVER AT ALL, but for his own selfish interest.</p>
              <p>I spit upon his grave and may he rot in hell.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: To TS, there is no worry about those who are alive from the purges. When Mao died, there were retributions, and most of those crazed fanatics were sent for rehabilation.</p>
              <p>The present chinese were the remnant that survived the revolution, wiser and hell bent in preventing such atrocities from happening, which accounts for the peaceful rise of present China.</p>

              <p>This is what happens when a bunch of fanatics - usually communist - tries to turn the clock back, tearing down everything that has been built, in their attempt to create a new society.</p>
              <p>In the period when the Red Guards became so powerful, everything broke down - education, healthcare, agriculture. And then the expected happened: total chaos, infighting, purges, bloodshed. (And those who don't believe History channel, please watch Zhang Yimou's To Live).</p>
              <p>It was repeated all over again, in an even more chilling fashion, in Cambodia under Pol Pot in the mid-70s, again with China's blessings.</p>
              <p>The first article of faith is: human life has value. Once you stop believing in that, then you are capable of any evil.</p>
