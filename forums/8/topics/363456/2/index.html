              <p>economies go to standstill.. people went about taking down signboards , learning martial arts and learning about mao ideology.</p>

              <p>looking at those children just cheering and idolising Mao was just like watching a bunhc of kids possessed by ghosts....</p>

              <p>anyone who is rich, educated, skilled, westerned, literate were considered evil according to Mao.</p>

              <p>btw.. mao's cultural revolution and all that, did away with the "superstition" and religions.. all were branded "counter-revolutionary"...</p>
              <p>in the end, China became a godless, directionless nation without any values, ethics, conscience, morality which was taught throughout the ages in the philosophies of Confucius, the Buddhist and Taoist scriptures and many other religions...</p>
              <p>amoral, atheist, the communists trudged on... until they were told that "it is glorious to be rich"</p>
              <p>without morality, the atheist communist went on a rampage which resulted in the ugly PRC we see infesting the planet.. and the polluted mess of the mainland.. and the many dead babies from poisoned "food" products....</p>
              <p>you rant and rage against organised religion... here's the flip side, the ugly side of atheism...</p>
              <p>both are horrific when used by extremists...</p>
              <p>rage against the extremists.. respect those who have their faiths... and they will respect your lack of faith just as much...</p>

              <p>The religious will value human lives above all. Atheists do so too, but there are Utilitarian and Egalitarian models.</p>
              <p>However, the issue of despotic rulers lies not in whether they are religious or atheist. Being despotic, they believe they are THE moral being themselves and thus determine the lives of others.</p>
              <p>As Cram had said earlier, the first article of faith is human life being valued, regardless atheist or religious. If not, the descend to evil is a sure thing. Hitler was a religious man, the crusader pope was a religious man too, so was the caliphs of islam, yet murders tainted their hands.</p>
              <p>Stalin was an atheist, Mao was an atheist, Count Dracula of Transylvania was an atheist, so were many, and their hands were tainted with blood as well.</p>
              <p>Therefore, religious or atheist is not an issue. The issue is whether the leader of a society value human lives, for everyone and not just a few.</p>
              <p>In defence of a nation, there is no issue with fighting for one's loved ones, but to cause destruction of lives based solely for one's personal glory and ambition is abominable, as what Mao had done and what present tyrants intends to do. They must be stopped at all costs.</p>
