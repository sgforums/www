            <div class='col-md body'>Now these feminist want the govt to come up with a mandatory law to FORCE men to pay for their wives CPF.. The good wife does house chores, and expects nothing in return.. Why? Because she sees herself as the pillar of strength, the glue that binds kids and their husband.. Because of love..<br><br>If we have to resort to pay married women for household chores, we might as well hire maids.. Wait a minute... many are already doing this!! That means most married Singapore women are doing negligible or zilch housework.. And now do we have to start paying them for doing nothing?<br><br>So by virtue of men shouldering the responsibility for our nation's defense in NS, should singapore women pay NS tax to the men?<br><br>TODAY NEWS<br>Tuesday, February 15, 2005<br><br>The widening CPF gender gap<br>Group proposes couples share CPF incomes<br><br>WOMEN in Singapore are getting older and poorer, and changes should be made to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme so that it will be a better safety net for them, say two local organisations.<br><br>The Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) and Tsao Foundation commissioned a quantitative study three years ago on "Women and Income Security in an Ageing Singapore Population", looking in particular at women aged 40 and above.<br><br>"There is a lot of talk about old people, but there is no specific focus on older women," said Ms Corinna Lim, 41, chairperson of Aware's Beyond Youth committee that was involved in the report on the study.<br><br>"It is a serious problem. We hope these (findings) will be raised in the media and will be addressed in the (upcoming) Budget."<br><br>In a paper based on the study, Aware and the Tsao Foundation emphasise that older Singapore women are in a "vulnerable position" due to their "lack of income over their lifetime" and that there are structural inadequacies in the CPF system in looking after the ageing female population at large.<br><br>Using public data available from government agencies, Dr G Shantakumar, consultant demographer and statistician, found that the majority of older women are "currently excluded from the CPF scheme" and have "little money of their own". This is because women's work as housewives is not financially rewarded.<br><br>In fact, the Census 2000 data revealed that a staggering 44.5 per cent of women in Singapore are outside the labour force Â— 398,600 were housewives Â— and this, in turn, causes the problem of income insecurity.<br><br>This problem is exacerbated by the low levels of educational attainment by women aged 40 and above today.<br><br>Eight in 10 women between 40 and 49 years old have only secondary education qualifications or lower, while 90 per cent of women aged 60 and above have below secondary education.<br><br>Factors such as the increasingly low fertility rates and the greater mobility and tendency of children to be abroad mean that the dependence of married older women on the support of their children is "precarious and worrying", the report says.<br><br>Male CPF membership exceeds female membership by 17 per cent for those aged 40 to 44, and by 11 per cent for those aged 55 to 59.<br><br>The paper calls for, among other things, a portion of the employed spouse's CPF contribution to "be channelled into the CPF account of the homemaker" and that families be given the choice of having a "joint family CPF" exercised by both partners.<br><br>Other recommendations are that spouses who contribute to the below-Minimum Sum CPF balances of their wives be given tax relief and that people working in the informal sector should be given incentives to contribute to CPF, either through a dollar-matching or top-up scheme.<br><br>Asked by Today to comment on these recommendations, sociologist Tan Ern Ser, who specialises in the CPF scheme, felt that joint CPF accounts would be unnecessary if the husband-wife relationship is not "in bad shape".<br><br>The other two recommendations were good, but Dr Tan added that people in the formal sector "may feel short-changed".<br><br>A startling trend highlighted in the Aware-Tsao paper is the widening disparity in the average CPF balances of the genders between 1980 and 2000.<br><br>Although the average balances of both genders have increased steadily over the two decades, the gap between the genders has widened significantly.<br><br>"One would have expected the gap to be decreasing given the rise in the educational levels of women during this period," said Ms Lim.<br><br>"This indicates that the income insecurity issue will continue to persist and apply to female generations who are currently below 40."<br><br>Calling this a "worrying trend", Ms Lim suggests that it could be due to gender discrimination in wages; the sharp increases in wage levels<br>in male-dominated industries and jobs; and highly educated women who quit their jobs in favour of the "mommy track".<br><br>Aware and Tsao Foundation hope with their paper to create public awareness of the problem of women growing older and poorer. They also hope further research will be carried out.<br><br>Ms Lim said: "We hope it will start certain initiatives. There are quite a few groups that are focused on ageing or that are focused on women. If we can pool our resources, there are many areas that require deeper research."<br></div>

Lashing out in general hardly serves to do anything. So maybe you're fustrated. But always look at both sides of the coin.<br><br>I think it's only rational that guys have the added NS component when stating out their first career. Note howver that this only occurs for the first jpb. Why so? This is done to peg the person's salary to a female of a similar age. (i.e. to offset the oppertunity cost of having served NS). Subsequently, promotions and salary scales are determined by your ability.<br><br>Also, not all males are the scumbags that you describe them to be. If you are in a situation, seek help. Don't vent in on others. It's not fair to them and you won't gain anything.<br><br>Lastly, if you put it as an honor to serve and protect the country, can we also say that looking after the home is also an honorable duty? Or perhaps to you, it is not... and is just like a job to you? If that is the case, then I think the person who ought to be really sad is you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the only men that might have a problem with the proposed cpf changes are the cheapskates/niao sais who want to control all the household finances and give their wives tiny allowances, if at all. I've seen guys like this and really feel sorry for their wives(In some cases even if the wife is actually working she still has to surrender all her pay to the husband and get his approval for nearly all purhase decisions. Quite a disgusting arrangement).<br><br>Its not like they are implementing a flat ruling that states that you have to give part of your cpf contributions to your wife even if she is earning her own income (now THAT I will have a problem with).<br><br>However, we'll have to wait for more details (e.g. how many % to contribute, other conditions etc) before commenting further on the issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the law is neutral gender in general. both party may seek ancillary relief or maintenence in the event of marital separation or divorce. however, it is a reality that there is a marked difference between the salary of a man and a woman even if they do the same job for the same number of years. in addition, the years that women take to look after their kids full time means that when they re-enter the workforce, they are force to undertake work at a lower salary or to take a part time job. thus it seems that the women is always the one that gets away with the money in times of divorce. man can apply for ancillary relief if they had been supported by their wives during the course of the marriage. but few guys seek this way out due to the 'face' issue and that not many guys earn less than their partners.<br><br>on the issue of housing, if there are no children and the flat is in joint tenancy, then the house would be sold and the remaining money after the bank loan is paid is split 50-50. if there is a child of the marriage, then priority of housing will go to the parent with care of the child as it is in the best interest of the child and the court would have first consideration to the child's welfare. thus the house may be transfered to the parent with care's name (usually mother). the husband may choose to either transfer outright to avoid paying maintenance or he could keep the flat in his name and continue paying the mortgage and negotiate for no maintenance. the effect is that once the child reaches 18, the house can be sold and the money split between the parties either 50-50 in joint tenancy or if in tenancy in common, the shares that were agreed.<br><br>so if there is a divorce, it is essential that u seek a family law specialist to help u negotiate these things. this is particularly impt if your partner is hostile.<br><br>a little off topic but to show why the law appears to favour women.<br><br>fact is that you can make all the gender neutral laws you want, but the reality is that there are significant difference in the  expectations of man and woman. and the law will appear gender bias.</div>
