            <div class='col-md body'>According to the twisting minds of these feminist-pigs, women have "options" but men have "obligations".. thanks to the feminist-infested media, they've been brainwashed to actually think that being greedy &amp; materialistic is actually a "virtue"..<br><br>They genuinely believe that it's being "pragmatic" to go after a man's money.. Yet, they lie &amp; deceive men into believing that women just want a " loving &amp; caring" man..<br><br>Did you noice the force-fed adverts from the Jewellry adverts just before V-day? Apparently if you don't get her a diamond, it means you don't love her.. So we guys spend our hard-earned to get her the diamond and what-ever material comfort in life to " show" that we really love her.. BUT when it comes to wife duties, everything will be share.. Are that the equality that YOU were talking about ??<br><br>Feminism pretends to be about "equal rights." In fact, it is an elite campaign to de-populate and de-stabilize society by promoting lesbian dysfunction.. Most people get their sense of identity and self worth from family..

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Lim Beh Ka Li Kong:</div><div class="quote_body">Harlow, why can't we see the men as the link btw the mum and the child? Would the courts buy my argument and pay me half HER asset???</div></blockquote>Does a housewife have assets worth mentioning of her own (unless you're referring to the rich tai-tais here or wives of people like the Hongkong actor Francis Ng)? Generally these women don't. What they get is what their husbands hand to them and perhaps a credit card that can be cancelled at his whim. Many housewives are at the mercy of their breadwinning husbands and really the law should protect these women. In the majority of instances I'd say the housewlfe DOES do something in the house. From what I've seen so far, generally when there is a maid involved there is more than one child in the family. It can be difficult for a woman to handle more than one young child, do the housework, grocery shopping, etc while the husband works to maintain the family. It's a two way street.<br><br>I would agree though that perhaps it is time for the courts to start considering a working woman's personal assets as a part of the matrimonial assets to be divided between both parties coz chances are with both parents working, both will have to contribute to household chores and bringing up the children after work. In some cases, the husbands take on a greater parental role than the wives.<br><br>All said, I still believe a housewive needs more security and protection that the law should provide for her if she has given up her a career to stay at home for her man.  If she had chosen her career over the welfare of her children and home, she may well be earning a lot more than her husband. This is not uncommon in these times.<br><br>The government does provide benefits for men who have served national service, whether they are active in NS or downgraded with whatever medical condition - more NSS shares, ERS shares, first time salary increment when you start a job, etc. Isn't it time the housewife is accorded some benefit?</div>
