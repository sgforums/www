We were attracted by the Topless 5 promotion that was featured in the 39 Days of Fabulous Treats promotion and specially went down to Swensen at Parco Bugis Junction at 4pm to enjoy the Topless 5. However, what was lined up for 12 of us when we reach there was plain disappointment.<br><br>We were shocked at being informed that the Topless 5 promotion was already over and has been changed to another dinner promotion after we were seated for about 10 minutes. There was no one to informed us  before we enter the restaurant. No one informed us while we were seated in the restaurant. Only when we were about to make our orders, then the manager of the outlet came over and inform us that the Topless 5 promotion is over.<br><br>My friend had called up Swensen located at Parco Bugis Junction to make a reservation yesterday but was informed that reservation service is not available on Sunday. The person who answered the call did not inform her of the change in the promotion. When we saw the 39 Days of Fabulous Treats promotion, it was never stated that the promotion is divided into 2 parts Â– the first being the Topless 5 promotion and the second part being the dinner promotion. When we checked with the manager, all he could say was he is just following orders and he is also not sure about the SwensenÂ’s website. He told us that the Topless 5 promotion was over 3 days ago and he had also encounter many customers still visiting the Swensen outlet in anticipation of the Topless 5 promotion. This shows that the general public had not known of the different parts of the promotions. When I checked with my friends, they reflected to me that nothing was ever stated that the 39 Days of Fabulous Treats promotion actually consist of 2 parts.<br><br>If the staff that we had asked was the waiter or waitress, I could accept that they are not in a position to know the details of promotions changes and plans. But the fact that the staff we seek clarification from was the manager of the outlet, it definitely reflected very badly on the ability and knowledge of the people at the management level of the outlets.<br><br>Our mood was affected by the whole incident and sad to say, we even lost our appetite to have our dinner there. It became a wasted trip and we just left the place, without any ice cream or meal to fill our stomach. Disappointment was the only word to describe what we felt. Disappointed at the promotion. Disappointed at the management.<br><br>This whole incident had really reflected badly on Swensen. Now we will have to think twice again before visiting any Swensen outlets or go for SwensenÂ’s promotions.<br><br>Regards,<br>*********</div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;"><br>not bad sia!!<br><br>DA got change the grammar, tenses and typo errors... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></div>
