            <div class='col-md body'>That's heaps of questions you've raised, gasband.  Chuckle...  On that note, I'd like to add a thing on how the small luggage size that Chinese kungfu heroes carry.  Notice when they open those bundles, there seems to be more stuff than what you'd think there was? I mean, I see bundles of cloth, gold pieces, and  a bun or 2.  And sometimes, even a manual.  Maybe they were trained by the army to pack their gear.  Chuckle...<br><br>Here's another one from me.  Remember those classic films or series when they have people from the future visitng us? They all seem to be wearing the same ol' thing.  It's the silver one-piece suit with the V-front design and knee high boots.<br><br>One more for the road.  Y'all might have thought about it heaps.  This was something I noticed in classic war movies.  The unlimited amount of ammunition a dude has in just one magazine...<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking about ninja movies, I was quite a big fan of those B-grade movies like Revenge of the Ninja.  So much so that I began scouring books on ninjitsu and the mysterious arts of the shadow warriors.  Here's my big question.  How did they manage to disappear just by throwing some egg bomb on the ground?  They're like in the open.  Oh, oh!  How about those ninjas who seem to be able to burrow through the earth faster than a mole?  Sheesh...  I don't think that's pretty smart 'cause any one could see their burrow trail from the surface.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Possum's question on the swords - there is/might be a logical explanation for this.<br><br>In today's boxing matches, they always state the guys reach and the power of his punch. Lets the opponent know what he's facing. For example, if his reach is 3 ft and his opponent's is 3 ft 1 in, then he better duck faster than he can punch.<br><br>Regarding the sword, the length and weight lets the opponent know the reach, and also an indication of how fast it moves, and how heavy a blow it can deal (at a certain speed). The name of the sword gives an indication of who made it and when/where it was made - lets you know the hardness, sharpness, balance, centre of gravity, etc of the sword. The history of the sword gives an indication of who held it - very much like classifying a Stradivarius as a Guanari (prob wrong spelling for both, but what the heck).<br><br>So, declaring your sword is quite a serious matter in those times.

They seem to always have this long 'justifying' speech to give to the hero whilst holding the gun to their head.  I think the Austin Powers movie tried to show that.  Dr. Evil's son just kept going, 'C'mon, dad, I'll do it.  I'll take a gun and boom!'<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
