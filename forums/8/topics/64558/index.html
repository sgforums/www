            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">By Nicholas Fang<br><br>STRAIGHT TALK<br><br>I RECENTLY got whipped by a girl.<br><br>Now, before anyone gets excited, I mean I was beaten in a sporting contest by a female and, after the crying had stopped, it got me thinking about how a situation like this might affect things between men and women.<br><br>I like to think of myself as being vaguely athletic.<br><br>I've enjoyed different sports like swimming, cycling, the triathlon, the modern pentathlon and, most currently, fencing.<br><br>It was in the latter sport that I got beaten by a girl.<br><br>Granted she was a very good fencer, being a member of the Chinese national fencing team, about 1.83m tall, tough as nails and pretty sneaky too.<br><br>But still.<br><br>I guess some residual machismo in me that survived the persistent pressures to be sensitive and New Age left me feeling a little aggrieved.<br><br>After all, I was bigger, stronger and had been fencing for about the same number of years as she had.<br><br>But it definitely wasn't the first time I'd been beaten by a girl.<br><br>There were faster female swimmers training with me when I started swimming at the age of five.<br><br>And there were faster female runners in triathlons who would occasionally catch up with me on the run portion of a race.<br><br>In the pentathlon - which consists of swimming, running, shooting, fencing and horse show-jumping - there were better shooters and horse-riders of the fairer sex.<br><br>Heck, I was recently beaten by a female colleague at bowling too.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. I don't have anything against strong women.<br><br>I was brought up single-handedly by my mother for most of my life, and she remains a strong and wise influence.<br><br>I have always respected strong women who have moved beyond tradition and stereotype to achieve more than what society says they can, and I believe this is an admirable trait for anyone to have, be they male or female.<br><br>The sporting arena itself has long since lost its status as an all-male domain, with female uber-athletes making waves.<br><br>In its current issue, American sports and adventure magazine Outside pays homage to '25 Sports and Adventure Goddesses Who Rule'. The list recognises triathletes, round-the-world sailors, mountain climbers and Olympic swimmers.<br><br>Women athletes have made great strides in the past century when you consider how it wasn't that long ago that the Olympics only allowed men to compete in long-distance running events as these were considered too tough for women.<br><br>Today, we look up to stars like tennis players Serena and Venus Williams, golfer Annika Sorenstam and Singapore's own table-tennis heroines Jing Junhong and Li Jiawei.<br><br>These athletes serve as inspiration to millions of young women who dream of experiencing the beauty and power of sports.<br><br>But what is a guy to do when he gets beaten by a woman? Especially if she is not some Amazonian behemoth with steroid-induced acne and more facial hair than us but actually attractive?<br><br>I must admit that I've always found toned muscles and lithe, athletic female forms alluring.<br><br>But would a pummelling at the hands of such a girl dash any chances I might have with her for action of a more romantic kind?<br><br>And if she beats me, should I slink away in shame? Or is it still possible to salvage a dignified relationship?<br><br>After speaking to a few female athletes who, at the peak of their game, would have given most guys a run for their money, I was pleasantly encouraged that all might not be lost should I actually lose.<br><br>My friend Joo Lee, 24, a former top schoolgirl sprinter, said that whether or not she beats a guy at sports is not crucial. And she should know.<br><br>As a teenager, the times she ran for the 100m sprint would have qualified her for the boys finals at that time.<br><br>'Sport is just one aspect of life. I would hope that whatever I find attractive and of value in a person encompasses more than just how he performs in sports,' she said.<br><br>This view was shared by Cheryl, another friend who holds two national swimming records and was a top swimmer in her teens.<br><br>'Personally, beating a guy may give me a boost in terms of confidence, but it wouldn't change my impression of him as a person,' said Cheryl, 24, who has since developed a passion for surfing.<br><br>'I look for other factors such as whether or not we share interests and can interact.'<br><br>I wasn't sure if they were just trying to make me feel better, but a casual poll of male friends revealed that not too many of them seemed to be bothered by the prospect of losing a sporting competition to a woman.<br><br>A former male colleague pointed out: 'It shouldn't be an issue unless we lose to them at everything, because then that would make us losers and that's never attractive.'<br><br>So maybe losing to a girl isn't that big a deal at all.<br><br>In fact, Cheryl said that as a competitive person, beating someone, especially a guy, always brings a smile to her face.<br><br>And making a girl smile, I suppose, is never a bad thing.<br><br>So if any girl out there wants to beat me at sports, I'm game - as long as she doesn't have more facial hair than I do.</span><br><br>Okay... being beaten by a woman in any particular event is no big deal... Really. As long as she does NOT belong to da "Ru Hua" category... (U noe... da look-like-guy who digs nose......)<br><br>&gt;___&lt;</div>
