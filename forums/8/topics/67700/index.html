            <div class='col-md body'>From The Newpaper:-<br><br>Fanntasy life<br><br>Obsessed fan got night-jobs so she could spend days chasing Fann Wong<br><br>Earned $800 but bought designer to please her idol<br>FOR four years, Fann Wong was the centre of her life. Ms H E Lim was so blindly devoted that she would spend all her waking hours following the MediaCorp star wherever she went, dreaming that one day she could be Fann's friend.<br><br>After completing her O levels in 1998, Miss Lim, 22, quit school and began spending her time tracking Fann.<br><br>'I didn't think of what I wanted to do in the future. Fann was all I could think of. I just wanted to spend my days with her,' she said.<br><br>'I only liked Fann out of all the other MediaCorp celebrities because she's nice and sweet-looking. When I met her for the first time, she was friendly and chatted with me. I found her sincere to her fans,' said Miss Lim.<br><br>'I was curious about her life as a celebrity and I thought that if I become her real friend, I would know everything about her.'<br><br>She laid out her plans to chase Fann, and looked for a night job so she would be free to pursue Fann during the day.<br><br>Miss Lim got herself a job as a night-shift production operator, working from 7pm to 7am the next day and was paid about $8 per hour.<br><br>'In just two weeks, I earned more than $800. I could afford to buy gifts for Fann and pay for taxi fares to follow her around during filming,' recalled Miss Lim.<br><br>'I would save up to buy branded leather goods for Fann as I felt that she wouldn't use normal stuff. I also bought dozens of wet tissues for her as she often needed them during filming.'<br><br>She worked six days a week, and after work, she would rush home to catch a few hours' sleep.<br><br>By 11am, she would be out chasing Fann.<br><br>'I would get tip-offs from people who worked with Fann about where she would be and I would go and look for her there,' she said.<br><br>'If she was filming at TCS, I would wait outside the gate for her to come out. If she was holding a press conference at a hotel, I would wait outside the hotel's function room where the press conference was held.<br><br>'And if she wasn't filming or being interviewed by reporters, she would be doing her hair at Passion Hair Salon.'<br><br>It was never difficult for Miss Lim to track Fann.<br><br>'I know people who work near Passion Hair Salon. They would call me whenever they saw Fann there.'<br><br>Miss Lim would willingly put herself at the celebrity's beck and call.<br><br>'Once Fann asked me to help her buy some bread when she was getting her hair done,' she recalled.<br><br>'I was so happy that out of the few fans who were there with me, she picked me.<br><br>'I ran down about four streets and finally found the type of bread I thought Fann would like.<br><br>'It was not unusual to wait for four to five hours outside Passion Hair Salon. I would take the same lift with Fann as she was leaving the building. I would ask her how her day was, and where she was heading to.'<br><br>'Do I sound like a pervert?'<br><br>Miss Lim only had time off when the artiste wasn't in town.<br><br>Even so, she would be busy surfing the Internet at home for updates on Fann's overseas activities.<br><br>'I had no real friends as my friends were fellow fanatic-fans of Fann. We don't care about each other. All of us only cared about Fann,' said Miss Lim.<br><br>Miss Lim's parents, who own a noodle stall in a food centre, were not aware of her activities.<br><br>After three years of chasing Fann on only a few hours of sleep every day, Miss Lim started to feel the fatigue.<br><br>'I lost about 7kg and began waking up later and later each day. Sometimes I would sleep till the late afternoon. By the time I woke up, it was too late to go anywhere as I had to prepare for work at 7pm,' she said.<br><br>'One day I asked myself why I didn't feel sad when I didn't see her for a few days. I realised I was no longer willing to sacrifice my sleep for Fann.'<br><br>But on weekends, the chase continued.<br><br>'I didn't have anything else to do. It took me about a year to stop that habit. That was because I found a new pastime - watching Hong Kong drama serials at home.'<br><br>As time passed, Miss Lim felt that work at the factory was mundane.<br><br>'I vowed to leave,' she said.<br><br>'Soon I found a new job as a clerk, earning about $1,200 a month, working from 8am to 6pm, and only on Mondays to Fridays.'<br><br>And this year, she enrolled in a part-time diploma course in business administration.<br><br>'I wanted to upgrade myself. I've made new friends in school and we go out together at weekends,' said Miss Lim.<br><br>She is full of regret for spending four years of her life chasing Fann.<br><br>'I've lost touch with all my friends from secondary school. Now I feel stupid that I've wasted my time looking for friendship with Fann and neglecting those real friends I made in school,' she said.<br><br>'But I'm glad I realised it now and it's time for me to move on. I'm begining to build my dreams.'<br><br>She no longer dreams of being Fann's friend - just getting a degree and a better job.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The article continues....<br><br>'I wanted to hurt her for ignoring me'<br><br>ADULATION is a double-edged sword. It can turn and cut a celebrity in an instant.<br><br>For one Fann fanatic Amy (not her real name), that instant was when her star wouldn't pose for a photograph.<br><br>Amy had become a Fann-follower after the latter bagged three prestigious Star Awards in 1995.<br><br>'Sometimes she would smile, wave to me and talk to me like she knew me well,' she said.<br><br>'She would treat me like more than just an ordinary fan because she would touch my hand or put her arm around my shoulder when we chatted. But other times, she acted strangely like she didn't really know me,' said Amy.<br><br>'One day, Fann asked for my name. And when she first called me by my name, I was very touched.'<br><br>'I would also ask for permission to take pictures with her. She always obliged. She used to be so kind and beautiful,' added Amy, who used to be one of the fans who regularly waited for Fann outside Passion Hair Salon.<br><br>But her devotion took a turn more than two years ago at a public event.<br><br>'I went up to her and asked if we could pose for a photograph together but she pretended not to see me and left,' recalled Amy.<br><br>The 22-year-old sales assistant felt hurt and betrayed.<br><br>'I'd been so faithful to her and that was how she treated me. I thought she didn't deserve my love any more.'<br><br>Then the terror started.<br><br>'I wanted to hurt her just like how she had hurt me when she ignored me. I wanted her to know that she had lost a real fan,' said Amy.<br><br>According to Amy, she had showed Fann her middle finger on a few occasions.<br><br>'I could see that she was upset too and I thought to myself that I had achieved what I wanted,' she said.<br><br>'I've also used vulgar language with her. Other fans were angry, and scolded me for being childish.'<br><br>She was not the only one: Another disgruntled fan even put a carrot in the exhaust pipe of her car - but Fann was warned by her other, more loyal, followers.<br><br>Amy has since stopped following Fann.<br><br>'I threw away all things related to Fann. Now I don't even have a single picture of us taken together,' she said.<br><br>Fann Wong was unavailable to comment, as she was rushing off to China.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br>Psychologist: 'They do it to feel important'<br><br>TEENAGERS are idealistic and like to see themselves as a personality, someone who is ideal and important, said Dr Yam Keng Mun.<br><br>'But not all teenagers go to the extreme of chasing TV or movie stars,' said the psychologist from Camden Medical Centre.<br><br>'These teenagers like to get close to their idols, someone whom they like to see themselves as. Being with their favourite TV star makes them feel they're also important.'<br><br>That explains why going to public appearances or press conferences of their idols are important, added Dr Yam.<br><br>'Some teenagers tend to bring this into adulthood,' said Dr Yam.<br><br>'On occasions when these fans feel that celebrities have let them down, they can get very resentful.'<br><br>'It becomes dangerous when there's a lot of bitterness and these fans do things to endanger someone else's life. It's their way of getting back and attracting attention.'<br><br>Teenagers who are extremely infatuated with celebrities tend to be more alone and isolated than those who spend more time in school activities, said Dr Yam.<br><br>'It is important to find out how these teenage fans see themselves,' said Dr Yam.<br><br>'Maybe they feel that no one likes them and they just want to be in the company of people who are popular.'</div>
