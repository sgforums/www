Call it bad luck or whatever but it is just so damn unfair.

Do the organisation think lowly of junior officers? They are holding the same educational level as us.<br><br>Everytime something happens, they will use regulars or NS SOs to take charge. And us, the junior officers will be called around like fucking little dogs.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't quite follow here. Let's see if I get what you're saying. If by NSF junior and senior officers you refer to 2LTs and LTAs and how the former are treated like dirt by the latter, well, should that come as any surprise? The same goes no matter what vocation or rank you hold. Seniors have a knack of treating juniors in a high-handed manner. Perhaps their behaviour can be considered as reprehensible in many cases, but the rationale behind different levels of responsibility, and not merely in the SAF, is the same as that of master and apprentice. Learn and you'll take over the job eventually. Sure, you think you can do better. You'll get your chance to prove it.<br><br>It's usually a vicious cycle - one takes a lot of shit from his seniors, so he gets the idea that his juniors shouldn't have an easy time and dishes out the same kind of shit.<br><br>If there are inequities to ponder, it imght be more worthwhile to consider these situations :<br><br>a) You mentioned educational level. What about other ranks as compared to officers then? For instance, both are A-level students heading for the U, but the officer orders the medic around. How do you feel about that?<br><br>b) Why should experienced warrant officers who have been in the army for over 20 years address a little 19 year old NSF punk meekly as "sir" and take his orders? Doesn't that rile you in the least bit?<br><br>Personally I think these complaints will all but vanish if people treated one another with respect and fairness.</div>
