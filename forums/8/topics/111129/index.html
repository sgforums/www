            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. As usual, this is purely my own opinions.. so shoot me down whenever u feel im wrong.<br><br>I believe that most relations revolve around these 3 steps:<br><br>1st, Attraction: It is essential because without Attraction people won't even make the first step to get to know another person... and if you dont even get close to a person.. how can you love her? However, this stage alone isn't love. Probably just a crush or what. Attraction can be either physically, intellectually, emotional or financially (the worse reason, but yet sadly, it happens.).. and many other reasons.<br><br>People find themselves attracted to another person because they believe that they find something in that person that is important to them. People usually mistake this for love (Especially the physical attraction part). I believe this is because they tend to be "in love" with what they see in that person (whichever area they are attracted to) and belive that it is love to the ENTIRE person.<br><br>2nd, Love: This is the part after attraction, where people really spend the time to get to know the other person.. and realize that it is more than just the initial attraction to that certain aspect of that person. They start to enjoy each other's company and hence, grow to love and like that person.<br><br>However, passion only lasts 3years... but i believe love lasts longer.. however, most people who do not fall in love, or fall out of love.. still tend to stay together due to the next reason<br><br>3rd, Attachment: Stuff like "we've been together so long...", "we've had such wonderful memories", "without him/her my life will be incomplete" aren't reasons of love.. but rather, attachment.<br><br>Even when pple fall out of love, they stay together becoz they are attached. Imagine a story book... not every chapter is the climax, not every chapter is funny or nice.. but some chapters just help to progress the plot, or give closure. If you take it out, the story doesnt really have any meaning, or cannot continue. That is the same case, i guess... The person isn't the love of your life anymore, but u just can't let go.. coz he/she has become such a big part of your life.<br><br>At the first and third stage, pple often get hurt, coz in the first stage, they tend to be too focused on that aspect that they love and get disappointed when they learn that a person is MUCH MORE than just that! But once they get to the 2nd stage, they're safe. Some pple either just skip to third stage, or after 2nd, go to third. People get hurt here too.. coz the love decreases and then, becoz of all the wrong reasons, they stay together, being under the impression of love.. and tend to neglect the other party, not treating him/her the way a lover would.<br><br>Well... what do you guys think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Am i right, or am i just being biased again?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>below are juz my personal opinions...<br>i think it's not easy to describe how we could "fall in love" cos no one exactly knows how it's like until we've been into it and experience for ourselves. we can't understand it fully cos it's not what we could do so in juz only a short period of time or say in 1 or 2 relationships... sometimes it could juz happen out of nowhere or even until when we're really old... it takes a lifetime to understand ourselves, all the more so it takes to understand what "love" really is (in our own context)...<br>though love may hurts sometimes but i believe it does brings it's own happiness at times and that's what many ppl often forelooked...<br>"love" is a very complex thing, only time and experiences will determine for ourselves what it is...<br>love is powerful yet powerless<br>love is selfish yet selfless<br>love bears all sins yet drives us to commit them<br>love is strong and yet weak<br>love can take years and years to come by<br>love can be gone in the blink of an eye<br>love is meaningful yet at times quite meaningless<br>love can be friendly yet at times leave you friendless<br>love is something that cannot be bought or sold<br>love is worth more than the purest gold<br>love makes us laugh and yet makes us cry<br>love makes us happy and yet makes us sigh<br>love is the blessing that guides us in sorrow<br>love is the sun that brings on tomorrow...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad but true that in many cases, couples who are together tend to forget that they still love each other.  They think they have fallen out of love.<br><br>At all times, try to go back to 2nd Stage to rekindle the feelings and be reminded why both are together in the first place.  Try doing something different once in a while like going on holidays, celebrate anniversary of the relationship etc.  Do special and new things on special occasions.<br><br>There are workshops for couples to attend.  In fact, Catholic Churches do offer that to couples who are more for at least 5 years.  The purpose is for the couple to renew their marriage vows and rekindle their courtship feelings.</div>
