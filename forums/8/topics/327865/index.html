              <p>no more FTs, clones due to vast advances in DNA and computer technology.  a human can be cloned in 24 hours in a cyrotube in the year 3000. These clones will work and work for free like a slave and earn money for the economy. Due to their altered genes, they have the ability to feel emotions taken away. NGOs and human rights groups would have made sure the govs all over the world will have banned such a morally wrong technology but SG will embrace it. but i think something closer will happen earlier 500 years from now, singaporean cyborgs, robots  who can work 24 hrs per day, 7 days a week but still talk and walk like a human. They have an artificial intelligence, state of the art. If trade in human organs made legal now, its very possible anything can happen in sg</p>
              <p> watch the movies Steven Spielberg's AI or The Island to get an idea.</p>
              <p>Only a small group humans will stay in an isolated region in the year 3000, when half the world is covered in ice age or 3000 feet below sea level. The human kids will hear tales of the blue fairy and try frantically searching for her in vain .</p>

              <p><strong>1.2.1  	Science and Technology to Respond to Demographic Change</strong><br><br>Summary<br>  As a nation facing an aging society with fewer children it is necessary to bear and raise healthy children, maintain health throughout life and stretch the potential abilities of each individual to the fullest. To achieve this there is a need to clarify the mechanisms of biological phenomena and various diseases, and to develop the means to prevent, diagnose and treat diseases. In addition more effective welfare tools should be developed to assist the elderly in being independent and participating in society, as well as to reduce the burden on care-givers, and working styles providing a better balance with private life should be achieved by making it possible to simultaneously work and raise children as well as allowing active elderly people to contribute to society through further promotion of telecommuting and lifelong learning utilizing IT (information technology). Such efforts will be effective not only for distributing the burden imposed by an aging society with fewer children, but also for changing the trend of fewer children by altering the balance between family and the workplace.<br></p>
              <p>Cyborg technology<br>  Research is progressing on cyborg technology, replacing some of the functions of the body by applying neuro-engineering, which is technology that makes use of brain information. Muscles are the devices that drive the hands and legs, and operate according to electric pulse signals that run through the nerves. If it were possible to read these signals, and feed them to an external drive device (a motor, etc. to produce motion instead of the muscles), it might be possible to cause an external device to move using biological signals. This concept is the origin of neuro-engineering.<br>  Even if you lose an arm in an accident, if you think "move arm," the same signals are still transmitted from the brain to the nerves that originally were involved in moving your arm. By reading the electrical signals from those nerves and connecting them to the controller for a robotic arm designed to move in response to those signals, it is possible to create a robotic arm that can be moved like your own arm, simply by thinking, without any other special operations.<br>  Furthermore, there is research being conducted on replicating the sense of touch, so that by attaching touch sensors to an artificial hand, the electrical signals from the sensors can be converted and transmitted through the nervous system. By gaining an understanding of the pattern of the signals that flow throughout the nervous system, it is becoming possible to take signals from external devices and send them as signals that the brain will interpret as signals from an actual sense organ. There is already development being done on artificial eyes and ears using this kind of technology, with more than 60,000 people throughout the world already using this kind of artificial ear.<br> 	 	Left: Autonomous daily-activity support robot that is equipped with soft skin, sight, hearing, sense of smell and sense of touch, and can perform tasks with a delicate touch.<br>Photo courtesy of RIKEN<br>Below: A therapeutic robot designed to help reduce stress for elderly and caregivers<br>Photo courtesy of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>OXFORD, England -- A British university professor has been fitted with cyborg technology enabling his nervous system to be linked to a computer. <br><br>The ground-breaking surgery on Professor Kevin Warwick effectively makes him the world's first cyborg -- part human, part machine. <br><br>Although a long way from fictional characters The Terminator or the Six Million Dollar Man, it is hoped that readings will be taken from the implant in his arm of electrical impulses coursing through his nerves. <br><br>These signals, encoding movements like wiggling fingers and feelings like shock and pain, will be transmitted to a computer and recorded for the first time. <br><br>Similar experiments have previously only ever been carried out on cats and monkeys in the United States. <br><br>Surgeons implanted a silicon square about 3mm wide into an incision in Warwick's left wrist and attached its 100 electrodes, each as thin as a hair, into the median nerve. <br><br>Connecting wires were fed under the skin of the forearm and out from a skin puncture and the wounds were sewn up. <br><br>The wires will be linked to a transmitter/receiver device to relay nerve messages to a computer by radio signal. <br><br>It is possible that the procedure could lead to a medical breakthrough for people paralysed by spinal cord damage, such as Superman actor Christopher Reeve. <br><br>On Friday, Warwick, 48, denied claims that the surgery, which was carried out at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, England, was just a publicity stunt. <br>'Change the world'<br><br>"To go through a two-hour operation I would say is a little bit extreme for a publicity stunt," he told the BBC. <br><br>"To say no you can't do this or this is publicity is absolutely crazy at this stage when we haven't even looked at it." <br><br>He said the £500,000 ($715,000) experiment was about "seriously helping people" with spinal injuries. <br><br>He added: "This has not been done on a human before so for someone to say this is not going to tell us much ... we don't know. <br><br>"We really don't know but we want to find out what sort of signals we are going to get and what sort of signals we can put in." <br><br>Researchers at the university's department of cybernetics will carry out experiments on Warwick for about a month. <br>It is hoped the science could one day help actor Christopher Reeve <br><br><br>He said: "What we're doing is historic and momentous. It is going to change the world. <br><br>"Science fiction has predicted this for quite some time. As a scientist, I'm excited about taking a step into the future. <br><br>"But as a human I do share the ethical concerns about what it will mean for humanity." <br><br>Warwick also hopes to wire himself up to a ultrasonic sensor, used by robots to navigate around objects, to give himself a bat-like sixth sense. <br><br>He believes the technique could be developed within a decade to restore movement to a tetraplegic's hand or feeling to a prosthetic leg used by an amputee. <br><br>"For someone like Christopher Reeve, it might not bring back complex movement. But if it could allow him to control a bit of technology to pick up a cup, it would be enormously useful," he said. <br><br>Warwick has already been a guinea pig for his own experiments. <br><br>In 1998 a silicon chip, which turned on lights and opened doors when he walked into his office, was implanted in his arm. <br><br></p></div>

              <p>They believe some kind of a divine being will appear to end the world.</p>
              <p>But this is not what I believe. What I believe is that the continuing exploitation of natural resources and contribution of pollution with no concrete remedies been done on them, that would bring our civilisation to extinction.</p>

              <p>There would not be much "glam" value if in the year 3000, the situation would not be much different from now - of course, better technology and all that jazz.</p>
              <p>If during the ancient times, they predicted that in the year 2000, life will be pretty much the same only with much better technologies... such prediction or literature would not survive till now, because it would have discarded as "not interesting" and forgotten by future generations.</p>
              <p>This is juz my 3.000 cents worth... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/sunglasses.png" alt="sunglasses.png"></p>
