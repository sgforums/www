            <div class='col-md body'>RP is never a dumping ground. Even if you fail EMS, the worst grade you can get is D7 before you can enter RP. I've not seen one who get an E8 and below for EMS entering RP.<br><br>The same standard also applies to the rest of the polytechnics here (note that it doesn't apply to all courses)<br><br>While RP is may seem like a slacker's place, it's not easy to study here. Besides working in groups everyday, you also have to learn independently. Those who treat RP as a dumping ground realizes this within a month and transfer out.</div>

I'm not saying all is like that, but majority of people who are eligible for JC sci stream usually talk a crazy combo of pure everything. Their pure humans includes either pure geog and pure history or a pure of either with a sub combi of the other one with social studies. And some even take lit as a private sub for os. Followed by pure bio, pure chem and pure physics all together, plus higher MT, A maths, total taking of 9 subjects.<br><br>When you got 9 pure subjects, it will be a sin to not go jc and be a scholar in the future.</div>
