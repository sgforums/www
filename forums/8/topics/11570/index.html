            <div class='col-md body'>An artical send to my e mail.<br><br>Location 1:<br><br>The basketball court which was rumoured to be haunted.<br><br>First encounter with a native islander-Mrs Lam of a provision shop there. A nice quiet old lady in her 50s, I bought a bottle of mineral water and took the chance to asked her about sightings on the island. Immediately she pointed to a basketball court nearby and told me it was rumoured to be haunted.<br><br>The storyby Mrs Lam:<br>In the middle of the night a headless "person" in white would "patrol" this basketball court. Due to one reason or another, this headless soul seems attached to this basketball court. She told me that there have been cases of NPCC cadets spotting this headless soul at the basketball court during their night walk. She also claimed that several other islanders too have seen the white figure.<br><br>From an email from Francis Teo, an ex-NPCC staff sergant from a northern secondary school:<br><br>It was during one of our NPCC camp in Ubin and during our second night I lead a group of 6 juniors for a nightwalk in Ubin. As you know Ubin is an undeveloped island and lack most of the basis infrastructure such as lighting. At that night there was no moonlight at all and armed with a torch each we made our way from the camp site around Ubin. Being the superstitious type, I made it a point not to venture near the cemetary which was rumoured to be haunted and headed towards the jetty-approximately 3-4km walk from the camp site.<br><br>After a two hour walk, we reached the Pulau Ubin Community Center. As we had a water parade earlier before we left the camp, 3 of my juniors needed to go to the washroom. Thus the rest of us went to the basketball court. One of my junior Wee Keong being a basketball freak started to make attempts to jump and touch the basketball ring boasting that he could dunk. Everyone else's attention was on him as my juniors started teasing each other. Suddenly at the corner of my eye I spotted a white figure. I turned to the side and saw a headless white figure drifting towards us!<br><br>You could have imagine how d*mned scared I felt then and I immediately gathered the rest and told them to head back for the camp without turning back. Within 45 minuted we reached the camp and when questioned, I told my juniors honestly what I saw and it scared the sh*t out of them. Because of this incident, all night walks were cancelled for other juniors.<br><br>Another story on the basketball court:<br>This story is contributed by David Thia.<br>I was a NPCC cadet back in my secondary school days and I remembered vividly that during a camp in Ubin, I had the most extraodinary encounter.<br><br>It was about 8 at night and after some drills the staff sergant told us to fall in on the basketball court (I believe there is only one on Pulau Ubin) for our water parade. The Staff Sergant told us to number off and we were in rows of 3s. "1,2,3,4,5,6......6 rows and no blank files Staff Sergant" the last man reported. "And 1 man behind!" someone shouted! You might not believe this but my Staff Sergant was real angry. Altogether there were 19 of us including the Staff Sergant and where did the extra man came from? The Staff Sergant told us off and warned that if we were to play a fool again we would have to finished the entire bottle of water as a punishment.<br><br>As a result we numbered off again. "1,2,3,4,5,6......7!" someone shouted again. This time the Staff Sergant shone his torch at the 6th row where the sound came from and he saw the guys in the 6th row shivering. This time he sensed that something was wrong and with just a half moon that night there was just barely enough light for us to see.<br><br>Immediately the Staff Sergant quickly lead us away from the basketball court and we were ordered to jog briskly back to camp. The horrifying part, the last 3 man at the end of the file heard someone jogging about 5m behind them all the way to the camp site.<br><br>Back at the camp, the Staff Sergant told us to do a buddy check instead of getting us to number off and told us to go back to sleep promptly.<br><br>Up to this day, none of my NPCC cadets confessed playing any tricks that night and we all concluded that "someone" had been with us that night.<br><br>Could it be another cadet who died on the island or was it just a wandering soul?<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/valiant91/basketballcourt.jpg"><br><br>------------------<br>A sweet dream it would be<br>To awaken in your arms<br>To be able to kiss your lips<br>To have such a precious gift</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Location 2:<br><br>A haunted house on Pulau Ubin.<br><br>The next story by WenKai on Pulau Ubin:<br><br>Hi,<br><br>I know you all are currently searching information about Pula Ubin, then i have some info to tell you. If u got go to OBS in Pula Ubin before u will notice that the bangs where they stay where along a long path and it's up a hill. i've heard my friends say that at the top of the hill where u walk all the way till the end of the path u will saw 1 big tree and along the path where bangs where the campers stay. they say that at night they saw 1 japanese army officer holding a japanese sword standing under the tree where they where at the second floor af their bangs. and it saw about 2 years ago when i saw in Secondary 3 when our school orgnise a camp at OBS. and it around march 1999. i think this infor can help you all on the searching.<br><br>WenKai<br><br>Tipped off by Liwei, we managed to find this supposedly haunted house. No doubt this house is deserted and looks pretty spooky. It stand alone and there are no other buildings near it.<br><br>The story by Liwei:<br>My ex boyfriend and I love the wildlife and Pulau Ubin is one of our favourite hang outs. We would often cycle all the way to Changi Jetty and bring our own bikes and backpacks over to P Ubin. There is this one night when we were cycling around Ubin at 2 am at night and as it was really really dark then and the lights on our bikes were not strong enough to luminate the paths in front of us, we cycled really slowly. As we passed this deserted white house painted with stripes of blue, I saw a spooky green light from the house. I knew straight away that something is wrong with the house and quickly cycled away.<br><br>The weird thing: after some 30 minutes, we came back to the house again! It was like we were cycling around in circles and within another 30 minutes we were back at the house again! And each time I reached there, the same glowing green light would be there-the strange thing my ex boyfriend cannot see the green light!<br><br>We just simply could not understand why we kept coming back to the same place. We have been to Ubin dozen times and there is no way we could have lost our way. On top of that my boyfriend was a commando back in his NS days and his navigation skills and sense of direction are good.<br><br>Finally we decided to get off our bicycles and walk instead. I was feeling really scared then and tried to dismiss the green light as my imagination running wild and the fatique that was setting in.<br><br>This time we succeed. After 30, 40 minutes of walking we did not see the house. Feeling relieved, we got on the bicycles and started cycling. Weird enough we saw the same house again! By this time my boyfriend told me to get off the bike and we quickly pushed the bikes  on the track again. After a while somehow we reached Nordin beach and saw some anglers there fishing. Feeling relieved we pitched our tents there and spent the night cuddling up as we simply cannot understand why we kept seeing the house.<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/valiant91/hauntedhouse.jpg"><br><br>------------------<br>A sweet dream it would be<br>To awaken in your arms<br>To be able to kiss your lips<br>To have such a precious gift</div>
