            <div class='col-md body'>My humble pt of view is that both actions and words should be combined to make show that you really are sorry for what you have done.  If u say it out (anyone oso know how to say wat) and if u show it through yer actions (some ppl know how to wayang) so itz best if u do both.<br><br>------------------<br>I dun wish to die i just wish for nasty people to die.</div>
