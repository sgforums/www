              <h1 class="title_normal">DBS cuts 900 jobs, reports 38 percent fall in Q3 profit</h1>
              <div class="segment_normal">
              <div class="detail">
              <p>Singapore's
              DBS Group, Southeast Asia's biggest bank by assets, said Friday it was
              cutting 900 staff to trim costs amid the global credit crisis, and
              reported a slump in third quarter net profit.</p>
              <p>Chief executive
              Richard Stanley said most of the cuts, to be carried out at the end of
              the month, will come from its offices in Singapore and Hong Kong and
              will account for six percent of the workforce.</p>
              <p>"To be a streamlined organisation, I believe we must run a tighter ship," he told reporters.</p>
              <p>"We
              have been vigilant on costs but as the economy enters a more difficult
              and uncertain phase, many financial institutions around the world and
              in Asia have made headcount reductions," he added.</p>
              <p>"To be more
              productive and efficient, we will restructure and streamline the
              organisation. Regrettably, this has resulted in the need to reduce our
              workforce by six percent or about 900 people, primarily (in) Singapore
              and Hong Kong, by the end of the month."</p>
              <p>Earlier Friday DBS said
              net profit in the three months to September fell 38 percent as
              market-related income took a hit from the global financial crisis and
              bigger provisions.</p>
              <p>Third quarter net profit totalled 379 million
              Singapore dollars (256 million US), down from 610 million dollars in
              the same period last year, it said in a statement.</p>
              <p>Analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires had predicted an average 572 million dollars net profit.</p>
              <p>"The operating environment is increasingly challenging for financial institutions the world over," Stanley said.</p>
              <p>"We
              took upfront prudential levels of allowances to strengthen our balance
              sheet and with strong capital and liquidity, I believe we are well
              positioned to ride out the uncertainties ahead."</p>
              <p>Net interest
              income in the September quarter grew two percent to 1.07 billion
              dollars from last year but net fee and commission revenues dropped 22
              percent to 316 million dollars.</p>
              <p>Other non-interest income plunged 87 percent on the year to 11 million dollars.</p>
              <p>The
              bank said it set aside 129 million dollars in provisions, compared with
              just 10 million dollars a year ago, partly to cover its collateralised
              debt obligations (CDOs) portfolio.</p>
              <p>CDOs are securities backed by
              a range of assets including bonds, loans and their derivatives,
              including corporate loans, high-grade mortgages, subprime mortgages,
              car loans and credit card debt.</p>
              <p>DBS was the last of three local banks to report earnings for the September quarter.</p>
              <p>Oversea-Chinese
              Banking Corp (OCBC) said earlier this week third quarter net profit
              fell 13 percent while United Overseas Bank reported last week a 5.1
              percent drop in profit for the same period.</p>

              <p>yeah.. i think so..</p>
              <p>thing is, i still want to know how the senile management got them to go sell the things... and if the senile management knew of the hard-sell, or maybe even fraudulent misrepresentations by the sales side..</p>
              <p>or worse, the sales side was misinformed about all these and they went out in good faith to sell the stuff to people..</p>
              <p>either way, someone in the senile management should know of these things... and if they do and still do not stop the things, they should be culpable...</p>
              <p>i wonder how many of the senile management kena the axe... WITHOUT the bloody golden parachute</p>

              <p>definately not, they all knew clearly what they were doing,  while i don't think they were out to cheat us with a faulty product i do feel they were making a choice between us parting with our money or them losing their jobs. its unlikely they knew what they were selling beyond sales talk</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>to meet target management also have pressure so make staff sell more. kinda pity the management, if lower level cannot meet target will kenna sack, meet liao this happen company in trouble also kenna retrenched. don't think lower level management would have any golden parachute.</p>
