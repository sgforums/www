            <div class='col-md body'>Thre has been a tremendous change in the Japanese realm in terms of culture...Back in the ancient times, woman are taught to be family based and also to be a virtous wife, upholding their moral and values. Presently, the morals and values have been atrociously brought down due to the introduction of pornography and prositution for the high school gals.<br><br>They are too inculcated to the western culture even interms of music, most of the rock bands are influenced by Boy George using heavy make up and coloured long hair as well as cross dressing.(Like Shazna and Luna Sea..just to name a few)...They are very good in the musical talents and also composing.Maybe it is a gimmick to attract young adults to listen to their music. In terms of technology, I think Japan is very good at modification rather than R&amp;D of new products...and it is really a good way of retaining brain and human resources..(Which I think is very smart of them)I still remember the very first CD player is first introduced by Phillips and Sony just got the prototype and do some remodification in some of the components as well as the package and design, it has surpassed Phillips in the sale of CD players when it first came out...If there is an anology, I would say that Japan is a very good scanner or photocopier, replicating the exact infomation and just doing some improvements in the design and package..Hey presto!A "new" product is out for grabs!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 04 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*hiaks*<br><br>Terence, you are probably the only one who remembered what I wrote.  :p<br><br>I am not sure what this thread actually purports to prove/disprove or even to critique? It's probably trying to link the beng-ism to japanese influences, although the originator presupposes too much on the ability of readers to construct their own thesis. It also offers the originator a safety zone to distance himself away from any resulting flames by saying, "That's not what I said."<br><br>Isaac, being evasive aside, (and other posts too) show an alarming ignorance of historical continuity. Perhaps this is symptomatic of the tyranny of the present.<br><br>Remember the Far East kids? Checkers? Extremely baggy pants and multiple hair dyes? Well, J-pop has always been part of Singaporean teen life simple because it is a big part of HK and Taiwanese life. Alan Tam's greatest hit "Peng You" was a Japanese song ... and his contempories, Leslie Cheung had numerous hits which were originally Japanese songs. The biggest tearjerker on SBC 8 in the 1982-3 was O-shin. Beng-ism is profoundly influenced by HK and Taiwanese culture and the Japanese influence is through that avenue.<br><br>The point I'm making is that for people like Isaac, only the present is accountable for itself. The lack of self-reflexivity for history continuity continues to puzzle me ... but this could be tied in with a general world trend of condensation of the simulated present. As Eco writes, "we are living in the Middle Ages" ; the present continuous and the flatness of time.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>No universal history leads from savagery to humanitarianism, but there is one leading from the slingshot to the megatonne bomb.<br><br>Adorno</div>

It is an essential element.<br><br>but if u were to compare US singaporeans with the japanese , we are far from them.<br>There are gd n bad too. I did not say they are the best after all.<br><br>N dun always think that we SINGaporeans are always right. Maybe u could travel more and see more b4 u use those words on me or anyother pple here.<br><br>u can dun accept what i say but maybe some one here might agree to what they say .<br><br>cheers this is juz another public forum for us to post our opinons .<br><br></div>
