Why didn't you finish the whole case? You miss the part that Apple in fact got the initial idea of user interface from Xerox PARC. So, no winner in the lawsuit.<br><br>I have question and doubt over the Windows crash you mentioned. I don't seem to have the problem you have. May I know which Windows version you were referring to? I find Windows 2000 and Windows XP are very stable. So, I don't think Windows is a big mess.<br><br>Yes, I do care about myself too, and of course my pocket. That is the one of the reasons I develop on Windows.<br><br>Talking about originality, Mac OS X builds on Unix code also. Do you consider this as rip off too?<br><br>Usually I don't let my Windows go on for 3 months. I will do a power cycle every week. Not because it becomes slow, just I feel I owe the system a fresh start.<br><br>At any rate, I really think Mac OS is a great OS, though I never used it before. To me, Linux, Windows are in the same rank too. They are equally significant. Just Windows has more user base.</div></blockquote>Actually from memory, microsoft got off on a contractual technicality.<br><br>'98 - xp + 2000.  True, Xp and 2000 are very stable compared to previous versions.  But if you have your hands in cold water and put them into water thats room temperature, it feels really hot.  Its relatively stable, compared with previous versions.  But even you have to acknowledge that windows is shoddy.<br><br>apple did hire some people from xerox to work on the idea of a gui.  but these people had been hired at xerox because of their individual work on the concepts.  the work on the concepts predates before xerox parc, and xerox just brought them togehter to define them.<br><br>apples work on the gui is also mentioned in articles to date back to before he visited xerox's reserach center.  also, xerox was using icons as verbs/commands, and apple used them as nouns/objects.<br><br>and osx is based on unix, but theyve built so much on it.  theyve developed it.  and it actually works.  they advertise it too.<br><br>do you see microsoft advertising anything?<br><br>at any rate, if i got a ibm/pc compatible, id be either a vaio or tablet pc.  heh heh.  i used to want one.</div>
