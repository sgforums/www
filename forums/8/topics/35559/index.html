            <div class='col-md body'>Met some unhappy incident with comf*** taxi driver. See below report for more information (pardon me if my grammer is not too good):<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I am writing this to complaint a particular comfort taxi driver.<br>On 16th Feb 2003, at about 2225hrs, I was driving along Cavenagh road turning into Bukit Timah road when a comfort taxi appear before me. This comfort taxi starts to slow down when we were in the filter lane into the Bukit Timah road. As my daughter got herself injury after a fall this night, me and my wife were rushing her to K K Hospital. This particular taxi driver purposely drove slowly after I started to horn him. I knew that he purposely drove slowly because the road at that time was deserted, and so he could not have slow down for oncoming vehicles.<br>At this point of time, I was really angry and decide to overtake him from his right and so I can turn left at the junction of Kampong Java road and Bukit Timah road. But when I started to pick up my speed to overtake him, he too started to increase his speed, slowly one lane by one lane, I was forced to the rightest lane of Bukit Timah road bacause he kept increasing his speed, not allowing me to overtake. For your information, I did show obvious indications that I wanted to overtake him, but he obviously wasn't giving much care to these. As I drove near him, I could see that he is in his early 50s or mid 50s and wasn't carrying any passengers.<br>I knew I would not be able to overtake him if he keeps increasing his speed, so I decides to slow down in order to make my left turn just before the traffic light.<br>Seriously I have been on the road for about 6 years, and I never come across any taxi drivers like this before. And my impression for comfort taxi before this incident was pretty good, believing that comfort taxi service surpasses other taxi companies. BUT after this incident, I doubt so.<br>Unfortunately, I was unable to take down the vehicle plate number as I was in a hurry, but I would still like to write this to your company to inform you about this unhappy incident. Fortunately, my daughter did not suffer any serious injury despite that she had fractured her collar bone 3 weeks ago. It was dark and wet that night and accident could have happened if one of us was not careful enough. Finally, I would still like your company to look into this incident seriously and hope to see improvements in your taxi drivers. </span><br><br>For your info, this is a true story from me, not just bo liao people writing story just to pass time. Just like to share my experience with my fellow friends here.<br>So what's your comment? Boycott comf*** taxi? I would as much as possible, boycott them.</div>
