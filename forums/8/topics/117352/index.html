            <div class='col-md body'>the problem with so many broken relationships is because many people out there are desperate and just go for anyone they can grab hold on..<br><br>trust me and spend more time widening ur social circle and spending time with ur family.. doing this exposes you more to other kinds of people.. and then you can secretly choose which one suits you best and try to win his/her heart over...<br><br>good luck buddy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
