I'm focused on making sure that strong commitment is really there, that people can see that vision. And I put together a little video that shows one way that working with one person at Microsoft I really did get the message across. Let's take a look."<br>[Film begins, first scene opens in stark interrogation room, with Steve Ballmer and agents on opposite sides of a table.]<br><br>Agent, speaking slowly: "We've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Ballmer. It seems you've been living an alternate life. In one life, you're Steven A. Ballmer, CEO for a respectable software company. The other life is lived in computers, where you go by the hacker alias, "Steve-o." One of these lives has a future. The other does not. Let's have a look, shall we?"<br><br>[Attempts to get computer to work, pounds on keys, camera angle shifts to show itÂ’s a Linux box. Comdex crowd laughs and claps. On screen, in interrogation room, Ballmer watches, amused.]<br><br>Agent, hushed aside to assistant: "I need you to write a new device driver and recompile the kernel."<br><br>Agent to Ballmer: "We know that you've been contacted by a certain visionary. My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you, but I believe you wish to do the right thing. [Phone rings.] We're willing to wipe the slate clean, give you a fresh start. [Phone still ringing] Would you get that? [irritated, to assistant]."<br><br>[Assistant answers, hands phone to Ballmer]: "ItÂ’s for you."<br><br>Ballmer: "Hello?"<br><br>[There's a zapping sound, and Ballmer disappears. The film shifts to a new scene, with Gates as the Laurence Fishburne character, Morpheus, wearing Matrix-style garb and sunglasses, approaching Ballmer from across a darkened room.]<br><br>Gates: "At last. Welcome Steve-o. ... Have you ever had a dream that was so real, you weren't sure you were dreaming? Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is, but I can show you, and after this, there is no turning back. You take the big blue pill [shows him pill with IBM and Linux logos] and this story ends. You wake up in your bed, and armies of consultants are running around the IT world. You take the red pill [with Microsoft logo], you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how to ensure innovation frees the [inaudible]."<br><br><img src="http://www.winsupersite.com/images/reviews/comdex2003_day01_06.jpg"><br><br>[Scene shifts]<br><br>Gates continues: "For years, I've watched them do it. They'd send thousands of consultants into the world to convince companies to outsource their information technology. But we see the world differently. Steve-o, you will deliver software breakthroughs that will enable the seamless sharing of information between desktops, servers and all types of devices. It's time for us to take it back. Our first step is to visit the Oracle."<br><br>Ballmer: "I think I can safely say we can just skip that step."<br><br>Gates: "Right. Let's get straight to your training."<br><br>Ballmer: "But they've got armies of consultants!"<br><br>Gates: "Free your mind, Steve-o. In here, we can equip you with the tools you need to succeed in your fight against those armies. Clear your mind. Think about what you need."<br><br>[More activity, Matrix-style fight scene ensues, with Gates and Ballmer doing their own imitations of the acrobatic stunts. Comdex crowd laughs.]<br><br>Gates: "Ow! Â… You are the one. It is time for you to deliver the truth. Â… Steve-o, you've got what you need to deliver every new innovation to our customers. It's time for them to unlock their potential. It's time for a change."<br><br>[Rock music blares, Ballmer, in Matrix garb, walks confidently from phone booth, evidently on Microsoft's Redmond campus. Video clip ends.]<br><br>Gates, back live on Comdex stage: "Well, we got Steve indoctrinated." Crowd laughs.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
