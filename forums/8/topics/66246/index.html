            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by 12 Angry Cocks</span><br><br>In view of SingaporeÂ’s economic situation, a government scholar has suggested that Singapore develop its sports outsourcing sector.<br><br>According to Ministry of Community Development scholar Mr. Louie Chin Ooh Lui, who recently received his Masters in Sycophancy from Oxbridge University, investment in sports tend to be expensive and needs many years of sustained investment before any payback can be achieved.<br><br>"Countries like East Timor should consider asking Singapore to represent them in the SEA games. There would be no need for them to build expensive stadiums and training facilities, no need to buy expensive foreign talents, no need to develop professional native sportsmen. Just pay Singapore a subscription fee and we will fly the flag and win the medals for them. We will even sing their national anthem. It's a win-win deal for both sides."<br><br>When asked how Singapore would do this, considering the generally abysmal sports record of Singaporean athletes, he replied. Â“Just hire some foreigners, lah. As long as the Gahmen, sorry, the country makes money, why you care whoÂ’s getting the job?Â”<br><br>Mr. Chin also brushed aside concerns about any potential conflicts of interest in one country representing two or more countries.<br><br>"Clearly there has to be a paradigm shift. In this era of globalization an athlete can no longer compete for only one country. Just look at David Beckham,Â” he explained. Â“All sportsmen must multi-task. He must compete in twice the number of competitions. This is also to address the issue of high pay for our foreign imports. We make them generate more revenue to cover their costs. After all, how long do you expect us to bleed?"<br><br>When asked if the athletes may face potential identity crises, Mr Chin replied, "We will also be implementing a comprehensive upgrading and training program at our mental health institute, in conjunction with the Internal Security Department, to get them to accept conflicting ideas. They will get a certificate at the end of the course, so no excuse for them to let this affect their performance."<br><br>Mr. Chin added that there would be spin-offs for Singaporeans as well. "If this scheme succeeds, we would need a lot of Singaporeans to be gym cleaners, caddies and boot lickers...er, polishers. We have a standby agreement with WDA and MOM to provide unemployed Singaporeans with these high-paying S$800 to S$1000 jobs. We are glad to provide jobs for Singaporeans. The ball will be in their court. Let's hope they are not choosy."<br><br>The Cabinet has awarded Mr. Chin a grant of $1,500,000 to conduct a feasibility study.<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
