            <div class='col-md body'>SPGs are a MINORITY in SG.. RELAX. Furthermore the hot issue going now throughout the world is DE-WESTERNISATION, meaning DE-anything-with-white-skin and PRO-anything-non-white. Asians are climbing on top and kicking the white men out of their niches. Well anyway that;s the global trend.<br><br>So relaxxxx. Most sg girls prefer their own kind anywayzz.<br><br>Let me relate a story where i met this 'fren' who is an spg, whom i dun know and dun wanna know, just met via a friend who is another spg, not realli friend, but acquatence.<br><br>*Somewhere at a club, i'm with my white friend from USA (tourist i am showing him around) and my eurasian friend (half chinese/eurasian).*<br><br>Me: Ok i'm gonna get u 2 some drinks brb.<br><br>white friend + Eurasian friend: k<br><br>*den out of nowhere i hear my NAME BEING SCREAMED out, by that spg person*<br><br>spg: *MY NAMEE* !!<br><br>*I turn around to see her, saw her long ago la, old school, and i see this BIG TOWERING Dulph Lungren type white guy behind her, prolly German, he;s like 2 m tall, and she is like 1.5 m ROFL*<br><br>Me: Errrr hi.. and u are?<br><br>Spg: Dun u remember ME?<br><br>Me: errrrr.. no<br><br>Spg: I'm blah blah blah, we went to school together blah blah with our mutal fren<br><br>me: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh hi... ahhhh *me looks at her white knight* U must be a friend of our mutual friend (who is an SPG) (i dun like her la, coz she fakes us accent when she's never been to USA)<br><br>spg: hey what;s that supposed to mean? *she looks at her white knight, i could tell from his expression he couldn't speak much english, German*<br><br>me: Hi Dulph! *sarcastically at the white guy*<br><br>White guy: Hmm?<br><br>spg: so i'll see u around? Whoa hey is that ur friend? *she points to my US friend*<br><br>me: yeah, i gotta go get drinks, bye dulph! *i swear that german guy really looked like dulph lungren lol*<br><br>german dude: My.. nam. isz not.. dulph.<br><br>Me: *sarcastically drawing into the crowd* ofcourse it isn't!<br><br>*then i go off*<br><br>Anyone can relate similar SPG stories?<br><br></div>

God knows what that spg was doing, but anyway our mutual friend (another spg) showed up, and came to say hello. I wasn't that into her, coz i dislike her spg behavior, so she aint a friend friend, so anyway, she was "all over me" by like touching me and talking as if we are very close.<br><br>So i introduced my friends, and she was like ALL OVER my yank friend, and totally ignored my eurasian friend:<br><br>me: hey this is xxxx, he's on holiday from colorado, and this is-<br><br>*before i can even introduce my other friend*<br><br>she: OH WOW!! So ur gonna be here long? Its like soo coool ur here man, u need someone to show u around blah  blah blah.<br><br>Eurasian friend: *aside to me*: Yeah ignore the local..<br><br>Me: dont worry its just her, anywayz, i'm glad she's off me.<br><br>Anywayz, for the rest of that evening, she was always nudging my friend and giving him these funny provokative looks. I was glad coz if my friend wasn't there, she'd be doing all that crap with me, which is disgusting.

I remember the year 'cause I was back that year, and read about it.  However, the term Asian is somewhat undefined.  In England, Asians are refered to as being Indian or Pakistani.  In Australia, on the other hand, it's us Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese, that sort.  If my memory serves me right, the term Asian in the article was biased towards... the Malay guys!  Surprised?  I wasn't.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>

Maybe i have mistaken to those posts, so can someone pls kindly explain to me what is the actual meaning of this</div>

I did read the thread carefully and I'm not implying that you are putting SG women down. I'm just bringing to your kind attention that there's a male equivalent of the SPGs which are the SG males who put SG females down.<br><br>Tho' i admit to knowing some girls who puts Asian men down and idolises the caucasians,  there are just a few of them.
