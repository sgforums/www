In Australia, on the other hand, it's us Chinese, Vietnamese and Japanese, that sort.  If my memory serves me right, the term Asian in the article was biased towards... the Malay guys!  Surprised?

I'm just saying that numbers are rising for various reasons.  And remember what a SPG stood for - not only do they prefer Caucasian counterparts, they put their own race down.  I don't we call Singaporeans, who have interracial relationships or marriages, SPGs; only those with horrific pseudo accents and will not stand within a mile of Asian men (and vice versa).<br><br>How about this for a question?  What do you think about Asians who have spent a huge amount of time overseas and either return or visit Singapore and are very 'white' in behaviour?
