            <div class='col-md body'>All these marriage things, sometime is like a man made occasion, just to make us got more things to do and not feel bored with life. Like my mum, staying on in marriage which i don really understand why! My dad gamble and gamble, go overseas, then come back ask for money! She still hanging to the marriage thru... seldom see those really loving couple. so rare... No love in the world. Love got meaning because human put meaning to it, if not its was nothing...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>psychologists say that there are different types of love... when u and ur other half first get together, u may experience what they call passionate love.... after some time, u will progress into companionate love and that's what most married-for-a-long-time couples are feeling.... how long each type of love lasts probably depends on the unique individual...<br><br>of course, there are environmental factors which will come into play and whether a couple stays together depends on how they handle these factors<br><br>i feel that couples break up usually because they can't handle such environmental factors which give rise to conflicts and they feel that they have fallen out of love per se, not really because their love doesn't exist anymore...<br><br>oh, if u read up more, it's really quite interesting... there are some factors that are better predictors of who u will fall in love with etc, but these are statistics on average and doesn't necessarily apply to everyone..</div>
