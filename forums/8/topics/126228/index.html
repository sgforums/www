Your marriage may last but that doesn't mean your love is still there. You might be together for the sake of kids or coz it's convenient to remain married or whatever.<br><br>And let's face it, men are naturally promiscuous- you may still be in love with him after 20 years but he may be screwing ard with other women for all you know <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Sighhhhhhhhhhh......the problem is, it's hard to  find a man who will stick to you for life.<br><br>Sad but true. Right guys......?</div></blockquote>To remain in love for more than 10 yrs impossible? Dun tell me u dun love ur mother anymore? I'm sure u're more than 10 yrs old rite? Dun tell me u're gonna go running to other women n call them mother? Sorry if I offended u, not trying to say anything about anybody's mother. Just using mothers as eg cos they're the closest woman to most men's heart.<br><br>The 'quite impossibe' statement is a bit too strong. For sure there are people out there who's been together for 30+ yrs n still love each other as much as day one. My fren was giving a speech on his wedding dinner n was thanking his parents for showing how to love each other after 30+ yrs. He was so emotional while saying dat he actually broke down. It kinda touched me deep down to see dat there are still people who love so much.<br><br>How to love someone for life? Most can't cos they only love themselves. But when everything u do is for others unconditionally n without prejudice n judgement, then maybe u'll experience dat kinda love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Often, marriages fail because people only look out for the fairytale part and forget about the real part of it.  While marriage is often based on love, it also often takes many other aspects (other than love) to hold it together long term.<br><br>I'm not qualifed to tell how to make a marriage last a lifetime.  However, I dare claim to be qualified to say that the chances of an unstable marriage will be very high, if entered with a pessimistic mentality.<br><br></div>

During the initial 7 yrs I wasn't ready for marriage. We stayed together n I felt no need for marriage. But one day u'll realise something. Anyway, long story short. It's something u know when u need to do.</div>
