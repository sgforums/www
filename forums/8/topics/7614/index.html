            <div class='col-md body'>Well well.........<br>this tread arrhhh....hmm.......close to my heart siaz.  Anyway......feelings can't be controled.  If the deaf and mute person is so attractive to you, you sure can't resist liking him or her.  You cannot discuss this unless you feel it for yourself.  heheeheaaa......its all fate i guess?  But then, many other factors must be considered.  What seems to pose no probs now may be big probs in the future.  So better think properly......this applies in every relationship.<br><br>Heheheheaaa.....o.k....i understand that a normal human being will stare or rather take a second look at a deaf and mute person.  I guess its the facisnation of how these ppl communicate?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Dun stare lah, its rude.  So if you interested, go learn sign language loh.  ehehhea.... a few of my friends know sign language and tok nonsence using sign lang when they dun wan ppl ard to know.  I will be learning that soon too....  :p<br><br>O.keee.....i admit that i am partially deaf.  I used to feel damn inferior about it but i dun care now lah.  I look normal and I sound normal wif one hearing ear.  Not much problems.  However, I admit that I feel bad when I need to get ppl to keep repeating what they said as I can't get right at times.  Ai yooooo.... trust me man, there are ppl who are so impatient that they just stop telling me things loh.  heehhehea....well sad but no choice lah.  I can't be bother as its not my fault wat.....sigh.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  yeah!  I have grown up leow loh....coz I remembered I used to cry over this toopid things.<br><br>So ppl........why think so much?  Keep things simple and adapt accordingly and you will be less miserable.....correct?  Anyway....every situation is unique, you cannot used old solutions on every supposedly similar situation lah.......   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I know its difficult but.........<br>Dun worry and be happy!!!<br>*pui pui pui*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when i wrote that iÂ’m not likely to fall in love with a deaf and/or mute guy, it was a polite way of saying i donÂ’t think so, unless God says and decides so because iÂ’ve too many fetishes, guess thatÂ’s why iÂ’m still left on the shell, iÂ’ve a thing for voices, eyes, mouth, nose, ears, the list goes on...<br><br>letÂ’s focus on voice. even if there are other methods of communicating, the fact that i can never hear him speak to me would be more than i can bear, so even before my heart is given to him, i would have taken it back. unless itÂ’s really fated but knowing me, it would be near to impossible. and if heÂ’s deaf too, he will never be able to hear me (well, some would say that thatÂ’s a blessing), and it would be a blow to me for when iÂ’m with him, the man i love most, my world will turn silent too. even though i could learn sign language to communicate but somehow, i'm just too selfish to want that for myself. never to hear his laughter, hear words of love, encouragement, disagreement from him, i cannot handle it. of course if my love one were to go deaf and/or mute later in life, i really pray that God would give me the strength to stick and stay by him. *knock on wood*<br><br>it does seems so unfair that such a lovely girl is deprived of the simple joys of hearing and speech. whether itÂ’s lonely or not, i wouldnÂ’t know but i believe itÂ’s a very lonely world for them, itÂ’s like watching television with the volume off.<br><br>it takes an exception human being to love another who is handicapped in some manner and sadly, i donÂ’t think iÂ’m that.<br><br>i may be doing you and her the greatest disservice but i would like you to think really carefully about how you can handle this. the first flush of love usually sweeps our logical brains into the abyss of nowhere for the first 6 months, you have to determine for yourself in all honesty if you can handle her shortcomings and whether you would mind the societal expectations/gossipings, itÂ’s not so much what others think that matters but chief of all, what you think and what you think will happen when you keep hearing what others think of her, her and you and their general comments.<br><br>you also have to think really hard whether in a few years time, you will find it a burden and a lonely existence not to be able to verbally conduct a conversation with your love one, to see her laugh and yet hear no sound, of course i know that mute doesnÂ’t mean that they canÂ’t make sounds. if you think you can handle that on a lifetime basis, then go for it. if you think you canÂ’t, then perhaps she would best remain your good friend.<br><br>you also have to think of her, how would she feel about being with you and your friends and yet no being able to participate and inadvertently, some people may just hurt her thinking she canÂ’t hear but she can lip read. imagine you meeting a friend by chance and that idiot goes: what were you thinking? why are you dating a deaf mute? you could have done better! and she will be hurt eventually when your relationship does not work out. well, some would say itÂ’s better than not having loved before, well, you decide.<br><br>just tell me to stuff it if i hurt you, iÂ’ve no such intentions.<br><br>&gt;TinDonGal<br><br>youÂ’re really brave and honest to let us know of your handicap and i hope you are not offended by my opinions on this and please do not think any lesser of me for voicing my true feelings.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by colette:</div><div class="quote_body">when i wrote that iÂ’m not likely to fall in love with a deaf and/or mute guy, it was a polite way of saying i donÂ’t think so, unless God says and decides so because iÂ’ve too many fetishes, guess thatÂ’s why iÂ’m still left on the shell, iÂ’ve a thing for voices, eyes, mouth, nose, ears, the list goes on...<br><br>letÂ’s focus on voice. even if there are other methods of communicating, the fact that i can never hear him speak to me would be more than i can bear, so even before my heart is given to him, i would have taken it back. unless itÂ’s really fated but knowing me, it would be near to impossible. and if heÂ’s deaf too, he will never be able to hear me (well, some would say that thatÂ’s a blessing), and it would be a blow to me for when iÂ’m with him, the man i love most, my world will turn silent too. even though i could learn sign language to communicate but somehow, i'm just too selfish to want that for myself. never to hear his laughter, hear words of love, encouragement, disagreement from him, i cannot handle it. of course if my love one were to go deaf and/or mute later in life, i really pray that God would give me the strength to stick and stay by him. *knock on wood*<br><br>it does seems so unfair that such a lovely girl is deprived of the simple joys of hearing and speech. whether itÂ’s lonely or not, i wouldnÂ’t know but i believe itÂ’s a very lonely world for them, itÂ’s like watching television with the volume off.<br><br>it takes an exception human being to love another who is handicapped in some manner and sadly, i donÂ’t think iÂ’m that.<br><br>i may be doing you and her the greatest disservice but i would like you to think really carefully about how you can handle this. the first flush of love usually sweeps our logical brains into the abyss of nowhere for the first 6 months, you have to determine for yourself in all honesty if you can handle her shortcomings and whether you would mind the societal expectations/gossipings, itÂ’s not so much what others think that matters but chief of all, what you think and what you think will happen when you keep hearing what others think of her, her and you and their general comments.<br><br>you also have to think really hard whether in a few years time, you will find it a burden and a lonely existence not to be able to verbally conduct a conversation with your love one, to see her laugh and yet hear no sound, of course i know that mute doesnÂ’t mean that they canÂ’t make sounds. if you think you can handle that on a lifetime basis, then go for it. if you think you canÂ’t, then perhaps she would best remain your good friend.<br><br>you also have to think of her, how would she feel about being with you and your friends and yet no being able to participate and inadvertently, some people may just hurt her thinking she canÂ’t hear but she can lip read. imagine you meeting a friend by chance and that idiot goes: what were you thinking? why are you dating a deaf mute? you could have done better! and she will be hurt eventually when your relationship does not work out. well, some would say itÂ’s better than not having loved before, well, you decide.<br><br>just tell me to stuff it if i hurt you, iÂ’ve no such intentions.<br><br>&gt;TinDonGal<br><br>youÂ’re really brave and honest to let us know of your handicap and i hope you are not offended by my opinions on this and please do not think any lesser of me for voicing my true feelings.</div></blockquote>Actually, I would very much agree with colette. Lots of time, it would be so much better if there weren't people around, for how many of us will be able to withstand pressures given to us by people around us? But I still think it is quite possible for true love to reign. For a couple to be together and thinking that everything is normal, that would be a suicide move for like colette mentioned, for problems will definitely begin to surface once that "honeymoon phase" is over. Instead, I think constant discussions about ways to cope with it will definitely help a lot.<br><br>Btw, TDG, just sent you a mail, dunno if can get through or not, but do reply if you don't mind me as a friend??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If it feels right, then I think you should give it a try. Contrary to what Colette said, I believe that one should give love a chance, even if it fails, the memories are there for cherished. Often, we remember only the bad things in life, what about the good times?<br><br>And although you can be rational, tetrutetrumon, when you are in love, somehow you won't act rationally. Besides, if you obey all the rules, you'll miss all the fun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
