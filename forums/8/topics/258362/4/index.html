It's very simple, for poly grad, if you are proud of yourself, then wear the gown and attend the ceremony. If you are so ashamed of your results then don't go.<br><br>But I felt the introduction of gowns helped to uniformed the appearence during the ceremony. Even with formal wear, it can look quite messy, when some guys wear different shades of pants and girls wear different length of skirt.<br><br>My parents were very proud when I put on my graduation gown. I felt it was not just for me, but also for my parents who had worked hard to put me through school.</div>
