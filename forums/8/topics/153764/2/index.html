Dont even know if she is a chinese, so better not say anything about her interest in the chinese language.<br><br>C'mon, just admit your linguistic incompetency instead of blaming your chinese teacher for not doing a good job. Teens.. sigh.. dont even have the capability to top up your own EZ link card yet want to rant so much with those lazy typo.<br><br>Please oh please stop bragging about yourself. Even if you made it to the Uni, that's because the system is incapable of seiving out mediocres like yourself, not because you are that good.<br><br>The lecturers are not stupid, they are just afraid of hurting your feeling, fearing that you might take your own life as you have been so misconceived by your so inflated ego.</div>

Wht ya think of em.. their performance N all?..<br><br>For me i feel quite sorry fer my current cheena teacher cuz she's lyk quite pissed wif our class.. She once told us our attitude stink N her english's cmi N has a tinge of cheena accent so it sounds real funny.. Frm my observation.. many cheena teachers are gettin bullied by students nowadays so i feel pitiful fer em.. But nevertheless it dont affect my dislike towards da subject.. i've my reasons.. juz dont feel cheena nuff N furthermore it's nt really my cup of tea.<br><br>So far all da cheena teachers i've came across are fed up of da class im in.. For my clique.. we all hate da language N always speak english durin her class N sometimes even use mp3 listenin ta english songs durin other ppls' oral presentations. Dont think they haf da control ova students.. most of em LOOK fierce but aint.. i emphasize on da word 'look'. i feel tht they shld be more darin N outspoken.. N also open-minded ta suggestions but sadly they arent. tht's juz my opinions..

Most heartlanders speak mandarin hence knowing or speaking mandarin helps you...<br><br>If u insist on speaking and knowing English language for the rest of ur life, try findin' some individuals like Indonesian Chinese students who studied in US or singaporeans who are English-speaking...<br><br>I believe in singapore u will always find one or two groups who belong to the same category as u...

            <div class='col-md body'>In sg, a large part of the chinese population speaks mandarin. Sadly, in sg english is more impt.<br><br>Firstly, the mindset of the ppl. Chinese speaking ppl are awed by those who are able to speak better english. I'm not being SPG or racist, but I have encountered often, ppl who hardly know me say to me "You must be rich", I reply, "Why did you say that", "because you can speak well and you're english speaking". Futuremore, jiak gentangs, errorenously deemed as "cosmopolitans and "yuppies" are seen as more affluent and more credible.<br><br>Most avenues for feedback are in english, therefore your ability to express yourself in english is very important.<br><br>Also, many (not all) companies operates in english. Your legal documents and rules and regulation are in english. Of course you can translate it into every major language you like, but it is predominantly in english.<br><br>Most of the documentation in your job is in english, so are the subjects taught in school. Therefore being proficient in english facilitates your learning and job efficiency.<br><br>I'm not saying there are no exceptions, nor am I condoning this behaviour, I'm just highlighting its existance.<br><br>I'm not saying that mandarin speaking ppl are inferior, nor is english superior as a language. Right now I'm trying to improve my mandarin but I still see that this particular society holds english very high esteem and thus it would be advantages to us to improve our english rather than strike out at it and those who practise it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A quick example to highlight the difference between ppl with good english and poor english is this forum. You notice some forumite are unable to express themselves well and thus do not put very convincing arguments and opinion across...<br><br>Forumites like stupidissmart and bear are able to express themselves well, ppl like the indian supremist (sexest_stud_in_world) and gum are unable to produce coherent posts.<br><br>This is the importance of english.</div>
