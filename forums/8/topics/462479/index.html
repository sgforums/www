              Seriously, I dont understand why there should be meritocracy in our education system. 
              
              Now, there is meritocracy in the jobs market. Thats understandable because companies want the best employees to increase productivity , outdo other companies and ultimately make a profit.But tell me, do schools enroll students to benefit themselves or the students? 
              
              Education IS a SERVICE to the people, and should be that way. In service, every customer gets what he wants, to the best possible extent. Which service picks its own customers? Is there a shop or restaurant out there thats says, hey, you're not good enough to be served by us, don't come in! 
              
              Let me give you an analogy. There is one tuition center called A*Star center which sprang up in the middle of Orchard. The owner of this center boasts that his tuition center gets 98% A* for its students when they sit for the PSLE. So his tuition center gets immensely popular. But then, the parents who flock to his tuition center find out the grim truth: That his tuition center only accepts students who have scored a A* in their P5 SA2 exams (so its given that they WILL more or less get A* for their PSLE). Immediately, a scandal emerges in the Straits Times and the parents avoid A*Star like wildfire. The owner is condemned, shamed and becomes to embarrased to face other people.
              
              If such tuition centers exists, they wont last very long, would they? But what we fail to notice that this is our Education system in essense. Only the Best pupils go to the top schools, and thus, the top schools perform best.  They start to brag that they are the best in the system, so they get more popular and attract even better students.   In the end, the good students get better and better, and the mediocre students stagnate, because there is no chance for them to get better. And eventually, the gap between the top schools and the neighbourhood schools widens, and this problem gets worse and worse. 
              
              And thus, we have our ELITISM, our poor social mobility, and our astronomical gini coefficient of 0.49.

              <p>Agreed~! And now foreigners are increasingly part of the elitism population. But in general, we too portray an arrogant impression in many foreign countries. I think our education system has overlooked one serious issue - inculcating of VALUES.</p>
              <p>No values but with high education = ARROGANT BASTARD/BIT*H</p>
              <p>As simple as that.</p>

              <p>Frankly all the talk about giving the education a "broad horizon" is really rubbish.</p>
              <p>Its just giving students undue stress on top of what's conceivably an over-emphasis on academics.</p>
              <p>Parents should encourage their children to look beyond the education system to be educated in more ways than one.</p>
              <p>Not keep criticising the education system, which genuinely does its job at rationing applicants for various vacancies!</p>
