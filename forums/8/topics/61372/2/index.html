            <div class='col-md body'>Well i do agree that 50% difference in pay does seem to be an unfair gap. However, considering the fact that administrative management can be extremely varied in terms of remuneration, i wonder if Honeybunz has taken the average figure of her research or the isolated one or two highest figures.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As to sohguan's seemingly nonsensical post, are you one of those disgruntled employees / subordinates who always complains, but has taken no action of your own? Talking about NATO - no action talk only.<br><br>Some advice to disgruntled subordinates - you are not a gift from heaven to your boss, don't ever assume you are one cos u are not and most probably won't ever be. Move your lazy fat arse and make way for others who are more than happy to take the jobs.
