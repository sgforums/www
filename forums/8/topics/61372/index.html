In fact, I am directly assisting him.  Of course, I don't expect the company to pay the same salary as him lah.  He is after all holding a higher post mah.  But then hor.... my pay is so low that it is almost the same as my subordinates who are just merely doing paperwork.  I will not mention my post here.  In short, it is like being paid an Admin Asst's pay to do a Senior Executive's job (running the dept, meeting customers, closing deals).<br><br>For more than three years, I have not gotten any increment.  In the first place, they offered me a very low pay, but promised yearly increment.  Ok lor.  Take their word for it.  First year, they say 911 affected the economy.  Ok fine.  Second year, they say Bali kenna bombed, have to freeze increment again.  This year, say SARS attack.  Much as I want to empathise with the company, I also have my own commitment.<br><br></div>

But I don't think he is incompetent.  Somehow, I just dunno what he is up to.  (Probably hoping that he will get promoted too, if I get promoted since I am only one level below him)</div>
