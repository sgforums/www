            <div class='col-md body'>In rural southern Illinois a toy company began selling "realistic" baby dolls to expectant mothers. But apparently after the mother had her child the toy baby would start crying. Eventually the "rocking motion" advertised to calm it down wouldn't work, and you couldn't get it to stop without shaking it. Eventually when it started crying the parent would have to beat it, and the beatings and thrashings would have to get harder and harder to get it to be quiet. The only thing that seemed to shut the baby doll up permanently was the bash its head against the wall to destroy whatever mechanism triggered the crying. On more than one occasion though, neighbors called the authorities to report child abuse, and when the police arrived they found the the bloody remains of infants smeared across the walls and the floor. In most cases the mother couldn't understand why the police were there, she just "got rid of the stupid doll" as she rocked a baby-shaped bundle in her arms.<br><br>---<br><br>In winter of 1944, with overtaxed supply lines in the Ardennes, a German medic had completely run out of plasma, bandages and antiseptic. During one particularly bad round of mortar fire, his encampment suddenly became a bloodbath. The survivors claimed to hear, above the screams and barked commands of their Lieutenant, someone cackling with almost girlish glee.<br><br>The medic made his rounds during the fire, in almost complete darkness as he had so many times before, but never this short on supplies.<br><br>The bombardment moved to other ends of the line, most men dropped off to sleep in the still dark hours of the morning - New Year's Day, 1945.<br><br>The men awoke at first light with screams. They discovered that their bandages were not typical bandages at all, but hunks and strips of human flesh. Several men had been given fresh blood transfusions, with no blood supplies available. Each treated man was almost completely covered, head-to-toe, with the maroon stain of blood.<br><br>The medic was found, sitting on an ammunition tin, staring off into space. When one man approached him, tapped him on the shoulder, his tunic fell off to reveal all skin, muscle, and sinew had been stripped from his torso and his body almost completely dried of blood. In one hand was a scalpel, and in the other, a blood transfusion vial.<br><br>None of the men treated for wounds that night, in that camp, saw the end of January, 1945.<br><br>---<br><br>Prominently displayed in the children's section of the Houston Downtown Public Library, among several others of the same title, My First Cookbook appears as a run-of-the-mill children's cookbook, complete with large print, simple instructions, colorful, friendly illustrations and a somewhat disproportionate desert section.<br><br>In fact, the only major deviation from this theme is an article near the end of the book entitled "A Recipe for Success". This is a complex, macabre ritual involving human sacrifice, self mutilation and sacrilege, as well as more curious and innocuous practices such as walking down a stair case with a prime number of stairs taking them two at a time and then up it taking them three at a time. It's written in the same cheerfully simple prose as the rest of the book and accompanied by the same helpful, pastel drawings.<br><br>---<br><br>There are stories about the hitchhikers - they only ever appear at night on quiet roads, seeming to flicker into existence in the very edge of headlights, never carrying a sign, always with an expression of deep despondency on their faces, swathed in a heavy coat and long pants, usually with gloves. If you stop, they will seem cordial enough, polite, but hardly chatty. They will assure you that the next town or city along your path will be more than fine to leave them. Normal enough. Unless you try killing them.<br><br>They die easily enough. But looking underneath their clothes and you will see their skin is marred with lines of scars, forming repeating patterns that are unsettling to look at, even more unsettling in the context of being on their skin. They have no wallets, no identification. If you slice their belly open, however, they're different inside. There's no blood, no muscle, only a hollow cavity containing a single object. The object varies. Examples include a single coin, heavy and golden and engraved with runes nobody could ever decipher, a childÂ’s rag doll, with a strange intelligence gleaming somehow in its button eyes, a diamond gem with fractal edges that slices bare flesh to ribbons, or a small vase, quite unbreakable, that smelled of the ocean and was always damp.<br><br>Once you possess a hitchhikerÂ’s object, you'll find yourself always driving the quiet roads at night. You'll never mean to, but somehow, you just will. The lure of possessing a second one will hum quietly in your head. You'll strain to catch sight of a figure appearing in your headlights, try to resist the impulse to stop, and sometimes you might.<br><br>But sometimes you won't. You'll try telling yourself that this is just a normal person on an adventure, someone who ran out of petrol. The logical part of your brain will scream at what you're doing. You'll smile and nod and they'll get into the car and you'll slowly, casually, reach under the seat or across to the glove box...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In almost every building, there is one corner, one small enclosure that no one ever looks at. It's the corner in the basement that has been blocked by a disused sofa for years; the thin space in the attic between the wall and the stacks and stacks of crates full of junk you never use, but could never throw away. The space that never sees the light of day, or any other kind of light at all. Where darkness does not merely dominate, but practically oozes out from around the edges of its prison.<br><br>No one knows quite how long a space must remain concealed for it to acquire this particular property, nor if there are any specific conditions it must meet. But it is a far more common occurrence than you might think.<br><br>In newer buildings, when this happens, the residents often report feeling cold when passing by, even in attics during the hottest of summers. Whenever contemplating taking a quick peek to see if there is anything actually there, an unnatural dread seizes them, and they leave the room quickly, if not quite running. Once left behind, the feeling passes, and it is quickly forgotten, or laughed off.<br><br>What actually happens in these forgotten sanctuaries of the dark? It is impossible to tell. For while many such corners have been exposed to reveal absolutely nothing, some brave souls have lost their sanity through nothing more than an ill-timed glance. The safest thing to do when encountered with such a phenomenon; close your eyes, rip away the area's covering in a single motion, then keep a tight hold on what you've pulled away. No matter what you hear or feel, do not get up, do not look around, and do not try to cover your ears.<br><br>You might be one of the lucky ones.<br><br>---<br><br>Ever think of what its like for the person in the mirror? Because it IS a person, not "reflected light" but a person identical to you, in a word that is and exact copy of the one you know. Except, their whole world is what you see there, if it can't be seen in the mirror, it doesn't exist for the other you.<br><br>Can you imagine a whole life spent in one room? worse still, your movements MUST be the exact same as another you, if you think it is so terrible, there is a way to help the mirror you. You must get them to do something, that is not the same as what you're doing. Even a tiny difference will do even a fraction of an inch is enough to make this work.<br><br>The best way, that I have found, requires only a ruler, it also helps if you have long hair. See where this is going? Stand in front of the mirror, and quick as you can, grab a hair, not a stray one that is floating away from the rest, it has to be impossible to tell which on you're grabbing. Now, quickly hold it out straight, and measure it. Look in the mirror, the mirror you will have grabbed a different strand, the length will be different. Maybe only a little, but remember, even a fraction of an inch is plenty. The barrier no longer exists for the you in the mirror, they are free to move where ever they want.<br><br>But I warn you: a lifetime in a room can be difficult to deal with, can even send a person crazy. They envy your life. ItÂ’s what they want. Never turn your back on that mirror, and every night before you sleep make sure your doppelganger is in the world they belong in.<br><br>And cover the mirror. Don't ever forget to cover it.<br><br>---<br><br>All mirrors are actually windows to another world.<br>This world cannot be reached, and shouldn't be reached, as all our mirror-selves are extremely malicious.<br>Try watching the edge of the mirror after sneaking into a room.<br>If you're good enough, you can see your reflection, pressing against the glass.<br><br>---<br><br>A few stacks of vinyl records stand in a corner in the basement of an old university library somewhere in upstate New York. Most of the records had been bought by the school over the years for the music department's use; others had been donated from personal album collections. One record, however, doesn't seem to belong with the rest. Hidden somewhere in the stacks, the album is unmarked and has a black cover with an identical large red mark on each side resembling a wide brushstroke. No one knows of its origins. The university has no record of having bought it or received it from some benefactor; no professor has ever requested to take it out for a class.<br><br>If you feel like taking a gamble one day, go to that library and find the album. Take it to one of the record players near the stacks, put on the large pair of headphones connected and take out the record. Now choose a side of the album to play, and put it on.<br><br>One side of the record contains the music of Heaven; the indescribably beautiful strains of the angelic chorus. It is said that after hearing the entirety of Heaven's side, you will never have another worry in your life. Every moment until you die will seem like Heaven to you, even though your external circumstances won't change as a result of hearing the music.<br><br>The other side contains the music of Hell. If you put this side on first, you will be paralyzed with horror at the sounds of pure evil. Once Hell's side ends, you will think only of ending your life as quickly as possible; the memory of the unspeakable music of Hell will torture you until you do.<br><br>You won't be able to tell which side is which, of course, but it's a risk worth taking.<br><br>Right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The 666th frame of every Halloween-themed movie, cartoon, or TV special depicts a basement with a corpse moldering in the corner; these frames are often removed from the final film, but one can find them on occasion. If you were to put the frames together, in chronological order of the release of the film it comes from, a short film is revealed. The film depicts the corpse's violent death in reverse. The final frame will be a picture of yourself, sitting before your TV, viewing the final frame of the film.<br><br>---<br><br>If you watch every State of the Union Address since it's been filmed and available on tape, you'll see that halfway through--exactly halfway through--the President always says the same word. Most say it under their breath during the standing ovations, but some are forced to work it into the speech itself.<br><br>What's the word? You don't want to know.<br><br>---<br><br>There is a doorway, one that can be any door, at any time. This door leads nowhere, yet there lies a realm of twisted reality to the opener. This door exists for everyone - some never encounter it in their lives, others unknowingly open it and step through.<br><br>The problem is, you can't tell if the door is open to you, until years after you step through it. You'll see them, and they'll finally see you.<br><br>---<br><br>In 1938, over 6,000 patients were checked into mental hospitals all across America within one week of each other. Reports of similar instances supposedly came from Europe and Asia as well. The circumstances of each patient were, eerily, identical.<br><br>Every patient completely shut down, shivering in the corner until their family, unable to calm or care for the individuals, committed them.<br><br>The only thing the patients would say was: "There is not, and never has been, such a thing in this world as a meaningless coincidence."<br><br>---<br><br>There is a demon of great evil, that will be able to walk upon the Earth if someone is told of its existence and does not repeat the name to another. To the best of my ability, his name roughly approximates "Jkqxxllyuo".<br><br>This was told to me by a rather unkempt man on the street. If you have not noticed it already, I just told it to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As we all know, smoking is really bad for your health. What a lot of people don't realize is that when you smoke, those few minutes of your expected lifespan are literally transformed into the ash you flick away into an ashtray. Ashtrays, each and every one of them, are constructed by a single group running several dozen front companies.<br><br>Basically, unless you're putting out your smokes beneath your heel or in the ashtray your kid made at camp, you're dispensing your ashen life into this group's eager little recepticle. Their ashtrays absorb the life force from the ashes and sends it to a central holding facility. No one knows for sure what these guys are going to do when they've collected all that life energy, but it's probably going to be huge.<br><br>Incidentally, there's talk of a rival organization leading the anti-smoking political agenda from behind the scenes. They probably figure removing smoking sections, and thus ashtrays, from restaurants and bars is a good first step towards thwarting whatever it is this ashtray company is trying to do.<br><br>---<br><br>For a brief period in 1971, a New Jersey based company sold novelty "x-ray" glasses through the mail via advertisements in the Marvel line of comic books. People who viewed their televisions while wearing these glasses reported seeing images that were "hellish" or "like hell". It should be noted that this phenomena occured whether the televisions in question were turned on or not. The company quickly went out of business and investigations reveal that the company's address leads to a graveyard founded many decades before 1971.<br><br>---<br><br>In any city, in any country, go to any mental institution or halfway<br>house in you can get yourself to. When you reach the front desk, ask<br>to visit someone who calls himself "The Holder of the End". Should<br>a look of child-like fear come over the workers face, you will then<br>be taken to a cell in the building. It will be in a deep hidden<br>section of the building. All you will hear is the sound of someone<br>talking to themselves echo the halls. It is in a language that you<br>will not understand, but your very soul will feel unspeakable fear.<br><br>Should the talking stop at any time, STOP and QUICKLY say aloud "I'm<br>just passing through, I wish to talk." If you still hear silence,<br>flee. Leave, do not stop for anything, do not go home, don't stay at<br>an inn, just keep moving, sleep where your body drops. You will know<br>in the morning if you've escaped.<br><br>If the voice in the hall comes back after you utter those words<br>continue on. Upon reaching the cell all you will see is a windowless<br>room with a person in the corner, speaking an unknown language, and<br>cradling something. The person will only respond to one question.<br>"What happens when they all come together?"<br><br>The person will then stare into your eyes and answer your question<br>in horrifying detail. Many go mad in that very cell, some disappear<br>soon after the meeting, a few end their lives. But most do the worst<br>thing, and look upon the object in the person's hands. You will want<br>to as well. Be warned that if you do, your death will be one of<br>cruelty and unrelenting horror.<br><br>Your death will be in that room, by that person's hands.<br><br>That object is 1 of 2538. They must never come together. Never.<br><br>---<br><br>The place that we humans call hell isn't hell at all. It is just a creation of man used as a scare tactic for morality. It got it's name from a old story about the real hell, that was taken out of context by man. There is no eternal suffering, in fact the only thing that is eternal is the lifespan of it's inhabitants. It is also not a punishment. Everyone goes there when they die. Unlike the earth it is flat and it goes on forever. It is filled with all manners of terrain from snowy forests to rivers of lava.<br><br>Rumor is that if you go out into the infinite expansion in the right direction farther than any human has ventured, you will find the beings that originally spoke of Hell and confused whe writers of the bible. They will torture you for so long that you lose your grasp of time. They will then ask you your name.<br><br>If you answer correctly you will be a slave to them forever but will have many of your dreams and fantasies acted out.<br><br>If you answer wrong you will cease existence and everyone you have ever known in both worlds will forget you. However is you answer "Bruce" you will become one of them.<br><br>And before you ask, anyone who claims to be named Bruce is a liar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once, there were two girls named Mary and Karen having a sleepover. It was being held at Karen's house because her parents were out of town. In fact, every time Karen's parents went out of town, they had a sleepover because Karen was afraid to stay by herself. It was Halloween and once again, Karen's parents were out of town. When Mary rang the doorbell, Karen answered wearing a beautiful silk nightgown. It was blood-red and had a furry collar. Mary envied Karen for having that nightgown.<br>They began to watch some scary movies. All of the sudden, Mary heard a soft "thump, thump, thump, thump." She was frightened and looked at Karen, who didn't seem to notice. As the night progressed, Mary heard the thumping noise intermittently and it seemed to be growing nearer. When the noise sounded from right behind them, the electricity and lights went out. Mary and Karen ran screaming, up to the second floor, into Karen's room. It was now midnight and the two girls were scared to death.<br>Suddenly, Karen got up and ran out of the room, slamming the door behind her. Mary sat there for what seemed like an eternity. After a long silence, she heard the thumping noise again. It seemed to be coming up the stairs, getting louder and louder. Thump, Thump THUMP, THUMP, THUMP! Then, it stopped. Mary thought she heard someone standing on the other side of the door and bravely got up and opened it.<br>Mary couldn't see a thing, so she reached out her arm and felt Karen's soft silk nightgown. Then, she reached up to feel her favorite part of the nightgown, the furry collar. When she reached higher, there was nothing but a bloody stump!! When the lights came on, she discovered that her poor friend had been decapitated! The neighbors heard her screaming at the top of her lungs and called the police. When the police arrived, they found Karen's dead body, and Mary, with snow-white hair, completely insane<br><br>---<br><br>During a wedding reception of a young couple the guests decided on a drunken game of hide and seek. It was decided that the groom was "it" and he eventually found everyone but his new bride. Eventually the man became furious and decided it wasn't funny anymore and left her there. As weeks went by he accepted that she'd had second thoughts and went on with her life so he did the same. A few years later a cleaning lady dusted off an old trunk in the attic of the building where the reception had taken place, out of curiosity she opened it. Inside the trunk was the rotted body of the missing bride who'd apparently became locked in the trunk she'd hid in. Whether she'd suffocated or starved was unknown, but her face was frozen in a scream.<br><br>---<br><br>During a wedding reception of a young couple the guests decided on a drunken game of hide and seek.

You fall unconcious, and be in the delivery room, witnessing the final moments before you entered this world. The doctor will greet you, and his eyes will look into yours, and they shall be your own. At this moment, the doctor knows everything about you, and will ask you a question about yourself. The question will not be easy, and you must be incredibly metacognitive to answer it correctly. If you do, you shall be born, and wake up with knowledge beyond mortal comprehension.<br><br>If you answer incorrectly, you will come out stillborn, your skin cracked and burnt, and you will never wake up.<br><br>---<br><br>You'd be surprised to learn how few actual people there really are in the world.<br><br>---<br><br>The assassination of John F. Kennedy started a macabre chain that continues to this day. Oswald killed Kennedy, Jack Ruby killed Oswald, this much we know. What few people are aware of is how far it continued after that.<br><br>In 1967 while awaiting retrial for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald, Ruby died in Parkland Hospital (the place of death of both Oswald and JFK), some say due to the negligence of the doctor overseeing him. A few years following this, that same doctor died in an auto accident while on his way home. The driver of the car that struck him would make a full recovery, though the medical costs would bankrupt him and drive him to a life of crime. A store owner acting in self defense would be the one to claim his life, and so on.<br><br>Few have kept full track of the chain up 'til now, or how far from Dallas it's traveled, but many believe it still continues. Fewer still are sure if it started with Oswald and JFK, or if perhaps it goes further back than that... betraying some unknown transgression from President Kennedy's past.<br><br>Just be careful out there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's a special brand of cheap condom making the rounds in Europe and just entering the North American market. The brand is popular for it's specially pleasing 'texture.' What many don't know is that when these condoms have served their purpose, they're actually fertilized. Submerging them in water completes the gestation process and within 24 hours, the condoms become living, swimming little latex creatures desperately wanting to go somewhere. If placed in a container, they'll just keep swimming in that same direction, bopping their head against their prison walls or leaping out of the container to their suffocating death. As far as anyone-in-the-know knows, they'll die when exposed to open air or when turned inside-out and emptied of their 'contents.'<br><br>Anyway, just to be on the safe side, don't ever flush a condom. You never know where it'll end up.<br><br>---<br><br>You've heard some of the crazy things the US soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan have been finding, right? Like, stuff from the palaces, stuff in old caves, stuff in bunkers, like golden swords, big honkin' vases, expensive jewelry, thousand year old lamps and stuff? They found something big, just recently. Some... marines, I think, yeah, marines, were poking around in an old cave, and they found this chest, and in it was a collection of remarkably preserved scrolls written on what seemed to be flesh.<br><br>Who here is familiar with the works of Abdul Alhazred? Yep. They found a genuine first edition copy of his number-one best seller, Al Azif. You might know it better as the Necronomicon.<br><br>---<br><br>In a small orphanage in a small village in Russia, there is a young boy. His hair is jet black, and messy, and he tattered jeans and an old dingy grey shirt.<br><br>Nothing is known of him. For 10 years, he sat in the bed in his room, never moving, never blinking, never eating or sleeping. In the 10 years, he had not seemed to age at all, continuing to look like a 7 year old boy. The only thing that proved he was alive is the slow rise and fall of his chest as he breathed, and the refusal to take his eyes off anyone who entered the room alone.<br><br>A lone psychiatrist came over in an attempt to find out why the boy had done nothing in 10 years. He entered the room, and shut the door behind him.<br><br>30 minutes later, the orphanage's nurse came to check on the 2 of them. Opening the door, she saw the child, still sitting, still not moving, eyes fixed on her. However, something seemed different. He appeared a slight amount larger; not by much, but enough to make him look like a late 8 or early 9 year old. The psychiatrist was no longer in the room. The door was the only exit, as the room had no windows, vents, or anything. It was, in fact, in the exact center of the orphanage.<br><br>He continued to sit, only seen occasionally by the lady who came in to check on him, and she never closed the door upon entry.<br><br>A week or so later, two law enforcement personnel entered the orphanage, demanding to speak to the boy about the disappearance of the psychiatrist. The two of them entered, closing the door behind him, as the head of the orphanage stood outside the door.<br><br>30 minutes passed, and not a sound came from the room. The Head eased the door open. The boy was still on the bed, but the officers where no longer there. The boy was know quite noticeably bigger, about the size of a 15 year old. His skin was darker than usual, and he looked angrier than ever. But one thing remained the same: His cold, unforgiving eyes that stared at whoever entered.<br><br>Eventually, the law organized a large group of 10 officers to speak to the boy. They entered the room, and left the door open, until one of the younger orphans ran up and shut it, apparently in a daze.<br><br>The head quickly ran to re-open the door, and upon doing so froze him in horror. A low rumbling noise came from the room....<br><br>".....One....more...."<br><br>If you return to that orphanage, you will see it still continues to run. The orphans live in good care, health, and education. However, there is one room that you will see boarded up, and far from enterable. If you ask what is behind it, you will be removed forcefully from the orphanage.<br><br>However, when no one's looking, if you place you're ear to the door, you might hear a low ominous growling sound, and if you listen for a bit, you will hear....<br><br>".....One.....more...."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In New York City, you may run into a beggar in the middle of the night. He will ask you for 16 cents. If you don't give him money, you'll be safe. If you do give him money, regardless of the amount you give him, don't look into his eyes. If you do, he will kidnap you and devour your flesh. If you don't, but happened to give him exactly 16 cents, he will hold out his hand to give you a ring. If you take it and put it on, you will be able to see the shadows, the spirits of the city that haunt the allies and backstreets, haunting the homeless and devouring the souls of those that wander into their domain. If you ever take the ring off, you will no longer be able to see the shadows outright... but they will haunt you, instead, and you will still see them when you are alone, but only out of the corner of your eye.<br><br>---<br><br>There is a tunnel under the old railroad tracks just to the west of the Queen Elizabeth Way in Niagara Falls. It is known locally as the Screaming Tunnel. A path wanders through the tunnel and then up to an empty field on the hill. But the field was not always empty.<br><br>At one time, a large farm house stood in the field at the top of the hill, and in it lived a happy family. Then one night, the house caught fire. A young daughter was trapped in the house, and the only way to escape was through a wall of flames. The brave young girl covered her face with her arms and ran into the fiery doorway. Her long hair and her long nightgown began to smolder as she burst through the flames and rushed out of the house.<br><br>When the night air struck her smoldering clothing, it burst into flames, enveloping the girl in a raging inferno. The girl screamed in agony and ran blindly down the hill, away from the fire-stricken house. She staggered into the tunnel under the train tracks, her screams echoing and re-echoing through the night. Overcome by the flames, the girl fell to the floor of the tunnel, wailing in agony. She rolled frantically on the floor of the tunnel, trying to douse the flames, but her efforts were weak and ineffective. She was quickly overcome, and burned to death in the tunnel under the tracks.<br><br>After that night, anyone that dares strike a match in the tunnel under the tracks will hear the agonized death screams of the burning girl, and a ghostly wind will instantly blow out the match.<br><br>---<br><br>There is a small island in the Mediterranean Sea that does not appear on any map. It cannot be seen from any other island, nor can any other land be seen from it. On this island is a lighthouse, rotting from age and sea water, that is never lit. There is nothing inside it, save for a spiraling staircase that leads to the top, and an ancient, dusty bookcase.<br><br>The case is filled with unmarked books, bound in ancient leather, save for a single space. If you remove a book from the shelf, it will fling itself open in your hands, and the words inscribed in it shall start screaming to the air. You must wrestle the book closed and shove it back on the shelf, or the immortal evil contained within its pages shall break free, and you will be forced to take its place, with pages, ink and binding crafted from your own flesh and blood.<br><br>However, if you bring the correct book to the island, and place it in the empty space, the lighthouse will light. As long as it is lit, the world shall enjoy an unending paradise, for all the evil in the world will be contained in the lighthouse. And while it is lit, nothing can go in or out.<br><br>The only problem; you will be trapped for eternity with all the evil ever known or conceived by man or god.<br><br>And the only way to escape is to douse the light.<br><br>---<br><br>Rumor has it, that in the depths of certain storm drains in the darkest hours of the night, you can call out to the darkness and ask it a question. If you ask the right question, you might get an answer. And you'll wish you never did; everyone who's claimed to get an answer is in an insane asylum, repeating the words, "Don't trust the darkness... Don't trust the darkness..."<br><br>---<br><br>At the edge of the Pacific ocean, on some abandoned beach in the tropics, there is a large, smooth rock that sits just beyond the reach of the highest tides. It is not cracked or marked in any way, and the smooth black stone reflects even the faintest of light. It's curved and formed in just such a way that if you are very careful, you can climb on top of it from the side, and stand on a flat area at the top.<br><br>If you stand on the rock when the moon is full and shining, and the water is at its highest point, you can see something in the sea below you. A faint shimmer of light, a flash of something you can't quite identify. It gets brighter, easier to see as you kneel down and lean closer, over the edge of the rock.<br><br>Once you are leaning out further than would probably be safe, your left leg will slip on the slippery stone, and you will fall forward into the light. There is no splash, no sound; you simply disappear into the ocean.<br><br>No one knows what happens after you disappear. But there are some who claim to have fallen off the same rock, what seems like a lifetime ago. According to the earthly calendar, they were gone for one day, then washed up on another beach, sometimes half a world away. But their eyes are hardened, and they rarely speak anymore, only occasionally muttering of fiery paths and gibbering demons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In southern Arizona, a section of desert is reportedly haunted. If you venture out into it, beyond the main roads at night, you may see some odd things...<br><br>1. A black fog will often appear around midnight. It will move against the wind, and even follows people if they get close enough.<br>2. Whispers and moans can be heard near a closed industrial plant.<br>3. In the largest building of the plant, there are bloodstains that appear.<br>4. If you park your car, you'll hear something tapping on it.<br>5. While the plant was still staffed, weird stuff often happened, such as calls coming from non-existant extensions, which, when answered, either hung up or produced a hissing that rapidly changed in pitch.<br>6. Shadows are often sighted moving among the buildings and desert.<br><br>---<br><br>There was a young couple that had been marrier for a few years and had been raising a child. Neither spouse particularly liked the other after years of marriage. The fighting was near constant, often coming to blows. Another year of this went by, and during one night, the drunken husband struck and killed the wife with a lamp. However, he was able to hide the body and other evidence from his son and the police, who were unable to get an arrest warrant for him.<br><br>The father was coming up with a story to tell his son and to console him about his mother's "disappearance". When he finally telked to the boy, he realized his son was not at all distraught. He inquired to his son as to why he was not upset; why he didn't miss his mother. His son looked up at him bewildered. "Why would I miss her? You're always carrying her around on your back."<br><br>---<br><br>17 years ago, outside of New Orleans, Louisiana, an unidentified man placed a small bundle into a river during the middle of the night. The cries it emitted woke up some of the nearby residents, and believing it to be a baby, one family took it in as it floated past them that night.<br><br>As they opened the basket, unwrapping the bundle from the warm blankets, they saw what it really was. Out of fear, they drowned the "baby" almost immediately, leaving town the next day, never to return. They say that if you go into that house in the middle of the night, you might hear a babies soft cries . If you go outside to the pier, the cries will grow louder, as if they were coming from inside the water. Looking into the water, you'll find only your reflection, and literally nothing else. Don't fall in; but you won't really have a choice considering what's behind you.<br><br>---<br><br>These may not be creepy, but they're kinda odd and actually happened/are supposed to be around my town in Arizona.<br><br>Northwest of my town, quite a few miles into the mountains you'll find valley, there is nothing special about this valley at first glance. That is until you realize there are no animals, nothing living in this valley. If you enter into it, near the middle of this valley in a wash is a large black jagged rock. Around this rock are bones of all kinds, animal and a few human bones dating back to when the Hualapai indians still lived off the land here. This rock, is supposed to be the Death Stone, touching the jagged black surface of this rock is supposed to cause instant death.<br><br>-------<br>This one actually happened to a friend of mine, I was actually apart of the last bit of it so it is of my own telling.<br><br>My friend, his girlfriend and some of his friends were out driving around in the deserts, they came upon what he called a grave yard, being stupid teens they hung out there, drinking and having fun. His girlfriend went around gathering up Apache Tears* and old arrow heads. As it grew dark they could hear what sounded like horses running around them, it was still light enough to see that there were infact, no horses. Creeped out, my friend told his girlfriend to leave everything she had gathered there. They got back in their 4x4 and headed back the way they came. As they made it down the winding and rough roads they noticed truck lights behind them coming down the road faster than was physically possible, scared they would be hit, the pulled over. The sound of a truck could be heard heading down the road, but a few seconds after pulling over the lights and sound form the speeding truck were gone, only a faint breeze passed them. After a short drive they made it back onto the road, my friend, scared **** pulled over to catch his breath. An old beat up truck pulled up next to them, it had come from the direction of town. The driver of the truck flipped on the cab light that was red. The driver was an older native American lady, she smiled at them and asked if they were ok, my friend said yeah and the lady smiled, laughed and headed up the road that they had come from.<br><br>They made it home, got out of the truck and started to head into the house when my friend's dogs started going crazy, my friend turned to look at what they were having a fit about and say a black dog sitting cross the road, he hadn't seen it when they pulled in and it was just sitting there. It turned slowly and left. That night, as my friend and his girlfriend were going to bed, she took off her jeans and an old arrow head fell out of her pocket. Thinking nothing of it, they went to bed. twice that night his dogs woke him up barking, each time he would look out the window there would be nothing, but the dogs would be barking at the same place across the road as the black dog had been sitting. The next morning, he told me this and we drive up to this "grave yard" there's nothing there. He swore to God that there was an old grave yard here and they he's going to leave the arrow head. He does so, we make our way down the road, get home and nothing ever happens again to my friend.<br><br>*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_tears</div>

The bartender can't tell you anything about him, but if you sit across from this man for 30 minutes, looking straight into his eyes, saying absolutely nothing, he'll take you to a back room. In this room you'll find a skeleton chained to the wall and a couple of artifacts, among them a diary and a ring. If you put on the ring and read the diary in its entirety, you will find yourself passing out, awakening as a woman, named Mary. You won't be able to control her; but you will live out her painful death and the circumstances that caused her to be tortured in the back room of this bar, by a gang of men in suits. You'll experience all of the pain until finally, she dies, and you'll find yourself at home, in bed, wearing this ring. The ring won't come off. You'll hear a knock on the door. Don't answer it; it's one of the men in suits. Climb out a back window, even if it's a 2 story house, and maybe you'll have a chance of hopping the fence and making your way back to the bar, where the man in the corner will be able to remove the ring for you. Everyone who answered the door, or was caught by the men, was never to be seen again.<br><br>---<br><br>Have you ever walked into a room and felt that it was "bad" or "wrong" in some way, and then promptly left the room, perhaps making excuses on the way out? It's good if you left. There are parasites. They live in another reality, unable to exist on their own in ours; these bad places are places that they can see, as if they are looking in through the window between our worlds. That "bad" feeling is that of them looking at you. And the more they can see you, they creep closer and closer to your body.<br><br>If you stay in their gaze for more than about three minutes, they'll get you. And you don't want them to get you.. unless you like being stuck behind that window like they used to.. watching while they take upon your identity and using your life to live the lives they had to watch all this time.<br><br>---<br><br>Ever wandered alone on the streets at the dead of night? Well, if you encounter a wizened figure in tattered robes and a hood, and you just can't seem to make out his face no matter which way you look at it, pay your respects. This man is infact Death himself. He only appears to sole travellers at the stroke of 3:33am, so most go their entire lives without ever seeing him "in the flesh", so to speak.<br><br>If you're brave enough to speak to him, he may take out an hourglass from his robe. The hourglass represents how much longer you have left to live. If there is plenty of sand in the upper glass, it means you still have a long time left to go before inevitability claims you. But if he takes out an hourglass that contains black flowing sand, then run as fast and as far as you can to the one you love before he finds you. And he will find you.<br><br>The black sand represents borrowed time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is said that during 11 pm on any Sunday, eat a banana and dont drink water. at 12 midnight, look in the mirror for 7 seconds and then sleep. In the middle of your sleep, you will encounter a figure who will give you water, he or she is your soulmate. However, at that precise moment, you SHOULD wake up. If you stay asleep for even less than a second, the exact image of your death and your soulmate's will flash before you. Give it a try, you will be amazed at what you see. I know I did.<br><br>this is cool.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
