Most of us are carnivores, sure I will eat the animals like fish, pig, chicken, etc,  to keep me alive ... I donÂ’t have a stomach for the more exotic animals, anyway I digress.<br><br>The reason why these animal abusers were jailed was to send a signal to the public that the law in SÂ’pore doesnÂ’t condone cruelty to animals &amp; also to prevent the brutal streak that lurks in all of us from bursting forth and given a free rein. More often than not, bullies, people who resort to violence &amp; murderers, they start small &amp; then they build up their courage by going on to bigger things.<br><br>Firstly, one kills a stray cat or dog for a lark, once one acquires a taste for cruelty, then one starts on defendless children or old people, then one realises that one needs more serious harm to be inflicted to get the same high, vicious assaults emerged &amp; finally one becomes so enbolden that murder is just a step, a skip &amp; a hop away.<br><br>Thus, curbing cruelty to animals by jailing the perpetrators who tortures these animals just for the pure fun of it in my view instills in all of us the sanctity of life, be it an animal or a human.<br><br>Humanity is what separates us from the animals &amp; when we lose our humanity with regards to the other species of living things, what hope is there for us?<br><br>Barclays, truth be known, humans have been known to kill &amp; eat another human being in the quest for survival during harsh times or war.<br><br>IÂ’m not flaming you, I have a special flaming partner for this pleasure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sacrificial of animals are very common among the tribal grops in Africa as well Native Tribes. It is usually used in ritual ceromonies as to appease the Gods and give them harvest for their crops or even to cleanse their spirits.<br>However, in tribes like those their culture is simply very different from us. Take for example, genital mutilation which seems as brutal in the eyes of our society are considrered as a ritual of conserving their body to the opposite sex as well as to reduce promiscuity. They have no choice and have to bear all the pain and after effects of the non professional surgery by the women in their tribe. Resentment and anger is repressed and no utter of cry of cry is allowed by the males or it will be considered a coward act.<br><br>There is certainly no right and wrong in killing in animals for their own selfish use depending on which culture u are brought up. If there is a religious cause to do it. the animals are mostly substituted for a human being instead. So is it better to sacrifice a human or an animal though both of them are living being?

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa,<br>What is the percentage of people who are wrongly convicted to capital punishment? I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) that the percentage is pretty low. If you say that capital punishment should be abolished because of the possibility that the judge or the jury make a mistake, does that mean the authority should be lenient to ALL criminals just because of the small percentage that may be wrongfully convicted?<br><br>Personally, I don't believe that criminals who got capital punishment will ever change to the better regardless of the amount of time and opportunity given to them. People who commit senseless murders do not change overnight. The idea of giving them a second chance is a noble one but I don't think they deserve it. How about the victims, do they have a second chance of enjoying normal lives (at all)?<br><br>Death is too easy for them, I agree, but why should resources be wasted on them? Moreover, why should they be given chance to be free someday? I believe there are some tricks that the lawyers can pull to get the criminals parole so they don't have to serve their full jail term. Why not stop them from committing more crimes once and for all?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Colette, Colette...<br><br>*abashedly scratch head* Wow! My very first compliment. I must follow MayaJ's example by printing this up and framing it.  :p<br><br>Umm.. I'm more moderate than what you mau suppose. I'm not saying that we can treat animals cruelly as we please (after all, I do insist on free-range products whenever I can) BUT, I do see a jail sentence as too harsh. A stiff fine is more appropriate. By way of a jail term, the person loses a large part of a normal, productive life simply because he/she will be stigmatised and reacted against every single time his status is questioned. Like the Mike Tyson's episode here, a convicted felon of more than 1 yr is not allowed into GB.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I hardly think an animal (no matter the circumstances) should warrant that part of a human being's life.<br><br>Like Eck said, I agree to disagree with his point (THANKS for replying sincerely Eck)<br><br>I dun think I can (or want) to change anyone's stance on this. I just wanted to point out the tremendous impact of a prison term can be. Rinoa's rehabilitative system of righting civic wrongs has a long way to go to redress social injustices.<br><br>As for someone who pointed out that the money can come from someone else, and thus the lesson is not learnt... umm... I dunno. I mean, unless you are incredibly rich that money doesn't matter to you, I think a stiff fine (like mebbe $10,000 depending on the seriousness of abuse) will elicit a painful lesson. Blardy hell, my Coffee Bean stint yielded $4 an hour ... how many years of my life had to be forfeited to pay for a crime of such nature?<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>No universal history leads from savagery to humanitarianism, but there is one leading from the slingshot to the megatonne bomb.<br><br>Adorno</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I confess that I have not read all the longish replies to this thread so, I might be retreading old ground.<br><br>Should we have capital punishment?<br>Firstly, we have to establish why we need to punish:<br>i) Incapacitation: to deprive the offender the capacity to harm others.<br>ii) Reformation: deterring the offender from future violations, or improving his character so that he no longer gives in to the temptations of committing such violations.<br>iii) Deterrence: of someone other than the offender.<br>iv) Retribution: Nuff said.<br><br>Hobbes pointed to a state of nature in which life of man is ' solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short'. As such, the drive of self preservation will motivate the community nto use4 all means to protect themselves if one of them becomes a threat to the community , which would entail the banishment or death of the offending individual.<br>By repudiating the discipline of the group by words or actions, he has placed himself outside the 'pale of the law' and have thus lost the immunities that membership in a group confeered upon him, including the immunity from physical harm by other members of the group.<br>People accept the legal sanctions against wrong-doers becos they accpet the discipline and authority of the Govt. bec of the protection they believe it is able to afford themaginst the others who wopuld depive them of their property, liberty and lives.<br><br>Many of the people have advocated the retributive 'lex talionis' as their standard view of murderers and rapists. By this I mean that Punishment should be PROPORTIONAL and not IDENTICAL.  'Rapists should be raped'. *hiak* where'd you get guys like these?<br><br>I have to agree that I tend to favour a more hardline approach of sanctioning with extreme prejudice. Why?<br>Immanuel Kant maintained that from a moral point of view, punishment is essentailly retributive. He made an example that if the world were to come to an end, and it was therefore evident that no one would benefit from the punishment of prisoners, who have been sentenced to death, those prisoners would nevertheless still be executed in the interest of righting the balance of justice.<br><br>Kant believed in the punishemnt of the guilty is good in itself, regardless of the benefits that may flow from it. In his view, it was the nature of crime committed that determined the type and severity of the punishment that was to be imposed.<br><br>No man should ever be used as a means to another person's end but should always be treated as an end in himself. Therefore, punishing one man in norder to deter another potential offender for committing a similar crime in the future would be to use the person who is being punished.<br><br>Punishement for the sake of reform would have to rest upon the assumption that the punishing authority knows more about what is in the best moral and spiritual interests of the person being punished than he does himself. This is an imposition by the authority of an image of the offender and denying the offender the right to his own moral choices.<br><br>I have spoken to friends about the human rights issues of Prisoners. The thing is, if the Human Rights of life, liberty and pursuit of Happiness is encoded into the American Constituion, then how can Texas, amogst other states still permit Capital punishment?<br>The thing is, the utilitarian argument of public interest comes up. So they're in fact still within boundaries.<br><br>Still the issues of whether Prisoners have rights are still a very sticky situation. If they do, what rights and how much?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Terence<br><br>i do have to agree that Leviticus is boring but thereÂ’s significance to that book, basically it shows us how to live our lives right before God but after Christ came, a lot of the sacrificial rituals were abandoned, probably God got so fed up with ManÂ’s disobedience that He doesnÂ’t want to be grieved any longer.<br><br>the book of psalms?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> wow, i love that book! especially those cursing psalms, reading them is like a balm to my wounded soul. eh, songs of solomon? not my particular favourite.<br><br>iÂ’ve never said that people who kill animals will graduate to become murders per se, if i did, iÂ’ll tell my parents to be doubly wary of the butcher, fishmonger, etc, etc when they do marketing. i qualified my statement by writing that if people predisposed to brutality or cruelty, if &amp; when they are caught torturing a defendless animal are not dealt with severely, they may graduate to murder because they are will definitely grow bolder &amp; would only value their own lives above others. thatÂ’s why we keep reading of ungracious people behaving appallingly or hit &amp; run drivers or crimes of passion where when one lover wants to leave the other that one can become so enraged that he/she rather kill him/her than to let him/her go. these people have gotten to the stage that they rather kill the one they professed to love than to let her/him find happiness with another.<br><br>who knows what kept me from holding my dark side in check? God or the fear of life behind bars? i truly donÂ’t know, if pressed for an answer, i guess it would be God.  similarly, for the majority of the people, if theyÂ’re even aware of their own dark nature, what keeps them in check?<br><br>what i am saying is that if thereÂ’s no threat of punishment, most of us would give in to all our desires &amp; anarchy would result, just like what happened during the period of the Judges, everyone did as he saw fit when they had no (human) king nor God in their lives. just imagine Terence, if you were a gal &amp; iÂ’m a strong handsome brute of a man, if you donÂ’t love me, so what? as long as i love you &amp; there is no law to punish me, believe me my darling, i would drag you by your hair into my lair &amp; ravish you. when iÂ’m done, i may keep you for further amusement or maybe move on to another conquest *drools at the thought* hehehe ... ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>similarly, without the threat of capital punishment of life for a life in serious crimes, we would be living in fear - fear of offending someone or stepping on the wrong toe. have you seen the way i flame that little toad Only4Lamer? gracious me, if there is no capital punishment in SÂ’pore, heÂ’s probably stuck in some sewer plotting my demise even as iÂ’m writing this reply to you. of course there are people who are willing to kill another for the right price, but that's another story altogether.<br><br>yeap, capital punishment has to stay, if nothing else, it offers me peace of mind.</div>
