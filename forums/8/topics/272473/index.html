Put it simply - all living things are able to sense and response depending on what sense organs they have. The fact that they can response to external stimuli - sunlight and water, is an indication that plant do have sense organs. Just because you can't sense the way plants sense doesn't mean they cannot 'feel'. Have you observed ants when they meet each other? They seemed to talk to one another but we can't hear nor understand!<br><br>As for thinking part, it is still uncertain.
