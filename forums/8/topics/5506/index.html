            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>Well, I like a girl in my company, however there are things that made me ponder so much that I DON'T KNOW WHAT to do. Ask her to be friends and she agreed. We chated like friends and however there is a bit of hesitation at times from her. Once I ask her to go out for a meal but she rejected straight without thinking. She's shy. But that makes me worried as she says "no". From what I know she is still not ready. My friends encouraged me to keep trying as she is not the kind that would often reject pple unless on bad situations (eg busy). Now I am thinking what to do.<br>I don't have much time but I don't want to rush her either. There are more things to talk about and she still wants to know me more but maybe not in the working environment. I cannot make desperate moves as she will get scared off and now I can only hope to see her in the company and short talk to her so that she gets to like me. But how am I going to do that and not rushing her at the same time.<br>Oh, sorry if I ask a little too many but my mind is in a mess and many questions are filled in there and needed to be flushed out. Anyway thanks for lending your suggestions cos I hope these can be a help for many others out there.<br><br>~~~~(o o)~~~~<br>^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My suggestion is for you to ask her out for meals, maybe during your lunch break, go somewhere nearby together?<br><br>The alternative is for you to ask her out (for meals) but not alone, as in bring a few of your friends (and ask her to bring a few of hers maybe) along....probably best if u have mutual friends (maybe in the company?)<br><br>Anyway, I'm not an expert, but if I were you, that's what I would do...<br><br>and btw, why are u in a hurry?

            <div class='col-md body'>MyLife,<br><br>I like ur name...there's a sweet, lonely, melancholy to it...:-) kinda like how I feel.<br><br>Mybe she isn't really comfortable with the fact that u like her.  Most girls are like this.  If they know u like them, they will feel uncomfortable and most probably try to avoid u.  Even if they just think that u might like them, they get like this...Which isn't totally fair to us guys, but hey...they will think what they think no matter what we think right?:-)<br><br>I don't really have any suggestions for u, just that take it slow...if u can tahun...Or is the wait torturing u...not knowing if anything will develope?<br><br>Just take the cue that she says yes to everyone, but no to you to mean that:<br><br>1: She likes u and doesn't want to spoil it.<br>2: She isn't interested because she feels akward for whatever reason it may be, real or imagined.<br><br>So, altho I wasn't any help in any way shape or form,...the decision is urs to take it slow and wait or do something about it and hope for the best....just remember the words crash and burn and don't have any false hopes.<br><br>That's all i can say about it...good luck 2 u.<br><br>Sorry, but that reading ur name really makes me feel melancholic...is there a word?</div>
