You counter sue for slandering your name.<br>my previous bosses had all theatened to make my life miserable (and they can with the amount the stupid company pays them to do nothing) when I tender my resignation although I am the one who buay song them and how they treat me and overwork me even when I do my personal best to out perform my colleagues.
