So many people have watched it already. But can we try to keep the spoilers to oneself? Or at least put up a *spoiler warning* I mean, poor Faye hasn't even seen it yet and we are being inconsiderate in talking about the most exciting parts of the episodes.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>*spoiler warning*<br><br>As for Takumi "Cheating" in the latest episode, I think he won fair and square. It's not easy driving blind but he is the chaser and further more, Ryosuke plotted the entire course for Takumi to follow before the race. I would say that this race was won by a bit of luck and his ingenuity. The first two races were won through pure skill and driving tactics. And i like that a lot. Takumi is someone who drives instinctively and Ryosuke provides the tactical aspect to help him race even better.</div>
