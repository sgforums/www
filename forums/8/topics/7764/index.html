            <div class='col-md body'>possible but it would depend on how the rejection was done and the behaviour of either party during the course of their friendship/relationship.<br><br>let's take for example if i like a certain forumite in this forum and we started flirting mildly with each other in this forum and progress to private emailing where the flirting gets hot and heavy, even to the extent of being lovers-like.<br><br>then one day i really think that iÂ’m falling in love with him and i expressed my love for him, but he has no interest in me at all and yet for reasons known to himself, perhaps ego, he doesnÂ’t want to let me go yet, he kept me hanging on before finally brushing me off by saying that itÂ’s impossible for him to fall in love over the net and yet in the next instance i hear that he is going out or falling in love with another via the net, you canÂ’t blame me for feeling bitter.<br><br>iÂ’ll wonder what was it that made him kept me hanging on, was it to massage his ego? does it make him feel so wonderful that he has someone professing love for him? i can't help but feel made a fool of.<br><br>if and when i had expressed my love for him, even he had let me down firmly, i would keep his friendship but if he lead me on and then turned me down at the end when a better catch comes along, itÂ’s very hard for me to want to remain friends. i rather he just laugh at me in the face than to hear promises of sweet nothings that ultimately amounted to nothing.<br><br>my advice is that if youÂ’ve no interest in the other party, let the other party know as soon as possible and as gently as possible, all of our egos are extremely delicate.<br><br>an advise to gals, when a guy professes his love/liking for you, be gentle with rejections, it takes a long while for them to get over it, handle a rejection badly, it may even haunt you forever, unless of course, you're one of those who thinks that it's only right that men falls for you and that the world revolves around you.  :p :p :p<br></div>

Usually the one who rejects the other will want to maintain the friendship, therefore it will be up to YOU!<br><br>Personally I became very good friends with 2 of the girls I previously liked and expressed my feelings for them. I went through the initial 'gan ga' stage but all things became better after I took the initiative to talk to them.<br><br>You may be suprised how unconstrained all your conversations can get.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My word of advice is that never pop that question until you are 100%sure that he/she will recipocate the feelings. Those movies that shows boy love gal but not sure whether gal like boy. Boy profess and gal felt touched and fall madly in love with boy. Those are in the movies.....wake up!!! In real life, there are such factors like embrassment. Better to source out the other party's feelings subtly or thru a trusted mutual friend. Once the bubbles is burst and he or she have no such feelings for you, the relationship will defintely not be the same anymore. Sometimes even asking her or him out is suspected as a ploy to get closer in the hope of changing his or her mind. Trust actual words or actions, never feelings.</div>
