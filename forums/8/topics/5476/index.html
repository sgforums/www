            <div class='col-md body'>For guys who are unattached and starting out on his career, what do you guys think should be the top priority? If you happen to be in a demanding and fast-paced industry, getting a good salary, and the only thing missing out in life is social life (due to the long working hours).<br><br>When you finally found a nice girl whom you like, and she demands that you spend more time with her, something you can't afford.. what would you do?? Give up a good career which you enjoy in a top firm just to pacify her or would you rather give up on her and concentrate on the job till you find someone who is more understanding on the nature of your job. Cheers!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Boy, that's a tough one to answer.<br><br>A good job is just as hard to find as a good GF or wife.  If it was me, I'd try and make time...no one never has no time.  Evryone's got some kind of time...if he's willing to make it.  Like no matter how busy I am..,and belieev me, it can get really busy, I always can find time for my GF.  It's a sacrifice, but can find....But on the other hand, she's busy, but not by half as much and she usually has a very hard time trying to have time for me....<br><br>It's just a matter of how much u want to find the time.  If it doens't happen, then find another girl.  If she ends up marrying u, would u feel happy knowing that it's going to take u another 5-10 years to get to the position that u would have got to if u stayed with ur job?<br><br>Just an opinion.  Besides, if she can't accept that u are busy then u aren't what she was looking for and vice versa.  Anyway, it isn't like u were with her before u got busy. If u were with her and were spending a lot of time for her, then suddenly u got a jobn that would totally take u away from her...then it's your fault and u should feel guilty.  It's still ur responsibility to make sure u find the time.<br><br>Hope it's clear and noone gets the wrong idea:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I definitely choose career.<br><br>There are lots of good girls out there.  But there are hardly any good careers that offer something that you like doing and $$$$$.  A lot of jobs out there are just "flipping burger jobs".<br><br>If she is a reasonable person and likes u very much, she would definitely understand.  Don't get me wrong.  I dont mean u should concentrate only on your job and ignore her totally.  Nor do I mean she doesn't like u.<br><br>The decision is ultimately yours, buddy!  Good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would choose the girl of course....that goes without saying !<br><br>It's very hard to find someone who can really connect with you and to be your future wife, whereas jobs are everywhere...it's obvious isn't it ?<br><br>If my job was really impt, I am sure I can still spare the time...it's whether you want to or not, not whether it can be done. It's all about juggling and if she is a good woman she would understand.<br><br>That's just my 2 cents worth !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hehe</div>
