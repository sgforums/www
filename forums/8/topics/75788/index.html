            <div class='col-md body'>Some may feel taiwan's politics are more exciting than Jacky's show,anyone. I feel the greatest and most exciting show is right in front of you. Never-ending and u are 1 of the stars.<br><br>Often I find myself having to give politically correct answers or show face to others more junior than me but they get their way because they curry favour with the heads.<br><br>1 example. I know 1 class leader who is better of being a politician than student or something. All he does is to play politics in class,trying to curry favour with others while offering bits of favours for kickbacks and also flirting with every girl he sees. ok maybe this term is too harsh, but what he does is to get ppl to do his bidding and getting others' completeted practical reports. When u ask him what are the changes with schedules, he says dunno almost immediately. as a class leader i find he shld know because he liases with the lecturers. he does bother to plan for class outings or activities. sometimes i am the first to know when there are schedule changes because i ask the lecturer himself.  there are times where he doesnt tell u of any changes until the last min,where u cant do anyting abt it.<br><br>World-class politician.<br><br></div>
