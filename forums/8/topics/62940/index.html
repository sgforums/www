We don't really need man-made 'rocks' like the esplanade to appreciate art. Some examples are the handicapped ppl performing in the underground passageway in Orchard.<br><br>The govt can allowed healthy Art to perform without any sort of applications needed. Let talented artist who love to draw portray humans and ppl facial expression to set up their 'stations/stalls' in any open places in Singapore, such as underground passageway, covered walkway outside MRT, parks, etc. Same to other artists such as band, bagpiper, musicians, etc. Allow them to perform in any legitimate places without official application needed. Soon, we will hear and see artist in any corners of Singapore.<br></div>

Western art forms has garnered its current status is through years of history whereby western countries dominates the world scene economically and culturally.<br><br>As China and India open up, we will get to see more of Asian art coming up. But it would take years before they can enjoy the kind of status western art forms have.<br><br>I don't see how Singapore can come up with its own art form as it is economically dependent on other countries. Hence, it has to be an ally to the superpower of the world as well as to have very good relations with the future superpower(s) of the world to survive.<br><br>Culture and economy are inter-related. So, to cultivate software for Singapore, the future superpower has to be identified, so that a critical mass of audience can be cultivated to boost the arts scene economy. Although there are some Singaporean art works/forms, like Jack Neo's movies but this cannot have a worldwide appeal as it's based very much on colloquial language. So the next best thing is to 'follow the leader' in order to ensure survival esp economic survival.<br><br>Art cannot survive without a proper environment and $$$.<br><br></div>
