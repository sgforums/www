So now the issue is environmental pollution?<br><br>And again, as a Buddhist, do you receive angpows during CNY, since you dont like to mix two religion or practices?<br><br></strong>[/quote<br><br>talk to u will puke blood.<br><br>Are you so sure that EVERYONE who read this thread will not think of it as buddhism?<br><br>In my last post I said BOTH "wrong idea" and "pollution". This further goes to show that you're an idiot.<br><br>Ang Pows are not as destructive to the environment as burning paper. [/b]</blockquote>Also making me puke blood. I already said the topic so far has no presented a case for misconception from the start. Thats why I said, unless you xin zhong you gui, is there a need to harp on it? Why you wanna keep emphasising it?<br><br>Ok, unlike you, I will admit my bad on the pollution part, but I am more interested in whether you do receive angpows during CNY, since you do not like to have others have misconceptions about Buddhism and folk practice.<br><br>But then nothing will make me move from my position that you just made insinuations against somebody's else beliefs and its also very nice, a Buddhist calling me an idiot and losing his temper.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I believe you yourself were introduced to Buddhism without putting down others' beliefs. People of other faiths have minds to think and eyes to see, so why the fuss? You claim to want people to understand the difference between Buddhism and folk practices, but is there a need to attack the latter constantly?!<br><br></div>
