            <div class='col-md body'>There's a few kind of security tags. The sensormatic (rectangle in grey) beeps while the ink tag (round in yellow) don't. The ink tag is normally tagged on merchandises placed near the door so dat it doesn't trigger the alarm too often easily. Ink will definitely leak &amp; spoil ur merchandise shld u try to remove the tag. It has been printed on the tag in red, warning u not to try removing it urself.<br><br>Pls try to understand, u'r actually returning a soiled defective pc which incurred them losses when they could haf juz removed the tag &amp; save tat pc of sweater. Now, they r offering u an exchange despite 1 item lost but u'r still pushing for a refund.. dat makes 2 items lost! Juz get another replacement la..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Japanese Yen = Sing $? Y compare? U go try shopping in France den u come back &amp; complain sg's service ok? The alarm isn't supposed to sound anyway. Yes, it is indeed the cashier's negligence for not removing the tag but human mistakes is inevitable. Y would they wanna put a tag on the items if customers can easily remove it themselves? U would need the proper device to remove the sensors.<br><br>Y don't u juz admit ur mistake for being geh kiang?
