            <div class='col-md body'>hi ... just wanted to offer my 2 cents worth on this topic. in my opinion, it's not the amount of money that counts here ... 10 bucks for 6 months is a very very reasonable price. what matters here is the mode of payment. how many people who visit sgforums have access to credit card payment ? i dun think they would ask their parents ( the people with the plastic) to pay .... den somemore with the recent dbs thingy that happened... the consumer wouldn't feel safe tranferring money online. then there's the issue of personal cheques ... very troublesome and again, how many people have access to cheques ? just how i feel ..... thanks for reading ...</div>

There are numerous projects in the pipeline for this kind of payment mode.<br><br>I know that there is a cinema operator (it should be Eng Wah if i remember correctly) that is piloting this mode of buying tickets ..... and it is a tie-up with NETS.  As this kinda of technology is still relatively new so it is still quite tedious and cumbersome (involves registering at webpage and stuff) to start with.  Maybe this is another avenue to look into.</div>

DBS to POSB and vice versa.<br>However, from say POSB to UOB or POSB to OCBC may be a problem as they are not interlinked yet !<br><br>2)Unless the person who transferred the money gave you his account no., there is no way you'll know who transferred you the funds as all you'll get from your bank notification is a bank reference number which may or may not reveal the identity or a/c number of the depositor !<br><br>3)Giving your bank account number will be no problem, but instead "hit the jackpot" as there are known cases some bank employees depositing huge amount of monies from dormant accounts by error to a wrong acount number.<br>Wah, what a windfall !<br>Anyway should this happens, they will rectify the correct amount before you can even detect the major error !<br><br>What I would suggest is depending on the bank that you have right now, perhaps open one each say POSB, UOB and OCBC, so that anybody can deposit to your respective account without any problems.<br>It may sound complex and confusing, but all that is required from you is to get these depositors to inform you by email of the date and approx. time of deposit, and the bank that they'd used to deposit the funds and to which a/c(bank).<br>So, end of the day, you have the funds in your respective a/cs and problems solved.<br>However, it will be some time before all banks allows immediate transfer through all the local banks in S'pore.<br>For the time being, I think you can take the above option, or as per my earlier suggestion get yourself a PO box, and accept cheques payable to your site.<br>Hope my suggestions will help you solve this payment option problem.<br>Good luck !</div>

All you need is a bank account and ATM card sure would make things MUCH EASIER...?<br><strong><br>Just some queries I have, wonder if anyone in this forum experienced with using ATMs to transfer funds can provide the answer:<br><br>Let say I have a POSB account<br><br>- can different banks transfer funds to me?</strong><br><br>Linked banks can... Banks not under the same group can't... eg. POSB linked with DBS; UOB, OUB &amp; OCBC (the rest I can't remember liao..?) are linked... This problem shouldn't be big as the 2 more popular groups are listed above... All you need is to have an account for each... But note that you might have to pay leviation fee is the account $$$ is low.... So ideally have your funding something which hits above the monthly required... The rest can go to the 'overheads' and perhaps outings in the future...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong><br>- will I be able to know which account transferred the money? (ie, will I know who sent me the money so I can give them their membership)</strong><br><br>Like Informer have suggested, quite UNLIKELY.... But you can TRY:<br><br>1. Asking people to mail you their receipt with their name or nick on it....<br><br>2. This is an APPROXIMATE METHOD. Ask them to e-mail you and let you know the date and time of transfer... Most probably when you update your account book, it would be stated there... If no more than 1 person makes claim to the same timing, you should have no problem with it.... Try to make as accurate for time given as possible, receipts should have TIME on them too... IF conspiracy really arise, you can perhaps then arrange for a meet up to verify receipt?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong><br>- will giving out my account number pose a danger to me?</strong><br><br>To my understanding, most UNLIKELY... Unless someone tries to give you a HUGE sum of bank in your account in which you might face investigation for various reasons... Just manage the finance of your account well and check with the bank when large sum of UNKNOWN $$$ rolls in?<br><br><strong><br>Once again I would like to thank everyone for their ideas and support.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Finally finished AGAIN liao...?<br></blockquote></div>
