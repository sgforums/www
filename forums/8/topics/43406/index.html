            <div class='col-md body'>Here's mine<br><br>March 21 - April 19<br><br>for Men<br>Personality: You are perceived to be passive, warm-hearted and quiet. However, you do own strong pride and ego, which no one can convert. You have the instinct of a pioneer and that is why you enjoy competing under competitive circumstances. This is why you fit for as a natural leader. Be careful of your destructive, hot temper. Sometimes it is necessary to show gentle expressions on your face.<br><br>Love Tendency: You have trouble expressing your feelings but you have all the romanticism stored in your mind. Now you just have to try to get this across to your partner because you are not the typical one-night-stand style of guy. You wish your partner would understand your mood swings a little more because that is basically the only negative trade about you. After all, your wish is to just meet a girl and keep a long relationship. Who knows if this is the person for marriage?<br><br>Life: Your strong, competitive spirit is a great asset for your future career. Employers really respect you because you are responsible and diligent. One day you will be acknowledged for that. Avoid stepping on other people or else you will hear that you are a tactless man. Take solid, small steps during your middle ages because you can experience a big downfall for that.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>July 23 - August 22<br><br><strong>for Men</strong><br><strong>Personality</strong>: The lively, conspicuous person at a party is you. You say whatever is on your mind and don't understand people who can't truly express their feelings. Your stubbornness sometimes gets mistaken as selfishness.<br><br><strong>Love Tendency</strong>: Your love affairs include lots of dramatic flair because you get yourself in trouble. It's wiser to stay out of dangerous women situations and unnecessary to start talking to every woman who crosses your walking path. However, this doesn't mark you as a playboy forever because you become truly committed when you start a relationship. The romantic side of you comes out when this occurs. You'll start taking her out to elegant restaurants and flowers gifts your darling deserves all the time.<br><br><strong>Life</strong>: Your trustworthy diligence will be helpful in your future success. Try not to look at your peers with contempt because this could be the obstacle to your goal. Your health will be good to you but aware that it will be difficult to get back to your normal condition if you once get into a slump.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>September 23 - October 22<br><br>for Women<br>Personality: You are a reserved and a calm woman but there are occasions when you vent out your frustrations. Those are the exact times you share your piece of mind with everyone. Although you have a thick skin and tend to think that things have to go according to your way, your affable charm makes up for that. You enjoy sports due to your athletic ability and fortitude.<br><br>Love Tendency: Your friendly generosity signals men to think you are approachable. Men are constantly surrounding you to the point that there'll be quite a few rumors and scandals you'll be involved in. Your interest in men never seems to end. The tendency to jump from one flower to another gives you the playgirl image.<br><br>Life: Even marriage doesn't stop you from being independent. Your great conversational and social skills make you restless to meet new people. An advice concerning your career is that you should choose an occupation that isn't highly competitive because it will deteriorate your health. A business of your own would also suit you very well, especially if it is a boutique or a hair salon.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personality: You have the tendency to enjoy the life of luxury because you love the limelight. People have to follow your way or they'll be in a disagreement with you. Your curiosity and variety of interest earns you many friends. You should be more careful about making split-second decisions.<br><br>Love Tendency: You are Mr. Popular among girls because you make them feel comfortable around you and your personality doesn't bore them. People will mistake you for a playboy even though you don't experience many relationships, thanks to your masculinity.<br><br>Life: Compliments from others are treats for you and you crave for them. Success will come to you from early on but you have to struggle to hold onto to it. Be your own entrepreneur. This will give you a better chance to succeed.<br><br><strong>I dun think this is accurate leh...</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for Women<br>Personality: Controlling your rolling temper is the best measure to take, if you would like your friends to remain beside you. Other than that your chirpy personality gravitates people toward you.<br><br>Love Tendency: Even when it comes to men, you are direct and honest. If you like them you tell them and if you don't, you tell them too. You don't see anything in front of you once you fall deeply in love with someone. This might be a time of happiness for you but friends and family around you worry about you constantly that you are too involved in this relationship. You have to learn how to balance this and your other responsibilities.<br><br>Life: You are destined for a great future. A charming family and husband will be a part of this life. But don't expect everything to be too content with your life but rather expect the unexpected. Otherwise, things will hit you with a fry pan out of nowhere. Another suggestion is to be wise where you spend your money. You tend to relieve your stress by means of shopping but try not spend it on frivolous items.<br><br>Match<br><br>Good Match: The most memorable love experiences would be with O-type Taurus, Cancers and Scorpios and AB-type Pisces and Capricorns. They will always be there to protect you. B-type and AB-type Virgos and O-type Pisces are unselfish partners who think of you first all the time.<br><br>Bad Match: A-type Leos are frustrating to you because they are constantly like to hear compliments from you and be accepted by you. They drive you crazy and due to your honest opinion, you guys are likely to argue a lot. If there are people who like to present themselves as cold people, they are the A-type Aquarius's.<br></div>

Sometimes your carelessness can lead you to embarrassing situations but you can cover that up with your enchanting charm.<br><br>Love: You tend to be fickle but this devilish side of yours might just be why guys are attracted to you. The relationships you enjoy are dates where there are no strings attached and men who admire you from far away. There will be only be one serious relationship you will experience and this man can tame you to a charming lady. One problem you might encounter will be your inadvertent humor. Make sure that your partner can differentiate that humor from your serious feelings.<br><br>Life: You come across as a snob at times due to your stubborn nature but people tend to think it's cute. That's your allure. You don't like to adhere to society's norms and constantly search for the true meaning of happiness. Thanks to the special fate you were given, you will hardly encounter monetary problems. However, there will be times when you think you are not saving as much as you are making. That's due to your expensive spending habits, which you should try to curb.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
