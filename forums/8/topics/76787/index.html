            <div class='col-md body'>haiz, abit borliaow. But nvm,here's mine.<br><br>The Little Girl and The Bird<br>Once upon a time, there was a guy sunbathing in the nude. He saw a little girl coming towards him, so he covered himself with the newspaper he was reading. The girl came up to him and asked "What do you have under the newspaper, mister?" "A bird," the guy replied. The little girl walked away and the guy fell asleep.<br><br>When he woke up, he was in a hospital in tremendous pain. When the Police asked him what happened, the guy replied, "I don't know. I was lying on the beach, this girl asked me about my privates, and the next thing I know is I'm here."<br><br>Police went back to the beach, found the girl, and asked her "What did you do to that naked fellow?"<br><br>After a little pause, the girl replied, "To him? Nothing. I was playing with the bird and it spit on me, so I broke its neck, cracked its eggs, and set its nest on fire."<br></div>

We planned to meet at a bar<br>for a<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;drink. I spent the afternoon shopping with the girls and I thought<br>it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;might have been my fault because I was a bit later than I promised,<br>but<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;he didn't say anything much about it. The conversation was very slow<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;going so I thought we should go off somewhere more intimate so we<br>could<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;talk more privately. We went to this restaurant and he was STILL<br>acting<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;a bit funny. I tried to cheer him up and started to wonder whether<br>it<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;was me or something else. I asked him, and he said no. But I wasn't<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;really sure. So anyway, in the car on the way back home, I said that<br>I<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;loved him deeply and he just put his arm around me. I didn't know<br>what<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;the hell that meant because you know he didn't say it back or<br>anything.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;We finally got back home and I was wondering if he was going to<br>leave<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;me! So I tried to get him to talk but he just switched on the TV.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Reluctantly, I said I was going to go to bed. After about 10<br>minutes, he<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;joined me and to my surprise, we made love. But, he still seemed<br>really<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;distracted, so afterwards I wanted to confront him but I just cried<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;myself to sleep. I just don't know what to do anymore. I mean, I<br>really<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;think he's seeing someone else.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;HIS diary:<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;Manchester Utd. lost today.

            <div class='col-md body'>As promised, first joke for this morning.<br><br>OMV of singapore women<br>Theory of a typical Singaporean woman's market value... here<br>goes...<br><br>20-23: Value is the highest. Most guys around the same age or<br>slightly<br>older are in the army or had just ord. So desperate for<br>companionship<br>and a sense of belonging and identity. So gals here can afford to<br>pick,<br>choose and dump. The gals at this stage are also the most haolian.<br>Becoz<br>of the attention they're getting, they are usually naive enuff to<br>think<br>that theyre some Jennifer Aniston or Elle macpherson.<br><br>24-26: The gals shud be engaged in a steady relationship. Trying<br>to work<br>things out with a boy fren. of coz, they may still date other guys<br>and<br>choose the best for themselves. some lucky ones are talking abt<br>marriage<br>liao. Some may still play the field or may be waiting for the<br>appearance<br>of that elusive tall, dark, handsome and rich knight.<br><br>26-28: Gals in this cat are usually in a steady relationship.<br>Should be<br>married at this age. Gals at this age group are not so haolian any<br>more<br>and are much more courteous and give more care and value to their<br>relationship. Gals still unattached at this age will usually<br>realise<br>they're not that desirable &amp; lower their standards.<br><br>28-30: Those attached and not yet married will start to pressure<br>the boy<br>frens to marry them, knowing that their biological clock are<br>ticking and<br>their market value diving. Unattached ones will usually put up a<br>brave<br>front and swear that they're fine with celibacy, which in actual<br>fact,<br>panicking inside.<br><br>30 and above: Lelong... lelong...<br></div>
