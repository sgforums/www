            <div class='col-md body'>There were 3 men in court for supply of drugs. The judge tells them if they can convince people in one week, not to take drugs they would not go to jail, but they had to use a diagram of 1 big circle and 1 small circle.<br><br>So the 3 men went away and came back a week later.<br><br>The judge calls the first man, who says he convinced 50 not to take drugs. He said the big circle is your ring of friendship before you take drugs and the small circle is your ring of friendship after you take drugs.<br><br>The judge tells him to go home and not to sell drugs again.<br><br>So next the judge calls upon defendant number 2. He said he convinced 100 people not to take drugs by telling them the big circle was the size of your brain before you take drugs and the small being the size after.<br><br>The judge told him good and also not to get involved in drugs again.<br><br>So now the judge calls the third and final guy to stand. He said he convinced 500 not to take drugs. The judge is well pleased by this time and says how did you do that. He said that the small circle is the size off your asshole before you go to jail and the large circle is the size of it when you come out.</div>

The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.<br><br>But the surprise came only at the fourth house where he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee.<br><br>She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door, and led<br>him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced. When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and a cold glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice.<br><br>And just before he stood up to leave, she poured him a cup of steaming aromatic coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cupÂ¡Â¯s bottom edge.<br><br>"All this was just too wonderful for words,Â¡Â± he said, Â¡Â°but whatÂ¡Â¯s the dollar for?Â¡Â±<br><br>"Well,Â¡Â± she said, Â¡Â°last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what should I give to you.Â¡Â± He said, Â¡Â°Screw him, give him a dollar!Â¡Â±<br><br>The lady then said, Â¡Â°But IÂ¡Â¯d like to say the breakfast was my idea.Â¡Â±<br></div>

That made me the grand-<br>father of my half-brother."<br><br>"This was nothing until my wife and I had a<br>son. Now the half-sister of my son, my<br>stepmother, is also the Grandmother. This makes<br>my father, the brother-in-law of my child, whos!<br>e stepsister is my father's wife, I am my<br>stepmother's brother-in-law, my wife is her own<br>child's aunt, my son is my father's nephew &amp; I am<br>my OWN GRANDFATHER!"<br><br>"And you think you have FAMILY PROBLEMS!"</div>
