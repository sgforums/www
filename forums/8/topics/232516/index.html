            <div class='col-md body'>From the looks of it, you don't have a lady in your life do you? And I do not mean family or friends. You go all out to critize the ladies.. and what does that make you? And at least there are many different kinda styles in which a lady can portray, lookswise or rather in her dressing and seriously if you've got it, fluant it, there's a diff between being sexy and slutty.. learn to tell the diff and I do not believe your eyeballs don't pop outta their sockets when you see a lady as such strutting down the street and get real this IS Singapore.. look at the weather.. do you wanna dress up in jackets or long sleeves and such?<br><br>When a lady has a problem are you even sensitive enough to tell? Also if she doesn't finish what's on her plate.. what business is it of yours? You can always choose not to eat it.. and if she were to gobble everything up.. you'd be labelling her as a glutton or somesort.. both ways guys always have something to say and you talk about ladies being crazed and all. Take some time to think of the situation both ways.. you ain't that perfect yourself.</div>

If you interested in the person SIMPLE rule be nice to him leh show it leh!!! Don't they have a better way to grab the guy's attention!!!??? I think they had emotional trama when young  ISSIT!!!<br><br>Why is it that woman when telling you all the problem, when you give solution they are angry!!!??? They just want you to listen tat's all!!!??? We man know one simple fact, when you got problem you telling someone means you asking for advise or help if you don't need help then why the freak share it!!!??? I think the whole generation of woman is suffering from serious self denial and depression... they are not thinking right!!! Woman brain seems to function beyond logic!!!??<br><br>And why issit that woman like to week very little and reveal alot... then on the street tried to cover themselves when someone else look at them!!!??? PEOPLE TELL ME IF YOU DON'T WANT SOMETHING THEN DON'T DO IT!!! So what is the reason why woman wear so little!? Weather hot or for the dogs to see?<br><br>Why woman like to buy clothes that is the more little material the more expensive one!? woman fashion seems to run haywaired on the theory of value for money!?<br><br>Why woman when eating always eat half then don't want already.... then worse push everything to the bf or husband, then complain that the husband/bf is fat!!! DON'T YOU KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE STARVING IN AFRICA!!! If you don't want to eat so much then don't eat so many meal a day!!! No wonder they say that half the earth resource is used up by 3% of the people.<br><br>I seriously think woman need to see phsycharist.... Singapore should have compulsory consultation for woman every month.<br><br>Ok maybe man are more weird.... dispite all these man still want to have  woman in their life.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">   cool down man!!  wow can see u are so frustrated with women, y y y???  eh, all women in the world offend u is it????  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Your basic problem is you don't have any idea about women.
