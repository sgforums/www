              hi, Hawk Eye, I was born 1978 in jiangsu province of mainland China, and went to a university in shanghai, then later moved to shenzhen of guangdong, this year was dispatched to Singapore.
              
              PRC is a large country, and most of the adult don't recieve high education, so the behaviour quality is much lower than in singapore, but it developes very fast, perhaps will catch up with the rest of the world in thirty years. and it has a very long history and beautiful scene, and most of the girls there are a little bit white than in singapore, some of them are cute. when have time can visit it, because it's large, so can see different side of it, and wouldn't cost you lots.
              
              and these days I want to import some electronics goods from shenzhen, thus can meet more local singaporean and get more money also, because one of my friends is in a travle company can take goods regularly.

              <p>PRC girls are actually warm and friendly...but quite naive and also not very smart to outtalk Singaporean guys.</p>
              <p>So I think Singaporean guys should go for them. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Hi colorfullife,</p>
              <p>thank you for introducing yourself to us! Welcome to Singapore. Actually, we Singaporeans are not that heartless lah. Although alot of us might dislike PRCs but its due to many factors that shape us into having such behaviour. Eg. More local company employ PRCs because of the lower salary paid to them than employing locals. If more and more PRCs come and 'snatch' jobs from us, where do we stand then?</p>
              <p>Anyway, its so little of me to be like one of the locals that dislike PRCs. Perhaps i should be more rational (<em>but my lecturer taught me that every ounce of our blood hates logic! How can we be rational?</em>) that not all PRCs are bad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, when in Rome, do what the Romans do. We would appreciate foreigners not to bring their worst attitude into Singapore. Eg. Talk loudly like nobody's business, squat anywhere on the floor, treating anywhere as if its the loo. Also, don't learn our Kiasu or Kiasee "culture". i'm personally is very ashamed of this too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have a pleasant stay! =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Parn, you woke me up from my negative views on PRCs (i mean meimeis).</p>
