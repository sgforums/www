              <p><br>this will be good. like create a nonsensical sheet and you must believe it like real when you tell them. when they hear it sure feel frustrated and start to grumble gossip here and there.</p>

              <p>just got a call from someone who enquire about something i selling. actually the item i have is brand new and i keeping it as a backup if my current ones should fail. so even if i don;t get any buyer its not a loss to me.</p>

              <p>Strange, isn't it? You would tell a coworker about that severely
              embarrassing time you coughed up a porcini mushroom on your boss'
              tie before you would ever share that sacred number.</p>
              <p>We take it as a given that, to ensure professional tranquillity,
              we keep such information to ourselves. <span style="color: #ff0000;">And for the most part we should. Finding out how
              much your peers and colleagues earn can lead to unforeseen
              complications.</span></p>
              <p>My friend - let's call him Ted - was talking about his salary
              with his colleague Russell. "We should just tell each other how
              much we make," Russell said.</p>
              <p>Ted was reluctant, but after further urging, he agreed and the
              two colleagues spilled the beans. As it turned out, Ted earned
              significantly more than Russell, even though the two were at the
              same level and had been on the job at the company for the same
              amount of time.</p>
              <p>Russell had recently had his annual review, so he couldn't
              readily go back to his boss to ask for a raise. Instead he
              grumbled. And grumbled.</p>
              <p>The old friendly banter that Ted and Russell had once shared
              turned into awkward and infrequent conversations, usually peppered
              by Russell with phrases such as "Well, I'm sure you don't have
              these worries, Ted." (Subtext: money worries.)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">By blithely sharing their pay
              information, they botched a perfectly good friendship. "The problem
              with these discussions is that there's often a winner and a loser,"
              says Bill Coleman, senior vice president of compensation at
              Salary.com, a paycomparison Web site. "Someone's feelings are
              likely to get hurt."</span></p>
              <p>Or someone's career. One of my former colleagues discovered that
              he wasn't paid as well as other staffers. When he asked his boss
              why not, the answer was a deflating "You're not as good as they
              are."</p>
              <p>Still, there's plenty to be said for sussing out the pay scale.
              After all, you work for money, and if you learn that you're earning
              less than everybody else, you can use the knowledge to press for
              more dough.</p>
              <p>Squeezing this information out of unwilling peers and managers
              isn't easy, of course, but you can do it - without hacking into the
              company computer.</p>
              <p>Here's how to conduct your investigation.</p>
              <div>Getting the real dirt</div>
              <p>You can start by checking industry salary surveys on the
              Internet. But you probably won't learn enough: In a recent study
              published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology, researchers
              found that internal pay comparisons (how much you make compared
              with the person down the hall) were more important to employees
              than external comparisons (how much the people at the competing
              firm across town are paid).</p>
              <p>You really want to know what people are earning at your
              place.</p>
              <p>The best way to get those data is to have a chat about your
              salary with whoever is your mentor in the office. You don't have to
              get specific; just say something like "Lou, I believe I've done a
              good job here and I'm planning on asking for a raise. Can you clue
              me in on what the company is paying now?"</p>
              <p>If Lou is plugged in and knows what your job's salary range is,
              he can offer the guidance without betraying any confidences.</p>
              <p>Here's another tactic: If you're with a large group of similarly
              ranked colleagues at, say, a bar, you can play the party game where
              each person writes his or her salary on a slip of paper, folds it
              up and places it in a hat.</p>
              <p>Mix the hat up and read the numbers aloud. The results should
              tell you all you need to know, and no one's feelings are hurt since
              the data are anonymous.</p>
              <p>Here's what not to do: stomp into your boss' office and scream
              "Why the hell aren't I making as much as Kovics?"</p>
              <p>She's likely to shoot back, "Because Kovics doesn't come in 45
              minutes late every day, take two-hour naps after lunch and insult
              as many clients as you do."</p>
              <p>There's nowhere you can go from there but the help-wanted ads.
              Learning that you are underpaid compared with a colleague needs to
              inform a discussion, not become the heart of one.</p>
              <p>After all, you don't knowthat much about Kovics. Perhaps he
              negotiated a better deal when he was hired, took on more
              responsibility, or has more experience.</p>
              <p>On the flip side, knowing that someone on your level earns more
              than you do means that you can earn more than you do. "Your salary
              is most likely defined within a range," says Salary.com's Coleman.
              "Once you know what that range is, you can talk about moving up
              within it." Nobody reacts well to "I want more money."</p>
              <p>A much better way to frame the demand: "What would I have to do
              to get more money?" Most bosses are happy to answer that question
              because now you're saying, "I am willing to work harder and smarter
              for you." The more you can emphasize that message, the more likely
              it is that some extra money will flow your way.</p>
