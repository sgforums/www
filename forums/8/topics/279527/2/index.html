I bet any normal ppl will not do anything to the guy, if you cant stand it, walk away. This is a public place, there's no rules saying that "Passenger who are too smelly are not allowed to board the train". Other has no right to attempt to ask him to go away.<br><br>You take bus in serangoon and got 20 bangladesh worker board the bus, you feel they are smelly, you scold them? TS, if what you said is really true, that lady really abit crazy.</div></blockquote>I agree. I'm not saying that BO is acceptable in public places but what right does she have to tell him off? By doing so, it still won't solve the problem (the fact that his BO won't disappear just like that). She could simply walk away from him and find another place in the train to avoid his BO. It's that simple.<br><br></div>
