            <div class='col-md body'>FFFWWWaaahhh.... 2500+++ Views and only few people reply.... Issit people don't like my story or just reading my story but don't reply...!!??? Hmmm... yea eh I tot of a poems today....<br><br>today the weather sibei sio<br>feel like drinking cheng teng sio<br>morning eat mee siam mai hum<br>afternoon eat mee poh mai hiam<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">... ok ok ok I know back to the story...Just do alittle chatting first mah....zzzzz Ok back to the story back to the story...so there I am sitting on the park bench with the girl whom to me one of the MOST beautiful girl really shiok feeling... then out of a sudden she begin to speak... "Do you have a gf?" She asked... of coz I abit malu lah I am not very young already still no gf leh... think my grandfather this age already got son liao.. I said "No" the wind suddenly blow towards us with a very cooling sensation... frankly at that time I was wondering weather its low tide or high tide now coz its something like 10 pm like that.. . before I think further she folded her legs and place her left hand behind me... leaning close towards me... while fiddling my back collar... For sure at that momment my face was no more than 10cm from her's. I could even smell her perfume and the little scent of alchohol from the wine she had she drunk just now... Basically I could hear nothing other than her breath and the rythematic beat of my heart.... At this point of time if You were me like any man The only tot that goes thru my mine is to grab her and give her a great passionate kiss a french one with love and tenderness... My heart beat like harley davidson... and her scent smelt like the most temptateous sweet pie one would ever ask for... somehow I trembled abit... I'm still a virgin to date... had a little short fling before but never into a really serious relationship... At this point I guess its a totally whole new experience for my comprehension... I was looking at her intermittently wanted her to know I do desire and yet guilty of such feeling...<br>"How do you find me?" She asked... For once despite the numerous conversation we had before I found myself totally lost of words... but managed to picked up my courage and speak out some words in a gibberish manner.."I really think you are gorgeous... the most beautiful I ever seen"... I regretted saying that... thinking a professional valentino would never than said such a mediocore comment. She smiled... "I find you really cute..."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all your support thank you thank you... abit pressure leh write liao scare you all don't like.... hmmm ok anyway I shall continue my story...<br><br>So you see I was there with her in the middle of nowhere in a secluded park in east coast... with a bunch of ang mos and chinese waiting for us to end the dinner... She was siting beside me and most importantly she said I'M CUTE LEH!!! wwwahhahaha... so happy... I nearly cried leh feels like winning the olyumpih like that... standing before the crowd while the flat is raised... singing national anthem... Mari Kita Singapura... ok ok sorry alittle deviated from the story now back to the story... so I was there suddenly I felt something... she actually laid her hands of my thigh... for a momment I was shocked and surprised... but it felt so good... like never before... her hands were gentle and soft surprising for a ang mo typically their skin texture are more rough...she was there... beside me...abit dumbfounded, but  I felt it is wrong.... it is wrong to take advantage of her... it is wrong to left her bf in finland wearing a green hat....before long the self righteous me had actually stood up... a vision drew my mind... imagining me in knights of shinning armour standing on the edge of the clift looking down into the oceans of man slaugther among themselves... the maiden kneed incline by the edge of my sturdy feet beholding it saying:" My lord please stay for I shan't knowth when I shalt see thy face...". I turned raised my hands in a palm toward her..." My lady my country requireth of me more".... a strong sense of self righteousness filled me... I felt noble and angelic to reject her advances... for a momment i felt valued I felt like a real gentleman... and most importantly A REAL MAN.. almost leviated above ground... when I got sucked back to reality... she looked at me with a little surprised... smiled... stood up and walk back to the restruant. It took me about 3 seconds to realised what happened... I regretted...Kaoz at that moment man I could really cry like a kid asking for mummy for toys... I felt like a piano just crushed on me by some litter bug. I was like thinking to myself hey I was just kidding mai ar neh leh... you can't joke one issit!? almost resort to kneeing before her begging her back... as I follow her quietly reproaching myself as we walk back to the restruant.. and end the day...<br><br>For days past I kept thinking of the incident... really regreted man... maybe I should really take advantage of her... or maybe I did the right thing!!! hey I should not be so bad lah... battling among myself for good and evil... days past... life is as normal.... soon thing begin to return to normal... when the following week... so happen I was working when I recieved a sms it's from her.....</div>
