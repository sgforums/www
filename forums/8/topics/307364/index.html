              <h1 class="title">World's biggest observation wheel starts turning in 
              Singapore</h1>
              <div class="segment">
              <div class="detail">
              <div class="gchild chrome1 left"></div>
              <p>The world's biggest observation wheel began turning in Singapore on Monday 
              evening, with corporate clients paying thousands of dollars for their "inaugural 
              flight."</p>
              <p>The 42-storey-high wheel, which offers a 360-degree view across the island 
              republic and -- on a good day -- into neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia, began 
              its slow revolutions under hazy skies at about 1055 GMT.</p>
              <p>At 165 metres (545 feet), the Singapore Flyer is 30 metres higher than 
              Britain's London Eye, said Great Wheel Corp, which built the Singapore 
              attraction.</p>
              <p>"The ride was rather exciting and relaxing. It gives a good view of the 
              skyline. It is a different experience from the London Eye and the view at night 
              is beautiful," Koh Choon Heong, a local businessman, told AFP after making two 
              revolutions on the wheel.</p>
              <p>He said he had previously visited the British attraction.</p>
              <p>"This is one special Ferris wheel. I'm excited to be the first few on it. I'm 
              keeping my fingers crossed so that it will be clear up there," Koh Pang An, a 
              Singapore company director, said earlier as hundreds of smartly dressed guests 
              waited to board.</p>
              <p>His reference to a "Ferris wheel" would make developers of the 
              240-million-dollar attraction cringe.</p>
              <p>"We don't use the F-word," Florian Bollen, the chairman of Singapore Flyer, 
              told reporters during a preview of the attraction last year.</p>
              <p>Unlike cramped, old-style Ferris wheel carriages that hang in the open air, 
              the Singapore Flyer and other large observation wheels feature fixed "capsules."</p>
              <p>The 28 sleek-looking capsules -- about the size of a city bus -- are air 
              conditioned and can hold up to 28 people. Passengers can walk around and will 
              not feel movement or vibration during their ride, which usually lasts about 30 
              minutes, the company said.</p>
              <p>Organisers said the attraction's first three nights are sold out, with 
              companies and individuals paying 8,888 Singapore dollars (6,264 US dollars), an 
              auspicious number in Chinese culture, for the first rides.</p>
              <p>"I've heard a lot about the London Eye and it is certainly very exciting to 
              now be on the highest," Koh Pang An said.</p>
              <p>A giggling Jessica Tay, who was invited by a bank, said she heard the ride 
              will bring good luck because of its feng shui, a reference to the Chinese art of 
              geomancy.</p>
              <p>"The wheel looks great and new. I can't wait to get to the highest point and 
              take a look at the Singapore skyline, especially the sea view," Tay said.</p>
              <p>Haze limited visibility for the first passengers but they could see some 
              outlying islands and Singapore's main Orchard Road tourist strip during the 
              sunset experience.</p>
              <p>"It was a very comfortable ride. Doesn't feel jerky at all," said one 
              passenger, S.K. Chan.</p>
              <p>Each capsule had two attendants serving canapes, wine and other drinks to 
              guests on the opening night, the first of a series of private events leading up 
              to the Singapore Flyer's public opening on March 1.</p>
              <p>Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse said it had invited about 70 of its private 
              banking clients for the first flight.</p>
              <p>Lacking natural attractions, Singapore has embarked on a major campaign to 
              spruce up its tourist appeal.</p>
              <p>Singapore's wheel is located across from the Marina Bay Sands casino complex 
              set to open in 2009, and is near the pit area of a Formula One Grand Prix street 
              race to be held for the first time in the city-state in September.</p>
              <p>The London Eye, which opened at the turn of the century, was the first of the 
              new generation wheels, Bollen said.</p>

              </div>
              <p>His Singapore-based company, Great Wheel Corp, is also building wheels in 
              Beijing and Berlin, which will edge out the Singapore Flyer as the world's 
              biggest when they begin turning in about two years, he said.</p>
