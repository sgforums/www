I mean such people are scary cos they are like so into the christian thing its really very... rude the way they pester u.<br><br>I am not condemning Christianity.... the theory behind the religion is sound....like most religions...what I h8te about Christianity is the historical horror behind it... it was essentially politics in the middle ages... crusades against muslims.... destroying cities.... like wiping out the Cathars in the name of the "Lord"... and burning old ladies saying they are withces... all that bull shit!<br><br>But thank goodness Christianity in Singapore not so horrible like olden days... but it is still quite unbearable to listen to the fanatic people here... although they are not quite so zealous as others i have seen from New Zealand... <strong>listening to a pastor at CHC is like listening to a erupting Volcano</strong><br><br>I think that Christianity is widely practiced here because people want to be more Western....and Christianity is  seen as the WHite Man's Religion... and you all think that wearing the cross around your neck will make u all white... and be accepted in the Western circle and culture.... but honestly you don't need to be in the religion... i dunno why people think like that. Furthermore people think it cos America is like the most "Fashionable" and "white" and more importantly <strong>"CHRISTIAN!!"</strong><br><br>And if u people think like that...then i am sorry for you.... cos people in the West are really not into it now.... Churches in England are knocked down... and turned into Bars and Apartments... people don't believe in it much now... in fact most Westerners are going into your Asian Religions such as Buddhism (epecially Meditation; which some churches say is Satanic haha).<br><br>So I see a relgious criss cross... in the world!</div>

In the old testament, there is a guide that people should give 1/10 (10%) of their harvest to God  as an offering. However, in the New Testament, all these traditions were broken and the Word says that give cheerfully, give according to your heart. Thus, my conviction is that we as  christians do not have to give strictly 10% right now as a law but we give according to our hearts. But some churches of course gave the "10%" as a guideline but never as a rule. I don think any church will condemn any christians if he/she gives lesser than 10%, which is but a guideline not a rule.<br><br>And I dun think its a mass orgy. Thats not very nice. Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>been a while since I came here and it is still a bashing ground for Christians  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Christianity has been around for a long time and very much of Christianity's history is that of European history, both good and bad. Some time around 300 AD Emperor Constiatine (whatever) stopped presecuting Christians and began believing in God (he wasn't baptised though). It was said that God granted him an important victory in the battlefields. Soon around that time, Christianity became popular and many ppl converted. From then, Christianity was embedded in European history. Of course there were really bad times and good times.<br><br>During the bad times, faith became superstitions and some Christians broke off from the Catholic Church and formed their own sects. Sometimes, countries broke away from the Church (England and the Eastern World). But no matter what it was, the Catholic Church and some main denominations survived too (Cause Jesus promised that the gates of Hell will not prevailed against the church. etc etc.) btw this is my own summraised form, any expression error is just on my part, go grab an objective history of Church book and read. Interesting parts are from 300-500 AD and 1400-2000++ AD.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Though, I am a Catholic, I am not going to judge which church is right or wrong. The charismatic way of prayer is just a way of prayer. Just like meditation with the Bible is a way of prayer. There is nothing wrong praying in tongues.<br><br>Theologically speaking, praying in tongues is allowing the Holy Spirit to help you pray better as you do not know what and how to pray best. Sure, anyone will be freaked out the first time they see a mass of ppl praying in tongues. I was freaked out too but after I understand that those ppl praying are not nuts who are possessed I feel a bit better.<br><br>The thing is this praying in tongues is not a fashionable thing. It is a private gift ie u and God's link of communication. In a community, you pray together with ppl who usually have tongues  or ppl who understand tongues. IMHO, inviting ppl to this praying of tongues is not a good way to let others experience God. It simply a freak show to them. Go show them God's wonderous creations, like chio bus and yan daos in church or something lah. There are 1 million and 1 other ways to do it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
