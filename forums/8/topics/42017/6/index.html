            <div class='col-md body'>I guess i just wanna summarise it up by saying that a religions' teachings do not amount to condemnation of another. It is true that God says that only through Jesus can people come to Him. That is a truth in christianity but may not be to some of you. When I tell my frens this  truth  i believe, i make it clear in no  way do i condemn them or their  religion, in the same  way, i take no offence when someone tells me that christianity is alot of bull cos i rather people tells me that than telling me they do not know anything abt christianity. To be  able to say Jesus is bull means you must have read quite abit  about Him, and I thank God for that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Beyond our faith an beliefs, my  frens are very important to me.  I cannot  give concrete evidence that I will go to heaven but mine faith  in God is afterall a faith but a strong one.

Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?'"<br><br>Some people believe for the sake of going heaven but  a true disciple who believes in God will produce 'Fruits' or in one context good works. Remember, good works is a result of us putting our trust in God and  God enables us to do good works in His name. It is not good works that make God accept us.<br><br>Thus God is saying Thus by their fruit you will recognise them, any true believers will have fruits  naturally becos God will enable them, but people who just use their mouth to pay lip service will never enter the kingdom of God.<br></div>

Unfortunately, that is true according to God. I have tried to tell this truth to my frens in a more gentler way sometimes  and of cos met with disdain most of the times  hahaha, but well, over the years God has taught me, why focus on that? The will of God when He came was not to throw  PEOPLE, His own children into hell, but His purpose rather  was to offer  us His love. In  Luke 19:10 (For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost) is the best example of His purpose. He did not come and say "Hey, believe in me or else go to hell" and round it off with an evil laff...he never came to focus on that. Unfortunately, if you dun choose to accept His love, the other  alternative is to  walk away from Him.<br><br>I understand your frustration on such teachings, it seem almost unfair  and 'controlling'. I use to think like you, really. But when I came to God, i realise that why do i have to focus on hell when i have a God who offers me love.<br><br>Cheers, no worries if you do not understand and still do not  agree, just trying my bes to explain.</div>
