But they are invited to the church to join "the family" there. For many, they never felt loved and wanted till these Christians come along. It's really a good thing to bring love to others who feel lonely, miserable or left out in the society. However, the important thing is the intention of the Christians who are showing this love. It shouldn't be for the intention to just increase the numbers of members in the church but to really reach out and touch the person with the love he received from God and those around him. Even if the person does not join the church eventually. True intention of love is rare these days so many ppl do doubt the intention of many Christians. I think the onus should be on the Christian himself to reflect upon his intentions and actions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But there are those who treat the church as a social club. To cling onto the "friends" there for support and companionship. Frankly, I think as Christians, we should be more charitable to share some love and time with these guys even if they don't really believe. Perhaps given the time and chance, they will be touched somehow and convert.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Well I am not dissing speaking in tongues.

But the thing is do not bring non-Christians or lukewarm (not very stanuch) Christians into prayer meets with lots of ppl praying in tongues. Unlike most Christians who would have the time and desire to find out more, these guys would not have the patience to do so. They would just form their opinions and stay off the church (adding to all the negative stuff they have heard from it).

And if that brings ppl to God, it can't be that bad.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wanna ask one qnÂ….if CHC is not a christian establishment, does it satisfy the criteria for a cult?<br><br>By Christian standards, it is very probable since I have seen Buddhism, Yoga, Role-Playing games, New Age movement, etc, being classified as cults. CHC seems a toned-down Osho movement. If one reads OshoÂ’s books, one can see that he does have some spiritual insights, but his practices includes loud music and Â“female mediumsÂ” --- a polite word for mass orgies, which I think will always find a ready audience, but is hardly spiritually fulfilling.<br><br>So why is there the selective discrimination?  This is a lesson in the way religions prey on the minds of people.  One must separate religion from spirituality. Religions are nothing but a guide to spirituality.  Spirituality is the relationship Man has with the Supreme.  What does it matter if religions are different but lead to the same goal?  Even when one has a chosen religion, it must be practiced in the true spiritual sense. Do not swear Blind allegiance to ANY religion. This is the path of Crusades and Jihads, a path far, far removed from the true spiritual path.<br><br>Besides, I have replied to another thread with my view on Church establishments. One can view it here: <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=41923&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=41923&amp;page=4</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by talk_cock:</div><div class="quote_body">Just wanna ask one qnÂ….if CHC is not a christian establishment, does it satisfy the criteria for a cult?<br><br>By Christian standards, it is very probable since I have seen Buddhism, Yoga, Role-Playing games, New Age movement, etc, being classified as cults. CHC seems a toned-down Osho movement. If one reads OshoÂ’s books, one can see that he does have some spiritual insights, but his practices includes loud music and Â“female mediumsÂ” --- a polite word for mass orgies, which I think will always find a ready audience, but is hardly spiritually fulfilling.<br><br>So why is there the selective discrimination?  This is a lesson in the way religions prey on the minds of people.  One must separate religion from spirituality. Religions are nothing but a guide to spirituality.  Spirituality is the relationship Man has with the Supreme.  What does it matter if religions are different but lead to the same goal?  Even when one has a chosen religion, it must be practiced in the true spiritual sense. Do not swear Blind allegiance to ANY religion. This is the path of Crusades and Jihads, a path far, far removed from the true spiritual path.<br><br>Besides, I have replied to another thread with my view on Church establishments. One can view it here: <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=41923&amp;page=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=41923&amp;page=4</a></div></blockquote>erm don't think CHC is a cult... i guess for any group to be a cult, the group would be quite close minded about most things ie I am always right and you are so wrong etc... A cult would usually use beliefs to influence, indoctrine, brainwash ppl so as to serve its selfish purpose. Typically, a cult judges ppl's character and "send them to hell" (what the heck, only God knows who deserve to go to hell). The thing is there are too many gray areas in identify which groups are cults. So we try not to judge groups as cults... esp when they have much more money than most churches, one of their pastor sell albums and they got some of the most expensive that every church dreams about.<br><br>Personally I enjoy big crowds singing together praising God, better still if the worship leader is lively and can draw ppl's enthusiasm. To draw it parallel to some mass orgies in some cult is somewhat funny (to me only, i always try to see the funny side of life) and very offending to many ppl who enjoy prayer this way. This form of prayer can be a very enriching and refreshing to many. It is just that some may need it to sustain their spiritual life with God, others would very much prefer the peace and listen to God. Both ways do about the same thing.<br><br>I know you have many misgivings about religion esp its management structure. When any organisation gets too big, there are bound to be problems. When the religious get into political power, there is a very good chance that there would be lots of manipulations using the name of God. But know this, the religious organisation is just not only about its leaders but also consist largely of its followers.<br><br>Take the Catholic church for example, thru' history, there were many years which corruption, sins and lots of crap abound in the church. But how the heck did it survive till now with 1 billion followers? It is the faith of its faithful, the grassroots who is the church. The church is broken, but it is the gift from God. Look at the body of Christ on the cross, it is broken but it is just that which saves the world. The church is afterall the body of Christ and not the crap/sins of those in control (dirt/spittal on Christ's body). Would you forsake the church because of its flaws? Or would you love it despite its flaws and love it because many more struggles with you to find God in their everyday life?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

God is of course important, without God, we are less than nothing (don't ask me how that is possible  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). But when you look at the Bible, Jesus's focus has always been on people. God loves people and treasures everyone. That is why people is important to God and to us. To care for the others goes beyond one's liking because now it has to be unconditional (the way how Jesus shows us). But please don't misled anyone thinking that you want a relationship out of it. To care for a platonic way. Hopefully, we can let down, those who are chasing us, gently  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  and bring God to them.<br><br>Bible bashing... though I applaud the intentions of many who cares about your neighbour by "bashing them", there more ways to convert a prodigal son. Tact needs to be used to tell ppl their flaws and weakness. It must be supportive, caring and constructive. Never criticise the person, but the actions. Love the sinner, hate the sin etc. Reaffirm the person's good points after criticising so that it wouldn't seem too loopsided. Try to emphatise and understand before criticising as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I can't say that I am for Bible bashing... can't remember that Jesus used the scriptures to "bash" anyone. Unless someone used the scriptures to challenge him first.</div>

IÂ’ve heard you speak on 2 separate occasions. First at Shangri-La Hotel for a Business Breakthrough seminar, and then also at Suntec City for a Market Place Convention. I thank the Lord Jesus for you, as your speeches have truly blessed me!<br><br>IÂ’ve founded a retail business in Singapore call 'ONE.99shop'. It is a store where all things are sold at a fixed price of $1.99. The business has since expanded into 12 branches island-wide, and two new concept shops, U-Neek and Bubble Bags, are currently being developed. All this could not have taken place without the blessings of the Lord!<br><br>Brother John, I need your advice over some questions that I have been praying about.<br><br>With the success of my business, the chairman of an MNC in Kuala Lumpur has expressed interest in investing in my company.

This investor has proposed a joint venture with me to bring the chain over to London, where we will both have a 50/50 share.<br><br>The questions that I face are :<br><br>(1) With the potential investor being a non-believer, should I be 'unequally yoked' in this proposed joint venture?<br><br>Would it be better if he is becomes a minor shareholder in my business?<br><br>If not, then what if the company goes IPO one day, and there are many more non-believing shareholders in my business?<br><br>(2) Is it advisable for the London deal to be 50/50, such that a believer and a non-believer have equal shares of the company?<br><br>(3) How can my company be a Â‘Christian' one if I have a non-believing partner?<br><br>I look forward to your reply.<br><br>Thank you and May the Lord continue to bless you.<br><br>In Christ,<br>Nanz<br><br>John G.Â’s reply to Nanz<br><br>----- Original Message -----<br><br>From: John Gagliardi<br>To: Nanz Chong<br>Subject: Re: Greetings! Need your advice.<br><br>Dear Sister Nanz:<br><br>I have, as IÂ’ve promised, prayed, talked to some wise people, looked at the original Greek, and read a couple of relevant books with regards to the matter that you have asked for my advice.<br><br>It is a common issue, and one that we should be very clear about.<br><br>Having said that, it is not my role to tell you what you should do - ultimately, it is between you and God, and you must have the peace of the Holy Spirit in your heart, whatever you decide. Pray and read the Word daily as you come to your decision - God will speak to you.<br><br>It seems to me that the intent of the Scripture in 2 Corinthians 6:14-18 is to save Christians from going into marriage or other partnerships with non-Christians because of the potential for conflict and disagreement. I don't think it necessarily means that Christians are better or more ethical than non-believers (although they definitely should be), but rather that such "yoked" or "joined" relationships have great potential for strife when the "crunch" in the business comes.<br><br>Relationships, whether marital or business, always start off with a honeymoon period- where everything is forgiven, and no problems loom. But with time, questions and issues will start to arise, and the two partners will then try to find their own solutions from two totally conflicting worldviews.<br><br>In going back to the original Greek, the word for "unequally yoked" is "heterodzoogeho", which means to bond or join or yoke (a yoke originally was a wooden crosspiece fastened over the necks of two oxen and attached to the plough or wagon to be drawn) differently, or to associate discordantly.<br><br>The Greek word for "unbelievers" is "apistos" meaning disbelieving, without faith, or an untrustworthy person.<br><br>So the verse has the essential characteristics of "discord" or Â“conflictÂ” in the partnership, and the further implication of the "unbeliever" being "untrustworthy".<br><br>Therefore, it is clear that in going into any sort of partnership with a non-Christian, there lies the potential for discord and distrust.<br><br>If it is an equal partnership, 50/50, then the potential for conflict is almost inevitable. If the non-believer is a minority partner, say 20% as you mention, then you are able to control policies and procedures and the potential for conflict is less.<br><br>In the case of an IPO, the individual shareholders are usually so small percentage-wise that this is virtually a non-issue. Ordinary shareholders have little individual input in the control of a public listed company. In that case, you may well be able to control the company very effectively, with a relatively small percentage of shareholding.<br><br>I think the most important thing is to be totally honest and up-front with the potential partner, and tell them exactly where you stand on a number of issues.<br><br>Some of the issues I think you should confront include:<br><br>- Will the company tithe its profits to the Lord, and/or donate funds to Christian and other charities? If so, how much, when and to whom?- Will we hire family members into the business?<br>- Will we have a policy on hiring Christians/non-Christians and/or other faiths?<br>- Will the business be used for evangelization in one way or another?<br>- What happens if and when we sell the business?<br>- Are we willing to be accountable to each other and to an outside group?<br>- How will the death of a partner affect the distribution of assets?<br>- How do we collect debts - do we go to court and sue?<br>- Personal standards of morality, honesty etc..<br><br>Let me quote a paragraph from "Business by the Book" by Larry Burkett "Few knowledgeable Christians would marry a nonbeliever (although some foolishly do). Yet many Christians will enter partnerships with nonbelievers, thinking they can make them work. If they succeed, it is generally because they aren't committed to applying God's principles to their business. Usually these partnerships are rationalized on the basis of economic necessity - not a Biblical principle...For the committed believer, the decision becomes, 'Do I serve God or man?'<br><br>The best counsel I can give anyone about partnerships is to approach them with a high degree of caution. Unraveling a partnership is usually as heart-wrenching as a divorce...If you can reach a mutually satisfactory agreement on a partnership, I recommend that every single detail be written down...if the prospective partner is offended...it is better to know his attitude in advance."<br><br>So Mr. Burkett is VERY cautious in his business dealings, and I agree with his concerns.<br><br>Although the actual Scripture on "yoking" that everyone quotes is 2 Corinthians 6:14, but it is just one verse in a sustained piece of teaching by Paul that goes on from verse 11 to verse 18, and even on into 2 Corinthians 7:1.<br><br>It is a major theme, and quite a strong one, because Paul goes on to make the point that we are the temple of the Living God, and as such, we have to be very careful about who or what we link/yoke/unite that temple to.<br><br>Read carefully especially verses 14 through 17. He talks of righteousness being yoked with lawlessness, light with darkness, Christ with Belial (the devil), and the temple of God (us) with idols.<br><br>It is very strong teaching, and ultimately, my advice to you is to pray over these verses, asking the Holy Spirit to open them up to you and seeking the Godly advice of a few mature counselors, and then let the peace of God rule your decision.<br><br>Personally, I would say the 50/50 option is very dangerous; the 20% option is cautiously open to you as long as you have full control and all the issues are understood and agreed up-front in writing. The IPO option is, in my opinion, a different issue altogether, not necessarily invoking the "yoking" sanction mentioned in the Bible (unless it is a very unusual kind of public company that more resembles a partnership).<br><br>I hope this helps somewhat. I know it is not definitive, but as I said at the outset, it is ultimately very much between you and God, and what you feel God is telling you in this specific situation. God may tell you to do something that would otherwise seem strange, for His own particular purpose - but in the absence of any strong leading, just be generally very, very cautious in going into any business relationship with non-believers.<br><br>Proverbs 19:21 says: "There are many plans in a man's heart; nevertheless, the Lord's council - that will stand."<br><br>Always trust God totally, and obey Him - He will bless your obedience as He promises in Deut 28:1-14.<br><br>The Business Breakthrough leadership will hold you up in prayer, and please don't hesitate to email or call me personally if you would like to talk further.<br><br>Your brother in Christ<br>John Gagliardi<br><br></div>

What i am trying to say is not to discredit  any teachings here. What i am trying to do is that every religion always  have teachings to do certain things so that you can reap benefits. Even reincarnation into what  animal or humans depend on your doings in this life isnt it? All i can, every religion has a general cause and effect teaching, so what's so wrong abt islam or christianity teaching on it?</div>
