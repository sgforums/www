              <p>In the past, people have little or nil education, thus their thinking is much simpler. All they know is to get a good husband or wife and have babies to carry on the family line. No matter how poor they are, they will still bear children because they believe offspring brings them luck.</p>
              <p>Right now, things are different. The law is to protect girls from having more unwanted pregnancies. There's nothing wrong with that law. Do u think nowadays youths thought of marriage first before having children? All they thought of is the moment of sexual pleasure and regrets later. Not many youngsters can manage to bring the baby up, since the expenses of living are so very high now. Bringing up a baby is not an easy task, and I don't think they have the means to support them. Now that is totally different from the past, if u wanna compare the past and the present.</p>
              <p>There are many factors as to why the population is ageing now. U can't blame it all on that law which is suppose to protect those underage girls.</p>
              <p>Ok I think we are quite off topic now.</p>

              <p>When you use 2 condoms, friction and heat generated when the condoms rub against each other (meaning the two condoms actually move and the inner/outer layers would rub against each other, even you use lubrication or that there are spermicides) would cause the condoms to actually tear/break.</p>
