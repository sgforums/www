            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...Quality Post (QP)~~<br><br>The contents of a Quality Post should, first and foremost, bear relevance to the initial topic of the thread. Yes yes...while I realise that it is easy to sidetrack when addressing a certain forumite (esp when both are of the opposite sex) during the course of the exchange of ideas, please note that everything written can be read by others who are probably not interested at all (ie...spare a thought for them). For personal messages may I direct such individuals to ICQ, IRC or even the time-tested email programs.<br><br>Secondly, the post should be written in a clear, unambigious and concise manner. Perfect grammer, spelling and sentence structure is not necessary (I mean we have school already, no need to torture ourselves outside of school hrs) Such features in a post are certainly plus points (not to mention its intimidation and "whoa" factors), but most of us can get by without it. So long the idea gets through, that's all that matters. This may sound a little contradictory, but in practice we do it more often than we realise.<br><br>Thirdly, a QP should have an OPINION. Yes, meaning "yes, I agree", or "no, I disagree", plus supporting facts and figures. You see, a discussion cannot really flow with everybody sitting on the fence. Alot of us are rather shy to voice out our opinions, probably for fear of sounding silly or thinking that such opinions are unoriginal. As long as it was done in good taste and it is constructive, I do not think that anybody would mind it at the end of the day.<br><br>Next, we should note that a QP addresses the opinions and not the forumite as an individual. The line between the forumite and that of his/her opinion is seperated by a rather thin line, and it is very easy to cross that boundary, which may give rise to the dreaded (and unfortunate) phenomonon called "Flamming". While I admit that such threads can be quite entertaining, I do feel that the forums would be a much better place without it.<br><br>Now we move onto the minor things that give rise to a QP, starting with the length. There may be many different schools of thoughts on this one, but I think that the best length is one that fits onto the computer screen nicely. There are several reasons for this; If the post is shorter than this length, chances are it may not score well in terms of content and depth, while any length longer than that would discourge all but the most hardcore forumite to read through the whole thing. That would mean all of your effort in typing out that marvelous opinion of yours may just go to a waste, now you would not want that to happen right? Of course this is just a general rule of the thumb, feel free to disregard in times of emotional duress or when one has achieved a certain level of mastery in the English language.<br><br>Humour and wit, while not important ingredients of a QP, do add much needed flavour and colour to a post. Of course I have to stress, only attempt humour if you are good at it, else you would certainly fall flat on your face trying (which in a way, gives rise to another form of humour that has its roots in the realm of cheese..duh).<br><br>Just thinking out loud  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>okok...if you have managed to read to this point, give yourself a pat on your back for preserverance and now would be a good time to think of doing something better with your life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> hehe<br><br>now back to business....<br><br>Tet: *gives an AUTOGRAPHED Bitch Boyz limited edition watch (with Pacman on the clock face)*<br><br>Errie: *gives an AUTOGRAHED Bitch Boyz limited edition watch (with Firewire on the clock face)*<br><br>Pacman: I think I WAY exceeded 100 on this one man~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>"Life is like a box of Chocolates...you have to eat it before it melts..." -- El Joraen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, Mr Hart.<br>I have to just do a single reply to you.<br>Let see who long my rubbish can go!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Your point for short personal message to be used in a IRC, ICQ or even email is being noted but if that is the issue, what is there to write in the forum? We don't expect to come into a forum and faced with all the BIG and SERIOUS issue, whatever the topic is about. This can be a place to talk about a more relaxing issue. However, what I'm against is a reply of "Yes" or "No" with quotes hundred times longer than the reply itself.<br><br>I wholly agree with your second point. Grammer and punctuation is not an important factor though have to be very careful, in case the wrong ideas is interpretated by different people. English is always full of ambigious meanings.<br><br>Shy is not a major factor in the cyberspace. I have come across many people and several can be quite outspoken in the cyberspace but a shy and quiet person in real life. However its the voicing out without the need to flame a certain person. If the person voicing out his/her opinion has a good knowledge in it, just stand to your points regarding than dismissing the person with "you are stupid" or "you don't know what you are talking about". The person can always share his knowledge though there are some who is very unwilling to share knowledges and give advices. So always who you are asking help from and if the person is "helpful" enough.<br><br>A good discussion can do without a bit of "heated exchange". But one should know when and where to stop and using words to belittle the person. "Sitting on the fence" fellows is bound to be found in forum and most people belong there. However, share your relavent ideas, opinion and knowledge with the forumites. However, if the topic is too "complex" or "difficult" for you, move on. Don't just reply with a "yah yah" or worse a " <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">"! That is not helpful at all and really kills my energy scolling that bit more.<br><br>Now, if all posting is going to be this long, you can KILL me. It is not the length of the initial posting but the content of it. In terms of sharing views or asking for opinions, state your view as well. Don't just start with "What do you think of ...." and that's it. Very high of chance of moving offtrack is what I can say. And for replies coming in, share as much as possible. Talk about it. This is what forum is for. FOR DISCUSSION and not FLAME. So, DARE TO SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY, BUT NOT BELITTLE ANYTHING. However, always rememnber that some issues are extremely sensitive like politics and religon.<br><br>As a topic starter or topic replier, be always open for discussion and "slight" criticism. Do not just stick to your points and refuse to accept what others say. You are not required to change your opinion but be able to listen to what others have to say. If you cannot take responds that is different from yours, then don't even bother to post. The whole meaning of discussion is lost, or shall I say that it should be dictate?<br><br>Okay, shall stop here. Time to get back to work. Its a long time since posted that long!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> So for those finishing reading my "rubbish", give yourself a round of applause.<br><br>Now, this is for you, stupid damz mongolian yellow head doctor!

            <div class='col-md body'>Well mr bishamon, good to see you posting long and sensible posts like days of the old(not that I'm very old)<br><br>I always thought a forum to be a place for people to voice their opinions whether they go against the grain of my principles or thought... so my point here is if someone says something that you don't agree with, you are entitled to voice your OWN OPINION regarding the issue, but NEVER NEVER NEVER say something like, "you are a jackass for not agreeing with what i have to say, you dickhead"<br><br>Of course, the thread starter has to have some opinions to share with the forums in general rather then to just post a topic like, "Am I a jackass?" and then just leave a sentence like, "comments as above please"<br><br>Of course there's an issue of little chatter and banter in the forums coz everybody has gotten to know each other so well... that is relatively harmless to me... unless the entire thread becomes dedicated to chatting alone... which by then i think you are better off conversing thru ICQ, IRC or phone.<br><br>Hahahaha okay... i think i had my fair share of comments on this.<br><br>We may have enough stuff here to start a "Sgforums newbie FAQ" here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Doh!
