            <div class='col-md body'>Hi colette,<br><br>har? Nobody wanted pacman until you staked your claim? How can that be?! When I was here many moons ago, he was always linked to another forumite, *** ***. (HAHA!!! pacman dun kill me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) And I thought tet was busy declaring that pacman has the best arm. Sigh, now he tells me he e mails you as regularly as he e mails me. Dunno how many other ladies he has on the side  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>colette sweetie, dun be so greedy can? I let you and tet have everything already- his arm, body, heart and soul. I must put my foot down and say, "cannot, you cannot have his sense of humour"! *pouts* pacman and I go waaaaayyyyy back, even before the first bitch boyz club meeting (or so I think), when he tried to email me an interesting article.
