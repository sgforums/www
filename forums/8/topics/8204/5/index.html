Nonetheless...I am waiting eagerly for the release of X-men too.....so let's wait togehter shall we? You stuill have me for consolation till then. *winks*<br><br>BH:<br>My personal fav is Rouge. I think she is cool with attitude. And yes...the comics always feature her with a cute tight butt...that sure is a bonus...hmm...is she in the movie? And is the butt like buns of steel? Please feedme with the information!<br><br>And for your information, piracy in Singapore is like in depression now, with Sim Lim Square without piracy totally, I guess people can only be flooding to Malaysia for the stuffs, and since Sim Lim is out, the delivery service from Malaysia which used to be so convinient for the many pirated VCD buyers in Singapore is non-exsitent too. Thus that only means more risk to get the stuff over. Hmmm...I heard from a friend in customs that they were order to step up on checks for pirated stuffs. why not you mail a copy of it over to Singapore for me? Then I can seduce Jub to come my house and watch it with me....will you do me that favour?</div>

Though people here do have VCDs, they are usually brought in from overseas~ so I'm afraid I can't really help you there with the VCD situation, but if you want to get Jub's attention...I think a good way to start is to get a bald head    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Tet: Haha~ u dun expect us to standby 24 hrs in front of our PCs rite?

I also dunno how! hehe, jokes aside, I am also not a female and ahem, i prefer gals thank you. Maybe instead of flirting with PAcman, I shall try to wrestle the attention of you gals away from him???<br>But alas, not possible. The whole bloody forum knew the devotion I showered upon Tet and it sure would look funny if I participate in this wild idea and massive flirting!!! Look, even the Queen of Flirts also refuses to have anything to do with me, shows you how much of a pariah I am   :p Oh well, like she says, flirting is harmless and if my gorgeous Tet doesn't give a hoot about what her love slave does, so be it!!!<br>Into the fray I comes!!!<br>I might not be as handsome as Pacman,<br>not as hunky as him,<br>not as humurous as him,<br>not veiny arms like him,<br>but...<br>a very big BUT<br>I have heart, and plenty of devotion!!<br>Anybody interested in a Singapore Chinese,  slightly less hunky looking then Pacman love slave???   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">...all are welcome but remember ah, my mistress will always be Tet.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Dear Tet,<br>I am always yours and thanks for everything   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">...especially your heart.<br>*wink wink*<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 19 July 2000).]</div>
