Basically some of you have mentioned it already, that different people have different styles, and these are used in different contexts in different threads. It makes the whole forum more fun.<br><br>However, other than good postings, you need good threads to get it started. I think thats why sometimes there seems to be not much activity, because few people are stimulated enough to want to contribute their valuable points. That has been the case since early this year, where we seem to have exhausted the topics that people appear to be interested in. I'm not shy to say that most of them had to do with ger ger boy boy and sex.

Was quite amusing...as this was the first time I ever heard that symbols like the Ankh, The Eye of Horus, the Scarab were actually Satanic symbols!<br><br>Okok...I may not be a qualified scholar on the occult, but from what I know everything has 2 sides to it. Take the cruxifix for example...u invert it, it becomes unholy. Or the pentagram...the most common of all occult symbols, as it represents the face of *u-know-who*...but when u re-invert the pentagram, it really just represents the basic 5 elements Earth, Fire, Air, Water and Spirit (if memory did not fail me)<br><br>hmm...I seem to be side tracking a little bit here...but I just wonder on the validity of the Ankh as an unholy symbol...it is widely recgonised as the Symbol of Life by the modern world and its origins can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians, who wore it as a safety talismans (usually together with the Scarab)...<br><br>Oh dear...have I just started another topic?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Eck: Btw...didn't mean to startle you...but I am quite certain the author of the book did not know what he was writing about~<br><br>I think these symbols are...meaningless...it is humans who give meanings to them...just like Dumbo who always thought that he could only fly with his "magical feather", but realised in the end that he could still fly without it...<br><br>pacman:<br>*Applaud Applaud*<br>*sees colette and pacman in the same thread*<br>*nudges pacman on...*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>*hopes E*** H**** did not see the nudge*  :p<br><br>tet: I want the old goody shoe tet back!!!! *cries* *wails* hehe<br><br>------------------<br>"Life is like a box of Chocolates...you have to eat it before it melts..." -- El Joraen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...ex-kingbuaya here...call me 1st gen or 2nd gen....I think I prefer the term, mid 1st, early 2nd generation.<br><br>Anyway....I thought I make a appearance here since someone has been telling me that I should come to this thread and say something. So I pop in and see lovely tet, witty colette, playful errie....and of course the long awaited purr...whom I only have the chance to experience her history in Sgforums but no chance to flirt with yet. *winks*<br><br>I always beleive in fate, and as in many forums, people come and people go....we transverse the miles of the virtual world to meet and there will come a time when we all move on to other things in life. Thus the "dying" of the 1st generation and the rise fo the 3rd generation. This is a cycle I believe will carry on, soon maybe you may see the 2nd generation complaining about the 4th, and on and on and on....<br><br>As for the quality of post, I choose to ask myself a question, "What is quality?" Is quality a matter of words, verbs, expressions? Or is it the thoughts that transpires during the discussion? Or could it be the putting up of a good arguement? Or is it the ability to withstand the many many flames lashing out at you? Or....nevermind...I can go on and on and on...but I end up with on simple conculsion. A quality post is not a matter of a long essay, nor is it a matter of using latin. Nor is it about one's stamina on withstanding insults and throwing them back. To me, I conclude by saying, a quality post is one that can bring new light on a view point of subject, one that can express one's thoughts in simple short sentances which are easily understood, one that allows rooms for exploration and discussion, one that causes a person to generate interest in a topic which he/she would normally not be interested in. Such would be a quality post, for it truly allows a developement in a topic being discuss....such is the use of forums, to allow room for discussion and a place for the exchange of ideas.<br><br>Note the word exchange, an exchange means you give something and take something back. Thus sharing a thought with all. In this light we often see 2 types of posts.<br><br>1) The closed mind. I think I dun have to explain much on this. It is pretty straight forward. Simply a person is only interested in keeping to his own ideas and not bothering to take others thoughts into consideration. This is most of the time the ego at work. Where on refuses to believe that he could be wrong.<br><br>2) The bargain writer. Basically what I meant is just that, such people just post a simplistic answer, one that does not really contributes to a topic, like "That is so funny, hahhahahaha." Finish. Now it is not wrong of them to do that, dun mistake what I meant. It is just that such post discourages quality posts from reappearing. By their sheer non-contribution in the long run, they kill the thread by not contributing discussion areas to the thread. Thus the dying of a thread.<br><br>For the 3rd generation we are talking about, I dun think they dun post quality posts, just that their level of maturity and life experiences does not allow for much flow of ideas and unique thoughts on life. Thus limiting the scope and view they can contribute to a thread. But look at it this way, would this place not be a good training ground where they can learn and listen to the many worldly view that are available here? And as time goew on, when they are more mature, they would be able to contirbute more plus our posts added into thoughts when they post in future. This would be a great breeding ground for great flamers and politicians alike.<br><br>And finally I would like to touch on lamers. *grins* In every generation we see lamers, from GBM, to shaolin boy, to pokemon(well he is not really that bad just that his area of expertise puts many woman off with it's disrespect.) to twinkle to Hugo. They exsit simply because there is a need for them to be, without them, the forum would be boring, without their exsitances a forum lose part of it's esscence. A lamer is a devil's advocate, and for a discussion to go on, a lamer is required to fan the flames, shit on our heads to stir some emotions. And that allows for an exchange of ideas. But in another light too much lamers in a forums kills it, for people will eventually go back to their caves to avoid the extensive humiliation they have endured from them. As more and more gets worn out, more and more leave, if there is too little new blood flowing into the forum...it will die of naturally death.<br><br>Thus I share my thoughts on this topic...is there a topic to begin with? *scratches head* NVM....I am glad to be part of this thread too...now to retire to the singles thread where I am having my fun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Thought there won't be any *long and quality* postings till someone else comes into the story. We wouldn't say if the generation issue is there. It seems more like the "old" forumites are being replace by the "younger" ones.<br><br>I agree on your point on the fact that many of them are young and have not seen and learn enough but there are some who experience things at that kind of age which they never expect in their lifes. It can be a shocking one and wake them up from the deep slumber.<br><br>Anyway, after all the discussion on the so called "quality posting" but who is to say WHAT is quality? Probably "quality" don't suit around here but its the "interest" that counts. Some forums are dedicated to sexual topic and we all know what I'm refering to. If you don't happen to know, don't ask me which forum is that. I would say that younger forumites might have some other topics that interest them but to "older" forumites like us, it find them "boring" and "childish".<br><br>Probably end of the day, the final question that is to be asked is "do you enjoy your stay here" and "do you like it here". How many of us have met up? Most of this thread replier have met up, and one period of time we are so active that we met up more than once a week. Probably during that period of time, the whole load of us are not that "busy". Most of us have found serious work to do and we have less time to meet up with everyone in our life, in the forums.<br><br>Whether a posting is worthy to be called "quality" or not doesn't really matters at all now. What matters is OUR FRIENDSHIP!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I always remember a quote from a movie "making love can be finish in 5 minutes but friendship can last a lifetime".<br><br>Wait a sec. What am I talking abt? Shit. I think I must be typing without my brain switch on. Due to the lack of sleep and overstress from work, probably I can come here and let go some of my rubbish!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>*SHOUT* OI! STUPID YELLOW HEAD! WHERE ARE YOU?<br><br>tet:<br>hahaha....<br>Okay, but before that, I have to seek permission from the owner of the arm first before I can pass it on to you. You like it medium or rare?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>HArt:<br>Okay, I know its *HOT* in Singapore but with *HOT* babes like colette flirting with pacs and purr coming in, where else can be *hotter*?<br><br>Purr:<br>Who have such great ability to contact our dearest *INFAMOUS* lady purr back here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>"HUAN WO HE SHAN!!" - Yue Fei</div>

If I were not so mature (ok, old, if you prefer to use that term) I would have fallen into the trap.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>With regards to what tet said about new people and cliques, I think it has to go both ways. Meeting new people and forming new friendships is not a one way street. Even if you take the effort in joining another group of people you will not be guarenteed success in getting to know them as better, at least to see them more than once. They have to be generous enough to welcome you and not let you feel left out. That said though, so people mix in easily, others don't.<br><br>In conclusion, NO ONE touches my arms unless I give them permission. They are so so but they are still MINE. WHahahahhahahahaha.</div>
