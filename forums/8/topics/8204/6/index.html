Time to move on. As for X-men, wait till I finish downloading it and ACTUALLY watch it, I will let you know what do I think. Anyway, I alwayz like Henry Mccoy and Angel. With X-men bring in huge opennings, not surprizing that the sequence might be in planning. Anyway, I believe it will be ages before the next one coz when I know of the movie for X-men, its years before I got into the army and u can count on 2 hands!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>There's more coming up, like Wild CATS and I can't remember what else. That is very "old" news anyway. I believe gambit is suppose to be very cool and a huge fav with girls though most will actually prefer wolverine. Its alwayz fun to provoke him!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Isn't it Magneto or Apocalypse that puts the ardamenxxx (dunno how to spell lah) into his body meh? Though I do know that "fatal attraction" is the issue that metal skeleton taken out of him. Interesting,probably that will be the next X-men theme.<br><br>Storm should be a wonderful in bed though dun agitate her else you won't know how u die in bed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Shiok:<br>Till you learn to drive, I dunno how you are going to "carry" the comics back home. I have repack it into another box and its damn freaking heavy and I thought my back is going to break becoz of it. Anyway, I will bury it in the ground and wait for it to see the "daylight" again.<br><br>pacs:<br>you are becoming a hot property now. The bitch boyz have discussed and decided to sell you off.<br>*take out "for sales" label and stick on pacs forehead*<br>Any takers?<br><br>------------------<br>"In physics, mathematics and astronautics it means over thirty; in other disciplines, senile decay is sometimes postponed to the forties.
