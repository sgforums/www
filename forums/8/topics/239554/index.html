            <div class='col-md body'>Kudos to this govt agency's quick response to the persistent problem, solution within a month's time.<br><br>However, boo boo for only reacting after news reports and complaints and of course... the investigation report that found no one at fault seems dubious<br><br><strong> HDB Launches Combined Balloting/ Walk-In System To Replace Walk-In Selection (WIS) </strong><br><br>HDB will be replacing its existing Walk-In Selection (WIS) system for unsold flats with a combined balloting/walk-in sales system called the Â“Bi-monthly Sale of 4-room and Bigger FlatsÂ” beginning Apr 2007. The improved sales exercise will incorporate features of the existing balloting and walk-in selection systems.<br><br>2         Under the combined balloting/walk-in system, HDB will group its stock of unsold 4-room and bigger flats into 3 sectors according to towns/estates as follows:<br><br>Sector A Â– towns/estates in the North and West zones<br>Sector B Â– towns/estates in the North-east zone<br>Sector C Â– mature / established towns/estates<br><br>The unsold flats under each sector will be launched for sale on a bi-monthly basis, on the 10th day of even months.1 The first exercise for flats in Sector A will start on 10 Apr 07. This will be followed by launches for Sector B on 11 Jun 07 and Sector C on 10 Aug 07, before rotating back to Sector A on 10 Oct 06 (i.e. there will be a sales exercise launched for the unsold flats in each sector every 6 months). HDB will announce each launch through a press release and advertisements in the media. The detailed flat list and prices will also be made available on the HDB InfoWEB and at HDB Hub. The towns/estates under the respective sectors and the scheduled launch dates in 2007 are shown in Annex A.<br><br>3         Interested buyers can submit their applications to HDB during the initial one-week application period. A computer ballot will then determine the order of selection and all applicants will be given an appointment to book a flat, subject to availability when their turn is due. Applicants who apply after the initial one-week period will be given appointments after the last balloted position. After all scheduled appointments have been processed, remaining flats will be available for booking on a walk-in basis. Unsold flats will be withdrawn at the end of the 5th month, so that they can be prepared for re-launch one month later. The step-by-step sales procedure is at Annex B for reference.<br><br>4         Flat buyers can look forward to the following benefits under the improved system:<br><br>(a) greater certainty when planning their flat purchase as the launch dates and location sectors follow a fixed pattern;<br>(b) no need to queue as all applicants who submit their applications in the first week of the launch will be given equal chances to select choice units through balloting;<br>(c) more time to study the flat list available on the first day of launch, before submitting their applications within the first week; and<br>(d) improved convenience with the option of submitting applications via the internet.<br><br>5         To facilitate the transition to the combined balloting/walk-in system, flats currently available for sale under WIS will be withdrawn by 15 Mar 2007.<br><br>Monthly Sale of 3-room and smaller flats<br><br>6         The combined balloting/walk-in system for the sale of unsold 4-room and bigger flats will be applied to the existing monthly WIS exercise for 3-room flats with effect from Apr 07.<br><br>7         Beginning Apr 07, HDB will offer 3-room flats, together with unsold 2-room flats and returned Studio Apartments under the Â“Monthly Sale of 3-room or smaller flatsÂ” to be launched on the 1st day of every month.2 As the number of such flats is smaller, the sales exercises can take place on a monthly basis. The sales procedure is at Annex C for reference.<br><br>8         To facilitate the transition to the improved system, flats currently available for sale under the existing WIS for 3-room flats will be withdrawn by end-Feb 2007 and there will not be any WIS exercise for 3-room flats on 1 Mar 07.<br><br>Investigation into Feb 2007 WIS<br><br>9         HDB offered for sale 556 flats in established estates under the WIS exercise on 2 Feb 2007. The formation of an unofficial queue outside HDB's Sales Office prior to HDBÂ’s announcement on 2 Feb led some members of the public to believe there had been an information leak on the launch date of the exercise.<br><br>10         HDB has completed its investigations into the matter. We interviewed 40 applicants who were at the head of the queue, as well as HDB staff and contractors involved in the WIS. We have found no evidence to suggest that information on the launch was leaked.<br><br>11         Investigations revealed that most of the applicants had decided to queue up based on speculation on internet forums that there would be a WIS exercise for flats in established estates in Jan or Feb 07. This arose from HDBÂ’s earlier announcement in Nov 06 when it suspended the sale of flats in established estates that the re-launch would be in 1Q07. Some participants on the internet forums even organised themselves into groups to take turns to keep watch at HDB Hub for tell-tale signs of a sales launch, such as the placement of queue posts. When they saw that a queue had formed for the regular monthly WIS exercise for 3-room flats on 1 Feb 07, some decided to join that queue in anticipation that it was for the flats in established estates.<br><br>12         Many of the applicants were unaware that the flats offered were balance units from earlier sales exercises and units given up by previous buyers. Out of the 4,600 appointments for interested buyers to book their flats, only 355 units have been booked, reflecting an overall acceptance rate of less than 10%. To date, there are still about 200 units available for interested buyers to select.<br><br>13         The incident showed that the existing WIS sales process could be enhanced to ensure greater transparency and convenience to the public. The improved system was therefore designed with these objectives in mind.<br><br>Enquiries<br><br>14         For enquiries, the public can:<br><br>- e-mail hdbsales@hdb.gov.sg;<br>- call the Sales/Resale Customer Service Line at 1800-8663066 on weekdays from 8 am to 5 pm; or<br>- visit the HDB Sales Office to speak with our customer service officers during office hours.<br><br>Issued By : Housing &amp; Development Board<br>Date : 26 Feb 2007<br><br></div>
