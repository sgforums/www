            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I went for a free trial. Then the consultant and manager spent more than half an hour trying to persuade me to sign up for a 2K package. Initially, I did not want it and told them point blank. I did not even want the trial treatment. However, they insisted on "giving" me the trial. During the trial, the consultant was very polite and gave me an "offer" - a $700 package. After the trial, I indeed lost 400g (although it could be the water I lost due to the steaming and thermal blanket that covered me for around 40 minutes). Somehow, I was more amenable to the offer at that time. The consultant quickly prepared the documents and the deal was made.<br><br>At first everything seemed fine, even my mother remarked that my tummy looked smaller. However, at the second treatment using cream and thermal blanket, the consultant tried to persuade me to sign up for another package. Then when I seemed uninterested (and very uncomfortable due to the burning sensation of the cream), she revealed that the current treatment could not help me to shape my body. If that is the case, why push me to get this package! Anyway, after the thermal blanket, I felt very giddy. Most of the staff members assisted me to a room to rest. Frankly, I was quite satisfied with their quick reaction. However, this changed when the consultant still tried to persuade me to sign up for the additional treatment. She denied that the treatment was the problem. Instead she told me that my detox diet (the plan recommended by London) was the problem and that I should at least eat some rice before going for the treatment. Fortunately, I declined the additional sessions because when I got home I felt itchiness on some parts of my skin and then rashes appear. I had to see a doctor about this<br><br>After telling the consultant, she promised to change the cream. However, I still have serious doubts about the treatment and the company. Then by chance I came across the following website:<br><a href="http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:...lnk&amp;cd=9&amp;gl=uk" rel="nofollow">http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:...lnk&amp;cd=9&amp;gl=uk</a><br>Now I am seriously afraid and hope to terminate the package. But looking at the Malaysian consumer forum, the chance of London giving me a refund seems really slim. However, if I continue, would the treatment be detrimental to my health? I still want to exercise (during the detox diet and treatment, I felt that my stamina was weakened).<br><br>Sorry for the long post, I am really not sure what to do at this point I should have left my credit card/ATM card at home when I went for the trial...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I received a call from London weight management saying that i've won a $300 treatment free on any 2 parts of the body. I did send an sms a few days ago to try my luck on some sms contest thingy.<br>I was wondering if i should go because i have never stepped into any slimming salons neither have i taken any slimming pills before.<br>Weightwise, I'm a rather average girl, just that I hope to slim down on my shoulders, arms and my hip areas.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  pls advise<span style="color: blue;"></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, you might want to reconsider because from experience, they will try very hard to persuade you to sign up for their packages.  Besides that, I'm not sure whether the sessions can be considered as healthy...You might want to consult a doctor/any friends studying medicine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The manager insisted that it's normal for people to feel giddy at the first few sessions of the "heat treatment" (wrapped up for 30-40mins) in the blanket.  Anyway, she recommended me to change the package and expected me to pay an additional $200 (total of $900) for just 5 sessions of their electrodes treatment!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sry to read bout ur situation.  Hope u can get at least some of ur money back.  I think the next time u come across pushy consultants who seem more concerned about their commission than your customer needs, u know what to do..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
