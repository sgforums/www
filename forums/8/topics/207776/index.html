If you are going to share your life together with another person, both of you should be open and transparent. What is there to hide from each other. For myself, I let my gf handle my hp, read my sms if i was not around at the time or driving, play around with my hp if she is bored. I also sometimes kaypoh go fiddle and read her hp stuff. I feel that there is no harm done. Unless there is something to hide would you insist on privacy and refusing to let your partner read your hp.<br><br>Is my thinking weird / unrealistic ?</div></blockquote>Going to but not there yet<br><br></div>

It's just about the level of trust between you and your girlfriend mah.. I mean what's wrong with having a sms from a girl.. You sound as though any sms from girls will be something that is obstructing the relationship.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
