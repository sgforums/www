            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, for some reason I always think Singapore Ahbengs are the most lowly lifeforms in the entire universe. They're like a joke to Singapore, there was once this group of people in cineleisure.<br><br>I stress, <strong>1st floor lift area</strong>, the place which has most number of people gathering cause that is the only "fast access" to the top floors if you know what I meant. Then 2 hip-hopped looking korean guys, (why korean? Cause they were speaking kongish) were talking and out of nowhere, this bunch of retards went oi oi oi oi , and one of them said. Knnbccb kabla kabla kabla.<br><br>Now this was the funny thing, 2 koreans look at each other, smile and laugh and point point. But the group did nothing. Obviously the group was in typical teck deck clothings, no rules pants, "no-taste" slippers and some side parting goldenish long hair. Easy identification ^^<br><br>Honestly, I'll prefer real "bengs" in Singapore, like those who do big things, drug trafficking, selling weed, u know creating REAL troubles. I never treated people "who travel in big groups and bully small sized people" with respect at all.<br><br>-Yawns-</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by TheVers:<br><strong>Seriously, for some reason I always think Singapore Ahbengs are the most lowly lifeforms in the entire universe. They're like a joke to Singapore, there was once this group of people in cineleisure.<br><br>I stress, [b]1st floor lift area</strong>, the place which has most number of people gathering cause that is the only "fast access" to the top floors if you know what I meant. Then 2 hip-hopped looking korean guys, (why korean? Cause they were speaking kongish) were talking and out of nowhere, this bunch of retards went oi oi oi oi , and one of them said. Knnbccb kabla kabla kabla.<br><br>Now this was the funny thing, 2 koreans look at each other, smile and laugh and point point. But the group did nothing. Obviously the group was in typical teck deck clothings, no rules pants, "no-taste" slippers and some side parting goldenish long hair. Easy identification ^^<br><br>Honestly, I'll prefer real "bengs" in Singapore, like those who do big things, drug trafficking, selling weed, u know creating REAL troubles. I never treated people "who travel in big groups and bully small sized people" with respect at all.<br><br>-Yawns-[/b]</blockquote>those tok veri loud and act sey de are those kids only bah....i hav 2 classmates whu were in gang. 1 of them jailed for drug trafficking, another was juz released from jail for almost beatin another person to coma</div>
