            <div class='col-md body'>Honors is only more useful at the start of one's career, not that much once you go further down your career path.<br><br>Don't expect to be paid more just because u have honors for your 1st degree. Civil service will definitely do that, some big MNCs may do, but don't expect it.<br><br>Having studied already and you are in your 1st job. Make good with it. But do know that engineers suffer a natural flaw. They become more expensive and value add less as they become older n more experienced. More prone to lay off. Imagine if ur work experience is 10yrs worth n ur pay is 5 times that of a fresh grad, is ur value add necessarily 5 times more that of a fresh grad? Unlikely if u are in pure engineering role. From mgmt's perspective, instead of having u, they'll just hire more engineers, keep less senior engineers like u n still be able to do the job.<br><br>Now job market booming. It's great, but everything moves in cycles, when economy goes down, be prepared, be nimble. Now is the time to start preparing urself. I wud recommend trying to move into  a role which has some management job function, it increases ur value and allows u even to change industries shd the need arise.<br><br>For further education, if u really want, then go ahead n do a MBA but only after considerable years of experience. Our local masters are still acceptable but go only for those which have tie-ups with reputable overseas graduate schools. At MBA level, it's not so much of theoretical knowledge. But networking and simply the reputation of the school which u got into.<br><br>U'll find that the pple that go the furthest in their career are those who know how to connect well with pple, outgoing, make use of pple well. In short they are pple kind of pple. If u want to go far, focus on developing this aspect of urself.<br><br>The true fact is no idiot aims low in their career. Everyone wants to be the best, just like no idiot wants to be poor but there are still poor pple out there. Every industry career structure is a pyramid, there are less places for the pple at the top. So u gotta differentiate urself and standout from the crowd.<br><br>How u do that? U have to find that out urself better.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Why bother getting a PhD if you're going into sales or business?<br><br>Regarding your second statement, on what grounds do you make that statement? There are jobs that only PhDs can do. For example, investment banks hire quantitative analysts with PhD qualifications. The IMF and World Bank hires PhD economists all the time. In biochem, only PhD holders are qualified for research. (degree and dip can only wash testubes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>Of course, you won't find jobs for PhD in the classifieds! PhDs don't look through the classifieds section and find job like everyone else, there are other channels for them. And don't expect PhDs to play similar role to degree holders or MBAs. Of course they are only able to talk to books, they are scientists, not PR managers! Companies hire them to talk to books and not talk to the hot counter girl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>PhD is a huge undertaking that goes beyond "finding a job". It is a dedication of your life to research. It is not just another degree. There are no lessons, lectures or syllabus to study or exams to cram. A PhD is obtained only through practical research.<br><br>Btw did you read my reply linking to the USA government research showing how education is correlated with income?</div>

Just curious, how much are the PhDs there paid? Hardly any info on PhD level salary around.<br><br>Are you sure his problem is not a language problem? (Ukranian?) Cause as far as I know you need to do lab work to get a PhD and that means working with people. Need to teach (Teaching Assistant) or work (Lab Assistant) also...which means interacting with people.<br><br>This is true at least for hard sciences and economics/finance. Maybe PhD maths no need to do all those, lock inside a room for 3 years can liao hahaha. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Wow, you could do his work? Does that mean you are a PhD also?<br><br>Hey, thanks for the valuable tibits man!</div></blockquote>You're right, poor Yev did have a language problem, and it's one aspect of how PhDs do need to be able to talk to people, not just books.  He was a lovely guy and once he got the idea, he was off like a shot, but his difficulty in understanding what was required of him is what did him in.<br><br>Anyway, Yev got his PhD somewhere the Ukraine and taught university Mathematics there, so he didn't actually encounter any problems till he moved to Australia.  Oddly enough, when he left he got a job teaching at a university here, and I honestly don't know how he's fared since.<br><br>As for taking over his work, my doctoral thesis was on Item Response Theory, which is involves a fair amount of calculus, so I was reasonably well-equipped to take over the role.  I've switched roles myself since, but these days my work still involves a fair bit of mathematics since I'm doing stuff like structural equation modelling.<br><br>I don't know if there's any authoritative reference for PhDs' pay scales - it all depends on the role.  You may be a PhD who does a lot of back-end work and be stuck with 90 or so grand a year, or if you have the people skills to go with the technical skills, you could go a lot further.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not to hijack this thread, let's say i doing honors in an overseas uni, how do i fare against those doing honors in SG?(Like employment, etc etc). Especially in engineering degrees<br><br>And honors in overseas vs. non-honors in SG.<br><br>I'm afraid if I take honors overseas and when I come back to SG to find jobs, it would be much tougher for me.</div>
