            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks fadingstar for twinkling again in the night sky. Was waiting for your post for a very long time. Guess in the end was worth the wait.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Was hesitant in posting for this thread in the first place as I know no matter how one tries to be objective in this topic, there will be a certain degree of subjectiveness in it. If one looked carefully, I'm the last person to join this thread. For the same reason, I've been leaving out religion on this issue, but after reading fadingstar's post, I feel that it's time for me to bring that up too.<br><br>From fadingstar, "what i have found in common (the reason i say we're all on the same side) is the belief that everyone should do what they feel is right after careful consideration."<br><br>ALthough I've offered some alternative  viewpoints on the subject, but my main message was what fadingstar has highlighted. Perhaps I'm not articulate enough to express that point clearly.<br><br>Okay, on fadingstar's post.<br>"my question then is this: have we now found ourselves in a new kind of dogmatism? where questioning, probing and doubting are the new forms of religion, the new (and unquestioned) edicts for today? "<br><br>Well, I guess your question is somewhat similar to saying is free-thinking a religion itself.<br>To summarise your viewpoints on religion(forgive me if I'm inarticulate enough to do properly), it is something to keep our morals in check, and with the lack of it might inevitably lead to the downfall of mankind.<br>So if free-thinking is a religion, would it also have it's set of "secret codes" to follow to hold it's "members" together?<br><br>A whim here, could it be that different religions having different beliefs be similar to different languages using different pronunciation of their words to express the same meanings and hence the different beliefs might be the same afterall, but we're just too deeply illusioned to see the true light of it?<br><br>"final resting place from which we should find eternal peace and happiness."<br>Are we searching an end or an eternity?<br><br>Is conscience a self-made values or religious values? They are actually of the same meaning but really depends on how you want to look at the overall picture. The values of a person is shaped according to his/her own faith(religion that is), and depends on how you would want to interpret your own faith, different people will have slightly differing values despite having the same religion.<br><br>"rather than congratulating ourselves for having the courage of our convictions, we should instead see if we have the courage for an attack on our convictions. while convictions help define us as a person, convictions are (equally) prisons from which we should seek to break free."<br><br>Somewhat in line with my "thesis" on "definites"(existence of which is questioned), which convictions are discouraged as the only possible to "fix" any "definites", is the existence of prefect knowledge in which was already ruled out with the existence of this post.<br>Hopefully, my "thesis" is not being viewed as a conviction, else both fadingstar and I will seem to be contradicting ourselves.<br>(If that's the case, it will be fadingstar's first flaw in his "thesis")<br><br>But isn't a "thesis" a conviction? Awww.<br><br>fadingstar-Believe you arrived at your current "thesis" after after hitting out your numerous "convictions"(no longer convictions as they no longer exist), but if you're going to hit out at your current conviction again, I don't know what you'll get, but well, this cycle seems to goes down well with my "no definites" theory, but then again if I'm going to attack on that too, what will I end up with? Awww.<br>Interesting. Seems we're travelling in circles. Oops, it's also a conviction that I must attack.<br>So, the question again. Are we looking for an end or an eternity? That's not a conviction 'cos I've not "fixed" an answer to it. Wait, that's a conviction 'cos I've narrowed it down to two possibilities.<br>Hmmm, so what are we searching for? (This statement is a conviction itself, if you understand what I'm driving at)<br><br>fadingstar-Comments?<br><br>"to say, "do it if it doesn't go against your conscience", is really in effect to say, as dostoevsky did, "if god is dead, then everything is allowed"."<br><br>Was thinking in abstract levels that the "conscience" thing is in fact the "natural human reaction".<br>Meaning at any point of time, the action that one does, he/she feels it's the best possible course to take. Perhaps, a second after they perform the deed, they would have regretted it, but at the point where the event took place, they did felt it was the best thing they could do.<br>Sometimes, people do things that they know consciously it's wrong, but their sub-conscience state tells that that it's the best possible route out at the point of time, and hence the choice of "lesser of the two(or perhaps more) evils" is chosen. Might not seem logical to people around, but to them, it's the most rational.<br>Of course, one can debate whether anyone can be truly rational at all times. But how about this, the irrational thinking that one has at the certain point of time is viewed as rational by the brain(which definitely isn't prefect), and hence the mind considers it rational for the action to go ahead. So it's rational or irrational? You decide.<br><br>"but in thinking like this we are assuming that human nature is essentially good and non-destructive and that we are aware and have good knowledge of what is in the best interests of mankind as a whole."<br><br>I guess this relates a little to my previous point. "Essentially good and non-destructive"<br>is highly debatable.<br>What I believe is our minds will look after our mental needs, and hence if the mind is hungry for "looking after the interests of mankind as a whole", it will try it's best to fulfill it. Of course, this will vary from minds to minds, depending on what sort of values the minds hold.<br>It perhaps doesn't have the ability to know what's best for mankind, but it will perform its best to do what it feels is right for mankind.(In this example, I'm assuming it(the mind in question) holds the value of doing good for others as the best route to put itself at ease.)<br><br>"the edicts behind religion,...are really crystallisations of age-old and unchanging<br>verities abt the nature of the human animal."<br>All these edicts, aren't they from humans too? (Eg, their interpretation from dreams?) Hence, in a certain way, are these human judgements?<br><br>"the edicts of religion forestall the consequences that would befall mankind when certain ways of thinking (the ways of thinking equated with the self-legislation of<br>values) are accepted. and these ways of thinking bring with it chaos and social<br>disintegration."<br>A thinking imposed on another thinking? So what makes either one of them right(or for the matter, the other wrong)?<br>A thinking thinking that if the thinking isn't followed, it will bring with it chaos and social disintegration. Hence using this point to dismiss the new thinking(the ways of thinking equated with the self-legislation of values), it's really a judgement on a judgement. What's "definite"?<br><br>"but why should we have such faith in human judgement when we have, all thru the millennia, repaid that faith so poorly?"<br>Didn't faith come about through human judgement? (if it's judged not to be believable, would anyone put their faith in it?)<br>Hmmm, so are human contradictory?<br><br>"the importance of this code is not that it sets down the specifics of what not to do but rather that it covers the whole range of possible areas where human beings are likely to fark up."<br><br>A judgement passed down from our ancestors? My question here now lies, what makes their judgement superior to ours? As humans, both are as fallible.<br><br>"the bible is after all written over many many years and is the repository of much human wisdom."<br>Yes, agreed. And I believe no wise man ever said that he is definitely right. Their words can be intepreted in my ways, most might seem wise in my ways, but definitely right?<br>Different denominations in christianity is suffice to show that.<br><br>"in other words, it purports to foresee the consequences of what we cannot in our limited wisdom foretell."<br><br>A belief?<br>If human race is equal throughout the ages, then our ancestors' wisdom is as limited as ours.<br><br>"religion purports to foresee the long-term consequences of what we cannot."<br>A belief again?<br>Religious books are written by humans, and none can be absolutely objective in their writtings, and their words are open to multiple intepretations.<br>A religion requires human participation. With erring earthlings, who can be sure of the long-term consequences?<br><br>"becos for them, debate does not foreclose belief."<br>Debatable. Use your conviction theory here. See what's the effects.<br><br>"and that, we are told, is the seed to our own undoing."<br>Is this message passed down from our ancestors?<br>Fatalistic view?<br><br>I acknowledge the value of the moral teachings of religions, and their purpose to protect. In fact, I do appreciate them.<br>My only question is all is about believing, and no questioning is allowed, wouldn't we become fatalists?<br>And as I've mentioned before, are our ancestors as fallible as us?<br>Apply your conviction theory on your thesis again, especially on areas where I highlighted on belief.<br><br>Things to ponder.<br>I think I'm guilty of adding another long post no-so relevant to the topic. Then again, it's not really of no relevance either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forever - I like your style man! My sentiments exactly.<br><br>Ocean - I've taken a look at your comments. Will study them more closely when I have the time. But unfortunately I don't think I'll be able to reply. Work is starting to pile up and once the new year begins I won't even have time to breathe. In fact I prob won't be here much anymore.  Do hope you'll keep posting your insightful comments, if only to enlighten others.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Purr - all in all, I must say that you're almost as stubborn, argumentative and arrogant as I am. But I'm much worse. I insist. How does Mr Purr put up with it? Anyway, do take care of yourself okay? And I hope you'll always be a guiding light to all your little purr juniors. Really don't think parenting is as easy and clear-cut as the text-book cases we've presented here. But all the best anyways. Nothing that a little prayer and good luck can't put straight, rite? Just to end off with a corny joke - I'm sure your kids won't be singaporean. Purr-sian more likely. Haha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Ocean and pacman (where the heck are you pacman?) - guess it's left to the two of you to kill off threads from now on.

Ever since I was growing up, I've always wanted to be a thread killer *wipes tear from eye*.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> but if any more threads die out, blame ocean and pacman okay?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....this topic does prove to be very interesting and I suppose it is on the mind of EVERY virgin - to be or not to be, that is the BIG question!<br><br>I find many of the responses rather conservative - WHERE R ALL the NON-virgins? Just look around you, how many friends around us have done it? It's just that many have done it and deny that they are not virgins for fear that they will be sneered at or gossiped about. Where do the survey results come from? Do you really think they reflect the true statistics? I shoudl think not. WHY?! Cause where are they going to get the survey answers from? I'm not going to tell some stranger that I am not a virgin.<br><br>I used to believe very strongly in keeping my virginity for my life-partner but now, I am rather impartial towards this topic.All that changed eversince I met my current boyfriend (he is not my first bf). I decided to give it to him. Like a true Singaporean, I weighed the pros and cons and it made me wonder if I want to give it up on my wedding night (as a "ritual" even though you are damn tired) or to experience that MOMENT when you love that person so much that you just want to share something wonderful with him.  I chose the latter after much contemplation cause I might never experience something like that ever again (I mean the moment) and you only live once.<br><br>I feel that if one ever decided to lose his/her virginity, they should never ever regret it. I do oppose to teenagers having pre-maritial sex though cause many of them might not have the right perception of love (but then again, who am to say what is right or wrong). Having the idea of giving up your virginity to keep the guy is a wrong perception. Neither is it right to give it to him just because he asked you to and you love him. It should be a very natural thing.<br><br>As a girl, I know that virginity is "precious", especially to a girl but to experience LOVE at it's fullest is also very important to a girl( I think it's due to all those love novels we bury ourselves in haha. I'm glad that at least in this life I got to experience the love that I have been longing for, whether he is the one I'll end up with forever is not important because I know that I had it. And if my future husband were to despise me because of this, I'll know that he is not worthy of my love.<br><br>Reading about guys wanting virgins for their wives or gfs, I find that so shallow. Is love based on whether women are virgins?<br><br>I understand about wanting to keep your virginity for after marriage.  You might call me selfish or silly, but I think I would be davastated to find out that I have been keeping my virginity for my wedding night only to find out that my husband is not one. Good for those who are virgins but even better for those who have experienced love and understand what I am talking about.<br><br>P.S. This is not a note to encourage people to "ley long" their virginity hor...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading so many posts in this newsgroup, I find it very amusing that a lot of gals have declared themselves as non-virgins and a lot of guys would preferred to have virgin wives. It seem to suggest a reversal in ideals and perspectives.<br><br>Let me put my stand clearly, in the first place, sex and love are 2 distinctively different things to me. When I marry the person, I marry the person out of love, not out for lust (sex), hence the issue of virginity becomes irrelevant. The responses coming from the guys who wants to have a virgin wife, seem in my perspective, fail to distinguish these two things. Yet if you look from the other side, seeing from the perspective when there are replies from ladies saying that they have decided to give up the notion of saving virginity for their husbands, it sounds equally funny. My point is that they are just doing it for the moment, and argued on the basis that they do it for their choice. But making that choice itself have nothing to do with any logic, because love itself is a very irrational thing. So, if someone tells me that she had weigh all pros and cons before sleeping with someone, I find it ridiculous. I will choose to accept the reason that the person had decided to make the choice out of her instincts, not by  reason.<br><br>I recall Purr mentioned about finding the One. Somehow, it seems nonsensical to me that what do you mean the one? Does the One really exists? Some people have to go thru many painful relationships to find the answer. Then here is what I want to pose to those who have already lost their virginity, are you really sure that the men they sleep with are really the One? Then if he does not turn out to be the One, wouldn't it be worse for you when you lose him? I said this because I understand how much more women valued relationships than men. (I used to believe in that but it seems to me in personal opinion, it is the reverse that men in the present days value the r/s more than women).<br><br>Maybe I will like to pose a question now to those gals who had lost their virginity. What are the qualities you consider in another man before you are willing to lose that to him? I suppose that I will not be expecting an answer based on reason but one based on just instincts and personal opinion.<br><br>Happy New Millenium (even the Millenium should starts at 2001).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Twinkle :<br>It is not that I do not read the posts thoroughly. I pointed out in my earlier post that love and sex are 2 distinctly different things, and that it should not be mixed together. Hence it follows that men should not use virginity as a criteria for their choice of getting a wife.<br><br>What I have pointed here, is something different. I am trying to argue that when a woman have sex with a man (whether she is a virgin or not), there isn't any logic to start talking about at all. In every case, the woman will sleep with the man based on her choice, not by any pros and cons she weighs, because she has already made the choice in her heart. So, I totally agreed with the non-virgins camp arguments. But I asked in the end that what are the qualities in that man whom they are willing to sacrifice for that man. I am pretty sure that the answer is not that of reason but one that is based on instinct. So far, no one has given me an answer.<br><br>I have read all the posts a few times before putting forward my opinion. Please think about what I say before asking me to read. I have no hard feelings to your comments.</div>

Prodigal, I also think you've answered your own question liao. I thot that becos the girl loves the guy that's why she gives him her virginity. If this is the case, then the qualities she looks in a guy to give her virginity to are the same qualities she wants in a man she loves.<br><br>Anyway, I dun agree that such decisions have no logic. Yup, who you love is illogical but what you choose to do (have sex, buy house to stay together, how to celebrate anniversaries together etc) can be made with lots of logic. Why not? Unlike love, all these are practical things which can be thot out practically. Even if she has 'made the choice in her heart' who she wants to sleep with, she can still decide when to do it what, before or after marriage. Why isn't this considered a logical decision????<br><br>Anyway, I'm not a ger so I dun know how gers think.

            <div class='col-md body'>Say i mean there's a story that i'll like to share with u. B has been involved in an intimate relationship with this lady C for some years, they already were engaged, but he was very annoyed &amp; sad when his girl wrote breaking off their engagemt, &amp; asking for her photograph. He went out &amp; collect from his friends all the UNWANTED photos of women that he could find, bundled them all together and sent them back with a note saying that, "Sorry, can't remember which one is you. Please keep your photo &amp; return the others."--- Can u imagine how the guy feels when he receives this notice from C that she is writing off their engagemt?? R they not meant for each other after some yrs?? Why take so long to discover that they r not really suitable and should sex necessarily be involved?? Think about it. Also, how does the lady feel when she gets his reply, &amp; his request?? He wants the rest of the photos back! It may appeal to ladies that he's just inflating his ego, &amp; he's a sore loser, but still this could be a blow to the lady, whom she thought she has a place in his heart all the while. Stand in their shoes &amp; imagine how they feel. Does it mean that losing one's virginity for the person that u love AT THAT POINT of time is a sufficeint reason?? What about the one that u r going to love tomorrow or in the near future or even for the rest of your life? Certainly, sexual chemistry is NOT the only factor &amp; consideration that determines if a relationship can work out or not, but izit NECESSARY? Then the lady C in the story must have wondered where she stood in the relationship all this while, is  this fair for the lady who has willingly lost her virginity to a guy, whom she USED to love, although she's the one who has decided to dump him for reasons untold? I can understand the suggestions &amp; reasons from both sides of the party, but we are not commenting if its good or bad, right or wrong, but izit necessary?!<br>No matter what, when one loses his/her virginity, things are not going to be the same as it used to, literally, or emotionally. Guys what do u think and feel when u r jilted by a lady whom u've not had sexual relations with? I guess it sux! Then how about guys who have already lost their virginity to that "SPECIAL" someone, only to find that the relationship is going nowhere and she dumps u?! True we gain THE experience. But where izit going to lead us? Izit going to be a guaranteed hands-on experience with other ladies in future relationships? Or izit one of the ways to hold on a relationship, which COULD be not so promising?? Ladies, how do u feel oso when a guy  promises his love for u, only to find that he dumps u the next day after u lost your virginity to him, worth it or not. Can't deny fact that some relationships do improve after sex, but how far can sex go in helping u LAST a relationship? Izit worth it or not? Well, think about it lah, at least even when love dies, the piece of hymen that we've been discussing all this while is not damaged as yet by the male hardness unknowingly, unless u wanna lose it responsibly??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gone off for a few days only to come back and find that this thread is still alive. Incredible.<br><br>Why don't I share a story too? I met the guy I gave my virginity to when I was in university. He was very good to me. Just being around him made my life brighter. Whatever spare time we had, we spent it together. To everybody in our hall, we were one of the most devoted couples around.<br><br>Eventually, we started to talk about sex. He said he would like to do it with me, but if I said no, it wouldn't change our relationship a single bit. I held off for a few weeks to think about it. He didn't pressure me at all. In the end, I decided I would give it to him, even if he didn't turn out to be 'the one'. He had put me above everything else in his life, to the point of neglecting everything else; I wanted to reciprocrate by sharing my life with him as fully as I could. It felt really right to be with him.<br><br>Was it 'necessary'? No, if you talking about 'keeping' the person.<br><br>But it really opened me up. I had an emotionally deprived childhood; we never expressed affection for one another in the family, must lest exchange hugs or kisses. Getting by was the priority because we weren't well off then. Not surprisingly, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions to another person. When I got angry or upset, I could only sputter and stutter. Even when I entered into a relationship with him, I still couldn't express myself properly. Whenever I was angry, I would punish him with silence because I just didn't know what to say. After we've made love, it became much easier for me to share emotionally because we've been so intimate with each other alredi. Sex improved our relationship.<br><br>Unfortunately, communication was still bad. Both from my side and his. We tried too hard to please each other. We never quarelled or voiced out any unhappiness. In the end, everything built up and we couldn't go back and start all over again.<br><br>We were together for more than a year. Even after we've broken up, I still think he's a great guy.<br><br>Of course, I was extremely upset it didn't work out. I felt as if a piece of me had been torn out, never to be replaced again. But it wasn't that stupid stretch of hymen that was torn out, it was my heart. I would be lying if I said I didn't wonder if anyone will still have me after I've given my virginity to him. But I spent a lot more time worrying if I'll ever meet another guy as good as he was.<br><br>I don't regret giving my virginity to him though. I take it as my way of thanking him for loving me so much, for taking care of me, for being there, for encouraging me.... the list goes on. If it hadn't been for him, for all that we've had together, including the sex, I would have still been an emotional cripple. In fact, I wouldn't have known that I was one. In the BGRs I've had before i met him, I would wall myself up and run whenever the guys tried to come too close. He made me take the first step to open up. He didn't manage to get me to open up completely but the experience has helped a heck of a lot in my other relationships. If I've met my current bf then, I would have lost him too.<br><br>I was going to sum up this story with some points but I realised that I was going to repeat myself again. So I won't. Everybody chooses their own paths and it all works out differently. Like everything else, giving away your virginity before marriage is just a matter of thinking about things carefully and deciding whether you can live with the 'consequences'.<br><br></div>

It was there at the moment, but the next second it may just be gone, taken away from us in situations that just render us helpless, sadden with grief.....<br><br>I guess the only thing that leaves behind in our minds are the beautiful memories that linger, and the terrible memories that haunt us, even when we try to put it behind. Gd or bad, we learn a lesson, &amp; we all learn our lessons well.</div>
