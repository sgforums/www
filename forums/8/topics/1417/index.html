Most guys i know wants their wife to be a virgin, but they themselve cant keep the promise to themselve too. Isnt it unfair? If man goes around "devirginise" himself, its considered ok. But when girls go around doing the same thing, they r called CHEAP. Double standards here?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Double standards? I guess so. But I dun know if guys still think that girls, who had premarital sex or several partners, are cheap. Or is there some kind of liberalisation in thinking already?<br><br>Probably there is a thinking that guys are supposed to be masculine, superior and all that. If they are supposed to be superior, then needless to say, it would be assumed that it's ok for them to sleep around in the name of gaining experience for their innocent wife. Girls supposedly have guys to guide them so they are not supposed to sleep around. Probably that's why some guys want their wives to be virgins but they themselves need not be??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking, I do see a change in attitudes nowadays, and a change in the ways we see things. You can call me old fashioned or whatever, but I do believe there are compelling reasons not to engage in sex before marriage.<br><br>Sex is not just some physical act to get done and over with. Especially, as someone has mentioned, you do it with somebody you love. There is a bond and attachment within that act that implies love and trust.<br><br>Now, within marriage, this love and trust thing has been declared with something more tangible than mere words (albeit the tangible thing is a piece of paper and the law). Without marriage, the words 'I love you' do not stand out as strongly.<br><br>Granted you are very much in love - what then if there is a breakup? We cannot even say there will be no divorce, what more a breakup - without a paper, and without the law backing up? I believe the strong attachment in sex will hamper your future relationships. Ask anyone who had premarital sex - like it or not, what happened in the past will haunt.<br><br>It is our own decision to make, whether to have sex with that person we love before marriage. But ultimately, we must live with the decision we make. And I say it is best to make a wiser decision.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;I mean, u do it in the name of love, but &gt;will your future spouse understand your &gt;verison of love?<br><br>You dun need to have sex with someone to show you are in love with him. Your bf will also be jealous of guys you've never slept with before just as long as he thinks you've loved them.<br><br>FYI, I would prefer my boyfriend not to be a virgin. I want him to have a broader experience of life before he settles down with me, so he won't hanker after something he's never had and leave me for it. Also, he'll be more experienced in bed- a definite plus    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But I won't want to know who he's done it with or how many. If it's only been one other woman, I'll wonder if she means more than I do. If it's with two or more women, I'll wonder if sex means nothing to him. You don't win, my dears. So no point knowing.<br><br>And there is no point letting this knowledge haunt you. What is most important now is that your partner loves you most. Look at it from the other way- no point having her body but not her heart.<br><br>If my partner condemns me as cheap, I will leave him RIGHT AWAY. In a relationship, you have to respect each other or there is no basis for it to go on.<br><br>I'm also looking for somebody with a similar mind, somebody who's not conservative or close minded. If he is, I wouldn't have been attracted to him in the first place. And if I were stupid to fall in love with him, I think I would be wise enuff to get out of the relationship quickly. The difference in mindsets will cause a lot of unrepairable cracks in the relationship eventually.<br><br>And let's face it- a person is the sum of her experineces. You cannot love some parts of her and reject others. It all comes in a package. If let's say you have also done something wrong before you met your partner, which you are bound to have, like maybe break another girl's heart, is she supposed to hold it against you too? No, because she is looking at the person you have become, the wiser you who has learnt from his experiences, not all the mistakes you have committed. A person is really greater than the sum of his parts.<br><br>So have I ever regreted? Frankly, the answer is no. I don't believe that my body is the ultimate gift for my partner. I think prizing virginity is a stupid notion of possession- I have her viginity, therefore she belongs to me. And if you place all your hopes and dreams in the person you give your virginity to, there is a higher likelihood that you end up being disappointed. Why? Becos you see it as the ultimate gift, when it is actually not. There are other things that matter more.<br>Perhaps, my strongest argument is that I see my body not as a scared temple but something more organic- something I use to give and receive pleasure with a loved one. It's just a tool, a function of love. It does not represent love itself. That said, I dun have sex with people I have no feelings for.<br><br>And I would not have taken back all my sexual experiences in the world because it has colored my mind 'like wine through water'. I may have regreted doing it with one or two guys, but my mistakes have also taught me lessons on life. And these experinences have shaped my way of looking at the world, the person I am. They are invaluable as far as I am concerned.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 23-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am shocked over wat Purr had said. She doesnt mind her future husband being as a non virgin, becos of better "bed" skills? Does that means it is a go ahead and have sex around so u will be good in bed?<br>Lots of people r talking about love in here, does being really in love permits u to lose your virginity, which is the only true gift u can give to your husband, as a statement of love? If u love that person alot, u should remain faithful.<br>Call me conservative if u want, but i felt that people who r not virgin before marriage r considered "loose".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.....if my gf tells me that she is not a virgin....well i have juz have to accept it as a fact...who ask me to love her.... virginity.....is not a muz coz sometimes its uncontrollable to lose it in certain unforseen circumstances... plus its stupid to leave her coz she is not a virgin.<br><br>As for me.... i dun dare to go round looking for experience coz... haha firstly sort of underage.... but then......isn't it funny and awkward when 2 virgins get married and do not know what to do on their wedding nite?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh, Ah Nic, you've totally misunderstood me. My main point is- I want him to have a broad experience of life, even if it comes to sex, before he settles down with me. The SIDE BENEFIT is that he is good in bed.<br><br>&gt;Lots of people r talking about love in here, &gt;does being really in love permits u to lose<br>&gt;your virginity, which is the only true gift &gt;u can give to your husband, as a statement &gt;of love? If u love that person alot, u &gt;should remain faithful.<br><br>I find the idea of 'one true gift.... as a statement of love' very amusing. There are many other gifts of love that are more important. You could give the guy your body, but you can deny him love, trust, respect and a multitude of other things at the same time. Virginity means absolutely bullshit if you don't have the rest. I dun want a man to give me his 'first time' only to run when the going gets rough. If you really want to make a statement of your love, there are greater ways to show it rather than sex, a basal human instinct. And frankly, things like trust are much harder to give than your virginity.<br><br>And I dun understand the part about 'If u love that person alot, u should remain faithful'. How could I be faithful to someone I have not even met when I lost my virginity? And how could I be considered unfaithful my bf if he is the only person I'm seeing at the time?<br><br>You're confusing virginity with ownership. I've been unfaithful, that is betrayed him, by denying him what he rightfully owns (my body)- isn't this what you mean? I've alredi stated my stance about ownership; go read it if you haven't.<br><br>Actually, I'm all prepared for such response. It's okay if you don't agree and insist on branding people like me 'loose'. But please examine the concept of 'loose' before you go on. Doesn't it have something to do with ownership which you break away from?<br><br>I would also like to question why losing your virginity is immoral. Yes, it's impratical but it's not immoral. I'll like to hear why you think it is so.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 23-12-1999).]</div>
