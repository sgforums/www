I am insulting your rigidity and unwillingness to go deeper.<br><br>As I've said, "It alright to hold your religious beliefs close to yourself." I have NEVER said your religion is wrong.<br><br>As I've pointed out, religion is subject to interpretation by priests and Saints (St. Peter), which are fallible. We shouldn't follow everything blindly. You can still be a good Christian even if you dun believe St. Peter's crap. But you seem to have the attitude that if it's in the bible, it MUST be correct. I sincerely hope that not many Christians are like you. You just seem to exemplify the worst qualities of one.<br><br>BTW, I've never said or hinted that I'm liberal.  You INTERPRETED it.

            <div class='col-md body'>purr - i had read most of the postings. but i didn't rem them. and at close to 4am in the morning, didn't feel like re-reading them. the main point i was trying to get across was what ppl learn from sex before marriage. and i think firewire gave some insightful comments. if other ppl have more comments i'd love to hear them. for those who already gave their views, then don't bother further. just wanted to phrase the issue more pointedly to see what ppl have learned from their experiences. and not get caught up too much abt whether it is right or wrong.<br><br>this topic must be pretty personal to you, purr. i re-read my thread and thot i phrased it rather neutrally. no meh? was this directed at me? : "And nobody owes anyone any explaination. I hope that in the future, should anyone ask others to share their experiences, he/she would so so with politeness, not sarcasm or condescension."<br>gee....if it was i wasn't intending to be. was i? i'm usu terribly mindful of such things.<br><br>and this: "No matter what you decide or value, I feel that you should have given some thought to it first." do you mean "you should give some thot to it first?" cos in the context of your generally negative comments abt my post, they mean different things. if the original statement is what you mean, then it's precisely because i can't figure it out too much that i'm asking for opinions from everyone. i'm personally quite okay either way.<br><br>and this: "it doesn't mean that non virgins sleep around for the thrill or conquest. There are those who do it with love and committment."<br><br>noted. and agreed. but i don't think i gave any indication to the contrary. hmmmm, so much offense taken over the word "wild". as you know, "wild thing" is a word used to describe the act. not the ppl who do it. maybe i should stick to the word "sex" next time. didn't know so much could be read into the word "wild". certainly wasn't implying anything bad. i would use the term "wild thing" even for married ppl doing it for the first time.<br><br>you also wrote: I'll also like to know how you can be certain that you've found the one you've been saving your virginity for, the one true love. It's difficult, almost impossible to know, unless you look back in time when you're nearing the end of your life. Even marriage is no guarantee; some marriages are really mistakes that shouldn't have taken place. And is there really such a thing as one true love? If there is, does that mean the ideal thing to do is to either (1) marry your first gf/bf (2) or denounce your exes as people you've never had feelings for?"<br><br>again agreed. did i suggest anything to the contrary? if i did i must knock myself on the head for being so careless.<br><br>i've noted your points and your position and would really like to hear more views from other ppl. just very bewildered that you seem to have imputed an intent to insult on my part when there was none. or am i reading too much into your post?<br><br>the only part i find that could have been offensive is the last line: so pray tell me (quite specifically) which part of your character is improved if ur more sexually experienced?<br><br>and this was written when my face was scrubbing the keyboard already. so let me re-phrase that: how do you think keeping yourself or not keeping yourself until after marriage can make you a fuller person? would that be neutral enough? and if these points have already been raised then read those posts again with this question in mind and i think we'll gain some new insights. again, i'm open to more comments from others.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ah...I guess I have to write in again...<br><br>yeah, I dun think that anyone is saying that religion is in itself bad...aiyah...purr said it alreasdy so I won't repeat her...<br><br>As said in earlier postings, what happens after you marry and give away your virginity, but find out that this guy is the devil incarnate...beats you, whips you, kicks ur ass everyday, insults you verbally and physically, baiscally a ***** tyrant...????  What happens then...Do woimen stay in these marriages????  I think not.  We are not put on this Earth to suffer as many would like tot hink...we have control over what happens in our life...if we choose to let bad thingshappen to us then it's our fault and noone elses......<br><br>In saying that, if the woman divorces this guy, and falls in love later with another guy,....what then...she has no more gift to give him....(this is seeing it in the eyes of virginity as a gift)...and she realises and the guy relaises that they were meant together and treat each other with love and respect...what happens then to the girl?<br><br>But it's a good thing, i guess, that most people know beforehand if their partners are super conservative or super liberal.  Most times you can tell and usually most don't get themselves caught in these relationships where it is obvious that their beliefs will clash....but then again, some people are damn decpetive....especially guys...I have experienced second hand(from my gal friends experiences) info about guys that they go steady with who at first seem to be quite easy going and relaxed and quite open, but as relationship got further on, the guy started to show his true colors....he started to show the real side of himself....that he was conservative...that his GF must never do this and never do that and nver go here or there and she must always be home at this time and her call must always be made during which hour....It's scary to hear people tell me these things because when they do tell me they tell me with fear and regret.....long run-on sentence there..hahah<br><br>Purr, I think that you have said it more elegantly than I did about some things you had gained...<br><br>It has definitely allowed me insight and understanding into relationships and I can safely and hoestly say that I can handle bad relationships better than a lot of people.  I rememebr when I was still a virgin(I was a late bloomer...lost it at 19 I think...), whenever a relationship didn't work out, I would feel so uncontrollably jealous and angry when I thought of my GF leaving me and giving herself to another guy and not me...Why didn't she love me?..blah blah blah...<br><br>Anyway, suffice to say that I did gain immensely from these realtionships where sex was involved...and ask my Ex GF and they will tell you the exact same thing....They never regretted it and in fact has made them more mature emotionally...not everyone will be but these cases were...They used to be very, how to say, inexperienced and shy and scared of everything....unsure of things even, but after experiencing sex(of course, crudely put), they started to change and started to see the world from a different view...you could start to see that they started seeing things differently...and they weren't as afraid or restricted as they were before, of life and things in general.  It was almost a liberating experience for them...and just to clear it up, I didn't force them...in fact, they jumped me ok...I'm a bit too shy to make a girl sleep with me, I could ask for it, but I could never bring myself to make the moves...hahaha...:-)<br><br>I know for a fact that they were were very ba dcommunicators before, but as we got intimate, they started to become more vocal and more willing to share their feelings and emotions with me...It did bring us closer...<br><br>And I don't really see why a person has to be the "ONE" to have sex with them...Like Purr has said, how do we know for sure they are the one....If you love someone you love them...it just never occurs to you that you should marry them...I think it comes in much later in the relationship... and sexual intimacy is a natural result of this love.  Most people who have had sex feel that they are doing the right thing according to how they feel for that person...or else why do it in the first place...of course there are some that do do it for the experience as just a physical thing, but I think they are not in the majority.<br><br>Mind, my point about virginity is that if you yourself are a virgin, then you can ask that your wife be a virgin or else if you aren't then it makes you the worst kind of hypocrite....don't ask of people things that you yourself cannot give...<br><br>that was my point also.<br><br>I don't know about everyone else, but it has always been a natural progression in my relationships...I never just sat down and stated," I think we should have sex now!"....It was always a natural thing and I never felt that it was forced on my part or the girls part.<br><br>WEll, it is very personal whether you sva eit or not, but you have to ask yourself whether you are asking girls to save their virginity because of your own concepts or because someone else  taught you it should be this way.....Big difference....If someone taught you that you shouldn't lose your virginity, then how do you know he is right and how do you know that it is the right teaching for you escpecially if you are stuck in one frame of mind....<br><br>For my case, I always , from circumstance and a bit of luck, could make decisions based on a wider perspective than some people have.  By first seeing a larger picture as well as having different perspective viepoints to make my decisions from, it has allowed me to make decsions based more on MY own beliefs and not based on someone elses belief values...I'm lucky in this respect, but a lot of people don't have this liberty.....<br><br>hey, now women can get their hymen recreated and become virgins again...I'm sure it will satiate a lot of guys egos and/or requirements in the woman he wants....In this day and in the very near future age, how will you ever know if your wife is truly a virgin???  This will blow away your minds with this element entering the equation...<br><br>So If you met a girl who somehow seemed to still have her hymen, and she told you that she never had sex(but she did and you didn't know), then does that make the moment special for you (the guys)?  Is it still a gift if you never knew that she had reconstructive surgery?  In the end, what's the difference?...Isn't her love, respect, understanding, and mind so much more important than virginity...?...When you consider all of thses other points in your future wife, I think that virginity would hit the bottom of your list...if it isn't then I pity the wife because of the reasons you married her....<br><br>Like I said, if it was like this, then women can only give of themselves once and then after if things don't work out, she is pretty much worthless to anyone else...<br><br>Anyway, I'm glad that there are people who don't care about it as much...<br><br>and uh...A lot of christians I know have had sex before and they don't feel that it's evil or bad in anyway...for them they told me that if you feel that it's right then it's right...It's when you do something against your own feelings that you betray yourself and start to enter the realm of the "wrong"....<br><br>Anyway we need both types of people in the world or else it will just turn out into one big gangbang earth party or turn into one big fundamentalist Earth state.....Both of which is very unpalatable....yucks!!!!  hmm the gangbang sounds good tho...hahaha:-)<br><br>I think that a lot of my problems with conservatism is their reasoning....It's ususally not based on anything that they themselves beleieve in but what others say....of course not all but I think most...Conservatives tend to be those who believe in the words of others if it is based on past values....almost like a group mentality and their answers are almost always the same...like they all learned from the same guy.....If you ask the more liberal about things, they tend to have more individual reasons for doing things...<br><br>Altho there are things to be respected in both conservative views and liberal views, we have to rememebr to keep our own minds and not to make decisisons that someone else would make, but by our own choices that we ourselves analysed.<br><br>Sorry, I might sound anti-conservative, but I'm not...only on this issue...and it's not really anti-conservative, but more of a problem with reasoning...but then again, I got a pretty screw-ball reasoning ability myself so who's to say right?..hahaha:-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>purr - i think that communication on the irc/icq/forum/email is always fraught with misunderstandings cos you can't always gauge the other person's tone. and it gets tiresome to phrase what you mean in a neutral or inoffensive way all the time. just say whatever you mean, right? but the ppl here in the forum have their own distinctive personalities. so you can generally tell what they are usu like. just so you know, i believe that in all my postings, if i were to give indirect inferences abt something, it's always accompanied by the person's nick in the front (which if you think abt it, doesn't make it indirect anymore).<br><br>well, happy posting anyways.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well firewire, i dunno whether this is true or not, but u seems to think that guys who want their gf/wife to be virgin is bcos of the ego and wanting to break the hymen. But this may not be true. For me, yah i want my gf/wife to be virgin, yah i will keep mine for her( i hope i dun fall into temptation). But its not bcos of the hymen thing. I think i will mind if she gave it to someone else before me but i dun mind if she lost it thru rape (hope this don't happen). Its more on the emotion side. Somehow i get the idea that u are trying to portray guys who want virgins as some egomaniac who wants to satisfy himself for breaking the hymen. This is really a sweeping statement and at the same time highly untrue. Yah there are guys like that but there are guys who want virginity for other reasons. Anyway i dun considered a woman who had a reconstructed hymen a virgin. Being a virgin is more than having a hymen, its really shallow to judge on virginity using hymen alone. No offence meant again.<br><br>I'm not against those non-virgins, if they want to do it, its ok. But for this kind of things, it involves 2 person. Even if u dun mind, what abt the other. It is again a sweeping statement to say cos of ur ex dun mind, that all the girls dun mind. There are girls who mind and there are those who dun mind. There are girls who did it with their bfs cos they think hes the one and what if they are under pressure and isn't thinking straight.( ppl make wrong choices when under pressure and they tend to regret it) So the best way, keep it for ur husband or wife.<br><br>If i were to have sex with my gf and we broke off and if she is to find a guy who believe in virginity or if she regrets it, i will feel very bad. I still remember the topic on annabel chong who gave up on herself cos she isn't a virgin. Frankly speaking, i feel that she still values virginity or at least she will mind doing such cheap stuff.( I dunno her, so again this is juz my assumption) What i'm trying to say is ( i said that in my previous post) the girl dun mind now cos she isn't a virgin anymore not bcos she dun believe in it. Not all girls are like this, but there are some who think in this way. In this case, i think the guy is doing her a great disservice cos deep in her heart, she wants her virginity back.<br><br>Are u trying to say, having sex will help to improve ur communications skills? It dun. Have it ever consider to u guys that the girl did it with u cos she feel that u 2 have reach that stage. U 2 become closer not bcos of sex but becos u 2 have reach the lvl of intimacy where very personal stuff can be shared. And sex is not required to reach this stage.<br><br>Marriage certificate...... Some ppl might think that u can have sex cos u have that piece of paper. But in my opinion this is a wrong way of thinking. I still believe in marriage. What i think marriage certificate is that it is juz a by product which signifies that a couple is ready to step into<br>a married world. They are ready, therefore they do it. But for the normal bgr, the couples juz isn't ready yet.<br><br>Getting a bit too long, continue later hehehe<br>Sometimes i really wonder whether i wrote this much cos i believe in it or juz for the sake of arguing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Mind<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow.. a very hot topic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>hihi,<br><br>hmm.. I may not be an experienced person to comment on this issue, but just to voice out something from my mind, I do value virginity. But i don't interpret it as "ownership sign".. well.. since if your gf/bf decides to give you her/his virginity, I guess if I am the one to accept it, I will be more than happy, as she has trusted me to be her first partner in sex. (for mer trust is one of the important issues inside a relationship beside love and affection)<br><br>If she is not a virgin, well, I don't say that I will mind her or something, and what I can think of is just ignore the past of hers. Not everyone has a smooth and happy past, and since if she is not a virgin anymore due to her previous relationship or any incidents, why should I bother so much about it? The most important thing is, to cherish her as much as I can.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>So, the point that I want to make is.. virginity is something, but not something that is VERY important. The most important thing is trust, love, loyalty, and care.<br><br>^^<br><br>-Rain of the day-<br>(maybe my idea may not be correct, but at least that is what I have trusted in so far.)<br><br>------------------<br>"When you looked into my eyes, and you said goodbye, could you see my tears?

            <div class='col-md body'>purr you 22 only and can share so much! Hats off to you.<br><br>After reading MOST of the acticles posted,I would just like to say one thing.<br>Virginity is a very private thing so to be a virgin or not depends very much on individual.If you don't do it just because "everyone" is doing it then I don't see anything wrong with it.<br>If you give away your vriginity in exchange for $$ or whatever then thats another story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems that there's a boxing match going on on boxing day. (Gosh, boxing day isn't meant to be a day to throw punches around, unless your present is a sand bag.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>Okay, finally I made my entrance into this topic. (Was holding back my troops and horses for quite some time)<br><br>This topic has got much to do with personal values, hence it's also a case of no definite rights or definite wrongs. (Seems that theory has multiple uses, can be applied in general)<br><br>As I mentioned before(in another thread that is), everything has got to do with your own conscience. If you feel it's right, and you will not regret it, it's okay to go ahead with it.<br><br>But that's only on your own personal belief; you can't impose your beliefs on others. What I'm trying to drive across is that although you might these certain values in you, you can't enforce it on the partner/spouse. You might want to hope, but please do not expect. Seems that you're attaching strings to your "love". But then, it might be hard for people who don't really share the same beliefs or interest to get along well together. However, this is not a rule; love is strange.<br><br>I guess I would have to speak up for a few people who contributed to this thread.<br>Firstly, I must say that Mind has brought discussions to a higher ground when he raised the point on guys keeping their virginity as they do not hope to hurt the girls should they not be the right one for them.<br><br>purr-Yes, you're right in saying that the girls are responsible for their own actions and even if they regret, they should not blame anyone for their actions. But Mind's concern is that the guys can prevent such regret by rejecting it in the first place. It takes two hands to clap; the guys do have a responsibility too. The girls might not blame them, but what about the guys themselves? Some might. It's a conscience thing. Can you blame them for being sensitive over such issues? If you do, I guess it's going to be a case of insensitivity on your part.<br>On the part about gaining experience from sharing physical intimacy; I believe there's experience to be gained from every encounter. But is it an experience you enjoyed and wouldn't regret for life, or is it a painful experience that you regretted so much that you wished you could turn back time?<br>purr, I think it's not fair for you to say that Mind's is looking only from his perspective, 'cos I think you've not really examined his perspective.<br>Okay, I'll draw an illustration here.<br>For example, a guy who truly loves his girlfriend has to break up with his girlfriend because he knows his girlfriend has met the right one and he knows that the two of them are prefect and it's better that he leaves the triangle.(nobody wins in an triangle) The girl values her virginity a lot(her own personal values), and when she gave up hers to her first boyfriend, she was not really matured enough to realised that although the guy loves her deeply, they're not meant to be. She might not have regretted going out with the guy, but she would have regretted doing it with someone that she's unable to stay together for life.(I'm sure that some people just want a single partner for life; personal values i'm highlighting again)<br>Now she regrets it, but she wouldn't blame the guy. But the guy can feel her pain, and although no one is pointing fingers at him, there's self-reproach in him. He regrets that he didn't stop the "tragedy" from happening. The words "What if, what could have been" would be popping up on his mind continuously. It doesn't matter if the whole world tells him that it isn't his fault, he's not to blame, etc. The point is, his conscience says he's wrong and that's enough. Given a choice, he would turn back time too.<br>I believe that this is the reason why Mind wishes to commit himself only after he got married. Marriage is afterall an even more major decision than agreeing to become steads. I do agree that no one can promise that any marriage can be everlasting, but it has it's significance in our lives.(How much depends on your personal values once again)<br>Here's another example of the need of two hands to clap. I would believe that if it's true love, he/she would not marry someone that is unsure about herself/himself. He/she would not want the other party to regret for life.<br>I don't wish to try and define true love as true love is something that no words are adequate to express it fully. To try and pen it down and proclaim that the crap that is written down is "true love" is a complete insult to true love.<br>(I did tried to define it and i realised i couldn't; I'm nowhere near the true meaning) What I can be sure about true love is that you've learnt to be selfless, and the well-being of the other is being placed above yourself. His/her self-interest will come before yours. Sometimes, we can't help but worry. If we had prefect knowledge of everything, life would have been much easier, but then again, if that's the case, this board wouldn't have existed in the first place.<br>Perhaps true love is almost impossible to achieve(how many can give up their personal self-interest); perhaps many have tried and has given up hope. But for those who are still trying and keeping faith in their beliefs, we should not discourage. Theirs might be a tough act to follow, but they might just be the ones who will rekindle our hopes. If we can't appreciate, it's okay. But do not condemn.<br>To borrow a quote from my friend: "It is better to not hold any hands than to hold many hands and not find the hand you wanted to hold forever."<br><br>I must speak up a little for fadingstar here. He's posts are by far, arguably the most objective in this forum, and after reading many of his posts, I believe he's not one who would launch personal attacks. In fact, I noted that he seldom posts too much of his personal opinions/beliefs lest he might sound subjective in his argument. I've read that "post in question" of his again, and altough i roughly guessed his personal stand on this issue, he has tried his best to make it sound objective.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purr: "Breaking up doesn't necessarily mean there was no commitment. Sometimes, it may just be wiser to split or you'll end up killing each other over your differences"<br><br>If i were to say that ppl esp the girls do it cos they believe they will end up with each other, am i rite? Maybe some ppl dun think its correct, but some ppl do it because of this mentality. To them, its like doing something in advance, but what many of the ppl of such thinking failed to realise that the guy/girl may not be the person who will be walking down the aisle. Then the rationale of doing it is no longer there and some girls will regret it. Even if the girl dun regret now doesn't mean she will not regret in the later part of her life. According to a survey, abt 50%( thats a very high figure) of Singaporeans want their spouse to be virgins, so its highly possible the girl will meet a guy who believe in virginity.<br><br>"Mind, it's nice of you to worry about the girls who've lost their virginity to their bfs. But it's really their choices to make (unless of course, they've been raped). If they decide on their course of life, then they, and nobody else, is responsible for the consequences. If they haven't thought clearly about the issue first, it's wrong of them to blame you or anyone else."<br><br>Yah they can't blame anyone( maybe with the exception of the guy in qn), but its always heartbreaking to see ppl in the state of regret, pain....... So do it after marriage.<br><br>Why do ppl break up? Lack of understanding? The person is not what u have expected? All this boils down to the fact that the couple are not ready for sex even though they think they are. Virginity is something which is lost will be forever gone, no matter how hard u try. Well purr, like i said, its really up to the individual and his/her mindset. Maybe its ok for u, but there are many girls out there who dunno what they are doing and the impt thing is that they mind. So the safest way, do it after marriage. True, marriage is no guarantee but it definitly has a higher success rate then the other type of institutions.<br><br>Being non-virgin helps u to get over heartaches that came with the breaking of a relationship? ( esp if u are the one being dumped) Sounds quite illogical, and i dun believe it either. Overcoming rejection, i think, comes with age and experience( not sexual experience).<br><br>On seeing virginity as the greatest gift one can give to his/her wife/husband. It can mean a lot. It can really strengthen the bond, trust in a relationship. It seems that most of the supporters of non-virgins somehow think that virginity= ownership. Yah, i want my gf/wife to be a virgin, but i dun see it as ownership. I see it as a gesture of trust which can really help a relationship to work out. Maybe some of those ppl who want virgins see it as ownership, but not all think it taht way, so " virginity= ownership" is again a sweeping and inaccurate statement.<br><br>Well purr, i dun really agree with ur perspective but again, like i said before, its up to the individual. In this kind of things there are no distinct right or wrong, but one thing i must say, u really know how to argue.... u studying law?<br><br>Mind<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh my...so many postings for this topic....and I seem to be guilty of adding to it....:-)<br><br>Purr and Star...calm down guyshhh (spoken with a lisp similar to the fart guy in Mystery Men...haahh)....:-)<br><br>Anyway to Mind and everyone else....My point is that it shouldn't be held as the absolute truth for girls to be virgins in a marriage because there are things more infinitely important than virginity....<br><br>Like I said, If the guy is a virgin, then in all honetsy noone will ever tell you that you are bad for wanting a virgin....and I do believe that a lot of guys want virgins for the ego thing....simply speaking most people(guys)make decisions based on their egos a lot of times...especially when it comes to relationships...but of course not everyone thinks like this...!!!!!:-)<br><br>I do question though, what the reasons are that guys want virgins because most girls don't ask of this from guys...again, maybe something that has been accepted and passed down from previous times....<br><br>Granted that there are many people who do it and regret it, I think that many more don't regret it.  Maybe it's me, but I have a hard time accepting that something I sacrificed for another person should be a point of regret...especailly if I gave that thing up for them because I loved them. but that's just me...maybe a bit too idealistic to belive this...but?...what do others think about his reasoning?.....<br><br>...and the question still really hasn't been settled about what happens if the girl gets married and gives it up to her husband but it end in divorce....OK if people get married you can't expect them not to have sex.  It usually come hand in hand...If it is so important, then what happens when she meets someone else that loves her???? does it make her worthless now?<br><br>and my relationshisp were a natural progression that led to sex not the other way around...:-)<br><br>I still don't and never will believe that people should live their lives filled with regret....the past is the past...don't ever live your life as one big regretful incident....quite sad....<br><br>Please...according to the virginity thinking, it leaves women in a very very bad position if they came from a failed marriage...can someone clear my mind on this matter....<br><br>And as for rape cases, a lot of people won't tell their future spouse about it...It's a very painful thing....If you met the girl that you want to marry and she wants to marry you, but you ask that she be a virgin but she was previously raped...how?...Are you really naive enuff to believe that tehy would come out straight away and tell you they were raped previously?...and wouldn't your asking her to be a virgin further make her feel even worse for having been raped?...It's a very hard thing to admit that you were raped...just look at all those studies...and a lot of cases aren't even reported to anyone at all because of shame...especially among the asian community where conservatism demands that women be pure...would the girl readily give up that information to someone even if she was going to marry them?...It is too naive to think that it is just so easy to knowif someone was raped or not.  I have a friend who I am very close to...so close that she knows that I am probably the only person who she can really trust when all others have ditched her...I have a feeling that she was previously raped before from suggestions and hints and things that i notice in her character and personality...but she as never said anything about it...and I would never ask her because it 's just not something you go and ask people.....You don't go and ask people directly whether they ahve been raped before....for sure you would get a tight slap...<br><br>Anyway, noone will say until they know that the knowledge of the rape won't have any impact on the relationship...and knowing that the guy wants a virgin will surely make her guard that info even more tightly...Believe me you will make her feel even more filthy for asking her to be a virgin...she will feel even more violated and dirty for not being pure for you....so how would you feel?...and how would she feel?...and there are lots more problems that can be raised about this....Suffice to say that it isn't so simple as saying that you wouldn't mind if she was raped...It's more complicated than that....especially for her.<br><br>anyway, it's just a thought that you might want to consider...<br><br>one more thing...what about reconstructive hymen surgery?...How would you know?  If she was still a "virgin" how would you know if she wasn't just lying to you...maybe she really wants to marry you because she loves you so much but she knows how hard up you are for a girl to be a virgin....if she was desperate enuff why wouldn't she go to such an extent...then how?...hypothetically, what do you'all think about that....and it ties in with the broken marriage thing too...how would you know and would it really matter all that much....<br><br>I still can't get over it as being a form of trust to the guy she is going to marry....What happens after when it doens't work out?...please please please answer me...enlighten me....does that mean that she has no more trust to give to the next husband?....how?  and wouldn't you feel even worse to turn dsomeone down because she lost her virginity to her previous husband?.....<br><br>Please enlighten...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm marriage...... well i'm one who believe in marriage, ppl shouldn't jump into marriage<br>unless they are really ready. Marriage is something which i think should last for a lifetime, so divorce shouldn't come into play. But again this is a bit too idealistic,<br>some marriage do end up in divorce, but much much more are successful. Why do ppl divorce?<br>Its more or less the same as why do not married couples break up. Ppl dunno what they are doing for most of the time. Ocean has clearly explained this in the above post.<br><br>Yah ppl do regret, and its quite often too. So my policy is dun do things u regret it. U never know what is going to happen in the future. So do it after marriage. Yah i agree, its very hard for a girl to admit they have been raped or not. Although, i'm not a girl, but i know that its a trauma( something so terrible that no words can describe it), thats why i hate rapist and molesters ......<br><br>Yah thats why i said in the other topic that during massive celebrations, there should be adequate security and protections so that girls will be safe.<br><br>Mind</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firewire:<br>Okay, I guess I'll have to explain further.<br>Taken from my previous posting,<br>"What I'm trying to drive across is that although you might these certain values in you, you can't enforce it on the partner/spouse. You might want to hope, but please do not expect. Seems that you're attaching strings to your "love"."<br>Certain values in this case with reference to the topic is "To be or not to be a VIRGIN."<br>What I'm trying to say is that even if you believe in "saving" your virginity for marriage, it's wrong to expect the same for your partner. Hence I added that this is "attaching strings to your "love"." You might want to hope for it, but do not expect it. In fact, if you're really referring to true love, the word "hope" wouldn't even exist. You love the person for what the person is; you don't reconstruct him/her into what you want him/her to be.<br>To attach a price tag to a relationship destroys the relationship. A relationship is not a contract. The worth of someone, if it's measured by whether he/she was once married, was a virgin or not a virgin, would make the person sound like a product on display, trying to entice shoppers into buying it. Love is intangible. You don't see it with your eyes; you feel it with your heart.<br><br>"I still don't and never will believe that people should live their lives filled with regret....the past is the past...don't ever live your life as one big regretful incident....quite sad...."<br>Some will regret, some wouldn't. What I've highlighted earlier is on the point "if she'll regret, is there anything that we can do to ensure that the incident didn't take place at all for the room to regret?" If there is, should we take that option?<br><br>"Please...according to the virginity thinking, it leaves women in a very very bad position if they came from a failed marriage...can someone clear my mind on this matter...."<br>As I mentioned earlier, it depends on how strong your love is actually. If it's true enough, the background doesn't matter. If your love isn't strong enough and those "points" keep lingering in your mind, then I must say that it's not called love. If that's the case, please do not hurt that person again. She deserves someone else better.<br>The same applies for someone who has the tragic experience of being raped. Please don't hurt the person again.<br><br>As for your reconstructive hymen surgery, I would think that this idea will arise when there's no faith in the relationship. As I mentioned earlier, if it's the guy's expectation, then it's not love. If it's the girl's fears, she doesn't have enough trust into the relationship. Both will cause the failure of the relationship as the basic fundamental for any relationship to work, faith, is missing.<br><br>"I still can't get over it as being a form of trust to the guy she is going to marry."<br>She can view that way, if she values it.<br>Marriage failures can be due to a wide range of reasons, I'm not going to go into that. As marriage involves both parties, both have a part to play for it's downfall. Again, I'm going to details of who is the one that's playing the major role. My point is if we can avoid the "tragedy" from taking place(marriage in this context), should we do it? Sometimes, people rush too much into things, doing acts in a moment of folly, lacking in foresight for the future, lack of consideration for others.<br>Sometimes, you would wonder if this is fated. Are some just meant to be hurt?<br><br>I know that some play the game of manipulation in the name of "love". There are people out there who misuse the word to satisfy their own needs. Hence is it that for those who don't do such manipulation acts but condemned those who are being "played" as silly, honourable? Or do they belong to the same species afterall?<br><br>"does that mean that she has no more trust to give to the next husband?"<br>Okay firewire, to continue from the previous point, your point will surface when this manipulation game is played. It's implanting "thinkings" into the minds. How come she'll think that way? 'Cos she's "forced" into thinking that way.<br>Of course, the issue of mental strength can be brought up. But then again, people with weaker mental strength are the easily manipulated ones.<br><br>If you feel it's morally wrong to do it, but there's some self-gain in it and the society's point is neutral on your actions, would you still do it?<br>Will the gains outweigh your personal morals? Or are you one who would never compromise your principles?<br><br>[This message has been edited by ocean (edited 26-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gone for a half a day only to come back to see so many messages. Gosh, I hope I'm not going to be chained to the computer for the next few days   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Okay, I see that we are circling each other again and again with our arguments. Some people mind that their future spouses aren't virgins, others dun; it's impossible to generalise that it's a tragedy. Let's leave it at that and stop repeating our points. It's very tiring and non-constructive. I suggest we argue about principles (right/wrong) instead of situations, especially 'what if' situations.<br><br>Yes, it's very gallant of you guys to feel some responsibility for your ex's virginity if you dun marry her. I appreciate that. But I really wish you guys can give us girls some credit. We are not fragile creatures you coddle and protect; we are fully capable of fending- and thinking- for ourselves. Trying to decide whether you guys are being MCP (to think that our future as spouses- as defined by YOUR ideas about virginity- are ruined) or SNAGs (to worry that we'll suffer).<br><br>Another point that is often repeated is that giving away your virginity is a 'painful experience that you regretted so much that you wished you could turn back time'. Well, this doesn't apply all the time. Not everybody did it in a great moment of foolishness or immaturity. Ocean and Mind, I hope that you dun believe in the idea that women tend to be immature becos you are generalising that they would regret. And assuming that it's really a mistake, there are many among us who dun believe in wasting time on regret.<br><br>Let's just agree that it is also impossible to generalise that a person might regret. Let's also agree that it is REALLY idiotic for a person not to consider the issues carefully before she does it.<br><br>I'll also like to raise one point- why is it that in movies and books, sexual awakening is often used as a metaphor for self awakening? Sexual experience is often seen as a form of disinhibition that allows you to explore more of the world. This is not coming from me but from great authors who supposedly had a lot of insight into life.<br><br>I think the idea that we are more or less certain about our partners when we marry is an overstatement. We are sure of our commitment; we can never be sure that our partner is 'the one'. But along with this idea is the assumption that becos we are commited to working on the relationship, we will become 'the one' for each other.<br><br>Ocean, I also dun understand what you mean by this statement- 'the crap that is written down is "true love" is a complete insult to true love'. What crap? And has anyone ever condemned somebody else's idea about true love? As I recall, we are testing ideas, not passing judgement on this topic.<br><br>Yes, love is about caring about the welfare of the other person above your own. So if I believe in satisfying my bf's sexual needs and not care that I will be condemned by society, would my love be any less pure? It's a justification for guys not to do it, but what about the girls???<br><br>And Mind, given the relative ease of divorce nowadays, it is hard to say that marriage has a higher success rate than any other relationship that has love and commitment but no cert. Nobody likes to think about divorce in a marriage, but we are arguing about break-ups in general aren't we?<br><br>And how would you define being 'ready'? You can never know 100 percent of a person. And people change. They're facts of life. Going by your argument, we can never truly be ready for a relationship.<br><br>You've also misunderstood me (ref: 'Being non-virgin helps u to get over heartaches that came with the breaking of a relationship?') As you may probably agree, giving your body to somebody is a great act of trust that's hard to duplicate from other acts. The heartache of having this trust betrayed is greater than others. It's not the only lesson on heartbreak, but it certainly increases your threshold for pain. If you can get over it, you can probably get over a lot of other things.<br><br>Also, I do respect your ideas about trust but can't it be given in ways other than your virginity? I'll rather my bf give me the freedom to do things (i.e. no supervision and pangs of insecurities)  rather than his first time.<br><br>Anyway, I've never said that MOST guys want their gfs to be a virgin becos of the ownership issue. I do believe that it is a reason nonetheless. Just as you say that there are girls who regret, there are bound to be guys who want to own their gfs/wives.<br><br>Okie, tired. Going to sleep. Hope i haven't repeated any points becos I've told myself not to. And doesn't mean that I dun value virginity that highly, I'm dismissing the value that it has for others.<br><br>Zzzz...must sleep liao. Good night and see you guys tommorrow.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 27-12-1999).]</div>

I rememebr when I was still a virgin(I was a late bloomer...lost it at 19 I think...), whenever a relationship didn't work out, I would feel so uncontrollably jealous and angry when I thought of my GF leaving me and giving herself to another guy and not me...Why didn't she love me?..blah blah blah..."<br><br>U dun need to have sex with all ur gfs to reduce the pain, there are better methods. I think its really immature, and wrong at the same time, to use sex to sooth the pain. Anyway, if any of u guys feel that its ok to have sex with ur gf so that it makes breaking up easier, i only got 1 thing to say, u really ought to change ur mindset. Sex is more than that, girls' bodies are not soothing agents for break ups. Some guys( not all) have this mentality that goes:" At least i got her body before we break up, so i'm not really disadvantaged with the break up." This, i strongly feel, really degrades girls. Girls are not guys' playthings   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> For girls who have bf like this, well time to seriously consider the relationship. NOt all guys that way, but sad to say there is quite a no of guys who think this way out there. This is not directed to anyone in particular,  hope no one takes offence at this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hmmm how did MCP and snags come into the issue?

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think we can argue about right or wrong without using situations. People did this before, and the concensus was that both exist in different situations. You can test principles in different situations, so that might be a better way of convincing people, since its clear that in this case we all have different principles that we need to discuss about.<br><br>Ocean and mind brought up concepts of marriage, true love, regret etc. I just want to say that people can only see a lot of things in retrospect. Whatever seems right at the moment will not turn out to be so in the future. Thats why there are divorces, breakups, and yes, regrets about giving up your virginity to that person. My point is that in real life its really difficult to decide whether it will TURN OUT to be the right decision. Sometimes it might not even have any significance at all. So, my view is that since you can't determine now, you do things that seem right, at least at the moment. And sex is, in my opinion, appropriate in a healty relationship.<br><br>I know some people have brought that up already. Don't flame me, because I did read it, just wanted to say what I thought.<br><br>Mind: I also see that you disagree that sex in certain cases bring about intimacy in a relationship. I guess its a different intimacy because of the physical aspect of it. Being so close physically breaks down some barriers to a relationship that mental/ intellectual understanding cannot. So I just want to clarify: would you agree that sex can bring about a form of intimacy that other forms of connection can't, or do you think that there is no form of intimacy that sex can bring that other forms of connection cannot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After thinking about it, an MCP imposes his ideas of virginity- and the consequences of losing it before marriage- on his future spouse. A SNAG is simply one who is sensitive to his partner's needs and adapts his ideas and actions accordingly to work things out.<br><br>I've also given some thoughts to regrets. It applies to both losing your virginity and life in general, doesn't it? No matter how well you consider the situation or how hard you try, there are bound to be some regrets in the end. Does this mean that we should be afraid to try things all the time? Life is not worth living if that is the case.<br><br>It's impossible never to regret anything, but you should never let regrets mar your life. In life, for everything you lose, you win something else. And in life, there can never be winners or losers, just survivors. You'll be ahead some of the time, in some of the areas, but there will definitely be moments when you fall behind. What matters is that you're still around and you know how to find your own happiness, instead of expecting others to give it to you.<br><br>Just as you may regret giving away your virginity, you may also regret never having the opportunity to explore before you settle down. The latter case may make you feel stifled and even start wild thoughts in your head, no matter how much you try to suppress them. If this eventually leads to an affair out of marriage, let's say it could have been preventable too (i.e. wider experience in the world before settling down). Sad to say it but many people need to do what's 'wrong' to really appreciate what's 'right'.<br><br>My main point is, if you really want to do, you have to balance everything carefully. There is never one perfect decision you'll never regret.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>purr-Did you read my mail carefully before replying?<br>I've already pointed out some might view it as, not all. How come the word "generalise" came about in your post?<br>About the point on "I really wish you guys can give us girls some credit", did I say I didn't?<br>If the girl chooses that path when she's mature, I respect that decision. What I'm trying to illustrate in my earlier post was that what if you know that she still has not reach that level of maturity(still rash and impulsive, etc), and the guy was mature to understand that, and hence should he or should he not "take advantage" of the situation. A question of morals.<br><br>"we are fully capable of fending- and thinking- for ourselves."<br>I think you're generalising on this point. You might be mature enough to do so, but what about those who has not reached your state of maturity? Is it not right for the more matured ones to guide those until they reach a certain level of maturity?<br>And do not confuse guidance with protect.<br><br>I'm surprised that you're trying to decide we guys are MCPs or SNAGs.<br>What I'm trying to drive across is a case of personal values, whether should we do when we feel that it's not right. Law might keep certain morals in check, but others really depends on your personal values.<br>I believe that it's important to uphold our own values, beliefs and principles. Do what you feel/believe is right, what others say doesn't matter. It's your own conscience afterall. You should never be swayed by fear of receiving harsh comments from the people around you. Every decision a person makes, there maybe thousands of different opinions on it. But what ultimately matters is how you feel. If you feel it's right, do it. If you feel it's wrong, don't do it.<br>MCPs or SNAGs? It doesn't matter.<br><br>"Another point that is often repeated is that giving away your virginity is a 'painful experience that you regretted so much that you wished you could turn back time'. Well, this doesn't apply all the time. Not everybody did it in a great moment of foolishness or immaturity. Ocean and Mind, I hope that you dun believe in the idea that women tend to be immature becos you are generalising that they would regret. And assuming that it's really a mistake, there are many among us who dun believe in wasting time on regret."<br>purr-This is the part where I believe you didn't read my post properly. I've highlighted that my points are based on a possible scenario(and definitely not a must-be scenario), and I have tried very hard to paint the picture of the other side of the coin to you. I did not generalise. Please read my posting again.<br><br>"Let's also agree that it is REALLY idiotic for a person not to consider the issues carefully before she does it."<br>No one is idiotic unless you choose to view it so. Everyone makes mistakes, sometimes it's really a spur-of-the-moment thing. I believe everyone has his/her impulsive moments. My main concern here is whether should we help to prevent "tragedies" (to be taken in multiple context and not just with reference to the topic itself) from happening if we could.<br><br>On the point on true love, my belief is that it's a feeling that cannot be expressed in words. Hence that's my personal belief, and I strongly worded it to highlight my point. Did I pass any judgement on the topic? I didn't.<br><br>"Yes, love is about caring about the welfare of the other person above your own. So if I believe in satisfying my bf's sexual needs and not care that I will be condemned by society, would my love be any less pure? It's a justification for guys not to do it, but what about the girls???"<br><br>How pure is your love depends on yourself. It's how you feel. The love is from you, not from others. How you want to express it, it's really up to you. I get your point here, and I wouldn't disagree with you. My justification for the guys applies when it's due to the scenario that I've mentioned earlier.<br><br>fadingstar, don't fade away so quickly.
