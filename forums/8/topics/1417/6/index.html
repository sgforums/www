            <div class='col-md body'>Before I engage in replying to different people on their posts, I have to say that I have enjoyed all the serious discussion which had continued and would salute to the various writers for example Purr, Mind, Pacman, and many others for their serious thoughts on the subject and sharing their experiences.<br><br>To Twinkle :<br>Perhaps, I have answered my question. What I am pinpointing that the act of losing virginity is not one of logic but of emotion. It is hard to say whether it is right or wrong because we are not in the situation where people like Purr is subjected to, we cannot understand what it is like. The other things which a couple do to plan for the future, I agree with you that it is rational, but that is not the point of contention. The point is on losing virginity.<br><br>To Purr:<br>Thanks for sharing the story, and at least I get an idea under what circumstances you choose to take the action.... Still, you have my best wishes...<br><br>To Repetoire :<br>I remember that I have deep relationship with my ex-gf (we broke up recently) that we have always agreed that we will not have sex as I respected her view that she wanted to keep her virginity for her husband. Whether sex is in or not, it does not matter, because if you love someone, it is the heart that really matters and that is where it hurts most. When your loved one has betrayed you for another man, and take away all that frustration of betrayal and still feel for the person and every place and song which could remind you, it will only mean you still love her. That is what it means most when all the people are talking about here, I suppose whether for both virginity and non-virginity camps. I think what hurts me in the end, is when she said that I was not the One in her life, and she went away with someone else, who could give her happiness, despite all that we gone thru to be together... *sigh*<br><br>Just a reflection and sharing of experience.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see this thread is back.....<br><br>All my the other previous posts are abt regrets and ideals. Maybe its time to see to illustrate in a more realistic and practical way.<br><br>Abt that survey which concluded that 50% of the population wants their spouse to be virgins, i believe its accurate. Many some of u might argued that the ppl involved in the surveys are lying cos they dun want to admit they are non-virgins. But that survey is asking whether u want ur spouse to be virign and NOT whether u are a virgin. I think that survey was done quite professionally, ie, the ppl who did the survery did not put any pressure of any kind on the ppl being surveyed. So to conclude this, the survery is accurate.<br><br>A quote from Jusme:<br>"I understand about wanting to keep your virginity for after marriage. You might call me selfish or silly, but I think I would be davastated to find out that I have been keeping my virginity for my wedding night only to find out that my husband is not one. Good for those who are virgins but even better for those who have experienced love and understand what I am talking about."<br><br>No offence meant <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, but somehow i think u are giving ur virginity away cos u are afraid that ur future husband is a non-virgin and if u are still a virgin, u felt that u are at a disadvantaged. In short, i think u are doing it for the wrong reasons.<br><br>A favourite quote:<br>"And if my future husband were to despise me because of this, I'll know that he is not worthy of my love."<br><br>Hmmm, maybe rite now u think this way, but when u fall head over heel in love with a guy and the guy wants his gf/wife to be a virgin, i think some of u girls will be cursing urself for giving it away to some other guy. Like other arguements, there is 2 sides to a arguement. Some of the girls might think that the guy is unworthy of her love, but have u thought of the perspective of the guy. The guy might seen u as cheap or something, in this case, its highly possible that the guy will juz dump you or even worse, some of the guy will coax u to have sex with them and after that he will dump u. Many of you have put your pt across that its hypocritical for a guy to demand that his wife must be a virgin if he himself is not one or a girl should not be seen as cheap if she gives it away to her bf before marriage.<br>But lets be realistic, this kind of thinking or scenario is only existing in our arguements here. I dun think many ppl will think this way out there in real life, out of this virtual forum. Like i said before, girls are at a disadvantaged cos they have tell-tale signs on whether they are virgins or not. So as u go on with ur life, its very highly possible that u will be labelled as cheap or something like that.<br><br>Some of u have said that its impt that u experienced love at its maximum..... but i think its better to give ur virginity to your spouse after marriage cos the love u experience then will be greater and much more fulfilling.<br><br>And beware of guys using sex as a weapon against u.<br><br>On guys asking for sex, have u really considered that the guy is serious abt u. Speaking from the pt of a guy and from the observation i made, many guys esp those still in the late teens and early 20s got a gf not bcos they like them but its juz for the sake of getting a gf. And in almost all casest, they are not serious abt the girls. They will ask the girls for sex, and after they got it, they will sooner or later dump the girls. So its highly possible that girls will be giving their virginity away to guys who are not serious abt them.<br><br>The body is yours. No one has the right to tell u what to do with it. But think very very carefully cos by the time u regret it, its too late.<br><br>Mind<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, this is the first time im posting and i wish to kill this thread once and for all. Geezz...took me 2 hrs to read this every single post. My eyeballs are about to drop out.<br><br>Love is unconditional commitment to an imperfect individual.<br><br>You love a person for who he/she is and not for his/her body or whatsoever. You don't expect him/her to be a virgin or not cause at the end of it all, it doesn't matter. Say a couple gets married and on their wedding night they have sex. For the guy, if he finds out that his wife is not a virgin, is he gonna think "Oh darn...my wife is not a virgin...maybe i should have ask her whether is she a virgin before i marry her. Now i regret marrying her..." THIS IS ABSURD. Whats the pt. in brooding over this type of stuff that is sooooo irrelevant.<br><br>In a relationship, its best not to place sex at the top of the list no matter how close the couple is.  To some people, losing their virginity to their Â“true loveÂ” seems to be the ultimate ideal thing. No thats not true. There are marriages out there where both sides have long ago lost their virginity to other pple, but they know that it doesn't matter. Whats important is that they have REALLY found someone whom they can share their joys and sorrows with. To those of you who says, I would remain a virgin till I found my true love and when we are married. Well to these pple, I would say good luck. Im not cursing anyone but when you find that ur Â“true loveÂ” ainÂ’t the true love u thought he/she is, then you would definitely not be saying all these. The concept of marriage is getting all messed up these days.<br><br>Firewire and Purr have told us about their experiences and how it has open up their life and perspective. Mind may not really agree, but i wish to say that you don't learn anything until you experience it yourself. The impact to your own life when you experience certain things are far more dramatic then things you actually try to learn from other ppleÂ’s experience. Firewire and Purr never regretted on their course of actions cause they believe that it has overall done them more good than bad. We are born in this world to commit mistakes and learn from them in order to make us a better person. Regrets are the results of the mistakes you made, but rather than spending half ur life regretting what u should have done or shouldnÂ’t have done, why not made the best of what you have now and actually learn something from your own mistakes.<br><br>This society is changing and weÂ’re already in the 21st century, why keep sticking to the mindset of the past? In response to Mind, surveys are usually a whole load of bullshit. It can never truly be accurate. You mentioned that the pple never applied any pressure on those who did the survey. But are u sure that the pple themselves actually wrote what they really think ?? And by the way, my post isnÂ’t aimed at being anti-Mind. Religion-wise speaking, we shouldnÂ’t stick too much to what our religion says, itÂ’s a different mindset that belongs to the pastÂ…learn to adaptÂ…you arenÂ’t suppose to follow each and every single thing they wroteÂ…but rather you follow the general thinking they want you to have, to be a good person and things like thatÂ…<br><br>There is no right or wrong in the things that we do, nor the paths that we take. Right or wrong is what other people perceive. Everyone has their own perspective.<br><br>Oh yes just to make things clearÂ…I for one values oneÂ’s virginity but im not obsessed with it. Just for ur info, im only 17.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I'll just like to say that not all non-virgins are cheap.<br><br>I dun even hold hands with a guy on the first date, much lest kiss him or jump into bed with him immediately. Up to now, I still dun know how to start a conversation with a total stranger in a bar.<br><br>To think that ALL non-virgins are cheap is very close-minded.<br><br>Mind, you said:<br>'I dun think many ppl will think this way out there in real life, out of this virtual forum.'<br><br>And on what basis do you say that? Why would people lie given the complete anonymity on the net? Why should we be afraid of being judged by people we've never met?!<br><br>In the first place, do you have any PROOF that this is the case in the real world?<br><br>'Some of u have said that its impt that u experienced love at its maximum..... but i think its better to give ur virginity to your spouse after marriage cos the love u experience then will be greater and much more fulfilling.'<br><br>So I assume you are married and know everything about how much greater love is after marriage? It's very easy to say this when you've hardly had any experience.<br><br>Even though my relationship with my ex, the one I gave my virginity to, has ended, I would never denounce him or what we've had together. If you've had several ex-bfs before, you'll know that it's possible to love each of them differently. To me, it's imopossible to compare my ex with my current bf. Both relationships are blissful in its own way and each had its own ups-and-downs. How do you weigh everything in the end?<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 05 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kudos to Locutus!!!<br>Love is accepting who he/she is &amp; not what u hope, expect or want her to be. I totally agree with u!<br><br>Yes, Mind, i can understand the devastation u'll feel when u found out that ur husband is not a virgin while u ve been kiping urs for the wedding nite. But how will ur husband feel IF its a role reversal, where u are the ONE in this case, who had lost ur virginity, &amp; he's still kiping it?? Dya think iz apt for him to label u as cheap? True, guys may jus get away scot free when it comes to this, but does it mean that society is going to condone his deeds while ladies who lost their virginity are condemned??<br><br>If he still chooses 2 label her, jus becos of this fact, then i dun think the relationship is anymor promising cos the guy is not able to accept her as what she is. That is NOT TRUE LOVE. That is EXPECTATION. He wants her to be what he hopes she should be. Sincerely, non virgins are at no more a disadvantage than virgins, cos in the end, it is WHO u are DEEP down inside that matters!<br><br>Its already a social &amp; emotional stigma for non virgins in society, but pls spare them the rod, cos they are already feeling distress enough by the staunch opinions of the pro virgin camp. Ouch, u know how that feels or not?<br><br>Sex may be important in a relationship or marriage, but how far the relationship is maintained &amp; the quality of the relationship depends on a lot of mutual understanding, trust, acceptance, &amp; communications. Maybe mor factors are involved for some, but seriously, virgins or non virgins, these are the basic prerequisites. LOVE is<br>UNCONDITIONAL...<br><br>No doubt, religion has taught us 2 be chaste, but whats done cannot be undone, then is it still alright for labels &amp;  hurtful names to be hurled at non virgins?? Altho they MAY have sin, but pls they DESERVE a chance to live life as per norm jus like any sinner. Well, the law may not think so, but thats not the point, cos iz not a crime?!<br><br>Not everyone can go thru wat others have gone thru, it is oso not necessary to go thru wat others have experience, b4 u can understand how they feel or think, but it is via shared experiences that we learn from others &amp; become stronger for it.<br><br>There's no point comparing &amp; contrasting. Every individual has her/his own mind, opinions, emotions. We are here to share our views &amp; respect each others opinion &amp; suggestions. U might accept, u might not, but the bottomline is we are speaking our minds &amp; from the bottom of our hearts in this forum.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all<br><br>wow!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i have skimmed through most of the postings with great interest and this thing is really cool!<br><br>1st i do not object to pre-maritial sex if it is done for the right reasons. It has been discussed and i agree with purr's views that sex does not only mean love and that you can show love in many other ways. That one cannot own the another if he or she has taken the virginity of the other. I'm also not taking sides on gender cos i believe that both sexes are equal cos we live in the same world. To me guys and girls are equally cheap or in the wrong if they sleep with other people.<br><br>However, as i was reading through, it suddenly dawned on me that little has been said about the down side of pre-maritial sex in the practical point of view. So far alot has been said about feelings etc.(not sure if i can put it that way) but you will see what i mean.<br><br>Okay for a start, let's assume that condoms and other contraceptives do not work all the time.<br><br>Now think about this, what is the primary purpose of sex?? make a lucky guess.., Yes It is for making BABIES!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Another thing that we have to consider is STDs. Some of you said that it dosen't matter how many people your partner has slept with before! While i'm not sure of the types of diseaes and their effects i strongly feel that....for crying out loud! IT MATTERS! come on! i don't want to wake up the next day with a swollen dick or worse, spend the next few years taking medicine till i die of AIDS..lonely, sad and in pain. While i am sure most of you won't just sleep with anyone you meet, you still can't be too sure about your partner or your partner's history right? Also, some diseases may not be evident until passed onto you!<br><br>You go do some thinking before you make your next move.Ask yourself, what sex means to you and whether it is worth the risks.<br><br>Remember this, it can make a life, or it can take a life. Both consequences, you don't want.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Purr and Mind:<br><br>On your point on not all non-virgins are cheap. In view to Mind's arguments, both of you are arguing on different groups of people in the non-virgin camps. Those who jump into bed on 1st go, are of one class and those who either willingly or unwillingly give their virginity to the guy are of 2 different classes. What is so different about the latter?<br><br>In reference to a few posts by JusMe, Mind and Purr, one can give away her virginity to her bf when he requests for it and she carefully "thought" about it. I used "thought" because I have already pointed out earlier that the decision to give away the virginity is irrational and the gal has already decided in the reason of love that she should give it. The other case, is an hypothetical case, where the guy coerces the gal to have sex, after tasting her and continues to dump her. I pity the latter group of gals, who responded to their bfs by fear. IMHO, Mind is referring to the latter class of gals. So, how are we going to help them to cope with their regrets?<br><br>The entire thread has gone in my opinion on this few issues :<br>1)Sex and Love are 2 different things. It is strange that one should try to bundle them together using the virginity argument. I think if you love someone truly, you should not mind whether she is a virgin. In this case, I totally disagree with Mind who seemed to bundle these things up in the issue.<br>2)When gal have sex with guy, it can be due to a few situations and most of the time, the guy ask for it. I don't think that there is any explicit example mentioned about women demanding sex first. This will be really horny.<br>3)The consequences that the non-virgins have to suffer in the eyes of society are illustrated thoroughly in all the posts. The non-virgins who argued in the issue have all no regrets and take it as a lesson learnt (when they broke up with the guy who took away their virginity). However, they are also fellow human beings, and who are we to judge them and condemn them? Who set the rules in religion to say that women should not give away their virginity to man before marriage? It is Man who create these rules, and these rules are just superficial rules which made no sense.<br>4)Love is unconditional but yet I still think that there are restrictions and boundaries to be made. Perhaps, we chooses the restrictions and boundaries which illustrate the spectrum of beliefs illustrated by Purr and Mind and many others in the issue.<br>5)The point brought up by Ticonderoga was interesting. What happens when the gal gets pregnant? The issue of another life to be brought into this world or to be taken away complicates the entire issue. People can use contraceptives but these things do not gurantee any misfire. Maybe now, the non-virgin camp should give their opinion on when this kind of situation happens. What if the guy doesn't take the responsibility?<br><br>On the other hand, I stood on the camp of the virgins. I hope that my wife is a virgin, but if she is not, I will still marry her because I love her, not because she has not slept with someone. So, Purr, don't always make the generalization that all virgins are close-minded. I chose that out of my own personal beliefs and there is no reason for it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigal,<br><br>to answer your query: girls who jump into bed immediately are driven by their physical impulses while girls who give it to their bfs *often* do it out of love, to please them. The motivations are different, even though both types may feel the same physical needs. The latter group *usually* do not jump into bed until they are certain about their feelings and those of their partners; they dun just do it with anyone that comes along.<br><br>And prodigal, I never said that guys who want their future wives to be virgins are close-minded. I said that guys who think that ALL non-virgins are cheap are close-minded. Please read the postings carefully.<br><br>Yup, pregnancy can occur. In fact, I got a real scare once. But my bf didn't run off;  he actually did the maths(income, expenses etc) and promised he would marry and take care of me if I got pregnant. The thing about us is that we're both grown adults at a marriageable age, with some side income from freelance work. And he's very committed to me. That's why I keep stressing that you must consider carefully before you do anything, including who you are doing it with.<br><br>And please excuse me for saying this, the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that my bf is a great guy *smilez*<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 06 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have read what all of you guys and girls have said so far. Somehow I can safely say that this issue is just a matter of opinion. Some are for keeping their virginity till marriage, and they give their reasons. Some say otherwise, and they have their reasons as well. But there is one thing that has to be considered by both sides: The consequences of losing one's virginity, whether before or after marriage.<br>So what's my point? Simply this: Are you prepared to face the consequences? I am not saying that anything drastic will befall you. But the fact is that there will be consequences, good or bad, and you will have to face up to them. And the how you come out from facing them will affect you for the rest of your life.<br>If you are confident that you will be able to make the right decision and live with it, by all means do what you will. If not, then I recommend caution. Personally, I do not believe that sex is merely a physical act to satisfy one's needs. It is a union of souls. I am saying this so that you will know where I stand on this issue and why I am writing in this manner.<br>Depending on how you important you treasure your virginity and the issue of having sex, this message may just appear to be the ramblings of a fool. But please remember: There are consequences, good or bad.<br><br>P.S: If what I have said has already been said, I apologise for wasting your time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Repetoire:<br>Actually, I have been thinking about it. I decided to stay as a virgin, because of the same idea of giving it to my wife as a gift. I think I sound stupid and naive here, as I have no religious beliefs to hold me back. It is more personal choice. It is easier to justify in my own opinion why I should not be a virgin, because I want to have fun (in the typical guy's perspective)... However, dun have the chance to flirt around....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
