            <div class='col-md body'>I think there is nothing wrong with having two virgins in marriage. There is a lot of things you can share and learn in the process of growing together in marriage.<br><br>It took quite a lot of adjustments and learning (especially patience, trust and love) during the five years for my wife and I. These trials and times we faced together cemented our relationship - something which I feel may just be missing if say, one of us is 'experienced'.<br><br>While I personally feel that virginity is important in marriage, I must salute Purr for her mature outlook on how she has handled herself. Here I must say something too.<br><br>Even if a woman is not a virgin when you marry her, it does not mean the marriage cannot survive or something like that. But both parties must be prepared to work it out. Like it or not, previous sexual experiences colour very much the later ones. If that is so with two virgins at marriage, how much more when one or both are not?<br><br>So my point is - do not reject or judge a person based on whether he or she is a virgin, but be prepared mentally that there are lots of matters to work out if you do intend to marry. Things are not so easy when it is not a clean slate.<br><br>I once thought over this matter while I was courting my wife. In the end I reach this conclusion - even if she is not a virgin, it doesn't matter to me. I am prepared to work out the marriage even with that. That would be my love for her. And yes, there definitely was A LOT OF PROBLEMS within the first two years of our marriage!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I think losing your virginity is not a bad thing but I can imagine if my wife ask me how many women have I slept before besides her. I'll really feel bad inside me even if she doesn't mind so I think ir is better to wait until you are really sure that the other party is the one you really one to be with.<br><br>------------------<br>Visit my homepage at<br>http://members.xoom.com/Thanis<br>A homepage for teens</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After St. Michael's example, I would like to share my experiences too.<br><br>With the exception of my current bf, all the rest were virgins when I met them.<br><br>Did it matter than they 'gave' their virginity to me? No, when the going got rough, they split. They varied from one who wanted to marry me after graduation to one who used me- not only physically, but emotionally.<br><br>My current bf was not a virgin when I met him. Did old ghosts ever come back to haunt us? Yes and no. In the beginning, I did wonder whether i was prettier than the rest and whether he loved them more. He did too. But it never got really bad becos we both realised that virginity didn't matter along the way.<br><br>It's not becos we've both lost it, so we have to accept it. It just didn't matter becos there are greater priorities when it comes to a relationship.<br><br>And if he were to meet me when I was still a virgin, he probably would not have fallen in love with me becos I was a different person then. The same goes for him.<br><br>Also, we wouldn't have tried so hard to work at this relationship because we don't know how precious- and fragile- it is.<br><br>Every relationship has to be worked at, even if you're both virgins. There're bound to be some insecurities and hicups, like old girlfriends and difficult parents. Don't think you can ever take the other way out. If you do, then you're not ready for a relationship yet.<br><br>In case anyone wonders how old I am, I'm 22- too old to act stupid but too young to know better  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So does it mean having to loose ones virginity means u have grown matured and wiser?<br>Pardon me this, but i didnt confuse ones virginity to ownership. Being a christian, i abide by the rules of keeping oneself pure and chaste. As in the bible, ones virginity is the only true gift to your spouse. Label me a religious pig if u want, but i just felt that u people r sensationlising pre marital sex as the rite thing to do. I mean, how can u just felt that its ok to make love to people u think u truly love just like that without considering the fact that u r not married?<br>Lets face it, this is a very conservative society, people will sneer at u for not being chaste and pure before marriage. If u r a non virgin, u will drag your spouse into gossips. have u thought of that? Have u thought of the future itself? What if one day, your spouse's ex lover just come up to u and say " so how's him in bed" or "she's hot in bed rite?" How would u response? Dont give me shit about wat loving-him/her-truly-will-not mind-his/her-past thingy. The fact is, u will sooner or later be affacted by it.<br>So what i am bringing across is, that being a virgin till marriage if the best preventive method to future woes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a very interesting thread indeed.<br><br>I'm no Christian, and I'm no religious pig<br>either, but ever since young it has been drilled into me that your virginity has to be given to your wife. I think I brought it even further by refusing to give out hugs or pats on the shoulder to my close female friends, telling them that I'm reserving all these 'physical contact' for the one I love.<br><br>I personally feel that sex is a very private act, for want of a better description. It is a time when you see a person of the other sex in all their naked glory, and that to me is better left after marriage.<br><br>I admit in this aspect I am conservative. I was brought up that way. And the fact that young teenagers are giving away their virginity like nobody's business irks me. It just show that there is a general deterioation in social and moral values. nowadays.<br><br>Perhaps gals like Purr are the norm nowadays.<br>It's their life, it's their body and they have every right to do whatever want to. Through that they have learnt, but by keeping myself a virgin and keeping sex out of relationships have also led to me realising that virginity/sex is not everything to a good relationship. Trust, respect, communication all matters more, and believe me, all the sex in the world is won't do your relationship any good if there are no communication between your partner at all.<br><br>Having said all that, it is still preferable, in my opinion, to keep your virginity until after marriage. At least there won't be guilt trips, no wondering of whether you were better than the rest, being disease-free,etc.<br><br>I kept my virginity for my wife, because I preferred her to be a virgin too. That way, no one can say you practice double-standards.<br><br>For the record, I'm 22, happily married, both my wife and I were virgins, and both of us placed sex so low in the relationship equation that we probably will go below the national average.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Nic, I believe that people here are not saying that premaritial sex is the 'right' thing to do. Rather it is more impt that we do not let ourselves tied down by "social norms" of 'strictly no sex b4 marriage' even though we disagree with them. Isn't it terrible that we cannot do something that we want to just because we are worried of other people looking down on us and all? Isn't the present society stressful enuf as it is without all these restrictions? Sex is not something that is harmful to society like murder or robbery. It is a private sharing of closeness between a couple. Of couse it should be ideally done when both parties are aware of what they are doing and the consequences. I think it is quite immature to mind a partner who has lost his/her virginity before being together with you. What is more important is that the couple is very much in love now. The present and future is more impt than the past. Just my personal opinion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah, went out to celebrate Christmas only to come back to see so much action. Good, I was hoping for a rigorous debate and it's picking up momentum.<br><br>Nobody has ever said that giving up your virginity will make you more mature. After all, there are a lot of girls out there who do it with strangers for $$$ to get a Prada bag.<br><br>But if you insist on sticking with your preconcieved ideas and refuse to experiment and really LIVE life in its technicolour (no matter how garish), then it's difficult for you to become mature. I'm not saying that sexual experienece is good or essential or something that will bring you closer to nirvana. It's just ONE form of experience that helps broaden your perspective.<br><br>If it's wrong to have sex with the person you love, does it mean that you dun make love to your wife too        <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> After all, you are marrying somebody you LOVE rite? The issue here is more about sex than marriage. It is not practical to have pre-marital sex but I still fail to see why it is wrong.<br><br>And sorry to say this Ah Nic, but this is not an age where losing your virginity will condemn you for life. In fact, many of the reponses in this thread have indicated that many do not mind whether their future spouses are virgins. Gossip, if any, will not make you or your wife a social outcast.<br><br>And excuse me for laughing at your idea of purity and chastity. So if I do everything with a guy, including giving him a blow-job, I am still considered pure if I haven't had sexual intercourse with him? Why don't you extend purity to thoughts? So long as you've kissed an ex-girlfriend or had any kind of sexual thought, even from looking at a poster, then you are alredi a sinner condemned to hell.<br><br>Again, I'll like to ask about the immorality of losing your virginity. The act in itself is not immoral unless, like every other thing you do, you hurt or betray somebody with it. Why do you call it immoral with your implication of 'looseness'?<br><br>About your point on gossip. If you have one night stands, of course you can expect people to say horrid things about you. In fact, you deserve it           <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But if you did it in a relationship out of love, would that person go around telling everybody about it? There must have been some feelings involved right? Okay, so what if he really does it? He'll be stuck with a label of a cad and you'll be seen as a victim becos he's trepassed good taste and social acceptablity with his kiss and tell. James Hewitt, Diana's ex, is a good example.<br><br>Ex-husbands kiss and tell too. Just look at Jennifer Lopez. Following your argument, why don't we totally forget about getting married.<br><br>And if you always expect a pat on the head for everything you do in life, then you'll never be much of a person.<br><br>So what if an ex-lover came and talked about it with your spouse? Again, the likelihoods of this happening is slim unless you've been cavalier about your lovers. But if it does happen, then ideally, you should alredi have told your spouse and worked it out with her so it doesn't hurt. Well, you are with her in the end rite? And you've probably told her you love her most and sex with her is the best rite? She could just turn around and laugh at the other woman about how lacking she was -in and out of bed           <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Serves her rite for acting like a bitch in the first place.<br><br>Again, I stress that you have work things out with your spouse for a long satisfying relationship, EVEN IF virginity is not an issue. If it really becomes a big issue, then the consolation is that the more issues you work out, the stronger your relationship will be.<br><br>Ah Nic, you are not just a religious prig. You are the worst form of religious prig. It is alright to hold your religious beliefs close to yourself. But to carve out them in stone and be unable to give a good reason why they should be upheld other than MY RELIGION SAID SO is laughable. From what logic or experience are you speaking from? Oft times, many religious beliefs oversimplify and ignore reality. Some are simply bigoted.<br><br>You are the type that really discourage me from becoming a Christian. If St. Peter's prejudice against women were to be accpeted without question, then religion does more harm than good.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 25-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something else has just occured to me. I think people are confusing marriage with finding the one true love.<br><br>Some marriages, like other BGRs, are simply mistakes that end up in divorce in 2 years. Yes, some marriages work out wonderfully. But my point is, marriage and finding your 'one true love' are not one and the same.<br><br>How then is marriage different from a relationship where both partners are in love and committed to each other? Marriages, like such relationships, are not fail proof. The mariage certificate is just a piece of paper that helps you divide your property. If people take it as 'permission' to have sex or confirmation that your partner is 'the one', then they are sadly deluded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sensitive issue, i hope no one will be offended. Well no one in this world is the same. There are ppl who are more liberal while some are more conservative so the expectations of their partners will be different. Whether ur future spouse/bf/gf are virgin really depend on what u think. If u dun mind, thats ok, if u mind thats ok too.<br>So i suppose open minded ppl will end up with open minded ppl , while the conservative ppl will end up with ppl thinking in the same way as them. It depends on how u look at sex. As a ultimate gift that shows ur love or as something to give and receive pleasure? If u believe in the former, most probably u believe in virginity,<br>if u believe in the latter, well i dun think u believe in virginity.<br><br>There are ppl who dun want virgins cos they feel non-virgins are more experienced but personally i think this reason is quite unacceptable. Bonding... Marriage.... I think its a great idea to for both the husband and wife to be virgins. Maybe sex will not be that pleasurable in the beginning ( after trying, i think it will be great for them) but they can slowly experiment and i'm sure the whole process can strengthen the bond btw them. ( dunno if i'm talking rubbish, never been thru this process before.)<br><br>The most impt pt i think is whether u will regret it? Maybe u dun regret it now but what abt the future? I think u will get a great feeling when u realised that on reflection of ur life, u have only done it with ur spouse and ur spouse has only done it with u. It makes u really think that the 2 of u are made for each other.<br><br>Personally, i want my gf/wife to be a virgin.<br>Again thats my personal choice. Other ppl might want the other choice. It really depends on how u look at it.<br><br>Mind<br>no offense to anyone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purr: About your previous posts, I wasn't sure if you were spelling pig or prick. As you can see, pig= oink oink, prick is an organ I suppose  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If prig was a new word, please let me know in case I look like a total idiot.<br><br>I agree with mind's view on anything goes in terms of whether you look for a virgin for a partner. Some can handle it, some can't. The most important thing is to be happy and comfortable with what you think.<br><br>Personally, I would prefer myself not to be a virgin when I meet my one true love, if there ever is one. I'm not sure whether anyone else has brought this up, but the notion about non virgins being more experienced doesn't only refer to the physical side of things i.e. how many more positions do I know more than you.<br>Non virgins are more experienced as well because they have encountered an intimacy that only sex can convey. Its not just physical, its also emotional. Its different from mental and intellectual connection, which by the way is very important as well.<br><br>I do understand that not everyone thinks of sex ( or if you prefer, making love) as a form of connection. Just look at one night stands. But thats another story.<br><br>So, I just would like to say, sex is good. I wish I can try it. But don't beat yourself about it if you are not comfortable with it. All in due course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just another thought. I have no idea whether I want my partner to be a virgin or not.

            <div class='col-md body'>pacman - no, i'm not following you from post to post but, as you now know, there really is such a word as prig. it means a self-righteous or moralistic person. if you trace the etymology of the word, you won't be able to find it cos the origin of the word is apparently unknown. but it's not too hard to guess, is it now? if someone tries to judge you based on their own standards you'd prob say "you prig! (rhyming with prick)" too, now won't you? haha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>aiyah, what can i say. i think everyone rationalises their choices and decisions in life. if you've done it before, you'll give reasons why it's alright or maybe even the preferred mode of living. if you haven't then you'll have your reasons why also. i think it's to make us feel better abt ourselves.<br><br>since most ppl here seem pro choice and pro wild thing b4 the big M, i'll try to see if the other priggish opinion has any merit to it. in short, i think there is a non-religious romanticised notion of keeping yourself til after marriage. i'm sure you all know it. and i think it's sweet. a notion where you equate (rightly or wrongly) keeping it til after M as a sign of respect, love and patience. this is esp so if the other party knows she'll prob succumb some day but wishes the two of you didn't do it. so the guy in this case shows all three qualities if he has the opportunity to but still doesn't take it. most guys would prob say that guy is stupid not to do it. a prick (without the "g"). but that's one reason for keeping it til after. and i think it's a good reason.<br><br>personally i would love to have a few partners b4 M. all in r'ships of course. and all under the delusion and illusion of love. but for me, it'd be a selfish thing. i just want to have as many experiences as possible b4 having to get tied down to one person for life. but what exactly can one learn from having lost one's cherry before marriage? i'd like to hear opinions on this (if they already appear above then i'm sorry. haven't read all the posts).<br><br>to me, i think different ppl learn different things from their experiences. some learn nothing at all. so pray tell me (quite specifically) which part of your character is improved if ur more sexually experienced?<br><br>man....i dunno if i make any sense. really need to get some sleep now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finally I must talk...and what has been asid here has been said to a certain degree in a few other earlier posts for those who want to read more about htis subject...<br><br>What do people gain from having sex before marriage?....as with all things in life, it is a personal thing...some people don't get anything but sexual satisfaction, other people are more in tuned with themselves and the act to get soemthign from it....What did I get from it???<br><br>I grew up and matured a lot faster after having sex(but that's just me...some people don't)...and it didn't happen overnight, but it started to open my mind up to other things in life...It was a door to another aspect of life and I have never or will ever regret anything that I have ever done in reference to sex...I found that after a while, I found the ability to understand women on a deeper level than just on the facade...iT's all so difficult to put into words as it is such a big part of me....as Purr had said earlier...If I had never had sex, I wouldn't be this persont hat I am now...i wouldn't have my confidence now, i wouldn't think the way I think, i wouldn't see women the way I see them now, I wouldn't be as forthright and psoitive, and I wouldn't be able to tahun when women leave me for other guys they slept with...It has allowed me to grow up emotionally and to a lot of extents, mentally also...and allowed me to be able to have some kind of understanding when things go bad in relationships...<br><br>It has opened up doors to emotions that I would otherwise never have or would find difficult to bring forth in relation with other people intimate or otherwise.  I have learnt to understand the womans body from other than porn magazines ands biology classes...they don't rteach you how to make a woman feel good in biology or in porn movies...you learn it from experience...and for a guy, I dun think that I have slept with many women (4 in total)...and all my GF....and I have never ever hired a prostitue or paid for sex from anyone...<br><br>I feel that it has made me more complete than any other event in my life besides being born....:-)<br><br>Sex for me has always been about "sex"...I have always never liked to call it "love" mainly because the word "making love" is so used and seems to me, superficial...sex is sex...but I won't elaborate on this as it isn't really that important right now so I'll leave open holes here (no pun intended)...:-)<br><br>I have to agree with purr, not because she's a girls and I'm trying to win concessions or because I am a male feminist, but because of a lot of reasons....and I guess they are all personal as it should be for everyone else...<br><br>And please everyone, religion doesn't tell you how to live life today...everything written in the bible was written for that age and adopted every generation but itnever gets uypdated...You cannot  live your life by values and stautes set out thousands of years ago...if it's like that, we might as well carry around clubs when we leave our caves everday...a book is just a book...and I am religious..in a way....I have had a lot of religious training...I was a bhuddist monk before, went to a christain school and a private catholic school most of my life (The Sacred Heart Brotherhood)....so I have a lot of insight into what religion is all about and I have never ever felt that religion forbade me or anyone else to have sex...the only time I ever felt it was wrong to have premarital sex was when other people actually said so!!!....Even in school they taught us never to take the bible literally or word for word...they told us to live our life not by the bible but gain insight and knowledge from it's teachings...It doesn't tell us how to live our lives although it might say so(of course we should try and live by the 10 commandments)...<br><br>And HEY!!!! Jesus best frined was a prostitute...and at the risk of sounding blasphemous(I know I do), if he fell in love with her, he would marry her...I have no doubt about this(that's if he hadn't given himself up for us)...and her virginity wouldn't even cross his mind.....ask yourself if he would really consider it even an important factor to marriage or a relationship if she was a virgin or not....<br><br>Besides, In those days, people got married when they were 11....and virginity is ALLabout ownership(as Purr has stated so clearly)...it is a concept created by men.  They just wanted to be the first one to jump the womans bones....It's an ego thing..it had nothing to do with any religios reasonings...i refuse to believe it...even if the bible told me so, i would choose to somehow misread it....I for one am not going to ever beleieve that the bible wanted us to be so superficial.<br><br>And virginity is not the biggest most valued thing that a woman can give a husband...Goddamn it!!!!! I want her trust and understanding more than i want her sex!!!!  and sex is damn important to me!!!If she gave me her virginity and not her heart what the hell...might as well not even get married in the first place.  It's not even that great doing it with a virgin anyway...they are too dry and constricted and it's gosh darn painful to stick it in when she's like that (2 girlfriends I slept with were virgins)....and it has nothing to do with whether she was experienced or not...It's just physically painful...Now i know why guys like to screw virgins...(sorry being crude cuz it's late)....IOt definately is an ego thing!!!  Being the first guy to make her pop her cherry...yeah, makes the guy feel like a real man...yeah, it boosts the guys ego because he's so good that he can get a virgin to give it to him...and no I never felt like this...This is how I think guys feel...and they may hide it beneath whatever explanations and excuses they make up, but I somehow know it to be like this...There is no other explanation that anyone has ever given me that even comes close to making feel satisfied (pun intended and not intended!...)...hahah:-)...and we must remember that religion was a guys club back then...women weren't part of it...beleiev u me...just knowing that I don't need to say anymore...<br><br>And also for guys who can't tahun the thought of their future wife sleeping with other guys, it usually has something to do with their own emotional immaturity...Yes there is a difference between being emotionally mature and intellectually mature...maturity will ultimately bring about acceptance and understanding.<br><br>I thought we were all equal in the eyes of the lord...i refuse to believe that the guy can sleep around and the girl cannot...in my eyes, I will never ever look down on girls who sleep around...unless they do it for really fucked up reasosn..like to spite people....AS my GF as often told me, she feels uncomfortable with me hanging around my gal friends because they are all so slutty...hahah:-)...Like I said, it doesn't matter to me....maybe you all might think that I am just an open perosn, but I would like to think that it has something to do with my maturity more than anything else.<br><br>Hell, i advocate that if you want to sleep around, it's your perogative....If you sleep with people for pleasure then fine.  If you enjoy it it's no sin...just make sure that you take responsibilty for it...many people don't bother with repsonsibilities to themselves or the other person...<br><br>To hell with people who talk...It's your life what.  What right do they have to talk about you or judge you...<br><br>Shit I can go on and on about this...I haven't even gotten started yet...but I't gotten really long already so I think i should stop...Ok so it's an essay on my own personal opinions based on myself...but why not...It's as good example as any.<br><br>To Ah_nic...sorry man....I hope you don't take this post as anti AH_nic...I post this to everyone and noone ...just voicing my opinion....like talking to myself again...:-)<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 26-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its wrong and impossible for us to conclude whether Jesus wants her wife to be a virgin or not. Theres no way of knowing. Different ppl look at things in different perspective. Its unreasonable to conclude that Jesus dun mind from ur own perspective cos u are not him, so u will not know how he thinks and most impt of all, ur values, perspective.... etc are not universal. A society consist of many different individual who think differently but we cannot juz use the perspective of one of them as the norm and use it to judge the other ppl. Some of u ppl might think that virginity is not the most impt thing, but some other ppl might think otherwise and its, again unreasonable to force ur thinking on them.<br><br>Maybe some guys want their wifes to be virgins cos they want to be the first or satisfy the ego or something. But not all those who support virginity wants their spouse to be virgins cos of that reason. They see it as the greatest gift that can give, as a sign of trust, to their partner. They want to be their future spouse only. This isn't wrong. Its wrong to assume guys want virgins so that we can inflict pain on them and satisfy our ego. Have it ever occured to anyone that the guy believes in purity where the his wife is his only, and he is his wife only.<br><br>Abt having sex will make u mature..... I dun believe in this. You dun need sex to know how a girl think. In fact(based on the girls ard me ie my classmates, frens ....), i dun think they want the guys to use sex to understand them. There are other better methods. Abt sex will open ur perspective, i dun think it will open any perspective (again this is different for different ppl)<br><br>Well of u guys dun mind, what abt ur exgfs? Do they mind. Someone of them might have done it with u cos they think u are the one, when u 2 broke up, its will be a tragic for them. Dun look from ur perspective only, spare a thought for the others.<br><br>SOme girls did it cos they feel taht the guy is the one and they have the committment to do it. They might be thinking that hes the one she is going to marry, but in the end they broke up...... some committment huh.....<br>Virginity is something once u lose it, u lose it forever. Some girls might then say taht they virginity is not impt not because they dun believe in it but cos they lost it and they might feel disadvantaged, but actually deep down in their heart, they are wishing they have never done it before with their ex. ( again this dun applies to all girls, and no offence to anyone.)<br><br>So the main thing is even u dun mind having pre-marital sex but what abt ur gf. The most impt thing i think for the girl is whether they will regret it. They might one day meet a very nice guy(someone who they think is fantastic and most impt of all, hes the one.)<br>and the guy believe in virginity. Then the girl how.....<br><br>I dun like ppl( both guys and girls) who sleep ard( one nite stand etc), there are ppl out there who thinks the same way too and there are ppl who dun feel the same way.<br>Like i say, it really depends on how u look at sex, as something holy that should only be done btw spouses or juz something to have fun with. Whether which one is correct, or are both correct or both wrong.... its highly controversial. BTW i'm not a christian or some religious prig. I'm juz an ordinary guy u can find on the street.<br><br>Mind<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For a while, I was wondering if I'll ever be the only one to post long messages in this thread. Good, we're finally getting some debate     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>First off, fading star, you shouldn't be separating people into 'pro choice and pro wild thing b4 the big M'. Calling somebody 'wild' is to judge from your own standards, so it is an unfair tag. Also, it doesn't mean that non virgins sleep around for the thrill or conquest. There are those who do it with love and committment.<br><br>Mind, you said:<br>"SOme girls did it cos they feel taht the guy is the one and they have the committment to do it. They might be thinking that hes the one she is going to marry, but in the end they broke up...... some committment huh....."<br><br>Breaking up doesn't necessarily mean there was no commitment. Sometimes, it may just be wiser to split or you'll end up killing each other over your differences.<br><br>Also, marriage certificates are no guarantee that there is commitment. Some couples are just not ready to work things out together, i.e. commit, so they divorce in two years.<br><br>Also, even when you try your hardest to work things out,  there may still be some differences that a piece of paper, i.e. marriage certificate, cannot gloss over. Commitment just means that you try to smoothe over the differences, it doesn't guarantee that everything will definitely turn out OK. So how then is marriage different from a relationship with love and commitment?<br><br>Mind, it's nice of you to worry about the girls who've lost their virginity to their bfs. But it's really their choices to make (unless of course, they've been raped). If they decide on their course of life, then they, and nobody else, is responsible for the consequences. If they haven't thought clearly about the issue first, it's wrong of them to blame you or anyone else.<br><br>And you are only seeing it from your perspective. To you, women losing their virginity before marriage is tragic. But has it occured to you that they may not think it is? In fact, they may even think they've gained from the experience.<br><br>And really, conservative people tend to marry conservative people, so you shouldn't worry too much.<br><br>Fading star, I really hope people can rationalise their choices. Even though I dun think virginity is very important, I dun condemn those who do as prudes. No matter what you decide or value, I feel that you should have given some thought to it first.<br><br>I'll also like to know how you can be certain that you've found the one you've been saving your virginity for, the one true love. It's difficult, almost impossible to know, unless you look back in time when you're nearing the end of your life. Even marriage is no guarantee; some marriages are really mistakes that shouldn't have taken place.<br><br>And is there really such a thing as one true love? If there is, does that mean the ideal thing to do is to either (1) marry your first gf/bf (2) or denounce your exes as people you've never had feelings for?<br><br>Fading star, could you also PLEASE have the courtesy to read the previous messages before posting? This is not a forum catered for you ONLY, you know.<br><br>And nobody owes anyone any explaination. I hope that in the future, should anyone ask others to share their experiences, he/she would so so with politeness, not sarcasm or condescension.<br><br>I feel that my sexual experience has helped me gain insight into life and love. It forced me to decide what is important to me, so I have grown as a person. I dun necessarily understand men better, but I certainly understand more about relationships and what I want in life. (For those who hadn't bothered to read the previous postings, I've alredi posted some of the insights I've gained.)<br><br>Of course, you can learn about life and love without giving away your virginity. As long as you've read up on the issue and thought hard about it, you'll pick up some things too. But most of us don't spend our free time on deep reflective thoughts, unless we've been confronted with an issue.<br><br>And let's face it, people learn more from wrong decisions than right ones. Even if both decisions are 'right', you learn more from experiences that are more painful.<br><br>More importantly, I feel that I have gained a wider perspective. You take more things into consideration, instead of insisting on one thing to the exclusion of other factors. If you've never been made to think about the RELATIVE importance of some things, you'll never learn much about life.<br><br>And having experienced so much, be it bliss or heartache, I feel I can handle things better emotionally. I dun think that it's the end of the world when things dun work out. You just learn to move on. This, I feel, is an important skill to have in life.<br><br>Okay, getting tired of typing. Before I end off, I'll just like to say that it is to each his own. For every person who values viginity, there will be another who doesn't.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 26-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purr ... I admired your views in this issue of virginity. Althought our views r totally anti one another, we had certainly answered a few taboo questions. But i felt that u have gone too far as to insult my religion, that is Christianity. In your few replies, u have gone further and further into insulting my religion. Dont u feel ashame when u kept hinting to us that u r a liberal person but yet here u r insulting people's religion. Let me refresh your memory with your extract.<br><br>[Ah Nic, you are not just a religious prig. You are the worst form of religious prig. It is alright to hold your religious beliefs close to yourself. But to carve out them in stone and be unable to give a good reason why they should be upheld other than MY RELIGION SAID SO is laughable. From what logic or experience are you speaking from? Oft times, many religious beliefs oversimplify and ignore reality. Some are simply bigoted.You are the type that really discourage me from becoming a Christian. If St. Peter's prejudice against women were to be accpeted without question, then religion does more harm than good]<br><br></div>
