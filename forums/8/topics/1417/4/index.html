            <div class='col-md body'>Ocean,<br><br>You said that the guy is to decide for his gf what her self-interests are. Even if she is sure she wants to do it, the guy must be prepared for the contingency that she will regret becos virginity is unreturnable. Given this way of thinking, it's hard to see that you have a high opinion of women's maturity levels. If she decides something, who are you to tell her what is in her better interests? What kind of credit are you giving her if you always think you know better? If I have misintrepretd you, please feel free to correct me.<br><br>BTW, if you are protecting a person, you decide for her. But if you are guiding a person, you give her informed advice and let her decide for herself. I believe you are advocating the former.<br><br>Good of you not to take advantage of the situation. We need more people like you.<br><br>But again and again, we come back to the same points (1) It's hard to generalise (2) It's idiotic (I still insist on the word) to do something- anything- thoughtlessly. Yes, there are more mature and less mature people around; while credit is to be given to the former, the latter group has to be guided. Can we stop going round and round?<br><br>For me, it's very impt to do the right things for the RIGHT REASONS. If a guy is an MCP, I wouldn't want to be with him even if he offers me protection. Who would protect me from him?? With his mindset, I'll probably become his prisoner. So the distinction between MCP and SNAG is very impt to me when it comes to his reasons for prizing virginity.<br><br>Again, this is not a personal attack directed at you.<br><br>You said:<br>"On the point on true love, my belief is that it's a feeling that cannot be expressed in words. Hence that's my personal belief, and I strongly worded it to highlight my point. Did I pass any judgement on the topic? I didn't."<br><br>Again, I ask you to clarify what you mean by 'the crap that is written down is "true love" is a complete insult to true love'.  What are you referring to as 'crap'? It seemed to me that you are asking people not to condemn something while you yourself are doing the opposite. Can you please clarify.<br><br>Ocean, I understand the part about not doing something you know is not right. But what about something where there is no definite right or wrong? I believe that this is the case here. How do we solve the dilemna?<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 27-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mind, I think u misread my point about sex and getting over failed relationships.<br><br>What I meant was what purr has said...that my relationships with sex has taught me to accept better the failed  relationships...I have never and will never sleep with someone just to ease the pain of something....:-) sorry I might have phrased it wrongly in my earlier statement...:-)...just saying that getting so close and intimate with a person you love makes the pain so much more damaging, but eventually when you do get over it, It's a great forced emotional growth and you learn to accept it a lot more readily and easier...unless ur a really foolish person who dun see anything of value, good or bad, from break-ups...:-)<br><br>God this thread is hot Ah_nic...:-)<br><br>the thing about papers and marriage....just an example is my parents...they never got married officially or otherwise...they just told each other that they loved each other and dun need a government body or piece of paper to tell them so....and so Love and commitment is more than just marriage.  In an ideal world, love and marriage is like this, but in the real world, many people get married for many different reasons the least of which would be love and commitment...<br><br>My thinking has also been that I would prefer a girl who has some experience of the world, sexually or otherwise because I fear and from my previous experience have discovered, is that after a couple of years with you, no matter how much they might love you, they will feel this need to see what other people are like...They become curious like hell and it nags at them until they actually try it...of course some people don't have the guts or heart to do it, but many do and I would rather have my wife be experienced already so that it doesn't arise during the relationship and maybe destroy it....<br><br>about trying to avoid regret...many people, I would dare to say most people, usually do things that they know is wrong or will fail...but for some reason they do it any way...why?....Again it is idealistic to think that people won't do things just because they know they will regret...besides most of the time you won't kow you're going to regret until after it happens...whether you considered it beforehand or not.<br><br>When people tell me that I can't do something or shouldn't do it because it's doomed to failure...i do it anyway because I need to find out myself, or else it nags at me day and night...and if not it will keep resurfacing someway somehow...<br><br>And I tend to think that most women don't see their losing their virginity before marriage as a sign of great regret unless they are super conservative in the first place...I think that most women who've had sex (b4 marriage)would list losing their virginity as not being on the top of their list of regrets...I am sure that there are more things in a persons life that people regret moer than their virginity....that's speaking for women who do regret losing it....<br><br>Mind, Somehow I get the feeling that you think that women rate their virginity as the most important thing in their life...and losing it becomes a great burden of regret...I tend to think otherwise...like I said above...they may regret but not to that extent that it is a burden...But we won't really know as we are guys...we would have to go and ask women from different levels of society to find out what they think...and keep in mind that the answers you get would most likely be answers that are "safe" for the face of the woman giving it...our society here, as we know, is still a conservative one...so even info gained from them might be a facade anyway...the best way is to have close gal friends and colleagues who trust you...ask them.....<br><br>anyway, I wouldn't say half of the things I say if I hadn't talked to girls I know before anyway....The advantages of having a lot of gal friends...hahahah:-)....just not good when you know none of them want you...:-)<br><br>But yeah...we can't really speak on their behalf though...in the end it's their thoughts and beliefs that matter most in this topic...ours would be considered "supporting arguements and beliefs..."<br><br>:-)<br><br>one other thing...some of the posts are beginning to take on a very heated exchange of attacks...uh...calm down people....breath...in...out....breath....It's just a discussion...relax....take it easy....:-)<br><br>Ok...now flame me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh, okie, how comes another long reply.<br><br>Mind, you didn't read my posting carefully. I didn't say that all guys who believe in virginity are MCPs. I'm saying that guys who IMPOSE their ideas of virginity are.<br><br>About the point about regrets, please look at the last point in my last posting. In fact, all the points I've raised in that can also be directed to you.<br><br>Anyway, I dun believe that regrets can mar your life UNLESS YOU LET THEM. If you always insist on seeing the negative and to value one thing to the exclusion of the others, then your life is really sad. I hope nobody will live this way. As you yourself has pointed out, "All I wanted to say is do look at things from different angles, have a wider perspective and you'll be able to look at the picture clearly, and appreciate the painting better." We shouldn't miss the forest for the trees.<br><br>You keep saying that the second guy will mind- but just look at the majority views here. Most people are saying that they want to keep themselves virgins but they won't mind- in fact, it's childish to mind- that your spouse isn't one. Thanks for your concern but I think it's misplaced in this day and age.<br><br>Okie, some WOULD mind but it is still not a decision you can make for your ex-gf. It's her life, you should respect that she *would* know better.<br><br>You said u can't agree with this statement, "Let's also agree that it is REALLY idiotic for a person not to consider the issues carefully before she does it."<br><br>The reason you gave is that 'many impulsive decisions are made and they are followed by deep regrets'. So we should all jump and make impulsive decisions- like giving away your virginity without thoughts of possible regret? Aren't you contradicting yourself?<br><br>About the part that sex sells in movies- do you know the same ideas are found in literary giants which dun sell but are still widely respected? Just to name some authors- D.H. Lawrence, John Donne, George Sand (can't remeber her real name)<br><br>And yes, this view is extremely idealistic, even naive:<br>"before a couple step into marriage, they usually will consider it very carefully, much more careful when they decide whether to enter a bgr. So in this case, there will a greater chance that it will work out fine."<br><br>Some people marry within a few days. Others are just so used to the relationship, they just get married without thinking about it seriously.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 27-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How would anyone know if they will regret not having a taste of other kinds of relationship years down the road? When you're married, it's too late to do anything becos you know it's wrong to have an affair. But your mind keeps running in circles, frustrating the hell out of you. Let's face it- every marriage will hit a lull at some point; it even has an official name,  'seven year itch'. If you've known how worse it could have been than the simple 'marriage boredom', you won't be tempted AT ALL becos you know you have something more precious. No amount of intellectual logic will influence you as much as what you know in your heart.<br><br>How can you truly settle down until you've gotten up to some mischief before?<br><br>It's not an excuse to do anything you like, it's just foretelling human nature. That's why I prefer a more experienced guy.<br><br>Anyway, to cool down this thread, let me recycle a joke:<br><br>Ma and Pa are sitting on the porch swing one<br>evening enjoying the warm breeze and the night sounds. Suddenly, for no reason at all, Ma hauls off and slaps Pa up side the head so hard he falls off the swing. Dazed, Pa gets up and asks, 'What the hell was that for?'<br><br>To which Ma replies, 'That's for 20 years of bad sex!' Pa says nothing and gets back on the swing. About 5 minutes of silence later, he hauls off and slaps Ma up side the head equally hard. Ma gets up dazed and asks, 'What was that for?'<br><br>To which Pa replies, 'That's for knowing the damn difference!'<br><br>Disclaimer: this joke is meaningless and not meant to be a personal attack on anyone. Been getting so much gunfire for things I thot were neutral that I better put this up   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 27-12-1999).]</div>

There's no right or wrong in his choice, as long as he is true to himself. If she wants to do it, he doesn't, then don't do it. It's an agreement between two parties, if one party isn't agreeing to it, then nothing will take place.<br>"Given this way of thinking, it's hard to see that you have a high opinion of women's maturity levels."<br>I think this is a personal attack on me. If you've misinterpreted my posts, please clarify with me before launching groundless attacks. I've never looked down on the opposite sex.<br>If both parties feel that they're ready, I would respect their decision. If one party feels that either party isn't ready, he/she will have to say no to stop it. What I'm trying to highlight is to stop the whole episode from happening rather than to regret later. Sometimes decisions are made on impulse. Even wise men make mistakes. Hence, it's up to the clear-headed one to prevent the tragedy from happening.<br><br>"If she decides something, who are you to tell her what is in her better interests?"<br>If I reject, can she force me? If yes, there isn't anymore faith in the relationship.<br>When two parties disagree, they would have to talk and find out what's the problem. Communication is the basic fundamental to keep the relationship alive.<br>"What kind of credit are you giving her if you always think you know better?"<br>When have I ever said I always think I know better? As mentioned in the previous point, they would have to thrash out the problem themselves to see who is the muddled-up one.<br><br>"BTW, if you are protecting a person, you decide for her. But if you are guiding a person, you give her informed advice and let her decide for herself. I believe you are advocating the former."<br><br>I think this point is wrong again.

And if you're using crap to proclaim it's true love, you're insulting it.<br>This is what I believe, and I didn't say that anyone must agree with what I say.<br>If you feel strongly that words is adequate, and it's true enough for you, then it's no longer crap, and hence no longer an insult.<br>I did not condemn anything.<br>purr-Please, clarify first before jumping to conclusions.<br><br>"Ocean, I understand the part about not doing something you know is not right.

Hence my point on doing things that you feel is right, others opinions doesn't matter, what matters is you yourself.<br>firewire's post has triggered off some thoughts on my mind. Sometimes, people do something that they know they'll regret, but they still do it anyhow. It might be because they're unable to find a good solution to their problems, the choice of regret chosen is the least regretful among all the possible options they could think of, and hence they chose it. However, as I mentioned before, no one is prefect, someone might be able to see the problem better from his/her angle, and provide a better solution for him/her. But should the person help? Especially when it involves some sacrifice on his/her part? Hence my point on "His/her regrets, might be your regrets too." Sometimes, the effects are direct, sometimes it's indirect.<br>When destiny lies in your hand, what should you do?<br><br>"How would anyone know if they will regret not having a taste of other kinds of relationship years down the road?"<br><br>Depends on the individual. To re-quote my friend from an earlier posting, "It is better to not hold any hands than to hold many hands and not find the hand you wanted to hold forever." It's his belief and he wanted it that way, 'cos he feels this is right for him. If he's able to stick to his principles for life, I believe it's admirable. He feels that he's able to remain faithful to only one and stick with her throughout the whole journey. The word "tempt" doesn't exist in his dictionary. Can you fault him? Or does he deserve our respect?<br>Although considered as rare species, they do exist.<br><br>"If you've known how worse it could have been than the simple 'marriage boredom', you won't be tempted AT ALL becos you know you have something more precious. No amount of intellectual logic will influence you as much as what you know in your heart."<br>True, when you've been through so much, you would know how to appreciate things better. Hence, it's important to uphold your own values. Do what you know best is for you.<br><br>Hope all of you would find the right one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm back!!!! Hehehe gd news or bad news hehe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hmmmm is this the hottest topic ever?<br>82 threads ....... 83 if u include this post.<br><br>Virginity....... a highly controversial topic. Like i always said, there are many different individuals out here in this world.<br>None of us can use our perspective as the norm to judge the rest. Everyone has his/her own choice. Each to his/her own. However, sex is something which not only involves the guy or the girl alone, it concerns them as well as their future partners.<br><br>True we shouldn't let regret mar our lives. But sometimes we can't help it, cos it weigh too heavily. Abt the lost of virginity as the top regret, if u really want to analyse it, well the time factor could actually come into play. When the couple breaks up, the girl regrets, the deepness of regret depends on the girl herself, some will take it easier, while some take it harder. Then another guy comes into picture. The girl falls deeply in him, the feeling for this guy is much more stronger than her feelings for her ex when they are together. To her, he is everything. One problem.... the guy believe in virginity... Then the girl will regret it by a lot more at this moment.<br>The future is always unknown. This applies not only to this topic but to other things as well. Yah regrets might make a person wiser, but its not nice to have them. That is why u see ppl who have done something wrong advising ppl who are likely to commit the same mistake not to make them.<br>We can't juz dump ppl aside juz cos they made the wrong decisions.<br><br>Seven yr itch..... to me its juz another name for temptation.... Its not correct,and quite naive, to say that cos the person has tried it before and will therefore be faithful to his/her future spouse. The fault doesn't lies in whether the person in question is experienced or not. It lies in his/her ability to resist temptation. If he/she finds it hard to resist temptation, he/she will still be unfaithful to his/her future life partner regardless whether the person is a virgin or not. I agree with ocean when he( a guy rite?) on the part where tempt does not exist in his dictinary.<br><br>Ppl are different therefore we have different views. But juz wanna say, if the bf want to have sex, pls spare a thought for the future of the girl( esp if she is still a virgin). The girl also, pls consider it very carefully. Its her own body, we can't stop her but what we can do is to tell her the potential problems and regrets. Some girls might have considered it very carefully, but there are always a lot of girls out there who regretted it. According to a survey, 50% of the ppl living here wants<br>their future spouse to be virgins. I'm sorry if i sound crude or sexist( i dun mean it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) but girls are disadvantaged ( again this is my view, u might or might not agree with me) as there is a tell tale sign. So think very careful before u do it girls. U only got one virginity per life time ( is there life after death hehehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> juz a thought )<br><br>Again this is my personal views. I have no right to force it on any of u, i can only try to make u see the pt and hopefully u agree with it. Anyway, no offence to anyone. If i have offended anyone, i'm sincerely sorry. To be honest, thru out this discussion or flaming if u wanna call it taht way, i have never been angry. I try not to make any personal attacks but if i did, i'm sorry. * holding out the olive* U have ur view pts and i have mine, both can be correct or both wrong.<br><br>Mind<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ocean,<br><br>I'm making a personal attack on you??? ha, ha....<br><br>Personal attack = "You are a pig."<br>Disagreement = "Your IDEAS are like that of a pig's."<br><br>Let's recap, I said:<br>"It's hard to see that you have a high OPINION of women's maturity levels."<br><br>I'm disagreeing with what I see as your opinions/ideas. I'm NOT calling you an MCP. You're over-reacting- again.<br><br>Yes, any decision that will affect both people in a relationship should be made jointly. What I am saying that it is unfair of you or anybody else to think you can decide for another person what's best for her. And I'm also VERY sure that I've said, "If I have misintrepretd you, please feel free to correct me" in my last posting, right after these points. Go check.<br><br>You're basically agreeing with me on the point that decisions should be made jointly, so can we stop going round and round?<br><br>Okie, the point about crap. 'Crap' is a word used to condemn. And I asked you to clarify. I have NEVER jumped to any conclusions.<br><br>Ocean, you seem to take everything I say very negatively. But I have been giving you the benefit of doubt all the time; you just refuse to see it.<br><br>You say we are going round and round becos I keep misinterpreting you. My opinion is that you take everything too sensitively and jump on everything, even things that are meant to be neutral.<br><br>Now about your friend who doesn't believe in the word 'temptation'. Hats off to him if he never experiences it.<br><br>However, the practical side of me doesn't believe it. It's possible not to succumb to temptation; but it's impossible not to feel any temptation at all. And despite your good faith, your human nature can get the better of you. I remember that in my first relationship, I loved the guy so much that I tried too hard to please. I didn't mind doing things that hurt me (i.e. have lousy sex) just as long as it pleased him. And I never looked at another guy. And he did the same, in his own ways. But we did everything all wrong; it was becos we tried too hard that we killed off the relationship. There was so much underlying unhappiness that my mind began to rebel against my will and started to wander. I try to be idealistic, but I also believe in being realistic when it comes to how everything works.<br><br>Nonetheless, I still wish your friend the best of luck.<br><br>Okie, time for a break....<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 28-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mind,<br><br>you cannot become wiser without making mistakes or regretting something first. Yup, regrets aren't nice to have. But it's really both (wisdom and regrets) or nothing at all.<br><br>And for such regrets, it's easier to understand with the heart than the head. After all, they are lessons on matters of the heart. No matter what others tell you, the lesson will not resonate or have much meaning until you've had experience in it.<br><br>And that's what I meant when I talked about truly settling down. Of course, it's wrong to say that everybody who has been wild in their youth will be faithful later on. There are some people who will never learn anything. But there is a lesson to be learnt nonetheless. My experiences in sex has taught me what to value and that certain things are harder to come by than others. That's why faithfulness has a heck of a lot more meaning for me now than a platitude that was repeated to me over and over again by family, friends, and teachers. I believe I have more will power to resist temptation because I've had first-hand experience that sex with another person will not rejunevate my life miraculously ( the delusion that drives many people to affairs) and it's all really a matter of working things out with your partner.<br><br>I've also been thinking: so far, the argument is for guys not to have sex with their gfs in case they dun end up together. How about the case of a guy giving up his virginity to a girl who's alredi lost hers? Assuming that they use contracpetives, is it still wrong?<br><br>BTW, I dun think there's anything wrong with arguing. So far, I disagree with many of the points, but I've never thought of anybody in a bad way. One or two bad points doesn't condemn a person totally.<br><br>I've never meant to make any personal attacks and I'm sick of defending myself all the time. If I've aggrieved anyone, I sincerely apologize. *Peace*<br><br></div>

I'm finding it amusing, 'cos all I did was try to make my side of story clearer to you. And I don't know why you brought up the point on MCP again. Sorry, but did I say I'm offended by any MCP statement you brought up? I've stated pretty clearly that it doesn't really matter. But what I can say for sure is no one likes to be called a pig. Hence my call for more tact.

Perhaps you could seek for clarification in a more tactful way.<br><br>Take for example, "It seemed to me that you are asking people not to condemn something while you yourself are doing the opposite."<br>This isn't really a neutral statement as there is a certain degree of sarcasm involved. Perhaps you could phrase it into something like, "Could you please explain further as you seemed to contradict yourself with that statement?"<br><br>I'm not jumping on everything you said, but I felt you've made a few generalising points which I feel I should correct.<br><br>Hope I've cleared the air now.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ocean,<br><br>hahahahaha.... even examples I use to illustrate a point is seen as a personal attack. I didn't call you a pig lah.

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm....this thread is still here. this prob means one of two things: (i) ppl in general don't listen and accept other opinions very well or (ii) ppl just love to talk and forward their views and can do so as long as their hearts are beating. or maybe it means both. by adding to this thread, i will be promoting the latter but hopefully not be accused of the former. whatever it is, ppl seem to want to convince and to be heard and acknowledged. human nature at its most expressive, vain and stubborn, i guess. mind and ocean have said many things that were on my mind (no pun intended). and i have also learnt some things from firewire and purr. not all of these things are entirely new but what came thru most strongly was the force of their convictions.<br><br>like firewire, i'm beginning to dread reading this thread cos the posts are so darn long. and i will be guilty of adding another long one. but after thinking abt things a while, it seems to me that everyone is really on the same side. they acknowledge the good and bad points of their own position but yet would want to place an emphasis on certain things that they feel would set their ideas apart.<br><br>what i have found in common (the reason i say we're all on the same side) is the belief that everyone should do what they feel is right after careful consideration.<br><br>the disagreement seems to be mainly abt the degree to which someone should be allowed to decide something for themselves and to be responsible for those actions/decisions. some ppl feel that the individual has sole and sovereign right to their own decisions. others feel that a certain degree of paternalism or guidance or protectiveness is necessary and, indeed, is the path to a higher good.<br><br>now this is where i want to bring the issue of religion in again. much maligned as it has been in recent times, i want to suggest a role for it in our lives and see if there would be any violent objections to this way of conceiving the role of religion.<br><br>a breather is in order at this point in time. and that is the purpose of this intermediate paragraph. why a breather? cos religion has become a dirty word these days. and it has been equated with dogmatism and cast aside as unworthy of serious attention. anyone reading that i want to talk abt religion, and has such a view of the role of religion in our lives, would thereby prematurely have judged the rest of my post by the sheer force of negative emotion elicited by the word "religion". to forestall such judgement, i feel it is necessary to say where i'm coming from.<br><br>first of all, i am not a religious person, at least not traditionally defined. while it has often been said that blind faith in the edicts of a religion is something to be overcome, and that the world we live in today is testimony to that spirit of questioning and overcoming, i want to suggest what kind of a world has emerged as a result of this way of thinking. and many of you would have guessed it.<br><br>today, in our world of scepticism and reason and self-assigned maturity, we feel that this way of questioning and thinking and believing is not only preferable to the old (religious) ways of faith and unreflective acceptance, but that it is immeasurably superior. maybe we really have grown up. maybe part of growing up is the uncertainty and responsibility that come with having to decide your own fate and destiny. after all, if you can't bring yourself to believe in some religion, you must then create your own values and your own notions of right and wrong.<br><br>my question then is this: have we now found ourselves in a new kind of dogmatism? where questioning, probing and doubting are the new forms of religion, the new (and unquestioned) edicts for today?<br><br>while many ppl find the move beyond religion as faith into the realm of self-made values (what else would you call an ethic based on the credo: "do it if it doesn't go against your conscience"?) a liberating experience, many ppl have already begun questioning the legitimacy of this latter-day realm as the final resting place from which we should find eternal peace and happiness. in other words, what makes us think this modern day disdain for faith and religion is really a progression and not an unfortunate but necessary digression, that should itself be overcome?<br><br>now, let me make this point clear. it is not at all easy for me to make this proposal of mine coherent, let alone convincing. and the reason why is simple. for all of you who have been posting or the onlookers who have been taking sides - each of you has already, thru these posts, built up the strength of conviction in your own views. now i ask of you what is infinitely harder - try arguing the best case you can AGAINST your own point of view. if you can honestly do that, i think you would have gained a lot more than what you have so far. in other words, rather than congratulating ourselves for having the courage of our convictions, we should instead see if we have the courage for an attack on our convictions. while convictions help define us as a person, convictions are (equally) prisons from which we should seek to break free.<br><br>so the task i have set for myself is to try to argue against what i am most naturally inclined to feeling and thinking. just for the heck of it. hopefully it helps build character. haha!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> as you may have noticed, many of my posts are heuristic. i guess i was just born that way. okay, enuf self-aggrandizement, let's proceed wif the argument proper.<br><br>what i hope to show is that the psychology behind religion is essentially paternalistic. religion aims to take care of the weakest members of society, and to do so by telling them certain dos and don'ts. now this is not at all new. we have already noted that the more "mature" can fight and stand up for themselves while the "less mature" need to be protected or guided or whatever. now the reason why i question self-legislated values is simple. it's the same reason a hundred politicians, philosophers and religious teachers would tell you. it is dangerous to the social and civil order. to say, "do it if it doesn't go against your conscience", is really in effect to say, as dostoevsky did, "if god is dead, then everything is allowed".<br><br>now surely, our detractors would say, losing your virginity isn't going to endanger the social and civic order, is it? aren't we over-reacting? but the point of course is not abt whether virginity (or the lack thereof) would have such cataclysmic effects. the point is the kind of effect thinking along the lines of "to each his own" would have. in fact even the supporters of virginity have said: "to each his own". but in thinking like this we are assuming that human nature is essentially good and non-destructive and that we are aware and have good knowledge of what is in the best interests of mankind as a whole.<br><br>religion tells us otherwise. my thesis (it's starting to look like one) is that the edicts behind religion, far from being simplistic pronouncements of a different (and irrelevant) historical and cultural order, are really crystallisations of age-old and unchanging verities abt the nature of the human animal. religions are consequentialist and utilitarian. the edicts of religion forestall the consequences that would befall mankind when certain ways of thinking (the ways of thinking equated with the self-legislation of values) are accepted. and these ways of thinking bring with it chaos and social disintegration. why? because human nature is such that we cannot be left to our own devices. does it show a mistrust in human reason? yes. does it show a lack of faith in our ability to steer our own way in the wake of our disbelief in god?  very prob so.<br><br>but why should we have such faith in human judgement when we have, all thru the millennia, repaid that faith so poorly? instead of looking at the bible and seeing stories of how disbelief in god has brought abt tragedy, let's reinterpret that in a humanistic manner. the tragedy and the wars and suffering were brought abt not because of disbelief in god but because of a rejection of what religion stands for - a certain way of thinking that leaves little room for saying, "i'll do this as long as my conscience doesn't prick me".  there is a secret code within religions that we have forgotten. the importance of this code is not that it sets down the specifics of what not to do but rather that it covers the whole range of possible areas where human beings are likely to fark up. the secret code tells what will happen if we let this or that action slide past us as morally irrelevant. in other words, it purports to foresee the consequences of what we cannot in our limited wisdom foretell. the bible is after all written over many many years and is the repository of much human wisdom. (there is a flaw with my thesis at this point. but that's for me to know and for you to discover. but it is not a fatal flaw because the spirit of my thesis is unaffected by it).<br><br>now at this point in time, the strong and the mature may cry foul. what the heck! i'm strong enuf for it. making my own decisions. but if the others are not, i understand. maybe religion works for them because it protects them but not for me cos i can take care of myself. if you've been carefully following my thesis at all, you'd know why this line of reasoning doesn't work. religion purports to foresee the long-term consequences of what we cannot.<br><br>but wait a second, we all know that preachers and religious leaders know that the bible is open to debate and interpretation. so nothing is certain yet. why can't i act my own way?<br><br>but that's precisely what religion is on my view. it is a human construct designed to end all debate (at least for the less questioning). cos if you keep debating, at which point will you stop and start believing? you won't. you'd do things your own way. and that, we are told, is the seed to our own undoing. religion is therefore the greatest tool for social unity that you can have (tho human beings, prob thinking from their own interests, have screwed the spirit and intent of religion up).<br><br>while religious leaders debate at their own level, they will never tell us (the lay-ppl)abt their debates. becos for them, debate does not foreclose belief. for many of us, it does. and religion tells us, remember, that disbelief leads ultimately to ruin.<br><br>now you use this and you apply it to this topic. the kind of thinking that is being advocated these days. this topic is just one variant of it. perhaps sleeping around is seen as leading to more unhappinness and pain than not doing so. perhaps it is seen as allowing moral standards to fall and to be cheapened and devalued. perhaps in the long term the social fabric of society is threatened. but here we are too concerned abt what it means to US to see the greater good, the higher end.<br><br>i think the more mature (and perhaps innately "good", whatever that may mean) ppl will take offence. nobody likes being treated like a child and told what to do. and religion, even tho it knows that the world is uncertain, nevertheless treats us like children and keeps that from us. it tells us instead abt how certain the world of right and wrong is. but perhaps it does so with good reason. to save us from ourselves. perhaps it really does know better than we do. what taking the law into our own hands can lead to - both in our own lives and in the lives of others, all thru millennia.<br><br>i can hear it now. in fact i would say it myself. we should still be allowed to decide for ourselves. but deciding for ourselves isn't what is being devalued. neither are the consequences that we have to take responsibility for and live with. what is at stake is more vital than our own needs and wants and comfort (and perhaps it has been the downfall of religion to take our present interests, our interests TODAY too lightly). what is at stake is the kind of thinking that would best lead (by the law of averages) to the preservation, not destruction, of mankind. and to do that, you can't help but be paternalistic.<br><br>think of it this way: say you have a child right now. how would you want to bring her up in this world? would you have total trust in her ability to not screw herself up, not hurt herself? would you trust in her ability to take care of herself and make her own decisions? or would you not rather want to protect her from whatever hurt or pain or harm or injury, real or imagined? would her pain not hurt you doubly? would you foist your own beliefs on her? or treat her according to what you thought was best for her? would she eventually resent you for that? for what comes most naturally to a mother or a father? - protection. would she blame you for protecting her too much or too little or not blame you at all (the parallels with religion apply - religion wants to protect its ppl.)? how would your experiences now color the way you handle your child?<br><br>for all that you may have said in this thread abt your own feelings, what would you say if your child were to ask you, "daddy/mommy, should i or should i not be a virgin?"<br><br>[This message has been edited by fadingstar (edited 28-12-1999).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by fadingstar (edited 28-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry Fading Star,<br><br>I gave up on your posting less than half-way through. Too long and reflective. Not in the mood of ploughing them through now.<br><br>Let me offer another perspective. Many of the things we have brought up here are matters of the heart, and I feel that they are best understood through the heart.<br><br>Flip through any dictionary or novel and you will get one thousand and one inrterpretations and illustrations of words like 'love', 'jealousy', and 'fidelity'. Does that then mean that you know all about them? No, becos you've ACCEPTED what they stand for, you havn't LEARNT what they really mean. Love, jealously, and fidelity are not what you can get from another's point of view, it's something you find(i.e. learn) for yourself. I can quote you sonnets from Shakespeare but I wouldn't know what love is until I've experienced it.<br><br>Let me stress again, these only apply to matters of the heart.<br><br>This is related to bringing up a child. Experience is a better teacher than I would EVER be, or in fact any kind of teachings could be, becos some things can only be learnt from the heart.<br><br>Of course, this is only case after the child has hit a certain age. Our ability to accept emotional truth increases with maturity. And I believe that by the time my child turns 18, I would have prepared him/her enuff to deal with it. And after he/she turns 18, I would consider him/her an adult whose affairs I should have minimal interference is. I -and other forms of teachings- have taught him/her most of what he can accept in the head, it's time for him/her to discover the world thru the heart.<br><br>And having been a teenager before, I know that the more I try to forbid my child, the more he or she would want to do it. Openess and education are key. At the end of the say, he/she decides for himself/herself, not me or anyone else.<br><br>The gist is, up to a certain age, you should protect and guide the person. After that, you should not because he would not grow up otherwise. He'll always be an observer, never a participant of life.<br><br>In fact, if you try too hard to protect, it can be bad. Despite your best intentions, you stifle and kill the growth of the individual. Another question is- what happens when you are no longer around? Ultimately, that does more harm than good.<br><br>All these apply to religion as well. It is not good to insist on religious paternalism, with its implication of PROTECTION, because it doesn't allow us to really live life. Rather, it should be a form of GUIDANCE geared towards helping us decide how to live.<br><br>So why do we fail again and again to learn from lessons from yore? No matter what they tell you, some, and I stress some, lessons are just better learnt from the heart. You can read the Bible, Shakespeare, Plato and so on and so forth but you never LEARN , as opposed to ACCEPT, without experience. And whatever knowledge passed down through stories and anecdotes is always condensed to one or two moral. But real life situations are more complex. They dun unfold exactly as the stories you learn from and there are so many considerations that one or two moral cannot cover. And when we read the stories, we are bystanders, not participants, so it is so much easier to see clearly. So religious platitudes are important but still limited in application.<br><br>I dun mean that we should question beliefs all the time. I just feel that we should BELIEVE rather than ACCEPT. The difference is that the former comes with some thought on how it all fits together (not the same as debunking it  and rebuilding it from scratch, that is, doubt). And it is the strength of your conviction that helps you INTERPRET the religious platitudes so that they have wider application in life.<br><br>Leading on this point is that experience can be a great source of strength for your beliefs becos it gives you a broader perspective on how everything fits together. Acceptance is a step away from belief, but BLIND acceptance will block off the path to it along with any form of exploration. Another reason why religion should guide, not protect.<br><br>Religion is not under attack. It's just important to distinguish between acceptance and belief, protection and guidance.<br><br>Okay, we are really veering off course. Shall we start a new thread if we are going to talk more about religion?<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 28-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okay i'm gonna keep this short.<br><br>purr - i agree with your perspective too. in fact, how could i not? we're all born in this day and age and the way most of us think these days is just like what you described above. but what i'm wondering is whether or not we have in fact missed out on some things that religion (and the religious way of thinking) has been trying to teach us. i believe there are many lessons (both direct and not-so-direct) that we can learn that perhaps we've forgotten all abt. your (or our) perspective is on the personal and individual and private level. but perhaps religion is interested in the cumulative effect on mankind of (only) thinking on the personal level. so religion serves a higher good to which we are now oblivious.<br><br>the reason why i brought up religion was cos it was mentioned somewhere above. was it ah-nic who was being tekaned like crazy? maybe religion gives us too little credit for our own decisions and for making our own mistakes. maybe it doesn't allow us too much room for experimentation and experience. maybe it forcibly separates the head from the heart. but then maybe we've been too poor readers of the bible also. maybe we've been interpreting it to suit our own ends and needs (and i know there are problems with interpretation). maybe there really is something there if only we'd look hard enuf or were taught properly enuf. perhaps the bible simplifies real life not becos it doesn't know abt it but becos after all is said and done, those few, pithy edicts or platitudes are all it really comes down to. after all the dust has settled, that's what we have. it skirts the complexities of life and teaches us to think simply out of profundity and not because of naivety.<br><br>perhaps we should have a compromise position. yes, it is impt to learn from experience, but equally impt perhaps is what the bible has been trying to tell us all this while (from its own wealth of experience) if only we were better and more reflective readers. maybe the two "perspectives" are really more complementary than opposed.<br><br>to end off (hopefully once and for all), you said "I would have prepared him/her (your child) enuff to deal with it". the thing is, how will you bring her up? with certain edicts and no-nos or by guiding her and then eventually letting her decide? this is impt becos 18 yrs down the road, the way she is brought up would decide whether she would come into a forum like this, take a look at a topic like this and then decide for herself, which side she wants to uphold and believe in. the way you bring her up leaves her with less room for her own decision than you may think. just some food for thought.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sign, Star, will keep this short as I have other work to do.<br><br>First thing first, raising a kid. Of course, up to a certain age, like childhood and early adolescent, she has to live by what I say. But when she grows to the stage where she starts to explore and question life with some depth, like teenage, my greatest responsibility is to help her grow by giving her the widest exposure that I can to different viewpoints, even those opposing my own. And my greatest gift is to help her to think critically. I may have my views but I dun believe in imposing it on anybody else. And if she decides to have a different view, it doesn't mean I will love her less. Up to the age of 18, I'll restrict her activities but give her the greatest freedom of the mind. After 18, she can do what she wants and no matter what happens, I'll be there to support her when she needs it. This is my belief what good parenting should be about.<br><br>About religion. Everybody starts off accepting the teachings. Some progress to be true believers, others don't. So yes, the important thing is to be more reflective in reading the bible.<br><br>But I also believe that there is some built-in allowances. I don't believe that god meant to give us a human nature, then deny us its existence. I believe he meant for us to find our way by ourselves, or he would have intervened in every single bad or unfair act out there. In other words, God does not value BLIND acceptance. The bible is but a guide to help us live life to the fullest, not stop us from doing that by making us adhere to the letter of the word.<br><br>I'm sorry, I'm getting very tired of sitting in front of the computer, doing a lot of deep thinking. Kills a lot of brain cells. I think it's time for others to speak    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>P.S: Orion, was that addressed to me? I meant that EMOTIONAL LESSONS need experience to be absorbed, I'm not saying that this applies to ALL lessons. I believe we have been talking about the emotional aspects rather than the physical aspects of sex alone, haven't we?<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 28-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>purr - agreed to let others speak up. i have other stuff to do too.<br><br>the point abt good parenting is well taken. what i meant, however, is that if you were to bring up your child your way and ocean and mind were to bring their child up their way, then even tho you may think you have brought them up the best way you can so they can make their own informed decisions, you would actually have influenced their choices and outlooks more than you think you have. that's what i mean when i said: "the way you bring her up leaves her with less room for her own decision than you may think".<br><br>even the most open and informed and guided tour thru life already presupposes certain values that are central and that will be passed from generation to generation. to put it bluntly (but hopefully not offensively), i think minds and oceans will beget little minds and oceans and purrs will beget little purrs, each with the same kind of values and thinking as the older mind, ocean and purr. and that effectly means that their "choices" in any real sense of the word have already been decided for them by the kind of upbringing they receive. this, of course, is not to say that they will be carbon-copies of you and that they won't be able to think and feel differently. i just feel that values passed down from our parents have more of an effect on us than we know or perhaps care to acknowledge. which only goes to show the great responsibility we have in our roles as parents, mentors and confidantes.<br><br></div>
