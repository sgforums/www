            <div class='col-md body'>I'm so glad to see that people like Bear, HoneyBunz and Moonice are all for HOTA.<br><br>In my line of work, I've come across several situations where the patients are already brain-dead.  This means that their heart is beating solely because of the medicines we pump into them and that the ventilator is doing all the breathing for them.  Yet, even though they may be very suitable candidates for organ donation, the family often refuses to give their consent.  As a result, organs that could have saved a few lives went to waste.  Say both kidneys, both corneas and the liver could be harvested, that would mean that by one's death, one has helped save or prolong or improve the quality of life of FIVE people.<br><br>I've asked the HOTA staff before and they say that they usually encourage the receipients of the organs to write anonymous Thank You letters to the family of the deceased to let them know how their lives have been transformed due to organ donation.<br><br>The probable reason why HOTA has been made compulsory unless one opts out is because there were too many cases of potential organ donors gone to waste.  Out of say 20 deaths or more, you'd only get one donor.  I think the statistics would show an even measlier percentage.  Which means that there are so many people on the organ waiting list that could have been saved but who lost their opportunity just because families wanted the body whole for burial.  So, the organs can be used to feed worms and what-not but they cannot be used to save a few people's lives??  I think organ donation is one of the most generous and loving acts one can do at the end of one's life and I'm sure it'll result in good things in the afterlife, if you believe in one.<br><br>Muslims are not automatically covered under HOTA and have to opt in due to religious beliefs.  However, I checked with a few doctors and they said that since they don't donate, then when say a Muslim kidney patient needs a kidney transplant, they will not receive priority at all on the waiting list and chances of them actually receiving one will be slim.  Which is kinda fair - you don't give, you don't get.  Most of them get a living relative to donate one of their two kidneys to them.<br><br>Now that HOTA is made legal, we still have families of the deceased giving doctors, nurses, and HOTA staff hell.  There's a lot of the Ugly Singaporean exposed - lots of threats, shouting, yelling, insults hurled every each way and asunder, aggression, etc etc.  We may be educated but sadly when it comes to social responsibility and what-not, we are so lacking.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Hopefully, our generation will slowly change things.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>When I die and the HOTA doctors start harvesting my organs, I'll look down on my body and smile and hope that whoever receives my organs will live a good, fruitful and meaningful life because they have been given a 2nd chance in life.  Embrace HOTA, give the gift of life.</div>
