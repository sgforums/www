            <div class='col-md body'>Dun ever learn from any music schools in Singapore no matter what, trust me, they suck and u end up spending a LOT of money over the years. Most music schools like to teach very little at a time so that they can eventually conduct more lessons which translates to u paying more over the years.<br><br>Self thaught is the best......<br>Let me teach u how:<br><br>Step 1 : Buy a Guitar.<br><br>No need so expensive ones. A $45 acoustic guitar will do. Learn how to fix your own guitar strings by taking out the strings on your guitar and changing into new ones. Its more or less the same as taking out your graphic card in you computer and fixing a new one, its easy. For electric guitar, dismantle your whole guitar so that you know the parts well. Learn how to tune your guitar. I tune my guitar with my Recorder, the one i use during primary school music lessons. Some books will also teach u how to tune your guitar. But if all else fails, buy an electronic guitar tuner.<br><br>Step 2 : Go for Books.<br><br>Guitar books are available anywhere in any good music stores. Try getting begginners's books and books that offers important stuff such as <strong>Chord Charts and the various right hand methods such as plucking, strumming, picking etc. </strong> No need to learn every single thing in the book. As long as u know some basic chords and is comfortable wif changing from 1 chord to another, and know the right hand methods u can start telling everybody u are a guitarist. U should be able to play simple songs now.<br><br>Step 3 : Learn how to read tablature. (optional)<br><br>Tabs are very easy to read. It is also a MUST if u are planning to play Metal songs or Rock songs. Figure it out yourself after u completed step 2. U need to learn how to read tabs in order to proceed to step 4.<br><br>Step 4 : Guitar online lessons. (optional)<br><br>Go to Google to search for whatever u are looking for. It can be a pain to find the right lesson but its worth the effort. However most online lessons are not newbie friendly and consists of very advanced techneques requiring u to understand tabs so make sure u complete step 2 and 3. A good website would be www.ultimate-guitar.com.<br><br>Most important: Practice everyday.<br>Hope u find this useful.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...i hardly play songs that totally consist of chords...cos the music i listen to are more complex. i listen to rock and metal mostly....and i cant rely on a chordbook <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>i can handle chords easy..but the harder stuff are really difficult to play. i also visit ultimate guitar all the time for news, articles, tabs, reviews...everything.<br><br>but in the end ppl still say that finding a teacher is best...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have the same exact problem... still stuck at chord playing most times and then only a few difficult songs i can play ok. That is after 5 yrs of playing. I went to a music school for 1 month and improved quite a bit (This guy taught me to play some jazz chords and opened up me to more ideas of playing).<br><br>At the end of the day, I think if you can't find good guitar players to jam with (and steal some free lessons), you should shop for guitar teachers (ask around to see which teacher is good and their style), find out their school and then get lessons from the exact teacher. Shopping for schools is a hit and miss kind of thing... always got some good teachers and and bad teachers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I went to Attitude Music school.... the guitar lessons were alright but I think the teacher has since left the school. Anyway all these schools are like tution centres so the teachers come and go... search for the right teacher rather than the right school.</div>
