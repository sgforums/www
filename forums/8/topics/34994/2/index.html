            <div class='col-md body'>If you are traditional type one, you got to consult parents for the good date from "tong shu", don't know what its called in English.<br>Then you got to go around sourcing for the Restaurant or Ballroom for your wedding dinner. To get more details of the charges, you can buy those local wedding magazine where they have break downs of prices for different hotels and restaurants. From what I know, 6-5 stars hotel ballroom range between $1200-$800 per table or 12-10pax, 5-4 stars will be between $800-$600, restaurants will be $600-$400. Most package will comes with a food tasting for a table of 10 where you will choose the menu.<br>Well, if you are going for some auspicious date, make sure you book it early cos a lot of people will be going for the same date.<br>When I booked mine for the date 2/2/2002, I booked it 15months before the date.<br>After you have confirm the date, you may want to start sourcing for a wedding package for gowns and photo shots. 6 months before the big day will be sufficient. Make sure you know what to look for in the package so that you can bargain with them, eg offer car on wedding day? how many costumes? 1st hand or 2nd hand? Number of photos in album etc... Once you have chosen the package, they will advise you the date to take measurement, 1st fitting, 2nd fitting, final fitting, studio and outdoor photo shoots.<br>Package price can be as cheap as $2000 to $5000 or more...<br>A month before the big day, you will need to do some shopping as in buying the dragon/phoenix candles, bedside lamps, etc... you will need to get your good friends to be your helpers that day. The amount of angbao you are going to give to your helpers and the younger ones in your family. And for guys you will need to plan how much you are going to give to the sisters during gate crashing.<br><br>As for the big day itself, the best would be find yourself a personal assistant to run the whole show for you so that you won't stress for the day. Normal program will be generally like<br>1. Wake up and dress up<br>2. Brothers arrived and set off<br>3. Reached Bride's house, bargain with her sisters, allow an hour for fun and laughter, be sporting about it.<br>4. Negotiation successful, go in, unveil the bride, kiss her and some photo shots...<br>5. Rest for 10 min and set off to groom's parent's house. if time allow, some outdoor photo shots...<br>6. Tea ceremony, blah blah blah, makan and photo shots...<br>7. Might change to tea dress before setting off to bride's parent's house.<br>8. Tea ceremony, blah blah blah, makan and photo shots...<br>9. Go to new house, take photos<br>10. Check in hotel, rest<br>11. 6pm rehersal in ballroom<br>12. get dress up, and entertain guest at around 7-730pm, depends on individual, bride can either wait in hotel room 1st or entertain guest also... but personally think bride should entertain guest also cos it will be a waste not to let the guest see her in gown long enough<br>13. around 830 or even before, helpers should count number of guest and decide whether to start.<br>14. March in, cut cake, take photo, 1st dish serve<br>15. 2nd dish serve, bride go up to change to evening gown<br>16. about 4th dish, 2nd march in, champagne popping, yum seng session...<br>17. table to table photo session. try to siam the drinking part 1st and tell them u will be back after the photo shots.<br>18. around 10.30pm you should be finishing the photo taking, eat the last dish and prepare to send off the guest.<br>19. get sabo and drink more from your closer friends<br>20. if you are sober, settle the bill else next day when you check out.<br>Generally, angbao receive from relatives and parents friends will not be sufficient to cover the cost but those from friends will be just right to cover it or even earn a bit. but it all depends who you have invited.<br><br>well, the above is only from my experience and of cos it will different from the rest, just to share it with you people  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
