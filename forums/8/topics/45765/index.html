            <div class='col-md body'>Something that you guys (WuMing78 and Master^_^) might be interested in...<br><br>It was 1990 when Praise The Lord, a publication of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, printed a story that had first appearred in Ammenusastia, "a well repected newspaper" in Finland, according to Trinity.<br><br>"As a communist I don't believe in heaven or the Bible, but as a scientist I now believe in hell," said Dr. Azzacove. "Needless to say we were shocked to make such a discovery. But we know what we saw and we know what we heard. And we are absolutely convinced that we drilled through the gates of hell!" Dr. Azzacove continued, "...the drill suddenly began to rotate wildly, indicating that we had reached a large empty pocket or cavern. Temperature sensors showed a dramatic increase in heat to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. We lowered a microphone, designed to detect the sounds of plate movements down the shaft. But instead of plate movements we heard a human voice screaming in pain! At first we thought the sound was coming from our own equipment. But when we made adjustments our worst suspicions were confirmed. The screams weren't those of a single human, they were the screams of millions of humans!"<br><br>Names and numbers vary from source to source, but the story goes like this: A team of scientists were drilling somewhere in Siberia and accidentally tapped into a giant cavern about 2000 feet below the earth's surface. Immediately, the scientists, especially someone called Dr. Azzacove, the single source of the story, heard terrible noises coming from the cavern and first assummed what they were hearing came from their drilling equiptment. After readjusting their instuments, they found that the noises coming from the cavern were the screams of millions of souls, confirming the scientists' worst fears: they had drilled into Hell.<br><br>"The information we are gathering is so surprising, that we are sincerely afraid of what we might find down there," stated Mr. Azzacov, the manager of the project to drill a 14.4 kilometer hole in remote Siberia. The geologists were dumbfounded. After they drilled several kilometers through the earth's crust, the drill bit suddenly began to rotate wildly. "There is only one explanation - that the deep center of the earth is hollow," the surprised Azzacov explained. The second surprise was the high temperature they discovered in the earth'scenter. "The calculations indicate the given temperature was about 1,100degrees Celsius, or over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit," Dr. Azzacov pointsout. "This is far more than we expected. It seems almost like an inferno of fire is brutally going on in the center of the earth."<br><br>What gives this story its profit potential and sets it apart from so many of its cousins that have made their way into Time-Life Books and onto CNN is an audio recording one of the team supossedly made by lowering a tape recorder and mircophone into Hell's cavern, originally to listen for plate movements.<br><br>The last discovery was nevertheless the most shocking to our ears, so much so that the scientists are afraid to continue the project. We tried to listen to the earth's movements at certain intervals with super-sensitive microphones, which were let down through the hole. What we heard, turned those logically thinking scientists into trembling ruins. "It was sometimes a weak but high pitched sound which we thought to be coming from our own equipment," explained Dr. Azzacov. "But after some adjustments we comprehended that indeed the sound came from the earth's interior. We could hardly believe our own ears.<br><br>The recording found its way onto the radio show of Art Bell, the famous conspiracy theory talk show host who recently appearred on TV's Millenium. Art read an email that came with a tape of the Sounds of Hell. In his email, the author (never identified) said his uncle had a tape of the sounds of Hell, which he had copied from a friend who was on location in Siberia when the scientists drilled into the underworld. In closing his letter, the man asked Art, if he played the recording on the air, to warn the audience that the sounds of hell were very scary, and not appropriate for young listeners. Art played the tape, which lasted about 45 seconds.<br><br>"We heard a human voice, screaming in pain. Even though one voice was discernible, we could hear thousands, perhaps millions, in the background, of suffering souls screaming. After this ghastly discovery, about half of the scientists quit because of fear. Hopefully, that which is down there will stay there," Dr. Azzacov added.<br><br>This sound clip is the Famous Sounds from Hell tape that was recorded in Siberia. This Tape is Intense &amp; if you have heart problems I suggest you don't listen. This is in a .ram format &amp; plays in the Real One Player.<br><br><a href="http://hometown.aol.com/jesusandsue6/TheSoundsFromHell.ram" rel="nofollow">http://hometown.aol.com/jesusandsue6/TheSoundsFromHell.ram</a><br><br>One last note, one source claiming to quote the entire article stated that certain paranormal manifestations occurred after the shaft broke through into the pit nine miles below, namely a vaporous image of a creature with horns temporarily manifested and then later dissipated. Whether this claim was actually made by the geologists or not is still uncertain.<br><br>You have been warned!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
