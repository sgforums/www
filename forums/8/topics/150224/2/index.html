            <div class='col-md body'>Research and experience indicate that in the vast majority of cases, unfair dismissal could have been prevented. An investigation of dismissal case studies indicate that most difficulties are associated with poor personnel management policies and practices. Inadequate workplace communication also contributes to employment difficulties.<br><br>If poor performance is an issue, develop an appropriate job description. That is vital. In many cases employees are unclear as to the scope of responsibilities. Quantify performance requirements whenever possible i.e. a data entry clerk could have requirements such as keystrokes per minute and entry accuracy rates. Update job description where work requirements are altered.<br><br>Consider a trial period for new employees or employees assigned to new roles and responsibilities. Monitor performance and provide written feedback during this period. Employees should communicate to management any difficulties they are facing during this time. Managers should make and be seen to be making every reasonable effort to assist employees with any difficulties they experience in their new roles. This should include training if appropriate.<br><br>In many cases, employees terminated on the basis of alleged poor performance are unaware that their employers are unhappy with aspects of their work. Above all, employers have a moral obligation to act in good faith i.e. not restort to unfair dismissal on grounds of pregnancy in avoidance of giving employees statutory maternity pay.</div>

I am not telling everyone to be selfish.  But at the end of the day, if you and the kids starve to death, the gahmen can't do anything.<br><br>The bullcrap about the baby bonus is really a bull.  Yes, you get the money.  But a simple mathematics will tell you that the bonus is nothing compare to what you need to pay for the kid.  Even with the baby bonus, you will still burn a hole in the pocket.  apart from the milk powder and food, medication fee is a killer.  Trust me.  Many working mothers are working their butts out just to pay for the medications.  The bad news is : All kids will fall sick.  The only way out is to buy heavy insurance for the kid (money again!).<br><br>The wiser thing for the gahmen to do is to pay the bonus to the employers rather than the employees.  At least this will encourage the employers keeping young mothers in their company.<br><br>Also the gahmen will prioritise their duty in pleasing the employers rather than protecting the employees.  This is sad for all working ppl, but is realistic.  The gahmen's biggest nightmare is to see companies moving out of Sg.</div>

I am not telling everyone to be selfish.  But at the end of the day, if you and the kids starve to death, the gahmen can't do anything.<br><br>The bullcrap about the baby bonus is really a bull.  Yes, you get the money.  But a simple mathematics will tell you that the bonus is nothing compare to what you need to pay for the kid.  Even with the baby bonus, you will still burn a hole in the pocket.  apart from the milk powder and food, medication fee is a killer.  Trust me.  Many working mothers are working their butts out just to pay for the medications.  The bad news is : All kids will fall sick.  The only way out is to buy heavy insurance for the kid (money again!).<br><br>The wiser thing for the gahmen to do is to pay the bonus to the employers rather than the employees.  At least this will encourage the employers keeping young mothers in their company.<br><br>Also the gahmen will prioritise their duty in pleasing the employers rather than protecting the employees.  This is sad for all working ppl, but is realistic.  The gahmen's biggest nightmare is to see companies moving out of Sg.</div></blockquote>sg employer and employment is too regulated and inflexible. Therefore the penality falls on the employee. Indeed the bb-bonus is crap but many people are short term oriented and get themselves lock into piling debts from their daily lives as well as now paying high prices for kids.<br><br>Now all developed countries has low birth-rates. Scandinavian countries beat the trend but its because govt heavily subsidised the parents and kids in many many ways so as to encourage them to have kids. Employers are flexible and allow for 1 year maternity and 6 months parternity. The employment of temps/stand-in is possible. Sometimes the work around would be to have the mother cover half day or work from home. In Australia, there are people who "share" a job. Meaning 2 persons is employed for the same job but each work only half a day. The salary is of course based on that as well. All these countries use creative solutions to solve the issues ie; Germany beat peak hour traffic by staggering work hours, Italy use the car number plates to determine the day of week the car can be driven.<br>There is no perfect solution but at least it gives people an alternative to consider.<br><br>Garmen biggest nightmare started way back in 80s. Factories back then realised sg factory space rental is too high esp from JTC. I used to work in these factories myself. The end result is these factories secure cheap and good space as well as low labour cost over in M'sia/Thailand and subsequently china and vietnam etc and they of course moved. Back then JTC used to rent out to big companies such as Tomy, Triumph, MNB, Seagate, and all sorts. MM Lee himself came down to the factory to speak with the Tomy director (and other Jap big shots) but these people told MM they are set on their decision cause SG got nothing to offer. Discounts on the factory rental rate is still not as cheap as M'sia or anywhere.. so we had priced ourselves out of competition since the 80s. Therefore, every year I hear the garbage from the current party... I can only feel that the people are blamed for the bad decisions and management pratices of our  garmen. Our employers are doing monkey see, monkey do...<br><br>Now Seagate is planning to move to Thailand in a couple more years... so the factories will be pretty much empty...  soon lots of people will again be retrenched....<br>The policies, economics and social environment has created such a situation where people are not left with any choice but not to reproduce because the environment is unable to support these new generation. If it does reproduce, it will be at a great costs to the persons who choose to do so. In addition, with such open FT policies..... its just means the extinction of the local people is simply something along the pipeline...<br><br></div>

Certain FT are better at giving praise to certain people, which our locals are not so capable of. Take musakazim in his a Tribute to ..... thread for example.<br><br>"i Shaikh musaKazim Qureshi, am a Software Engineer (Indian citizen) working in Singapore since last 7 years.<br>Coming from India i realize the hardships in life and therefore appreciate the efforts by government of Singapore to make life worth living in Singapore - It is Worth it, when We REALISE.[/b]"<br><br>I do not blame musakazim for his love for Singapore though for indeed, the Singapore gov really made it worth living in Singapore, for FT that is.</div>
