Not wanting to disturb<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;anyone she gently lifted up the baby and took it back to her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;station. Feeling the baby's forehead,she found it was cold and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;with a sudden panic she realised that the infant was dead. Calling<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;upon a doctor she knew to be on board, he examined the baby and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;confirmed that, not only was it dead, but it was embalmed.The<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;child's body had been hollowed out and it was full of the drugs<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;that the couple were trying to smuggle into the States.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;A young lady is alone in her apartment. She goes to bed with her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;dog on the floor beside her. In the middle of the night, she is<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;woken up by a strange sound. She is alarmed, but reaches down to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the dog,who licks her hand. She is reassured and goes back to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;sleep. In the morning, she finds the dog hung in the shower. Where<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the dog slept, she picks up a note which reads 'Humans can lick<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;too,"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;A woman living in the city {Salt Lake} was visiting some friends<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;in Ogden. When she got into her car in front of this friend's<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;house,she noticed that a car started up right behind her car. It<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;was about 2:00 in the morning,and there weren't any other cars on<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the road. After she had driven to the highway, she began to think<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;that this car was following her.Some of the time he would drive up<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;real close to her car, but he wouldn't ever pass. She was really<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;scared to death and kept speeding to try to get away from him.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;When she got to Salt Lake, she started running stop lights to get<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;away from him, but he would run right through them too. So when<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;she got to her driveway she pulled in really fast, and this guy<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;pulled in right behind her.She just laid on the horn, and her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;husband came running out. Just then,the guy jumped out of the car,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;and her husband ran over and said, 'What the hell's goin' on<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;here?" So he grabbed the guy, and his wife said,"This man's<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;followed me all the way from Ogden." The man said, 'I followed<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;your wife because I was going to work, and as got into my car, I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;noticed when I turned my lights on, a man's head bob down in her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;back seat." So the husband went over to her back-seat, opened the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;door, and there was a deranged man sitting on the floor with a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;knife in his hand.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Two roommates remain at their deserted college dormitory over a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;holiday break. One of the girls goes out on a date that evening,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;and the other one turns in and goes to bed before her roommate<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;returns. Later that night the sleeping girl is awakened by<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;gurgling and scratching noises coming from outside the hallway<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;door. Frightened, she locks the door and cowers inside the room<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;until morning. When the girl finally opens the door and ventures<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;outside, she discovers the bloody corpse of her roommate in the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;hallway.The murdered girl's throat had been slit, and she had bled<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to death in the hallway while clawing at the door.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;____________________________________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;In Berlin, after World War II, money was short,supplies were<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;tight,and it seemed like everyone was hungry. At that time, people<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;were telling the tale of a young woman who saw a blind man picking<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;his way through a crowd. The two started to talk. The man asked<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;her for a favour: could she deliver the letter to the address on<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the envelope? Well, it was on her way home, so she agreed. She<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;started out to deliver the message, when she turned around to see<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;if there was anything else the blind man needed. But she spotted<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;him hurrying through the crowd without his smoked glasses or white<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;cane. She went to the police, who raided the address on the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;envelope, where they found heaps of human flesh for sale. And what<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;was in the envelope? A note saying 'This is the last one I am<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;sending you today,"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;__________________________________________________________________<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;A male flight attendant was stopping over at Japan.He went to a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;local bar where a Japanese man and woman approached him. They<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;chatted and had a drink,The man gave him an old traditional<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Japanese drink. The next memory the flight attendant had, was when<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;he woke up in a bath of ice in a hotel room with agonising pains<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;in his stomach. He managed to pull himself out the bath and phone<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the police. He told them everything he could remember,the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;policeman described the two people and the man said that's what<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;they were like. The policeman calmly told him to get back into the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;bath and sit there till the police and ambulance had arrived, The<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;mans kidneys had been removed.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt;<br><br></div>
