            <div class='col-md body'>The best solution to getting a dog toilet trained is carry out the below procedure right from the beginning.<br><br>The moment you bring a puppy home, wipe his ass and private part with a tissue paper and then place that tissue beneath the pile of newspapers at the designated toilet area.<br><br>Typically, the moment the puppy arrives at a new home, he will seek to relief himself. Just make sure the very 1st time he pees at the spot you want him too.<br><br>Just reinforce over the course of one week, and your dog will usually return to the place he's familiar with to do his business. As a measure of reinforcement, keep a tissue tinged slightly with his excrement at the designated area for a week, or even longer if necessary.<br><br>This is a very easy solution without much 'beating'. The key thing is that people normally baby a new puppy when it 1st brought home, ignoring these essential steps.</div>
