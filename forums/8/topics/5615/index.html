            <div class='col-md body'>OK it is in teh overseas culture to be friendly in general. But in the clubbing culture overseas one of the MAIN reasons that ppl are friendly is cos they are high on estacy, in other words they are ultra friendly. Clubbing overseas is totally different from clubbing in singapore 1stly considering alopt of oversea ppl are really in to thr druggie scene where as in singapore ppl are more into the antisocial alcohol thingie also alcohol as a drug makes u agressive and not friendly so that sucks combined with natural antisocialness of singaporeans.</div>
