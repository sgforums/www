            <div class='col-md body'>Here's an interesting read I found off the net... Enjoy pple!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>A Man's Guide To Surviving Valentine's Day</strong><br>ROBERT KIRBY, TRIBUNE COLUMNIST<br><br>If you are a man, chances are you have forgotten that Monday is<br>Valentine's Day. Now that you know, this seems a good time to pause for a large<br>hysterical fit. The angst you are feeling right now stems from a complete lack<br>of understanding about what makes a woman feel romantic. I don't know either,<br>but I did look it up on the Internet.<br>Not counting about 5,000 Web sites that seem to correlate the word "romance"<br>with "hot mamas," here's what I found out.<br><br>HOW TO ROMANCE A WOMAN: Call her. Hug her. Compliment her.<br>Smile at her. Laugh with her. Cry with her. Cuddle with her. Shop with her.<br>Give her jewelry and flowers. Hold her hand. Write love letters to her. Go to<br>the end of the Earth and back again for her.<br><br>Conversely, if a woman wants to romance a man, she would<br>only need to show up wearing anything remotely revealing, including a hazardous-material<br>suit.<br><br>This may sound like an oversimplification of gender romance<br>differences, but it isn't far from reality. It's always Valentine's Day for<br>men, if you get my drift. Women need<br>a special day.<br><br>Because it involves a woman's feelings, Valentine's Day is<br>something of a mystery to men. So is the top of a box of Cheeze Doodles, but<br>we'll save that for another column.<br><br>The following is a basic guide to Valentine's Day survival<br>for men, which was faxed to me by the nice ladies down at "Romance Anonymous,"<br>formerly known as "Men Are Pigs But We Can't Kill Them."<br><br>STEP ONE: The minimum requirement is to let the woman know<br>that you care. The least expensive way is to look at her -- preferably somewhere<br>on her face -- and say, "I love you, [her name here]." If you forget<br>her name, don't bother with the rest of the steps. You're dead.<br><br>STEP TWO: A Valentine card is an acceptable nonverbal token<br>of appreciation. Best of all, it's cheap. Good Valentines are pink with lots<br>of lace and have cute words such as "I'll love my sugar bunny forever and<br>ever and ever and . . . " Bad Valentine cards say, "Good for one free<br>quart of motor oil."<br><br>STEP THREE: Candy. For some scientific reason that makes no<br>sense, women regard chocolate the same way men view beer. While a handful of<br>M&amp;Ms is OK, women tend to expect something a bit nicer. Wrapped for starters.<br>By the way, since the candy is supposed to be for her, she's going to notice<br>any test bites. Stay out of it.<br><br>STEP FOUR: Jewelry. A bit pricier, especially if you didn't<br>bother with steps 1-3. If you did, you might get by with a small but hideously<br>expensive ring, necklace, or tiara. Keep in mind that most women, even in the<br>Southern States do not consider aluminum, tin or a Mylar balloon to be a precious<br>metal.<br><br>STEP FIVE: Lingerie. Be careful. Few men are smart enough<br>about women to figure out their underwear. Not only does it have to be the right<br>size and caliber, it must also match any of the approximately 8 billion feelings<br>she currently has about herself. To be safe, tell the clerk that you're looking<br>for something that<br>can't be used to strangle you in your sleep.<br><br>STEP SIX: Romantic getaways are good for couples with more<br>than 0.002 kids. Studies prove that not even bacteria can reproduce when a toddler<br>is beating on the bedroom door with a Fisher-Price toy. Depending on the size<br>of your family, the romantic getaway may have to cross at least three international<br>boundaries.<br><br>STEP SEVEN: Unlike men, women give points for trying. So do<br>something. Anything is better than nothing. If you don't believe me, I can<br>show you last year's knot on the back of my head.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>Tell me why?<br>I want the meaning of my life....<br>Do I try to live?
