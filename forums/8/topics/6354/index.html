Then how to enjoy the things that are important around you?

            <div class='col-md body'>In my view, there is absolutely no pt. in hating yourself for the flaws you have. Each and everyone on this planet has their own flaws but you don't see everyone blaming themselves. It is not possible that we can correct all these flaws even till the day we die. Sometimes, its better to live with our flaws and continue our life the way it is. Im not saying that we should ignore our flaws entirely, but rather we should acknowledge them and try to change our ways for the better whenever possible. There is no point in seeking perfection as the more you try, the harder it gets.<br>Instead of regreting and hating urself so much, might as well make the best out of your life and cherish every single moment while you can.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa, I feel sad that nice people like you are facing problems you can't solve. I believe many in the forum(whom you've helped along the way, me including) will be glad if we can do something to help you. Just too bad that you're so far away from us, and we can only watch you suffer in despair.<br><br>However, many of those things that you hate about yrself are actually good things, and I know you certainly know that. Just happen that good virtues can sometimes hurt people in certain situations, and that can't be helped.<br><br>On being a heartbreaker, sometimes you just can't help, isn't it? Heard from many fellow forumites that you're quite pretty, so i reckon pretty girls will hv many suitors, and in the process, you'll hv no choice but to break some hearts. Guys shd be able to pick themselves up from such heartbreaks.<br><br>On the issue of getting drunk, I think(just what I think...) maybe sometimes, getting drunk do help a bit... see... if we've hurt someone, or feel very hurt ourselves, getting drunk will help us forget those things for awhile. After that, we'll feel terrible fm vomiting, headache, etc. and this will be the tormenting part which maybe will make us feel psychologically better becos we are suffering physically. I know this sound a bit sadistic, but how impractical it may be, it does help sometimes...<br><br>Take care... I got to work...<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry too much Rinoa. Life is full of hurdles. Most of the things you think u hate about urself are actually things of virtual. The rest, if you know that things are wrong, then you can change. Else if we are ignorant abt our shortcomings, then we could not take a positive step forward. You are a intelligent and independent gal - from my point of view - you will shake out of this, I am sure. Everyone have times when they are down, just how you handle it.<br>Take care. You have many friends here.</div>
