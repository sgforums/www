Or before buying dzi beads too... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Whether i am or not from chc, i do not think that there is such thing as research before joining a religion. if research have to be done, why not believe in yourself and no one else?  i do not bother to buy beads too.<br><br>But think, if you carry the mindset of look see for every religion, why must u have a religion in a first place? Religion is to believe, learn good morale values, but when believers think that they learnt about good values, what not they share to their friends, they care for their surronding friends, if not why do they even bother to invite you over? All religion cultivate good values if not why are people believing the words?<br><br>I think that in the future, its not because of racial riots but it a religious riot in the future. why not accept how different religion are like. there are many churches, temples and mosques. If everyone carries the same mindset as you. how worst will it be for the future generation?<br><br>Will there be existance of beliefs, when everyone think that they are right? Hatred develops from the heart too. If they disagree with all the religious saying, no matter what any religious leader say, everything is wrong in their mind.<br><br>So its like whats the point of arguing and having of topics like joining a church? it like digging something from nothing. nothing to do with back to square one. Though i maybe young, why cant people think in a mature way?</div>
