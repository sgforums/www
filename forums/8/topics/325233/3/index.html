              <p>I guess parn had mistaken the nature of insurance.</p>
              <p>Insurance is there to provide an income for your daily expenses when you are unable to earn an income due to illness or disability. Its main purpose is not there to provide you with your dental and optometrist.</p>
              <p><strong>You mean you can claim $100 000 because you are short-sighted? or pay for your spectacles and lasik?</strong> <span style="color: #888888;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your life still goes perfectly fine even you wear spectacles. OR claim for braces or teeth whitening?</span></span></p>
              <p>It does covers hospital bills and treatment, specialist treatment, accupunture and even TCM.  </p>
              <p>Govt is not able to give you free insurance. Because insurance work by pooling in the premiums and go through redistribution.</p>
              <p>It will be possible if you are willing to pay 20% GST and 5 times the amount of incometax. LOL.</p>
              <p>When things are free, people abuse the privilege. </p>
              <p>Insurance is like a religion. Those who believe in it have a peace of mind.  Those who don't is a believer of self-denial. LOL. =p</p>

              <p><br>Well, if insurance isn't a scam, then could you tell me how many times does a person actually need to make a genuine claim in their lifetime?</p>
              <p>"Insurance is there to provide an income for your daily expenses when you are unable to earn an income due to illness or disability. Its main purpose is not there to provide you with your dental and optometrist." -------&gt; Unfortunately, this is the fear factor that insurance companies used to exploit common people to sign up for their policies. And how much INCOME will actually be covered/payout by the insurance companies? And how will the payout actually helps the claimant? I would like to see real living stories of claimant coming out in the public and promoting the real benefits of insurance cos it is really beneficial to them.</p>
              <p>"<strong>You mean you can claim $100 000 because you are short-sighted? or pay for your spectacles and lasik?" ----&gt; Once again, this is an entirely wrong concept that insurance companies are trying to project themselves to the public. Tell me it isn't true that people buy insurance because of the promised high payout in any case of an unfortunate event in their lives? If exploiting on people's fear and greed isn't strong enough to justify insurance as a scam, then do you even understand the meaning of scam?</strong></p>
              <p>People should be smart enough to know they were being exploited upon their fear and greed.</p>
              <p>Moreover, if insurance were that good, you wouldn't need to come here and try to find out the mindset of people who aren't getting scammed so that their premiums could supplement your salary for the next 2 years?</p>
              <p>The fact that insurance has already projected the wrong image from the very beginning and it's too bad that some people DO possess a mind of their own and realise that insurance were a scam to begin with.</p>
              <p>Ohh...one last thing, insurance are bought and sold mostly to people who are POOR. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>parn, besides those compulsory insurance like house or car insurance, your family really never buy any insurance at all?</p>
              <p>If you say insurance is for the poor, you are so wrong! Let me name you a few examples.</p>
              <p>Rich models are insured for their face, legs etc.</p>
              <p>Oil rigs, shipping companies insure their properties from any major damage.</p>
              <p>Companies buy huge insurance for their key personals.</p>
              <p>Heard of reinsurance companies? They insure insurance companies. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>I don't think you need me to tell you the reasons why they buy insurance. I guess you are smart enough to know it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>know how insurance works?</p>
              <p>they calculate the risk of you getting hurt, which means you claim money.</p>
              <p>let's say super high risk job, rope tester for bungee jumping, 1% chance of death per day.</p>
              <p>the insurance company will than be williing to pay out up to 90 times the amount you are insured just for 1 day.</p>
              <p>let's say got 100 guys buy the plan. and very true to statistics, 1 of the guy die. the insurance pay out 90% of money.</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, the insurance company ends the 10%.</p>
              <p>now scale up everything, from the time invested, lower the payout rates, and lower the percentage of dying. that is life insurance.</p>
