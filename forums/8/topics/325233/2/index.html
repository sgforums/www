              <p>Everyone has been talking about death / life insurance. How come no one is concern about critical illness? Isn't Critical illness important too?</p>
              <p>Critical illness is the one that piles up your medical bills and drain all your hard-earned savings for medication and living expenses.</p>
              <p>Sad to mention some of my clients claim that they are healthy and do not need any critical illness coverage now. They will only purchase it when they are around 30 or 35 years old.</p>
              <p>Don't understand their intention. They prefer to pay a higher price next time for the same coverage. LOL.</p>

              <p>Know how insurance co. make money? they take the money and invest. Won't insurance co. lose money if people actually claim the insurance? The probability that people will need to claim is low, so no problem.</p>

              <p>Insurance works by pooling in big sum of money and redistribute to the claimant. For insurance company to successfully insure 1 person, she need to have sufficient resources and also be insured by another reinsurer. Therefore, if your policy is in force, you are definitely guaranteed claimable.</p>
              <p>For your info, claiming rate for critical illness is so much higher compared to death. Because it is getting more common.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I always wanted to know the mindset of the client. What is/are the reason/s that stops you from buying insurance?</p>
              <p>1) because you feel that you are buying something that you do not need ?</p>
              <p>2) Not willingly to part with the money?</p>
              <p>3) Do not want to think about financial planning?</p>
              <p>4) Others?</p>

              <p><br>If you do not need life insurance does not mean others dun need it. It depends very much on the individual and you are <strong>ONLY</strong> speaking from your own perspective.</p>
              <p>We know you come from a well-to-do family so maybe you are unable to see the need to insure against unforeseen circumstances. For others, it may be better to spend a small sum of money per month to insure against major critical illness or death.</p>

              <div><strong>Who needs Life insurance?</strong></div>

              <div>If someone will suffer financially when you die, chances are
              you need life insurance. Life insurance provides cash to your
              family after your death. This cash (known as the death benefit)
              replaces your income and can help your family meet many important
              financial needs like funeral costs, daily living expenses and
              college funding. What's more, there is no federal income tax on
              life insurance benefits<br> <br> Most of us need life insurance. To figure out if you need life
              insurance, you need to think through the worst-case scenario. If
              you died tomorrow, how would your loved ones fare
              financially?<br> Would they have the money to pay for your final expenses (e.g.,
              funeral costs, medical bills, taxes, debts, lawyers' fees, etc.)?
              Would they be able to meet ongoing living expenses like the rent or
              mortgage, food, clothing, transportation costs, healthcare, etc?
              What about long-range financial goals? Without your contribution to
              the household, would your surviving spouse be able to save enough
              money to put the kids through college or retire comfortably?<br> <br> The truth is, it's always a struggle when you lose someone you
              love. But your emotional struggles don't need to be compounded by
              financial difficulties. Life insurance helps make sure that the
              people you care about will be provided for financially, even if
              you're not there to care for them yourself.<br> <br> To help you understand how life insurance might apply to your
              particular situation, i have outlined a number of different
              scenarios which will be posted the next time round. So whether
              you're young or old, married or single, have children or don't,
              take a moment to consider how life insurance might fit into your
              financial plans.<br> <br> &lt;!-- / message --&gt;</div>

              <p>Everyone has been talking about death / life insurance. How come
              no one is concern about critical illness? Isn't Critical illness
              important too?</p>
              <p>Critical illness is the one that piles up your medical bills and
              drain all your hard-earned savings for medication and living
              expenses.</p>
              <p>Sad to mention some of my clients claim that they are healthy
              and do not need any critical illness coverage now. They will only
              purchase it when they are around 30 or 35 years old.</p>
              <p>Don't understand their intention. They prefer to pay a higher
              price next time for the same coverage. LOL.</p>

              <p>Insurance and financial planning are terribly outdated
                  stuff.......when is those insurance companies going to market
                  themselves as a private health fund organisation?</p>
              <p>People would be more likely to buy private health policies if
                  they covers general dental, optometrist, specialist treatment,
                  hospitalisation bills &amp; treatment, GP, Physio, accupunture,
                  even TCM.</p>
              <p>This is the kind of policies that people are more likely to be
                  investing their hard-earned money into....not those kind of "you
                  give me money now and if you kanna accident, your family will get
                  some money and then at least you will die with a smile"
                  idiotic useless impractical policies.</p>
              <p>People are already under earning in SG.....and these policies
                  that they use their hard-earned cash to invest in....they probably
                  don't even use it once a year anyway, and so it is impractical and
                  useless.</p>
              <p>Don't tell me about company policies, they are often abused as a
                  shield to protect the management/company against the public.</p>
              <p>Since SG has claimed to have a world-class medical
                  service/facilities, isn't it about time the people get
                  to enjoy world-class medical health policies to protect
                  them in their daily life?</p>
              <p>Life Insurance was a scam from the very beginning.</p>

              <p>Insurance works by pooling in big sum of money and redistribute
