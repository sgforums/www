              <p>know how insurance works?</p>
              <p>they calculate the risk of you getting hurt, which means you
              claim money.</p>
              <p>let's say super high risk job, rope tester for bungee jumping,
              1% chance of death per day.</p>
              <p>the insurance company will than be williing to pay out up to 90
              times the amount you are insured just for 1 day.</p>
              <p>let's say got 100 guys buy the plan. and very true to
              statistics, 1 of the guy die. the insurance pay out 90% of
              money.</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, the insurance company ends the 10%.</p>
              <p>now scale up everything, from the time invested, lower the
              payout rates, and lower the percentage of dying. that is life
              insurance.</p>

              <p><br> Well, if insurance isn't a scam, then could you tell me how many
              times does a person actually need to make a genuine claim in their
              lifetime?</p>
              <p>"Insurance is there to provide an income for your daily expenses
              when you are unable to earn an income due to illness or disability.
              Its main purpose is not there to provide you with your dental
              and optometrist." -------&gt; Unfortunately, this is the fear
              factor that insurance companies used to exploit common people to
              sign up for their policies. And how much INCOME will actually be
              covered/payout by the insurance companies? And how will the payout
              actually helps the claimant? I would like to see real living
              stories of claimant coming out in the public and promoting the real
              benefits of insurance cos it is really beneficial to them.</p>
              <p>"<strong>You mean you can claim $100 000 because you are
              short-sighted? or pay for your spectacles and lasik?" ----&gt; Once
              again, this is an entirely wrong concept that insurance companies
              are trying to project themselves to the public. Tell me it isn't
              true that people buy insurance because of the promised high payout
              in any case of an unfortunate event in their lives? If exploiting
              on people's fear and greed isn't strong enough to justify insurance
              as a scam, then do you even understand the meaning of
              scam?</strong></p>
              <p>People should be smart enough to know they were being exploited
              upon their fear and greed.</p>
              <p>Moreover, if insurance were that good, you wouldn't need to come
              here and try to find out the mindset of people who aren't getting
              scammed so that their premiums could supplement your salary for the
              next 2 years?</p>
              <p>The fact that insurance has already projected the wrong image
              from the very beginning and it's too bad that some people DO
              possess a mind of their own and realise that insurance were a scam
              to begin with.</p>
              <p>Ohh...one last thing, insurance are bought and sold mostly to
              people who are POOR. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>a person with a normal life insurance without any riders will be able to make at least 1 claim during the life time. apparently u oso do not know that not only is ins for the poor to create instant asset upon inception of policy, but also act as leverage dollars for big companies.</p>

              <p>Insurance is good for a start. Everyone needs a basic coverage. Even your condo needs one. Does it mean that your life has a lower value compared to the condo? </p>

              <p>Hospital Insurance (The importance of it)</p>
              <p>If you’ve ever been sick or injured, you know how important it is to have health insurance coverage. Health insurance pays for things big and small, from a lab test that might cost $75 to a hospital stay for major surgery that could cost thousands of dollars. It gives you peace of mind of knowing that no matter what kind of care or procedure you or a family member might require, you won’t have to worry about shouldering the cost on your own.</p>
              <p>Hospital insurance is one type of insurance you're pretty much guaranteed to use. We all need medical attention from time to time, and some of us need it quite frequently. When care is needed, you want to focus on getting better  not on how you're going to come up with the money to pay your medical bills. A good hospital insurance plan allows you to focus on what's most important, your physical well being. <br><br>Is there anyone who doesn't need hospital insurance? Not really. Even if you're young, healthy and haven't had to see a doctor in years, you never know when you might be involved in an accident or be diagnosed with a serious medical condition. While your health insurance coverage will pay for things that aren't too costly like routine doctor's visits or lab tests, the main reason to have coverage is to have protection against the potentially catastrophic expenses of serious illness or injury.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is very important to get a very comprehensive hospital plan. Go and get a hospital plan if you have not. It is very important.</p>

              <p>I hope you guys do understand that insurance is literally everywhere... the flat/house that you stay, you need to buy fire insurance (compulsory for HDB or if you have a mortgage loan), the car that you drive, also requires insurance, even Medishield that is paid by your CPF, is also a form of insurance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Insurance are not for poor people but for people with specific needs and different people have different needs. In reality, extremely wealthy people buy quite a lot of insurance (for tax purposes). Some people buy life insurance in case something happened to them, their parents/kids have money to spend. Some people buy medical insurance because its cheaper to die than to be ill.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Financial planning involves planning your finances (or your money). So insurance is just a very small part of it. The depth of financial planning, also depends how much money you have, how much you earn (or can potentially earn). If you earn $2000 a month, then seriously, there is not a lot to plan right? But if you earn $20,000 a month, then you will be worried about taxes you have to pay, if you should buy a condo or invest, and how to maintain your lifestyle when you retired, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no necessity to argue if its the right thing or wrong thing to do... because different people have different needs.</p>
