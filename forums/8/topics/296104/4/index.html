            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I have noticed myself quite a few similarities between Bahasa Indonesia/Malaysia and Japanese language. Apart from the very similar pronounciation in both languages, there is the same hierarchical differences in personal pronouns. For example "you" is either "anda" or "kamu" with the same meaning and wa of using as "anata" and "kimi" in Japanese. Likewise, "suki" 好き (to like) translates "suka" in Bahasa. Such similarities are striking. In both languages you can make a plural by doubling the word, like wareware in Japanese (ware = I or you, wareware = we). Doubling of words is so common that there is a kanji that only means the word is doubled(" 々"Wink in written Japanese. However, it is more common in Bahasa nowadays where it is almost systematical. Expressions like "ittekimasu, itteirashai, tadaima and okaeri" also exist in Indonesian (selamat jalan, selamat tinggal...), but not in European languages. I am not a specialist of any of these languages at all. I barely know a few words in Indonesian, but it's enough to see the link with Japanese.<br><br>Japanese matsuri ressembles so much Balinese ones that one could wonder if they are actually the same country. I've seen a cremation in Bali ; they cary the dead body very much like Japanese carry a mikoshi. Balinese funerals are joyful and people swinging the "mikoshi" in the streets and making loud noise to scare the evil sprits. Basically, Bali is Hindu, but has mixed it with the original animist religion. Shinto is also an animisn, and we can see lots of other cultural similarities between non-muslim/non-christian Indonesia and non-buddhist Japan. For example, the wall and entrance around traditional houses and the style of Balinese temples and Japanese shrines. Buddhism, Islam and Christianity all arrived much later after the supposed original ancestors of the 2 archipelago split from each other, but have changed radically both societies. We have to look for the purely original culture (what might be very difficult nowadays) to find the connection existing in late prehistoric time.<br><br>and<br><br>If you look closely at japanese people...clearly this group have variety of skin tone, from milky to darker tones...you do not seem to find it in chinese or koreans ..strange lah but let's not mystify their origins..they are a mixed group that has evolved to yamato race<br><br>and<br><br>Have you ever noted some japanese are darker with polynesian skin?<br><br>some famous Jpop singers have this. it's not tanned btw<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>CatKnight, you gotta be joking.<br>Similarity in some parts of both language and culture don't necessarily tell you<br>that both races are related genetically. And this also applies to the 'rationale' that some Japanese skin colour is naturally dark, so this means that they are also related to Polynesians and hence Malays.<br><br>Are you drunk? I seriously think that those Japanese who have darker skin are<br><span style="font-style: italic;">tanned</span>.<br><br><strong>Moreover, you have absolutely no scientific evidence by credible experts/scientists to boost your case that Japanese and Malays are genetically related.</strong><br><br>In addition, Malays don't share the same facial features Japanese have.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this is the second time I heard about this.The first was from a Japanese Elementary School principal not too long ago.The original people of Japan were the jomonjin and the Ainu people but they got mixed with Korean and Chinese tribes.As for languages ,you can always find similarities in some words even in other languages like for example Thai and Japanese or Hawaian and Malay.Okinawa is near Taiwan which is why some Japanese look more like Malays,some Japanese stars you see on TV have filipina mothers or African fathers so that again explain their skin color.So dont be quick to jump to the conclusion that they eat nasi lemak for breakfast.</div>

The people of Hokkaido also known as the Ainu people are hybrids between the assimilated mongoloids and native europids thus creating a very eurasian looking  hybrid. The Ainus were isolated from the rest of Japan and have a language of their own which has no link between Asiatic languages. The Ainus have baffled anthropologists for ages and their ancestry remains blurred. The Ainus can be distinguished from the rest of Japan by their square jaws, straighter nose, almond yet bigger eyes,milky skin tone and are generally taller.</div>
