            <div class='col-md body'><br>Geez... youngsters nowasdays har.. still lack exposure.<br><br>Let this aunty here teach you a few things...<br><br>1) Teenage BGR very seldom will last one (believe it or not), altho there's the very few who would finally get married and live happily ever after. But that is the minority. So just cherish what you have and enjoy. If things turn out bad, try to solve. After a max of 3 months still cannot solve, I sugg you move on.<br><br>2) You don't get as much exposure to guys in your teens and you will think that the guy you are with is your world. But once you get into your twenties, it's a totally different scenario! There will be lots of guys for you to choose from, provided you make a conscious effort to expand your social circle. Kinda like a shopping mall scenario. You definitely will have lotsa choices and it's up to you then to decide if you wanna stick with you existing beau or dump him for a better one.<br><br>3) Usually r/s that starts around mid 20s will blossom into marriage, say about 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 yr old period. Anything before that is rare and any after is also rare (unless you are the desperate type).<br><br>4) So why kill yourself over one guy??? In terms of guys, there's a jungle out there. Don't ever believe that your existing beau is the best and is definitely the only one for you. If you are still in your teens, perish that thought and keep your options open still.<br><br>5) The best is you can solve your problem with your guy, otherwise, don't despair, guys out there will come for you. Believe me about me! (I know coz even after I'm married, I still encounter guys interested in me and wanting to come after me... Yikes!) As a female, your job is to reject guys, not to hanker after one of them and get suicial. No such thing as cannot help it one. It becomes 'cannot help' it, only when your mind is closed to the fact that you won't accept other guys out there.<br><br>6) Always look at the big picture in life. Kill yourself and you will miss out the good stuff that comes later. Parental objections will fade if your r/s is long enough (this never fails). Often you will be surprise that parents' choice are amazing correct in deciding if a guys' good for you when you get a little older (I was!)<br><br>7) Give your guy an ultimatum, if you are convinced that you are not the problem in the argument. Either he shapes up within a given time period or you are gone. If I were you, I"ll give that to him and leave it to him to see the light himself. Don't bother about being supportive to him whatsoever. He has to shape up himself.  Start planning Plan B, enlarge your social circle and keep your mind off him. After a while, you will find that he's not the only one in your world and then you can make a better judgement there.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> You may think my advice is heartless and downright pragmatic. That's right. LIfe is hard and harsh. Local guys should be wakened up to the fact that there's always competition out there. So if the problem lies with him, he better shape up! No such thing as fussing over a guy's problem and make yourself unhappy over his problem. (Ultimately what everyone pursues is happiness. If he's such a pain, seek other avenues!).<br><br>9) Be glad that you are alive and you are a girl. You should be cherished and not suffer!
