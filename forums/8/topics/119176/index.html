            <div class='col-md body'>Dear mystic_law<br><br>Obviously you are suffering from depression -- suicide thoughts, negative thoughts, loss of interests in every single thing etc...<br><br>Try to take up some hobbies or see what you can do to change the way you feel or your lifestyle.<br><br>If it doesn't help, you might need to seek medical help.  Some medications can stablise your mood by adjusting &amp; balancing certain chemicals in our body (I think that's how it works).  Just don't be afraid to seek help.  Depression can be a medical problem, instead of due to your environments.<br><br>My friends, husband &amp; wife, have a clinic in Mount E to help individuals who are depressed, stressed, nervous etc.  If you want to get them to help, PM me.<br><br>Don't worry.  You'll be fine.  The very fact that you know how to voice out your depression is already a very good start.  Now you must decide what to do to feel better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I am coming to 50 this year. I am SICK of living, sick of life, sick of the Hypocrisies in this world, the facades people put up... </blockquote>Let me add to this,<br>=&gt;And the clock keeps ticking, like a never ending picture, always the same today, always the same tomorrow<br>What's the meaning of living in life??? Why does everything we learn hits back at us?? Why does every believe we have end up with a contradiction??? Why is there no glory or good picture that stay forever? Why must there be more bad days than good days??? Why do we not fit in, and even when we do, so what???<br>It feels like everyday is a boring day. Why are people always fighting and debating??? Why are things always so real and serious??? Why must there be stress??? Why is there always a need to improve?? Why is there never a good enough?? Why is everyone always caring about themselves???<br>What am i searching for?? It's a dread to wake up in the morning, it's always that same day, that same reality.... the clock always tick!!!!<br><br>Everyday is the same conclusion, everyday is a never ending route. People question reality as if they know heaven or hell, whoever is judge to go either place... But maybe we know one fact, given that reality alters, are we ever going to be satisfied even then? I challenge this 50 yr old to look and imagine you are 80. What do you want to feel on that day???<br>It ain't the result that is really interesting, it's the road to the result, if you are given a million dollars right on the spot, how interesting is it really, how will you ever learn in your road in life that way, how will ya ever improve if things come too easily. Isn't it easier to receive good things than bad things? What victory is there in that?? In actual fact, it's the hardship that is the reward, not the good position or result, becos only in hardships that we really change. We are put in this earth with our soul, it's the soul that is going through life more than the environment. It's the soul which is what we are living for internally, it's our soul that we are living our life for. So you ought to say, "f#%k you depression", becos you wouldn't want to be that way when you are 80 and feel sad that ya have lived that way from 50 to 80, or do you???<br><br></div>
