            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, don't think of girls as clingy ok?  It takes two hands to clap and it can happen both ways.  Both parties know what they're getting into, they shouldn't "expect" the other party to be committed after the act.   What do you expect after meeting for the first time and gyrating in bed immediately?  A LOVE story?  It's just a hormonal syndrome and as adults, be it a guy or a girl, they should think with their heads before their loins.<br><br>My advise...Never play with fire if you can't handle it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahahaha, Crab. Most of the time, after sex, it's the guy who falls into a dead slumber from the exhaustion, not the girl. Hard for the guy to run lah. And if you meet somebody who claims he can do it four times a night, it's likely that he only lasts 5 mins each time   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>BTW, I've worked in a pub in Boat Quay during one vacation. Lots of SPG there. Always see them go off for one night stands with ang mohs. And frighteningly enough, I found out from talking to them that some are actually looking for guys to marry. *shake head* Dunno how their mind works.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 07-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 nite stand? Great! No commitment, no need to worry abt the GUY being clingy (hey! some guys are clingy as well!), no need to think of ways to pump up the guy's ego (bye, I know I wun see u again, and I juz wanna let u know that I'll appreciate a more "sustainable" session), etc. Basically the same reason as why guys like a 1 nite stand. But can guys really "stand" for 1 nite? Oops! no offence...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just wonder- aren't one-night stands a good excuse for bad sex? I mean, if you're in a relationship, the guy has to try to make sure it's good for the girl, so there'll be a second time, a third time etc. If you're only going to do it once, why bother? The guy will just satisfy himself. So doesn't that mean it won't be good for the girl?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. IMHO, i think girls actually would like to have one night stands, pretty much for the same reasons as guys, like tictac said. but it's the stigma attached, that ruins everything and prevents most girls from actually going out and doing it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1 nite stand doesn't mean no feelings is involved, only that all feelings and emotions watsoever is channeled to the "action" at hand (no pun intended). So that actually makes the act better, isn't it? And u can go all out w/o having to worry abt how to face yur partner again after that, since there's not a high chance that u will see each other again.<br><br>Uh oh, dun think that I like the idea hor, juz voicing my opinion only.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tictac,<br><br>for sex to be good, there has to be prolonged stimulation for the girl. The initial rush from physical attraction is not enuff if the guy cannot ...er... bring it to the next level. (*look around and hope Ko Kid is not reading this*) In fact, if stimulation is not sustained, sex can start to hurt for the girl half way through. Either that or she will become damn frustrated when the joy ride only lasts 5 minutes.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purr, regarding your point about SPG's going on one night stands with ang mohs, and actually looking around for a guy to marry.....<br><br>Ever realise that most of the SPG's around (I'm juz saying most not all) are actually women in their late twenties?<br><br>I guess like most women at that age, when they are still single and unattached, and unable to find a "Local", the bioloical alarm starts to ring. And most of the time, the ang mohs are usually more romantic, more charismatic, more  blah blah.....in the end I guess they just don't mind trying their luck on a one night stand.<br><br>But dunno, I think asian women to the ang mohs are basically a fetish. I mean if not why the heck are asian women listed in the fetish on so many porn sites?<br><br>and I guess most local guys prefer to look for a gf "in the early twenties" to get married to.<br><br>So the whole problem becomes an endless cycle.</div>
