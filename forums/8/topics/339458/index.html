              <p>I went to that forum before, filthy leh.   The owner does not want to manage the forum and they don't want to ban spammers, trolls and so on.    I don't like it there and stop going there since then.     Some forumers and mods there said that if ban people means it is like PAP's style, oh my goodness.     Really, I surf for so long  it is my first time to come across such hopeless forum.   U want to go there take a look?</p>
              <p>Recently, my friend's friend just kena severe constant attacks from a troll there and mod and some forumers point fingers at him that he should leave the troll alone, in a way they are supporting the bad behaviour of troll.    He left the troll alone but the troll keeps attacking.   They see no need to ban trolls.  so people, if you like trolls go there.    </p>

              <p>Back to the topic.    I have been around to other forums as well.   Find out that well organised forums are with proper management, a system to manage spamming, trolling, slamming.    </p>
              <p>Do you prefer to surf in a well organised forum or a forum whereby the mods don't care about proper management and allow trolling and spamming?   I personally don't like to surf in forums whereby there are no proper system.   I am not asking for perfect forums but at least must get the basics right like managing spamming and trolling.</p>
              <p>Among friends, we will usually update each other on forums.  Just get info from my dear friend that there is this forum 3in1kopitiam where the mods there simply don't take the responsibility of managing spamming and trolling.  They expect the forumers to deal with the trolls.    As such, trolls are taking advantage.  Which other forums do you people encounter which has the same problems?</p>
