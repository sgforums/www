            <div class='col-md body'>I hope no GALS get offended by this.<br><br>I am prety upset.  My close friend is married for 8 yrs, hv a good career ( Salary S$ 10k per mth ) and hv a beautiful daughter.  Suddenly, his wife ask for a divorce by saying reasons like he is not romantic, care for his daughter more, etc.<br><br>We decide to probe further n found she hv another bf.  In my opinion, the bf is lousy although rich right now.  Drive a merc, hv a condo, foreigner, bet on horse racing every wk.  But he is a VERY VERY sweet talker.<br><br>Why does gals choose such things over long term committments, obligations ?  It is true the bf is great today.  But can't one look at his profile n realise he is not stable ?<br><br>Is it true that gals get "blinded" so easily by sweet talk n current materialistic conditions ?  Is LOVE really so blind ?<br><br>Sad n disappointed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...<br>this is one SOB story...<br>wat can we say???<br><br>the woman forsake the family for a foreigner, then who is at fault? This happens coz when the husband is not showering her with love and sweet talks(which gers find it a must) and the 3rd party giving her all these. There is a possibility that she will be swayed.<br><br>true love does stand but as times passed, the love might just losely die down, esp if the guy is unlomantik. that can just make things worse. so tim, what is your friend decision? either use the family and daughter, hoping she will change her mind, else forget this "water-letter-goat-flower" woman! one day she will know that her decision is wrong and it will be too late for regrets.<br><br>hmmm, u are saying that the daughter is beautiful, so how old is she??/ haha (just kidding) but frankly, how old is she? a little kid or some teenage? did your friend try to talk to the 3rd party? is he just a flirt, attacking all MARRIED woman or he's serious abt her?<br><br>there is nothing we can do to help. only he can solve the problems himself. just be around him to give him support. be careful. look closely over him cos he might just do silly things.<br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alle, I do agree with u.  This is where the problem is.  BUT where is the un-written rule on obligations to family, daughter for the sake of fun, short term love ?<br><br>Bishamon, dg only 3yrs.  Interested ?  Too bad, her wife don't want him but want the dg.  No nego.  Ask him to go, that's it.  I really hate her selfish attitude.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think love is very important to women, in this case, to that woman...Timothy mentioned that the woman said her husband is not romantic and cares more for the daughter, this could be a sign that she actually feels neglected by her husband and that her husband is not trying to ignite the flame of love. When the love inside a woman dies, it is as good as her dying.<br><br>She may be just in love with that man itself and not the material possesions. Tim, u said he's just a sweet talker and that may be a fact. But i feel that women are silly in the sense that they let themselves be cheated into thinking that they are really being loved. Sometimes, they know that the man is just sweet-talking her but she rather live in that world of sweet-talk. she can be happier thinking that she is in love again...<br><br>------------------<br>tHe BeSt aNd MosT bEaUtiFuL tHinGs iN tHe wOrLd cAnnOt bE sEEn oR tOuChEd. tHeY mUsT bE fELt wItH tHe hEaRt...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so women like to be cheated?<br><br>like dat i think i'll go write a book on how to sweet talk women, maybe it'll make me rich<br><br>but then again, most of the time, communication breakdown leads to diff scenario. perhaps the hubby spending too much time on work? stress? performance anxiety? daughter taking up too much time?<br><br>maybe the lao wai got more ways than one to hold the heart of your friend wife, sekali is by black magix...<br><br>then again, now that she's strayed, you never know if she might stray again if they do get back together, it's diff. for guys to try and forget these unhappy memories, well, for me i.e.<br><br>stay by your friend! he needs all the encouragement, but maybe try not to breakup the family, hope the kid don't grow up repressed n lonely without her real daddy~<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alle, guess u r right.  Gals put love in higher priority than obligations, rules,.... n it may be the reverse for guys.  Ask a married man if he will leave his wife for gf n the most likely reply is No.<br><br>Kitty, it boils to basic.  R gals different in mentality ?  I guess yr answer is yes.  Love / attention are more important for gals.<br><br>nYteMare, we r trying not to break up the family but court not on our side.  Poor little daughter.  Bishamon hv already "book" her.<br><br>Never see my friend so upset.  No mood to work,....  I am quite lost too.  How to help.  Only drink, lah.</div>
