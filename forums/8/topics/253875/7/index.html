You jump to wrong conclusions so easily without any evidence to back you up, it says alot on your sense of judgement.  Not very astute, but understandable.<br><br>As for standard of English, I don't really want to get into the technical bits, figuring that this being a forum, many are allowed to use bad-english.  As such, in the event information might be wrongly interpreted (assuming that IS the case) the fault lies in the person who posts rather than the reader.</div>
