I dun earn much as an Asst Egr and my pay is only $2k.<br><br>I started working four years ago and I tried to save but to no avail.

My father is no longer with us in this world and my mom is no longer working till to serious health problem.  Well all these has place enormous stress on me and my financial status.<br><br>Well I find life boring and very tough for myself and I have literally no friends to seek comfort from.

Yes pay is good, but IT is a tough line to take on.  You have to be real good to stay on top.<br><br>I was an IT/Application Engr b4 earning 3k a month.  I had given up the post because it took a toll on me as it took away most of my time and my free time with my family.<br><br>What is the use of high paid job when one own time is taken away.  I rather have time with my family then to slog like hell.<br><br>Causeway &amp; bird, I know it is tough for you and it is not going to be easy.  Just stay strong and be determine to pull thru.  I was too in your situation though not so bad when I have to fork out about $50k for an operation for one of my family member.  It took a toll on me because my parents have retired then and so they dun have money to foot the bills.<br><br>Well life goes on for everyone of us.  One more thing dun compare yourself with others.  Many people out there are very rich because they have support from their wealthy parents like a fren of mine who drives a BMW Z3  car and owns a condo when he is just a N level grad working for his father.<br><br>Don't be despair by all this.  Work hard and stay strong.  However I strongly agreed that Singapore cost of living is so high.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh.  Life is tough, I agree.  When I was in my early 20s, I dreamed of getting married, buying a HDB flat and having at least 100k in the bank.  Now that I'm hitting the big 30 soon, I have achieved none of these things.  I work in a miserable job with long hours, I don't have a place to live and girls run far away when they find out i'm not rich.  If it were 10 years ago, I would have been able to afford a 4-room flat, with the way prices of flats are rising, by the time I earn enough money to buy a flat, the prices would have risen beyond me again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></div>

I think, we got to have great determination to really carry on with the hefty burden.  Even though if migrating is an option, the environment may look cinducive at the beginning but every countries have it pros and cons, for example, the advantage od living in Singapore is that we are genrally very safe if we keep our doors open all night, which I dun think can be achieve with ease in any other countries.<br><br>As for investment all that, although it bring fast cash.  Anything that can be achieved easily makes ones want more..this is human nature..so just control yourself.<br><br>Although every Singaporean yearn for a house, a car etc...all this materalistic goals are all being induced by the government, by doing this only the economic will flow and Singapore can continue to survive due to it extreme puny size compare to any other countries.  You can say the government is cruel, but only by doing this then we can soundly live on in this country...as a country.  If not we maybe take over by malaysia again.
