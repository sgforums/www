            <div class='col-md body'>The cost of living in Singapore is getting higher and higher as each day goes by.  Telecom, PUB, Property Tax, Income Tax, Conservancy fees, food, drinks, entertainment and many more bills piles up.<br><br>How are we going to go thru our lives in future?<br><br>I am a simple with simple goals.  I dun yearn for a car, credit cards nor condo.  I just want to have just a house maybe a three room flat or four room flat to live in.  But the cost of a HDB flat is enough to kill plus the renovation fees, plus the stamp fees, agent fees and many more other fees.  Wah bian.<br><br>Singapore is so tough to live in and one day eventually people start migrating.  Only those strongest will survive.  Looks competition is not only in business but also people like looking for job.  The employers now want low paid, highly educated and highly experienced and skilled worker.  What a tough life?  Furthermore workers in the company are not cooperative and they tend to fight political battle among one another.<br><br>What have Singapore come to.  Are we the average income earners going to survive in future.<br><br>Look at the cost of a car and the petrol.  The price is four to five times the price if one gets a car in Malaysia or Thailand for example.<br><br>I am sad and demoralised by all this factors.  I have worked hard for eight years, trying to save and achieve my goals but yet there are so many obstacles.  One good example is when one my family member has a serious medical problem.<br><br>The cost of medical fees are so great and most of my eight years savings are gone including my medisave.  Bills came up to almost $90k + $1k for every month. Fortunately we only foot about $45k due to subsidy. Yet $45k is no small sum for us.<br><br>What are local gov body doing for the us?  They force us to upgrade. Okie so I upgrade, took a part-time course and went my way up from a ITC holder to a degree holder.  Hwoever it took away so much of my time and effort and determinations.<br><br>I lost my social lifes and lost my close friends just because I have to work for money, money and money.  I became anxious of every day life until I was diagnosed with acute anxiety.<br><br>I am tire, really tire of all the things in Singapore.  Don't you guys feel the same with me unless you are earning high pay.</div>

I too worked hard for my future and try to save as much as possible and at the same time keep on upgrading myself.<br><br>I too find it very tiring.  To save money for my studies, I skipped lunch and sometimes breakfast altogether though I have a hearty breakfast which cost only $2 or less at most.  In the night I have my dinner at home.  I seldom go for movies like I used to, banned myself from nightspots and no buying of anything and no buying of can drinks from kopi tiams.<br><br>Life isn't that great in Singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'>causeway : you married yet? it's easier if you share your financial burden with your wife. don't just plan by saving whatever you can. frankly, it's just too one-dimensional. pay a visit to the bank and talk to their managers about investing in unit trusts. you can also check out finatiq.com or read the MONEY section in ST regarding the performance of existing unit trusts.<br></div>

Well... WAKE UP!!!!!!<br><br>The pay is perfectly fine.. as for making $350k by 30.. assuming you are 20 now.. that makes it 10 years.. you need to save $35000 per year!!!!! You think you'll become some big CEO once you grad and draw lots of pay issit?<br><br>Nobody wants to work hard.. all dreaming of making big bucks and fast cash like investing in stocks.. and for goodness sake.. Please don't influence causeway to buy stocks... he hardly has enough savings right now and you're telling him to talk to some bank and invest!??!?!?!<br><br>Maybe singaporeans are too used to the good life.. this clouds our judgement.. makes us greedy.....<br></div>

Life doesn't have to be only about money.. granted we can't live without money.. but I'm sure we can still live a good and normal life with the current pay.<br><br>For example.. you don't need to spend $1000 on a handphone.. there are $100 models available.
