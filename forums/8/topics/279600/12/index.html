We will prove things slowly as we get more technologically advanced. Our knowledge is limited to the extent to not able to unravel its mysteries. Whether or not some cow is sending us signals to how to live our life in a galaxy far far away , or proven that cows on earth dun send signals to our brains how to live our life , everything must be taken into account logically and within reason.<br><br>Many people believe in ghosts. Even not proven in thier face but do u doubt thier ancestors when they say Ghost festival this and that. Some people may be a better person fearing that there are ghost , some will be affected in another way. But we cannot tell them it doesnt exists when they are brought up in that belief , whether we have proof or not , unless u can prove thier ancestors wrong. So there. Case close. Everyone live thier own lives the way they want to.</div>
