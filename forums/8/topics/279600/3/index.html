If I see such things I willd efinitley try to get evidence like video tape it down or use a voice recorder to record it down.<br><br>Can you imagine if you stop working at night and cannot get your work done and the boss fire you over things that turns out to be nothing, how stupid that is?</div></blockquote>Yea, that is why i work till 10pm. U have a scientifc thinking which is good.. but u need some experience and see if you can really find any evidence when you're all alone like me. I read many ghost stories online and some knowledge of wat shoudnt i do if i exp anything weird.... but its not easy as easy as it seems<br><br>That thing pretty good to take me when i least expected. My lab staffs all went back at 5.30pm and left me alone. I was mentally prepared for any sound or weird things while doin my job. I constantly telling myself what i shouldnt do if thing happened. All 4 and half hours, nothing happened.. its quiet and peace. That sound of the beaker vibrate made me turn so fast to it unprepared... im not mentally ready for this kind of thing..<br><br>So i looked back at the beaker today, found no evidence on how that thing can vibrate and cause the sound like something lifted it up 2 cm and dropped it back to its original position. I stimulate the incident again to make the liquid in the beaker moving like what i saw yesterday. IT really looked like some1 accidently knock the beaker. Proves that 500ml in 1 litre beaker is heavy enough And confirm no rat can climb till that high..<br><br>Any other possible scientific explanation that i might not know?</div>

What's wrong with that suggestion?
