            <div class='col-md body'>hmm i feel tat our inability to xplain such tings does nt prove the non-existence of gods.. It only proves tat our knowledge is as yet incomplete..<br><br>( For example, b4 the development of modern medicine,  ppl didn't noe wad had causes diseases n then they believed tat god or the gods sent those diseases as a punishment. But now we noe wad causes such tings n when we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our knowledge of the world is more complete, we will be able to understand wad causes these unexplained phenomena, jus as we can now understand wad causes diseases. ) so i feel tat we jus cant simply state tat gods/god do not exist.<br><br>whats more.. albert einstein believe in buddism.. he feels that buddism is scientific lol while scientists like thomas huxley and prof gustaf stromberg(astronimer,physcist) believe in rebirth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> n issac newton believes in god too..<br><br>well im oso nt tryin to say tat we shud believe in gods jus bcus these famous physcist or scientists believe in them.. jus tryin 2 show tat every1 has their own views in these.. so i feel tat u shud respect other ppl's beliefs instead of  judging and criticising other ppl's beliefs.. i hope theres not much ppl on earth  having the same atitude as u or the world would be in chaos.. every1 would be quarreling abt existence/non-existence of god n countries of diff beliefs might even go to wars with each other.. (well it might be exaggerating but u see, nth is impossible )  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>oh ya.. shud albert einstein.. issac newton.. thomas huxley and pro gustaf stromberg be sent to a mental hospital too.. ? =/ lol<br><br>hmm and i guess deres no harm in believing such tings right? hahs last bt not least.. even tho im a buddist/taoist.. i respect all other religions bcus they preaches the right thing n teaches us gd moral values.. tats all bye bye</div>
