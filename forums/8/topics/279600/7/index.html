Make a point to go through kranji there and continue along Old Woodlands Road. And please be daring to exclaim that Ghosts are full of shits. Many things can happen to you. Either you can skid off when you are clearly in control of the bike with no oil or water on the road. Or you can pillion a new passenger instead. The best will be someone flying alongside you. And that won't be Superman. And if you see anyone dress in red or white, please stop by them and ask if they wanna hitch a ride. I'll bet they'll love it.<br><br>Taxi-drivers, guards and all others swear of their existence. What makes you think you have seen it all? Well.. An interesting phenomenon happened last month. There's 2 accidents along the same road on the same night. On a Thursday night coincidentally. I forgot which road that was. But somewhere between Marsiling and Bt Batok. A notorious bend. An old couple only have abrasions thankfully. The old man with his wealth of riding experiences only bank a little around the bend but it was enough for him to skid off. Well... Maybe he was tired eh. Also, coincidentally, there's a lot of fatal road accidents lately. Hungry ghost festival anyone?<br><br>I bet you never experienced NS. Have you ever tried bring in pork inside your bunk? You've been warned not to. But you can bring at your own risks. If you've still yet to experience NS, please do so. I can bet you will have sleepless nights. Personally, I've experienced ghostly encounters but thankfully, not face to face. My training camp in CDA is just beside an old cemetery. Why me and a few others experience it when most others don't? That's an interesting question to ponder about.<br><br>Anyway, to TS, where exactly is the place you work? If your workplace is 'dirty', you can try avoid working overtime. Not worth your health. lol.. can have higher change of heart attacks.</div>
