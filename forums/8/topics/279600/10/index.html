            <div class='col-md body'>Andrew, I agree that you should attempt to point out the errors in other people's thinking to them.  However, what you are doing is harassing them with your non-belief.  They have heard and dismissed your views and have no wish to engage you in an argument.  Why persist in making them prove their beliefs to you when they have not set out to convince you in the first place?</div>
