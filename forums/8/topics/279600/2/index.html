Im in the lab 2nd floor<br><br>9.30pm. Heard door slamming - faint noise - far away. Ignored<br><br>9.45pm - Checking switches to off. A guard was with me. A 1 litre beaker with 500 ml liquid in suddenly vibrate behind me 4 metres away like some1 lifted it 2 cm and dropped it to its original position. Shocked but i see nothing. A rat cant climb that high and its a storage for chemicals. Its also too heavy for a rat to cause that vibration and sound. I ignored it even though i know something is not right.<br><br>9.48pm- Leaving my lab (2nd Floor) with the guard, Heard door slamming again. Its on 3rd Floor.. No one left.. Im the last person to leave<br><br>Guard said he warned me not to work alone till very late especially till 10pm. HE said he always listen to door slamming and voices at this particular hour.<br><br>AM i too foolish to work alone in a company which all staffs know it is really haunted and this earthbound spirit is an evil one..<br><br>Guard heard few ppl were talking in the lab at 10pm. Female voices. Unrecognised and alien language. Not any language that he knows..<br><br>This is real story of my own. I experienced it with my own eyes and ears. Please do not even think that this is a make-up story<br><br>Im stll terrified..

After the blessing and so on, sightings , voices are still here.. LIke i told in my thread.. this thing is a strong one and i dont think its alone.. .. I dont think that priest did a really good job, perhaps that priest is just the normal one.<br><br>Everyone in my company knows bout this thing and its not meant to play with this stuff.. not even one dare to play prank like scaring any other staffs for fun.<br><br>I did some own research.. Most of the sightings or weird things happened on either Thurs or Fri. Time is not a matter.. some if it happened during day, Some at night. What i do know.. This thing will prove to anyone that its a real thing.<br><br>One worker at 3rd Floor along with 2 other staffs working . 3rd Floor is like our warehouse where we put all items in it.. so you guess it rite . a bit messy. The guy staff saw that thing at the far dark corner in white laughing silently.. he got scared but his leader(female) told him dont afraid and just pretend nothing. So he followed his leader. The other staff(female) didnt know bout this. Suddenly a big carton filled with things inside(yes, heavy one) dropped. The leader and the guy know its that thing cuz its placed on stable position and very heavy.. cant simply push if down just like that. But this female staff wanted to go and pick it up but warned by the leader not to and just leave it there. She didnt listen and said why so afraid and even talked that no ghost exists. So she went there to pick up things inside the carton and she came back.<br><br>Guess what.. this guy saw that thing behind him standing and looking at the female staff sitting. He asked her dont ever look back at all cost !. She tot this guy trying to scare her and even dare to say "What ? Got ghost behind me is it? Haha, Dont scare me la"<br><br>So? Yes , she did turn back and since that thing is too close to her.. she saw that face and fainted, Possessed. How i know she saw the face? She told me after she is back to normal. and only say this "Undescribeable"</div>

This is seeing and hearing things that normal people do not see and hear. Sure, you can believe that what you see and hear are those things that you believe but what if it is not? Isn't it better to make sure and get a qualified opinion from a qualified psychiatrist?<br><br>The psychiatrist will be able to do some test and then confirm that you do not suffer from any mental problems.

This thing appeared just right in front<br>him naked but ... headless. He ran like hell to the front guard and resign<br>the nex day. The back guard told front guard that voices and seeing things<br>from far away is normal to him. but the sudden appearance out of nowhere<br>of a body without head in the dark just too ovewhelming to him.<br><br>2) 2 staffs at 2nd floor (yes, my floor) went to take things situated behind near back of our company (this is a famous place for sightings and disturbance). Boo.. they saw headless guy just sitting there.. 2 of them petrified and run away like hell.. ended up both of them got possesed and hysterical. People say if u see any weird.. dont ever run away, the fear actually give them more energy to manifest.<br><br>2 other sightings - One of my collegue has the natural ability to see those thing. She saw it once in the toilet washing hand.. another in the office floating and lurking (both sightings on day, not even near evening), One is white (Normal with all body parts) ,another is red dress with long hair covering face without body. Yea.. just Long hair covering face and red dress with invisble body in. My collegue got scared cuz for all her life till now she never saw a red one.. and um. i happened to tell her that red or black means evil... so.. ehehe.<br></div>

What's wrong with that suggestion? I did not say that people that see and hear things are automatically suffering from mental problems but there is reason to believe that they might and it is better to make sure before it becomes too severe.</div></blockquote>Brownie dear, Thanks for what you said.<br><br>BUt i believe Andrew is not tying to say to believe this thing immediately.. yea, sometimes mental problems can cause delusion or illusion friends<br><br>I might go and seek but this is my 1st time hearing doors slamming without anyone when im left alone in the company and the guard heard it too. So i can say im not in any mental problems. If i happened to see and hearing things too often..i will sure confirm to do some test and find out if i realy have mental probs or not. But things happened at 10pm.. is not a way of imagining things cuz hearing and even watching the liquid in beaker moving is just unexplainable<br><br>But andrew, if you dont believe this thing, its always ok, but i hope if tehres anyone telling of what they experienced, pls do respect cuz only seeing is believing..<br><br>Im not sure if u experience anything paranormal.. but if u never, i just hope u dont be too  c o c ky</div>
