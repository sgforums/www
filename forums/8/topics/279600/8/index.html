Have you ever tried bring in pork inside your bunk? You've been warned not to. But you can bring at your own risks. If you've still yet to experience NS, please do so. I can bet you will have sleepless nights. Personally, I've experienced ghostly encounters but thankfully, not face to face. My training camp in CDA is just beside an old cemetery. Why me and a few others experience it when most others don't? That's an interesting question to ponder about.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Anyway, to TS, where exactly is the place you work?

I will not bother you if you start threads in religious forums as religious people are "gone case" (unlikely to change their beliefs no matter how ridiculous it is) anyway. </div></blockquote>i cant handle? Cmon, you have been replying this and that.. and at last i just respect whatever u wanted to say and just say There ANdrew goes again. but you intepreted it as i finally realised that there is not ghost ?<br><br>And the reason why i start this thread in chit chat is cuz i dont know there are SEA before i started in here.. IM still new here.. we all listen to anyone to say bout their story ,, you're talking bout beliefs? i bet you dont have friends..didnt some of your friends tell you of their story or their problems to you? and what? you have no evidence bout what they are saying and you dare what they tell are all lies?<br><br>Its really funny... YOu said you will not bother me in other forum like religious forum ? why is that ? Like i said , if you dont like , it doesnt matter in religious forum or chit chat. Its whether you need to reply or not...<br><br>I dont see your logic.. Chit chat means anyone can reply but religious forums means only ppl with religious belief can reply ? That is stupid<br><br>and again, this is not my error. What some ppl told bout what they heard bout ghost or watsoever, we all just listen , how to prove what they are telling is the truth... we all dun waste our time to be a detective just to find out if its the truth... If some1 told me they see a ghost, i will jsut listen and share.. to believe it is hard unless you see it yourself..</div>
