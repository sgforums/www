              <p>depends. I mean if u "keng" physical pain, den i think its a waste of energy.</p>
              <p>But.. if u "keng" mental stress(in some way is also related to agony), den its worth. Mental aspect can train and will benefit you in the future, whereas... physical, hmm.. i dont think much of it and how it'll help you.</p>

              <p><br> true, a bit of stress is good for life, otherwise these
              NS mommy boys and maid babies are going to despite many things
              in their lifetime whenever they cannot handle it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, my Dad, who was a former sergeant sometime told me he
              missed his NS days, where all brothers of his suffered and have fun
              together, he can hardly find that kind of joy now.</p>
