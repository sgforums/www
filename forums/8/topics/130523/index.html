            <div class='col-md body'>ok.there is always two ways to looking at this thing. It is either the school is taking the easy way out or the school is doing the right thing by disciplining the child. Well, u can always confront the principal by saying that you're unaware of the situation and just be plain freaked out because the school can't be bothered to go after the run away child.<br><br>Yes, you're right to say that it is the school's responsibilty when the child is in school. Whatever happens to your child during school hours is covered by the school.<br>However, it is also right for them to say that ur child broke the school rule</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the child is in lower seconday leh...  The thing is I see my son school closes the main gate all the time... so for a student to leave school un-noticed is not likely.  But hor, I feel my friend got a point la ...  if the school close the gate, child cannot just run away so easy ma..  I feel for my freind because as parent we want the best for our childre...  so with this kind of problem that I never come across, I don't know how to advise that why come here to seek view leh ...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

The school did not reply to this queries and I was told another student did the same thing after all these happening !!  Can you imagine, thing had happen and yet they do nothing to prevent another happening ....</div>
