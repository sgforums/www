            <div class='col-md body'>Send that kid to another school and see if the same thing happens? I say take out that cane and discipline your own kid. Generally, kids nowadays don't fear the education authorities anymore. Why? Because the parents are getting soft and protective over them. Parents blame schools for little things that happen to the kids. It is hard for a school to take responsibility for both the academic and character development when the parents themselves are covering up for the child. Be responsible for the character development of your own child! Just by locking up the gates alone doesn't remove the spoilt, rebellious nature of the kids.</div>

We all here can agree it is not the school fault.  I don't think the parent can be blame for it too.  The faul lies largely on her and her curosities....  hope she learn her lesson...  now her parent called her almost every other minutes.  I told her she have to accept it as it all started from her.... hopefully after she changed, thing can be back to normal... now the question, why don't the school closes the gate ???  All other school are doing it .... not this one ....why huh ???</div>
