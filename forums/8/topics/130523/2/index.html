            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway I agree with the rest that it is more important to find out why the girl keeps skipping school. Is she being bullied, for example.<br><br>Haha I know someone who wanted to skip class and used a pair of pilers to cut a big hole in the wire fence to get out.<br><br>If you want to get out of school, there are lots of ways to do so</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Brings back such fond memories of me running off to the nearby mama store to buy toys and comics.<br><br>How can the school effectively look the gates when there are other students come and going for various other activities???<br><br>Lock the school gate and parents will cry foul - PRISON!!!!<br><br>Don't lock and let people come and go - WAH!!! DANGEROUS, RAPIST, CHILD MOLESTORS, WEIRDOS etc.<br><br>There are even cases of parents quarrelling with school staff for not allowing them in....<br><br>This case is a serial offender... so probably why the harsh punishment.<br><br>I say send her to girls home.... and taste prison life for a while.<br></div>
