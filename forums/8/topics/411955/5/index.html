              <p><br> Basically, I think as responsible human, if 2 get married, they
              should at least give birth to 2 children so that at least can
              sustain our human domination in this world, even ants are
              protecting all their might to perserve their eggs and we here are
              reluctant to give birth, more so if you are married, i heard that
              after married many years with no children, the couple relation
              start to strain, and also hor, childrens also provide happiness to
              the family, one of my workers said, work hard is ok, when go back,
              see childrens very happy. For this, no amount of money can buy</p>

              <p>From what you say. Couple who have problem conceiving would all ended up in divorce lor. </p>
              <p>Before being humanly responsible &lt;-- crap though angel, dono what you talking, I think we should be responsible for ourselves and our kids too. If we can't afford to have them, then why should we have kids? </p>
              <p>We can't compare to that hawker who raised 10 kids as that was a story repeatedly narrated for donkey years already. With the rising cost now, plus the competition in our education environment, the effort and money put into raising a single child is a lot. Unless people are really obsess over kids, I don't see why many would want. </p>

              <p>The problem is because Of Chasing after money and by the time they have it, They cant conceive... Which is natural. Every women should know that Time is Ticking for them and man should know that if they want a baby they should take care of their body and their lifestyle, it goes for every human being.

              <p>The only reason I can think of for you to say the low birth rate is due to chinese, is because Chinese form the majority race in Singapore. But even so, you can't push the entire responsibility onto the Chinese. Malays and Indians are not producing either. Thus, why you and your friend can come up with this conclusion is because, with the higher % of Chinese around, you guys would only get to know more on the stories of Chinese not wanting babies. </p>
              <p>Correct? </p>
              <p>Its not wrong to ensure financial stability before having a child. Its a form of responsibility. And what constitute material luxury? Having a car? Allowing the child to take extra tuition classes and other enrichment lessons? </p>
              <p>If we as parents can't afford that, then I rather not have children as I'm unable to provide for my child to unleash his full potential. I'm discounting my child already gUms. </p>

              <p>How can you compare us to algae and animals. -.- It depends on what kind of personality both partner possess. If they are strong in their thinking, and know they don't like children, how then would they feel pressurised and allow their life to become stale just because of the children?</p>
              <p>Children are only <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">part</span> </strong>of marriage. If you have children, your marriage can equally become stale too. Children are not a guaranteed form of protection. </p>
