              <p>I had a long discussion with my friends, And we came to this conculsion that we are in the Shitter(need immigrants to come here) cos most chinese couple are either childless or only have one Child. I think most chinese only care about money Money money and by the time they are ready, the females cant have babies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indians and Malays on the other hand are not really interested in being Rich, just being content with a roof over their head and ability to put food on the table and just have alittle bit extra on the side. Chinese are more interested in buying a car with a pay of 2k..</p>
              <p>What do you guys think?</p>

              <p>If a couple can afford to live condo, can they love in 5 room hdb? Can afford to own a car, can they take public transport?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Agreed with Deino that it also play a part in putting babies off for they want face and they want to be better than their colleagues and friends.</p>

              <p>well, TS, just another point of view. (no offense to any).</p>
              <p>In the past like 80s or 90s or even early 2000s, I don't see other ethnic groups besides chinese owning a car. or if they own a car, they would own the lower range ones. For example, when u think of proton, which group would you think of? but recently, there is a big change, if U check, more of the other ethnic groups beside chinese are driving mid or even high range cars. this implies the more and more are getting educated, and with that, they are finanically wiser, and hence, better planning and more comfort pursuit be it travelling or bigger house.</p>
              <p>also, they want to reserve their bests for one-two children at best. also, some of the ladies want to keep in shape too.</p>
              <p>hence, it is not only one ethnic group that is not providing but a more general problem.</p>

              <p>i agree with ts</p>
              <p>all the blackies, ie malays, bang-lahs, pakis, ka-laings have uncontollable sexual urges and will have sex with anything on 2 legs</p>
              <p>thats why malaysia, indonesia, india and pakistan got so many cases of fathers raping their own daughters</p>
              <p>singapore should follow this trend to increase its population,</p>
              <p>1 - make rape legal</p>
              <p>2 - make incest rape legal</p>
              <p>3 - make child rape legal</p>

              <p>I cant quite agree you on that @icefatboy, from my observation this minorities weather they are more educated or more well off now, seems to be still marrying earlier and having more kids.</p>
              <p>Every month at least 1 or 2 indian/malay wedding invitation is send to my house, Chinese friends wedding is more like Once every 3 or 4 months. Most of my chinese friends are mostly single or childless or have only 1 kid.</p>
              <p>Thinking about it again.... Let me look at my 4 neigbours which is just next to me... 1st house-Women is in her 40s and she is childless, 2 doors down-Couple in their late 30s only have one kid who is in sec school. 3 doors down - couple has only 1 kid who is going to N.s soon and all are chinese.</p>

              <p>There you go!!! you dont have a child cos of your lifestyle of travelling abroad. Only way is to stop what your doing(Your salary will be effected or you will lose your job) So for the moment is it right to say, that you are choosing not having a baby because of work? Cos work = money.</p>
