              <p>Singapore's <a class="mw-redirect" title="Fertility rate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_rate">fertility rate</a> is 1.29 children born per woman (in 2007), which is one of the lowest
              in the world. Chinese had a ferlility of 1.07 in 2004 (1.65 in 1990),
              while Malays had a TFR of 2.10 (2.69 in 1990). Both figures declined
              further in 2006. TFR for Indians was 1.30 in 2004 and 1.89 in 1990. <a class="external text" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.singapore-window.org/sw06/060426re.htm">1</a> <a class="external text" rel="nofollow" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2006/12/15/unanswered-questions-on-singapores-population-policy/">2</a> While the Singapore government has launched several highly publicized
              attempts to raise the fertility rate and increase awareness of the
              negative effects of an aging population, the elderly (65+) still
              constitute only 8.3% of its population; this proportion is
              significantly lower than that of many other developed nations, such as
              the United States (12%) and Japan (21.2%).</p>

              <p>We can be noble and prolong mankind by reproducing, but at what cost? We can't only think for ourselves, as in whether are we going to be alone when we're old, no one is going to help us with our funeral, no one to continue our blood line. Does all these matter if the entire family is eating scraps, and having a harsh life? Would it matter if your kids have the means to do well with additional help from tuition, but as a parent, I sadly can't afford to? I wouldn't want to ruin my kids future with my inability to afford helps that could elevate them to a better future!</p>
