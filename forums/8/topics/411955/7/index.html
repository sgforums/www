              <p>online i don;t really know you so the initial way is to joke on all such stuff. don;t worry if you not up to my standard i won't bring up sex, hotel bathtub anyway. those that said that to you usually they will bring along a blindfols before sex. so they can blindfold you and make believe you havea pair of sultry alluring eyes.</p>

              <p>I had a long discussion with my friends, And we came to this
              conculsion that we are in the Shitter(need immigrants to come here)
              cos most chinese couple are either childless or only have one
              Child. I think most chinese only care about money Money money and
              by the time they are ready, the females cant have babies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Indians and Malays on the other hand are not really interested
              in being Rich, just being content with a roof over their head and
              ability to put food on the table and just have alittle bit extra on
              the side. Chinese are more interested in buying a car with a pay of
              2k..</p>
              <p>What do you guys think?</p>
              </div>

              <p>On the other hand, I find that malay &amp; indian families have many children..... so many that they have finanical difficulties raising their many children.</p>

              <p>Yes, and kids nowadays are more and more demoralised.</p>
              <p>Meaning, they don't feed parents anymore. No point raising kids, I rather feed my bank account.</p>

              <p>hi gums, been reading ur posts on this topic &amp; here's my views... :)</p>
              <p>1st point - chinese as compared to other races prefers to have less or no kids. chinese have the $$$ factor 24/7 in mind. perhaps due to our parents constant nagging from young of being no. 1 in class so we can hav a good paying job in future. many couples do not want the burden of taking care of kids &amp; prefer to live free &amp; do watever they can aka enjoying lives themselves. And no i do not mean other races do not hav this mentality either...but more chinese in generally. dats why i quietly admire the malays for always having a warmer home as compared to us chinese(but then again i mean in generally, not everyone :)</p>
              <p>2nd point - wanting to hav or not to hav kids is all dat matters, $$$ is secondary. a household income of 6k is definitely more than enuff to raise 2 kids. myself a living example - my wife &amp; i earning less than 6k, we hav 2 kids, live in a 4A hdb, i drive a average car. can be done, why not? :) its all about whether u want to do it or not. pple who claimed tight budget or excuses after excuses...well it simply boils down to the fact they do not want kids for the moment, nothing else :)</p>
              <p>3rd point - i may join later than u to this forum but oso participate far less these days. i used to hav rational points &amp; arguments for my posts but always get shot with "pple who want to win kind of answers" + silly &amp; childish remarks(not from all but still a fair bit). Generally i think u will get more crappy answers than logical ones here, maybe its the stress of living in sg so we hav to talk more cock to survive better :D</p>
              <p>good day :)</p>

              <p><br>What you are talking is the social aspect, but i believe as human, we have a duty to produce our decendents, a duty that our last generation or previous generation had fulfilled and now it is time for us to perform that duty. It will be quite lame for a married couple to go childless even tho they are perfectly healthy to produce just becos of the difficulties in some social aspect such as high cost of living. Bearing in mind that our forefathers came here as labourers with a pathetic pay and foods, yet they produce many childrens.</p>
