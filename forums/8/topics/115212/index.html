Call her the next day.<br><br>2. Always laugh at her jokes.<br><br>3. Tell her (truthfully) that you can't wait to see her again.<br><br>4. Offer her a backrub, without asking for one in return.<br><br>5. Call her just to say you were thinking about her.<br><br>6. Bring her a teddy bear and chicken soup when she's sick.<br><br>7. Write her a poem.<br><br>8. Slow dance with her (not only on a dance floor).<br><br>9. Bring her flowers for no reason.<br><br>10. Send her a (handwritten) letter just to say hello.<br><br>11. Always remember your anniversaries and bring her something sweet.<br><br>12. Kiss her in the middle of a sentence.<br><br>13. Take her for a walk at sunset and stay to look up at the stars.<br><br>14. Tell her something about you that no one else knows.<br><br>15. Remind her that you still think she's beautiful.<br><br>16. Take a bubble bath together.<br><br>17. Watch a sappy movie with her.<br><br>18. Surprise her with a candlelight dinner.<br><br>19. Never stop trying to impress her.<br><br>20.
