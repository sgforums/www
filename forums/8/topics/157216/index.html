UFC fights are good, they are brutal, realistic, and raw.<br><br>But i strongly disagree that "Bruce Lee is not a real Martial Artist", i think it's just that his type of Martial Art is not your type of  Martial Art, that's why u said so. Or Maybe bcos u watched his movies, and the fight in his movie is not realistic, that's why u said so. Bcos in the making of movies, every steps in the fights should be pre-designed before they really shoot it, so it's feels like not realistic. How can it be realistic when u know wat ur opponent's next move is? But that's how they shoot a movie, to make it more dramatic.<br><br>you should check out what is jeet kwun do ("way<br>of the intercepting fist" ), which is a martial Art Bruce lee invented by himself. Many ppl are learning this martial arts, but of cos not as many as those learning Karate, taekwondo, and other martial arts.  jeet kwun do's history is way much shorter than other martial arts, thus less popular.<br><br>And do u even know what is "one inch punch"? That an art to punch something with most strength with least distance. A normal punch takes the leangth of one man's arm to deliver the blow, but in Bruce's one inch punch, it takes only an inch to deliver the blow.<br><br>There are many more great stuff related to Bruce Lee's martial arts, u may serach the internet and find out. If u still think he's not "real Martial Artist" after that, i got nothing more to say. u can still think he's just not  "real Martial Artist" , but many ppl, including me, still thinks that he's one of the greatest martial artist of all time.<br><br></div>

For those who knows it, the shoulder tells all. before u begin to lift up ur leg to deliver a kick, ur shoulder will move first, and it tells ur opponent that u are kicking with left or right leg. So, in JKD of Bruce lee, or why bruce's kick is so fast. It's not only fast, it's actually "early" too. He can see when his opponent is going to deliver a kick and he deliver his kick as early as possible, that's why it seemed to be fast. it's like in a 100m sprint, assume that u and me can run in exactly same speed, then wat determines who's gonna win is that who's going to start running. If u start when u hear the "bang", and i start half a second before the "bang" bcos i guess it right when he's going to trigger the gun, i will win the race by half second bcos i started earlier than u.<br><br>something not related to bruce lee but related to what's mentioned above, the "no shadow kick". Of cos the real thing is not like in movie when they "fly" across the screen and kick like 20 times in mid-air. The real "No shadow kick" is actually nothing to do with shadows or flying up in mid-air, it's about the shoulder too. it's call "wu ying" bcos it leaves no trace or leave least trace for the opponent too see if u are going to deliver a kick. The art of it is too deliver a kick with least shoulder movement. It can also be a fake shoulder movement that makes the opponent thinks that u are using right leg when u are actually using left leg.<br><br></div>
