            <div class='col-md body'>People who are rich can easily pay 12k for a complete set of hand-bag.. 12K is consider small potatoes to them.. like maybe two weeks income.. With only a small minority who flash their high lifestyle, it is often depicted as the lifestyle of the general singapore population as a whole..<br><br>Why does ST interview these people? Its a bloody waste of time..  they should interview a family that live on $1200 per month, then you will know what "financial adjustment" is all about.. I chanced upon one family where-by the child said the slipper is too small, they are so poor that the dad cut the slipper into two and added a slice of rubber glued to the two pieces to enlarge it..<br><br>The kid complained the slice of rubber is different in color from the rest of the slipper, the dad slapped the kid and told him he is lucky to have slippers.. You would imagine this scene from 1950s but it happened only two months ago..<br><br>Weeks after weeks we heard all the lame stories of these rich folks splurging money on hand bags, pastor on their homes, etc.. There is nothing profound or interesting.. Give anyone the money and they will find a way to spend it..<br><br>Why not ask the poor how they live on $1000 a month and you will hear how they use their wits to scrape through in modern singapore.. They struggle just to earn enough money for a days meal.. It is a day to day survivor for many peasants out there, But NO, many still live on self denial mode, when all is definitely not well with singaporeans...<br><br>By Leong Chan Teik<br><br>YOU could say Mrs Gretna Yen, nee Goh, has it all.<br><br>She is a beauty queen, the reigning Classic Mrs Singapore World.<br><br>She's been happily married for 28 years to Peter, 50, a regional director of an engineering firm.<br><br>She has five children aged between 22 and 12. The three youngest are triplets, all girls.<br><br>At work, Mrs Yen is a project director with Keppel Land, and oversees the construction of One Raffles Quay. The landmark office development in Marina South at the New Downtown consists of two towers: one 29 storeys high, the other 50 storeys high.<br><br>But life hasn't always been as rosy, reveals Mrs Yen, 48, in an interview at her Bugis Junction office.<br><br>Q Are you a saver or spender?<br><br>A I'm more of a spender. I spend a lot on the home and my children. I'm a strong believer in keeping the house well-organised and beautiful, so every family member can feel the love and comfort of home.<br><br>For example, in 2000, we made substantial renovations to our terrace house in Upper Serangoon, adding another storey to the existing two-and-a-half.We now have eight bedrooms, three store rooms, a large living-cum-dining room and a roof garden.<br><br>Q What do you indulge in personally?<br><br>A I have a weakness for rings with gemstones, and branded handbags. I consider them reward for my hard work.<br><br>One afternoon, I walked into Chanel and Louis Vuitton outlets, and bought a complete set each of their handbags with matching briefcases and wallets. They cost well over $12,000 in all.<br><br></div>

If she has already done her part for society, it is her right to spend her money however she likes. Even if she does not contribute to society, she has every right to spend however she likes. The money is earned by her, be it from investments etc. She is just pampering herself.<br><br>For example, to a poor man, a meal at McDonald's is an extravaggance. To a rich man, a meal at McDonald's is peanuts. Does that make one morally wrong because they feel like pampering themselves?</div>

BUT its morally wrong when you " show" off in an interview like this when you still see many old folks selling packets of tissue and collecting empty soft-drink cans as their main souce of income in hawker centres, Living wretched old man lives by scrapping and sleeving off old electrical wires of appliances to sell the copper as scrap, cutting out old carton boxes to sell etc...<br><br>What does the article served? when the motive only display " showing off" rather than anything else..<br></div>

The ones I do know personally do donate generously, both time and money. I am not sure what are you trying to insulnate here but when I speak from experience I mean it personally. Not all but the ones I know do. It is the same as you saying the ones you know don't. So as usual, there are two sides of the coin. A side that do and a side that down.<br><br>Well Caramon, if that is your point of argument, I would agree with you that it is insensitive to "show-off" when others are working their arse off to make ends meet. But as how society goes, there will always be someone with a huge ego who wants to show off. I mean it happens every Chinese New Yr as well. Don't have to be monetary. Just look at the different relatives comparing why their kids are much better than the others.<br><br>As well, any government in the world likes to paint a beautiful picture, especially so when the economy is still flagging despite reports that it is improving. They want to keep the average citizens spirits up so that they can pump more money into the economy. Any logical person knows that the average Singaporean won't splurge S$12k on a bag.</div>
