Wat kinda society r we living in if we can't even spend our own hard-earned $ in the way we wan?<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon:</div><div class="quote_body">People who are rich can easily pay 12k for a complete set of hand-bag.. 12K is consider small potatoes to them.. like maybe two weeks income.. With only a small minority who flash their high lifestyle, it is often depicted as the lifestyle of the general singapore population as a whole..<br><br>Why does ST interview these people? Its a bloody waste of time..  they should interview a family that live on $1200 per month, then you will know what "financial adjustment" is all about.. I chanced upon one family where-by the child said the slipper is too small, they are so poor that the dad cut the slipper into two and added a slice of rubber glued to the two pieces to enlarge it..<br><br>The kid complained the slice of rubber is different in color from the rest of the slipper, the dad slapped the kid and told him he is lucky to have slippers.. You would imagine this scene from 1950s but it happened only two months ago..<br><br>Weeks after weeks we heard all the lame stories of these rich folks splurging money on hand bags, pastor on their homes, etc.. There is nothing profound or interesting.. Give anyone the money and they will find a way to spend it..<br><br>Why not ask the poor how they live on $1000 a month and you will hear how they use their wits to scrape through in modern singapore.. They struggle just to earn enough money for a days meal.. It is a day to day survivor for many peasants out there, But NO, many still live on self denial mode, when all is definitely not well with singaporeans...<br><br>By Leong Chan Teik<br><br>YOU could say Mrs Gretna Yen, nee Goh, has it all.<br><br>She is a beauty queen, the reigning Classic Mrs Singapore World.<br><br>She's been happily married for 28 years to Peter, 50, a regional director of an engineering firm.<br><br>She has five children aged between 22 and 12. The three youngest are triplets, all girls.<br><br>At work, Mrs Yen is a project director with Keppel Land, and oversees the construction of One Raffles Quay. The landmark office development in Marina South at the New Downtown consists of two towers: one 29 storeys high, the other 50 storeys high.<br><br>But life hasn't always been as rosy, reveals Mrs Yen, 48, in an interview at her Bugis Junction office.<br><br>Q Are you a saver or spender?<br><br>A I'm more of a spender. I spend a lot on the home and my children. I'm a strong believer in keeping the house well-organised and beautiful, so every family member can feel the love and comfort of home.<br><br>For example, in 2000, we made substantial renovations to our terrace house in Upper Serangoon, adding another storey to the existing two-and-a-half.We now have eight bedrooms, three store rooms, a large living-cum-dining room and a roof garden.<br><br>Q What do you indulge in personally?<br><br>A I have a weakness for rings with gemstones, and branded handbags. I consider them reward for my hard work.<br><br>One afternoon, I walked into Chanel and Louis Vuitton outlets, and bought a complete set each of their handbags with matching briefcases and wallets. They cost well over $12,000 in all.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
