It's opposite<br>Cairnhill CC , 5 mins walk from Newton MRT.<br><br>Please prepare TWO SONGS (One slow/ One Fast) to be sung acapella or<br>accompanied by your own minus one. Bring along a photograph (any photo<br>will do) and your bio-data/resume if possible.<br><br>1. THE SWAMI, THE COW, AND THE SPACEMAN<br>A psychedelic comedy about an American astronaut from the 60s who<br>crashes on a mountain in a failed attempt to reach the moon, and meets<br>an Indian swami and his talking cow. Cultures collide, and the world<br>turns upside down.<br><br>Characters :<br><br>(i) Swami (m) 40+<br>A hermit and religious ascetic who lives on the mountain and enjoys<br>milk and chapattis; Actor should either be Indian, or can do an Indian<br>accent.<br><br>(ii) Cow (f) -<br>A sassy, young talking cow, dressed in the bright flower power dresses<br>from the 60s, and Swami's companion. (Role taken)<br><br>(iii) Spaceman (m) 20-30<br>An American astronaut (born and raised in Texas) on his way to the<br>moon; Actor should either be American, or can do an American<br>(Southern/Texan) accent.<br><br>2. TEN DAYS OF MOURNING<br>A coming-of-age story about a Singapore Indian girl who faces issues<br>of cultural and personal identity during a visit to India. 10 Days of<br>Mourning features modern song structures and lyrical styles using<br>Indian scales.<br><br>Character List<br><br>(i) Veena: 20<br>Veena is wilful. Her relationship with her mother is tense, as Veena<br>tries constantly to assert her independence. In the early scenes, she<br>practices disengagement from the family, in rebellion for having to<br>leave the comforts of home and her life in Singapore, to visit her<br>grandparents in India. She eventually comes around, due largely to her<br>Grandfather's gentle persuasions and some eye-openers from a young<br>musician (Raj). When the musical closes, she understands herself, her<br>family and her culture better than when she reluctantly arrived in<br>India.<br><br>(ii) Mother: 40<br>Veena's mother, having married and had Veena at an early age. She is<br>the sort of person who accepts her fate calmly and makes the best of<br>any situation, believing it better to live happily in the moment.<br>Partly, she has learnt this the hard way, after the death of her<br>husband, early in their marriage, and since she has had to raise her<br>child alone. She is also a musician (she played the Veena) who gave up<br>that passion when she took on the roles of wife and mother. Veena's<br>mother, in her gentle way, teaches Veena about respect, selflessness<br>and that regret is something we should avoid incurring at all cost.<br><br>(iii) Grandfather 60s<br>Veena's grandfather is a dignified man with a gentle, wizened air<br>about him. He is responsible for much of Veena's transformation<br>because he is the only one who does it in a kind, loving way. He often<br>communicates in metaphors, but always makes a strong point. He is the<br>one to first break through Veena's icy exterior.<br><br>(iv) Grandmother 60s<br>Veena's grandmother is playful and humorous. She teases Veena<br>relentlessly and is not averse to colluding with Veena's mother to<br>makes jokes at Veena's expense. She doesn't do this to be mean but<br>rather to counteract Veena's iciness and sulkiness. Whereas Veena's<br>Grandfather gently coaxes Veena out of her shell, Veena's Grandmother<br>playfully heckles her out of it.<br><br>(v) Raj: Late 20s<br>A young, celebrated and widely-travelled musician whose father (also a<br>musician) used to play with Veena's mother. Veena is instantly drawn<br>to him (but not in an overtly romantic way), because of his youth and<br>because of his exposure to other lands and cultures. Veena quizzes him<br>about why he keeps returning to India when he could choose to live<br>anywhere else, and in replying, Raj opens Veena's eyes to the beauty<br>of her motherland.<br><br>Ensemble<br>Three or four people are required for the first scene, in which a<br>beggar-woman and a drinks seller harass Veena and her mother.<br><br>3. ROSES AND HELLO<br>A spunky flower shop owner fights the acquisition of her property by a<br>law tycoon, whose son falls in love with her.<br><br>Main Cast:  All singing parts<br><br>(i). Chris Wee (Male lead) Mid/late 20s<br>An up-and-coming lawyer in the law firm Wee, Bill &amp; Soo LLC.  Son of<br>the firm's senior partner, but also capable, competent, and charming.<br>However, also youthfully naive and has yet to face real challenges in<br>his life.<br><br>(ii). Penny Lee (Female lead)  Mid/late 20s<br>Penny inherits a flower shop, "roses &amp; hello", from her mother. Spunky<br>and determined to succeed, she commits herself to keeping the business<br>afloat, against the advice of those around her.  One of Chris' love<br>interests in the play.<br><br>(iii). Mr William Wee  Late 50s<br>Senior partner in Wee, Bill &amp; Soo LLC.  Chris' father.  Fights to<br>maintain the firm's reputation.   Wee finds himself slowing down with<br>age, and hopes that Chris will take over the reins in the firm.<br><br>(iv). Mr Richard Sooreej  (tentatively a character of Indian<br>ethnicity, but may be flexible)  Late 40s<br>Senior partner in Wee, Bill &amp; Soo LLC.  A driven, self-made man who<br>will let nothing stand in the way of his success.   Has a dubious<br>relationship with Stella.<br><br>(v). Stella  Mid/late 20s<br>Rising star in Wee, Bill &amp; Soo, and also a bombshell of a woman.<br>Intelligent and witty, but also as cold as ice.   Chris is shamelessly<br>infatuated with her.<br><br>(vi). Annie Ting  50s<br>Secretary to William Wee.  They have a deep friendship that has<br>spanned decades - a relationship that might or might not be amorous in<br>nature.<br><br>Also casting for a chorus of 4-6 characters.<br><br>Chorus members must sing and dance (although dancing is optional for<br>the upcoming "highlights" showcase)<br><br>Chorus will play different characters in the course of the play, but<br>most of the time assume the character of a lawyer in the firm.   Parts<br>have been written for individual chorus members (tentatively 4 female<br>and 2 male)<br><br>Chorus will also be required to rehearse as intensively as the leads.<br><br>Please contact Tamara at 81134292 or email<br>tns@uanworld.com should you have any questions.
