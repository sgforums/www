            <div class='col-md body'>muahaha. lets look at it this way. good-boys are not very into places with ear-splitting music. so of course u're unlikely to find them there. Juice is a mag. its gonna make the club look the way the club owners want to potray the club, and the image they want to potray is one thats fun and wild. afterall, who wants to go to a club for a funeral or library atmosphere. u have appropriate places for appropriate atmospheres, and suffice to say, just as u'd expect a library to be silent and soothing, u'd expect a club to be wild and fun, where u can go crazy a bit. comprehend?<br><br>2ndly i really dunno wot u mean about bathing ape or high society. im not familiar with either. i do admit i am quite westernized because i like the western culture and i've also spent the last 10 months in London, some of that influence's bound to rub off on me. But I don't play the guitar, I listen to rock, metal, rap, hip hop and all sorts of dancy music. I'm also rather into a gothic lifestyle. But have u seen those techno clubs? those ah bengs and their techno music? most un-westernized i must say, especially with their "KNN" every other sentence. but they go clubbing too. so your view that clubbers are westernized is already wrong, and your image of what westernized people are like is also seriously flawed.<br><br>To state the long n short, u have no idea what the clubbing scene is actually like.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>From MC-King:</strong><br><blockquote>Those photographers in Juice Magazine will only take pictures of their friends/CELEBRATIES, does it make sense that Mediacrop artiste dressing up for a event?</blockquote>aiyo-yo. wrong spelling lah. not celebraties. it's celebrities. anyway, those are not celebrities lah, if u read the Juice magazines. all normal people, but very wild and mad, as if they just got Nicole Kidman as their girlfriend or like they're gonna marry Brad Pitt tomorrow. Some look like they're the coolest folks on earth. quite fake to me leh, that's the thing.<br><br><blockquote>So where did your concept of clubbers come from? JUICE magazine?</blockquote>not really lah. not just Juice magazine.....also got newspaper mah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>From Heng-ah!:</strong><br><blockquote>Juice is a mag. its gonna make the club look the way the club owners want to potray the club, and the image they want to potray is one thats fun and wild.</blockquote>logical.<br><br><blockquote>afterall, who wants to go to a club for a funeral or library atmosphere. u have appropriate places for appropriate atmospheres, and suffice to say, just as u'd expect a library to be silent and soothing, u'd expect a club to be wild and fun, where u can go crazy a bit. comprehend?</blockquote>logical. but the thing is : i don't understand how they get so wild? i mean, surely got some reason one mah. u cannot go in and just start raving, raging, shouting, dancing like berserk right?<br>but then on the other hand, if i really wanna get wild, got a lot of legal body stimulants that can give you the 'high' feeling(not drugs).<br><br>not to insult you all lah, but if i ever go to pubs, my purpose is to chat up girls and nothing else. the drinks all also overly-hyped up for me. all fancy names.....what Blue Lagoon? can't recall all those names lah. this is where i admire these guys lah. drinks also can give all these kind "outta-this-world" names. Da Vinci's Slice? Solo ballad? Portugese Girl O' War? Tequila Blow? Lazzefaire Gin?<br><br><blockquote>2ndly i really dunno wot u mean about bathing ape or high society. im not familiar with either.</blockquote>all clubbers should be one lah. bathing ape is that no-style t-shirt. the design usually features an ape-face/figure etc.<br>name so phucking ugly and the design also crap. their marketing very top-notch leh. some designs still can sell 1 piece for S$500 and above.<br>besides bathing ape still got a lot of other clubbing terms and brands and accessories lah.<br><br><blockquote>But I don't play the guitar, I listen to rock, metal, rap, hip hop and all sorts of dancy music.</blockquote>aiyah, don't play guitar but listen to rock, metal, rap and all sortta dancy music.....what the difference, bro?<br>ah yes! hip-hop always associated with clubbing one. almost forgot that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote>But have u seen those techno clubs? those ah bengs and their techno music?</blockquote>those are different.....they dare to be themselves and be barbaric mah.<br>those high-society clubs like the few i mentioned earlier really makes me cringe. if they're so obessed, then buy ticket go to San Fransico loh. talk to a pub owner there and beg them to give permit to run direct franchise in SG lah.<br>wanna be westernized, then go all the way lah.<br><br>westernized/very high society pub is ok, they're classy. ah-beng/gangster club also cool. those that are in-between with a mix of SG, West and gangstah are the phucking worst of the whole phucking lot.<br><br><blockquote>most un-westernized i must say, especially with their "KNN" every other sentence.</blockquote>proud to say i'm also one of them lah. no no, seriously....like i already lectured before, KNN is very poetic and rythmic in sentences. all other foul words not good, though.<br><br>anyway, u go clubbing lah. i do my own stuff. to each his own mah, but at least i got some insight lah. for me, i'll do anything except clubbing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>go hotel see, go restaurant, go library, go scenic/nature-related places, go malls, go movies, go beach......anything.<br><br>Proud to be the the world's #1 anti-clubber and anti-faker.<br>Nikar Subramanian Venkata Girish.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heh let it be said that i sort of look down on people who go to clubs purely to chat girls up. And think about it, it is common sense that for every quiet person, there will be someone who likes to be wild. Of course alcohol combined with good music helps. And to say that ah bengs in techno clubs are being themselves while people who go to "westernized" clubs aren't is a fallacy. So why must u assume that people who are in "westernized" clubs are't being themselves? btw, ah bengs n their techno clubs make me cringe too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>anyways the world is diversified. people are all different and thats what makes it interesting. Just because u don't see the point in something doesn't mean others don't, and stereotyping something is just being lazy to go find out for yourself what it is like. Finally, I still don't get your "bathing ape and high society" comments. I've never seen either of these kind of people in the clubs I go to. Stereotyping remember. Perhaps singaporeans really do need to climb out of their well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Perhaps singaporeans really do need to climb out of their well. </strong><br><br>Ooh yeah agree. Tat time i go perth australia theirs is a pub cum striptease show place. You go buy alcoholic drinks and then wait to see striptease performance on the stage. Sometimes the naked dancer will even dance on the bar top. This is something similar to spore bar top dancing minus clothes. Then u see happy customers stuff dollar bills on their teeny weeny bikinis but some gers even take out the bottom bikini but the gers place their hand strategically across their pubic region.<br><br>This is a culture spore do not have. Hmmm... maybe should let those Spore bar top dancers dance naked huh? Follow the ang mo hahahhaha..... will update the peep show culture later....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
