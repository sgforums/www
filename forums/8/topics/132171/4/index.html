            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately I agree that Singaporeans are one of the most uncourteous and inconsiderate bunch. I'm not saying you all are - it's just an observation I have made.<br><br>I left Singapore many years ago and when I hear holidaymakers in my new home country talking, I can always establish whether they are from Singapore (accent, mannerisms). Singaporeans are always complaining, littering, talking loudly or rushing to be the first and oblivious to people around them. It really makes me embarressed to tell people that I was once a Singaporean. Everyone shakes their head when they see Singaporeans behave.<br><br>Now I'm not saying all Singaporeans are rude. It's just that I have yet to see a Singaporean tourist behave in a courteous and gracious manner overseas. Every time I go back to SG for a holiday, I have to get used to the ungraciousness again. I don't see how running to be first in line for the bus can make you get to your destination sooner. And it's sad to see people fighting with the disabled for seats.<br><br>It is a sad, sad fact that I attribute to the upbringing, mentality and cultural mindsets of Singaporeans. Even after so many years, the culture of Singaporeans has not caught up with the increased economic prosperity. Sometimes I wonder if Singapore is fit to wear the tag of a "developed" nation.<br><br>Happy flamin'.</div>

I can only imagine what the poor tour guides must feel hearing a bunch of boorish Singaporeans insulting their homeland.  And don't get me started on the food comments. All I can say is, if you're in Rome, eat what the Romans eat. If you are only willing to eat Singapore/Chinese food, for goodness sake stay at home and don't travel. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> Of course, not ALL Singaporeans are like that, the main culprits are usually the middle-aged housewives/aunties and elderly folks. Thankfully the younger ones seem to be able to conduct themselves with more decorum(well, not all of them).</div>
