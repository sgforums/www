            <div class='col-md body'>I think <strong>some</strong> Singaporeans can be complete wankers. I fractured my knee last saturday playin basketball with some cool Singaporean players who played well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">, but what hurt me was when i went to Alexandra hospital for treatment.<br><br>I am now moving onto what I dislike about <strong>some </strong>local people, their complete lack of empathy for others, such as myself yesterday night (even IF I AM a half white devil whose very presence symbolizes the evil colonial Englishman all of you local people hate). I paid the cab driver, opened the door to get to A&amp;E, my knee gave way and I fell flat on my face haha! I was just like Arthur in the movie Arthur (he was pissing drunk on whisky when he fell out of the taxi). I picked myself up and hobbled weakly in front of the staring Singaporeans, the nearest couple didn't seem to care about me, as were eagerly preparing to take now-empy taxi. I fell down a couple of times again, no one bothered to help nor showed any concearn for me.<br><br>Now you're probably going to same something mean like "why should they help someone so MEAN like M@a", say it then.. and prove my point.<br><br>But it is no big deal haha, just an incident i recalled after having looked at this thread to see how i can contribute.<br><br></div>
