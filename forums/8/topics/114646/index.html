            <div class='col-md body'>Contrast to what many ppl believe about the rich and the poor...here is what i actually found when browsing through a book in my estore...The Guru's Guide to Money Management:<br><br>Â• Millionaires believe in being frugal. Most millionaires have never spent more than 41k for an automobile or $38 for a hair cut (including tip). They have their shoes resoled and always develop a shopping list before going shopping. Many Millionaires are price sensitive when purchasing products such as automobiles and clothes that lose all or most of their initial value after the sate of purchase. They also believe in buying quality products and in making them last and living below their means.<br><br>Â• Millionaires believe in owing their home but seek to have a small outstanding mortgage. Many millionaires believing in purchasing an existing home rather than building a new one and that one should never pay the asking price. They look to purchase a home that is likely to appreciate in value, reasoning that the quality of the public schools in the area is a good predictor of the likelihood that the house will appreciate in value.<br><br>Â• They believe in living a comfortable but not extravagant lifestyle. For example, they dont indulge in fancy and expensive vacations<br><br>Â• They believe in doing work that they love and that peopleÂ’s choice of vocation has much to do with their success in life<br><br>Â• These millionaires believe in working hard, but they also think it is important to spend time with family and friends. They donÂ’t feel that one has to be a workaholic to succeed. They avoid Â“do-it-yourselfÂ” activities, preferring instead to work hard at their main vocation and spend the rest of their free time doing what is enjoyable.<br><br>Â• They strive to balance their financial goals and their lifestyles. They feel that there is a positive correlation between the number of activities people take part in and their net worth.<br><br>Â• The millionaires believe that the best things in life are free, or at least reasonably priced<br><br>Â• They think that luck has little to do with success and have little regard for gambling or playing lottery. They believe that their Â‘luckÂ’ is a product of hard work and that the harder they work, the luckier they will become.<br><br>Â• The millionaires know that there is a strong correlation between oneÂ’s willingness to take financial risk and oneÂ’s level of wealth. They see economic risk taking as a requirement for becoming financially independent.<br><br>Â• Millionaires look for opportunities to provide a product or service that has strong demand but few suppliers to fulfill that demand. They donÂ’t follow the crowed when it comes to deciding what to sell or how to invest. They think that success comes at the price of not being one of the gang, one of the good boys.<br><br>Â• They believe its risky not to be self-employed<br><br>Â• Finally, the millionaires think that becoming wealthy is a mind game and that before you can become a millionaire, you have to think like one</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mebbe successful at managing your money but I think the points you listed are only part of the formula.<br><br>An example would be John D Rockerfella the oil magnate.<br><br>Born poor into a strict baptist family led an upright disciplined life :- no drinking, no gambling no whoring. Frugal saver and frequently gave to charities very hardworking model citizen.<br><br>But he employed sharp methods and underhand means to put all his rivals out of business &amp; a scoundrel when it came to money. Back in the days when the only means of transporting large volume of oil was by rail, he bought out and controlled many of these railroad enterprises thereby bringing rivals to their knees and forcing them out of business.<br><br>When some of his rivals started using pipelines to move oil, to circumvent he sent teams into the vast american countryside in advance to buy up huge tracts of land or create trouble and sabotage these construction sites, or he bought out &amp; threatened building materials companies not to do business supplying pipes to his rivals.<br><br>at the height of his business empire his behemoth company standard oil controlled 90% of of the oil business in america, a wily fox the US government spent 30 years chasing him trying to break up his company.<br><br>There are many other businessmen leaders like him, smiling faces on the surface scoundrels and slave drivers underneth<br><br>Moral of the story?

They like root for the underdog if he wins against all odds and like to believe that he did it thru honest means, common folk like to romantised these things.<br><br>But unfortunately it is never the case, Very rich people are ruthless, like conquerors of olden times. I do not doubt for a minute these rich people are smart and very hardworking and very disciplined as most perfectionist are.<br><br>But I do doubt that they did it without being ruthless and underhand.<br><br>I won't be surprised one day if someone wrote on Lakshmi N Mittal and you find out that he actually very ruthless.</div>
