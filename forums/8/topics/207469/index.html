            <div class='col-md body'>When in doubt. always ask the job agencies for the company details. It is your right to know which company you are applying to. It is also good for you to check up on the company history before going down for a interview at the company, just in case the interviewer ask you what do you know about the company. Job agencies are just a middleman, they match people to the company only.</div>
