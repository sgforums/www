Maybe cos the reason they dont have army....As for the guys, they are immature in a different way though,they are still stuck in the "chasing after gals" syndrome after expereincing the 2 year shithole, they can get along with the world easily but iits purely on a standalone basis....S</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think 90s have really been a transition of a lot of things. Some craze come and go.  For E.G<br><br>1)Bubble Tea<br><br>2)J-POP - This sure ly was a hit.  Quite sad it somehow disappear. Jpop was really a hip culture.<br><br>3)Bubble Pop - Aqua , Dr Bombay , Venga Boys<br><br>4)Ah Bengs / Ah Lians .<br><br>My sec school always have this Ahbeng/ahlian culture where these group normally do things like smoke , play truant , scold tracher in school. Then after school , they will hang out around void decks. Topics they like to talk are "Where to Chiong?" ,  vulgarities. And every friday they go Sparks /Boat Quay and stuff. The way they walk and lifestyle are the likes of this Hong-Kong gangster show like "Gu Huo Zai".<br><br>5)This 90s hair-style which somehow disappear in the 20s now. (I realise most of the 20 teens are having "rooster" hairstyles). Can someone help me identify?<br><br>6)Techno Music rulez over Trance.<br><br>7)Arcade - DDR / Para Para .<br><br>8 )Handphone that are modified to look like techno light<br><br>9)Singers like Leon Lai , Aaron Kwok . Andy Lau , Jackie Cheung , Alex Toh rulez in the 90s . Taiwan singers aren't that popular yet. I labelled Zhang Zhen Yue as one of the 90s well-known Taiwan rocker. Some came and go like Jimmy Lin.<br><br>10)TCS sudden urge to produce a lot of swordfighting shows . And big big production like golden pillow (Where to find their songgs ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). Any shows by Fann Wong/Zoe Tay are a sure to catch.<br><br>11)Countdown to Christmas/ New Year Millinieum. The party before yr 2000. Still vivid in my mind. Still remember the whole of orchard crowded.<br><br>12)Pubs/Bars/Dances are fuming in Boat Quay/Clark Quay. A hot favourite among those chiongsters. I remember Sparks was hot too. And this place in Marina Square one. Canto pub themed.. Forget the name.  I went to Sparks once and I still remember they play this song - think its "Espresso - Drive Me Crazy", then the clubbers will somehow chant this rythymic call to the song. This chant will screamed from one corner to another.<br><br>Can someone continue this list? Sure there's a lot of 90s moments and captures<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess everyone go through different stages in your life. After getting your first job first paycheck, you get married have kids and then work until retirement. During our teens we yearn to be financially independent to buy things we want.<br><br>But now reaching 30's I think maybe teens is better. Life in the 30's is about bills and bills and more bills to pay every month. Not to mention more responsibility and stress <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

Some craze come and go.  For E.G<br><br>1)Bubble Tea<br><br>2)J-POP - This sure ly was a hit.  Quite sad it somehow disappear. Jpop was really a hip culture.<br><br>3)Bubble Pop - Aqua , Dr Bombay , Venga Boys<br><br>4)Ah Bengs / Ah Lians .<br><br>My sec school always have this Ahbeng/ahlian culture where these group normally do things like smoke , play truant , scold tracher in school. Then after school , they will hang out around void decks. Topics they like to talk are "Where to Chiong?" ,  vulgarities. And every friday they go Sparks /Boat Quay and stuff. The way they walk and lifestyle are the likes of this Hong-Kong gangster show like "Gu Huo Zai".<br><br>5)This 90s hair-style which somehow disappear in the 20s now. (I realise most of the 20 teens are having "rooster" hairstyles). Can someone help me identify?<br><br>6)Techno Music rulez over Trance.<br><br>7)Arcade - DDR / Para Para .<br><br>8 )Handphone that are modified to look like techno light<br><br>9)Singers like Leon Lai , Aaron Kwok . Andy Lau , Jackie Cheung , Alex Toh rulez in the 90s . Taiwan singers aren't that popular yet. I labelled Zhang Zhen Yue as one of the 90s well-known Taiwan rocker. Some came and go like Jimmy Lin.<br><br>10)TCS sudden urge to produce a lot of swordfighting shows . And big big production like golden pillow (Where to find their songgs ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). Any shows by Fann Wong/Zoe Tay are a sure to catch.<br><br>11)Countdown to Christmas/ New Year Millinieum. The party before yr 2000. Still vivid in my mind. Still remember the whole of orchard crowded.<br><br>12)Pubs/Bars/Dances are fuming in Boat Quay/Clark Quay. A hot favourite among those chiongsters. I remember Sparks was hot too. And this place in Marina Square one. Canto pub themed.. Forget the name.  I went to Sparks once and I still remember they play this song - think its "Espresso - Drive Me Crazy", then the clubbers will somehow chant this rythymic call to the song. This chant will screamed from one corner to another.<br><br>Can someone continue this list? Sure there's a lot of 90s moments and captures<br><br></div></blockquote>Who can forget the infamous Annabel Chong?.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Add that to the list..another one would be starbucks coffee and pagers...yea pagers...These humble devices were widespread for a brief period of time...remember how the dicipline master used to catch people bringing pagers to school?...It never got the respect anyway ,teated like some Contraband item..Nowadays the teens carry all sorts, HPs, PDA,laptops..These items were very ex during the 90s and not yet in mainstream use.....There was a sort of PDA device existed  which one of my friends were carrying but it was in monochrome lcd, an early version of a PDA ..like a calculator..cant remember the name for it.Those days we werent so rich i guess..</div>
