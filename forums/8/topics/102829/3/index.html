It started with alternative which now is mainstream. These days it's all black man music. In the 90s, the only way black man music could make it was if they killed each other off and got some press for that. All the rock chicks used to hang out at jam studios (me included oh god i'm so embarrassed).<br><br>Sigh.. Ya know that pagar of mine.. The usual codes we used to page each other. Like 999 at the back of our phone numbers. Or 1-177155-4 hahahahahhhhahahahhaha..<br>Man, those big big water bottle mobiles in the 90s.<br><br>All of us had hair like that picture... short at the back and sloping down to our chins.. Unfortunately i could never quite get my hair to sit properly.<br><br>All the girls had Chantal Thomas quilted bags, burberry wallets, JPG wallets (only $300 then but seemed so expensive then), Ferragamo ribbon hairclips. The beng had their Versace underwear.. where they used to tuck their Ralph Lauren/Tommy Hilfiger shirt INTO THEIR UNDERWEAR and had white jeans with gold VERSACE labels on the pockets. hheheeeehhehehe.. OMG OMG...<br><br>And who can forget Nex.Is.. remember that huge teenage shop in Taka? Don't forget that platform shoes made a revival. I threw out all evidence of platform shoes. EEEk.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Boddah pronounced, Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complained. This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings from the Punk Rock 101 Courses over the years, it's my first introduction to the, shall we say ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has been proven to be very true. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to, as well as creating music, along with really writing something for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things, for example when we're backstage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowd begins. It doesn't affect me in the way which it did for say Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love and relish the love and admiration from the crowd, which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can't fool you, any of you. It simply isn't fair to you, or to me. The worst crime can think of would be to pull people off by faking it, pretending as if I'm having one 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as though I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on-stage. I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it, and I do, God believe me, I do, but it's not enough. I appreciate the fact that I, and we, have affected, and entertained a lot of people. I must be one of the narcisists who only appreciate things when they're alone. I'm too sensitive, I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasm. But, what's sad is our child. On our last three tours, I've had a much better appreciation of all the people I've known personally, and as fans of our music. But I still can't get out the frustration, the guilt, and the sympathy I have for everybody. There is good in all of us, and I simply love people too much. So much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little sensitive unappreciative pisces Jesus man! why don't you just enjoy it? I dont know! I have a of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy, and a daughter who reminds me to much of what I use to be, full of love and joy, every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm, and that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I cant stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable self destructive, deathrocker I become. I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along and have empathy, EMPATHY. Only because I love and feel for people too much I guess. Thank you from the pit of my burning nauseas stomach for your letters and concern during the last years. I'm too much of a neurotic moody person and I don't have the passion anymore, so remember, it's better to burnout, than fade away. Peace, love, empathy, Kurt Cobain. Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your altar. Please keep going Courtney for Frances for her life which will be so much happier without me. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU!</div>

Ericsson  brand was popular...Many of the things tha tu see technology wise during the 90s are the same , only contuining in a evolving fashion...remember the new CG technology in Jurassic park back then, its still being used today...<br>Pentium-class computer was invented and 90s saw 2 iterations of 16 bit windows Win95 &amp; 98..Gaming consoles saw a new image altogwether with Cd based systems and full 3D worlds..Now u see the same thing but with better effects thats all..The DVD was invented in 1995 and the first DVD player in Singapore Panasonic was released in 97...The 56K Internet gained mainstream by 1997 and was broadband was still new...<br><br>Sad to say, the playground culture actually died out somewhere in he mid 90s due to things like Internet, pagers, all of a kids found themselves doing other things like IRC,making new friends ect.. ..But in the 80s , it was still alive and kicking</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was a teen in the 90's.  It was really a time of transition, computers started to become a common thing and cg stuff started to improve at a higher rate in movies.  Pretty sad for the kids who didn't get to grow up in the 'non-computer' era.  They really don't know how good they have it.  But they also missed out actually play all the games like tag and stuff instead of playing video games.</div>
