The 20s pple are going into another another phase of life whereby it is time to think of settling down or mellow down.....may not party as much as b4 as your priorities are different now. Have to move on.<br><br>There will always be this transition thingy. Fr Pri sch to Sec sch....fr young adult to a parent.......<br>At times, it can be stressful to handle so many things at a time like work, exams, relationship, family, etc.  In the different phases of life, you will have different things to worry about.<br><br>Try to take things/challenges as they come.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, the 90s were great.The world was filled with a great sense of optimism and hope.You did not need to worry too much about the world and you could just go out and have fun.Being a 20s and above is not easy.Lotsa responsiblities start coming your way..NS, Uni life, the works.Most of my friends are still trying to bridge that gap because teenage life was great and some part of it still lives on inside us.We can still laugh at things that make us guffaw back then and it brings back memories of the good ol' days in Sec School and JC.<br><br>The 21st Century is gonna be a very rocky one, some parts of our lives have been affected irrevocably.E.g you migh never have expected o bump into a squad of heavily armed troopers while you're having your seafood at Chomp Chomp.It does make you sober that this world could suddenly be a more dangerous place.For this to come together with our entry into the harsh world, it's a killer double combo.<br><br></div>
