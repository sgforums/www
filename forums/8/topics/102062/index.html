It's the same for animals, beast or insects, not because of sex, but because mascline energy produce drive, passion and energy, while feminine energy produce passive attraction. Law of Polarity.<br><br>II) Astrologically speaking, it doesn't always happen this way. From time to time, we do see female initiating a chase (I have a good friend belonging to this category) - this is explained by the astrological energy existing in a person's birth pattern, which also includes the theory above. (A woman with massive mascline energy will have the tendency to initiate chase as she believe in getting the one she loves instead of being passive)<br><br>Woman have an idea who they like? Even most man themselves don't even know, being the 'rightful' initiator. Emotional reflection is something people don't really do or understand - that's why we are often confused about and over our emotional needs. What we truely need and not filling up voids in these empty spaces. And of course, when AOS (Art of Seduction) comes into the picture, it spills into other side of the story altogether.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
