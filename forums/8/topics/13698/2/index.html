If you really go into all the doctrines of different religions you will see they contradict each other. Even Buddhism contradicts Taoism in some aspects, and the Quran of Islam (supposed to be Allah's words) denys Judaism and Christianity etc etc<br>From this sense I can see that you dont really have any concrete stands of any religion. As you claim you accept Islam as it is, you didnt really accept what Allah said about misled Christians and Jews, and as you claim you accept Judaism as it is, you didnt really accept the fact that Jewsish bible deny Jesus, as you claim you accept Christianity as it is, you didnt really accept what the Bible said about the wrong way of worshipping God as statues or stones in Hinduism/Taosim.<br>There is no conclusion to this, but I just want to tell you your thinking about "universal" religion is wrong.<br><br>There are many who say "All routes lead to Rome".

Go, do your due dilligence.<br><br>However do it impartially and not as a challenge to proof to people that they are wrong( in this case, in ur view, all gods are the same) as that will make you accept information to back your up "proofs" and subconciously reject those that are otherwise.<br><br>If objectivity is the mission, then one day you will discover your God.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a></div>

Scientific advances were imported after the west came into contact with the Arabs during the crusades.<br><br>If what you mean by early scientists are luminaries like Galileo and Issac Newton, then you must know that these people came after the Arab astronomers, mathematicians and physicians. Even Newton was not a "true" Christian. He wrote a paper attacking the concept of trinity.<br><br>Throughout long centuries, the spirit of Europe was oppressed by a religious system that embodied the contempt of human nature. To ascribe, therefore, the practical achievements of modern western civilisation to Christian teachings is not accurate. Christianity has contributed very little to the powerful scientific and material development in which the present western civilisation of the west excels all others. Indeed, these achievements rose out of Europe's age-long intellectual fight against the Church and its historical hostility towards science. The history of the Middle Ages is full of the bitter struggle between the genuis of Europe and the Church.<br><br>Galileo was forced, on pain of life imprisonment and later, exile, to recant his views that the Earth orbited around the sun. Church authorities at that time believed otherwise because of a verse in the Bible:<br><br>"So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, Until the nation avenged themselves of their enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day." (RSV Bible, Joshua 10:13)<br><br>A further proof that the legacy of the Arabs still remain with us today is the fact that we use their numbers...1, 2, 3, 4, 5...all these are Arabic numerals...<br><br>Verses in the Bible that purport to be scientific are vague, at best.<br><br>To clarify though, how old do you think the earth is?<br><br>And, if you think that the existence of scientific verses in the Bible is cause for such awe, how do you explain the verses that exist in, say, the koran?<br><br>Another question that seems to be avoided is:<br><br>"do you believe that the bible has errors?"<br><br>[This message has been edited by yidd (edited 19 February 2002).]</div>

The Old Testament specially, is peppered with factual errors regarding, for example, the reigns, and also ages, of various kings. Although the errors are numerical in nature, it is inescapable that they are also event-related.<br><br>One telling example of an event-related discrepancy is found in the New Testament. The area which has generated the most discussion concerns the angels who were present at the tomb of Jesus. The gospels according to Mark and Matthew relate that there was only one angel in the tomb, while Luke and John insist that there were two angels.<br><br>The apologist's explanation for this seeming contradiction is interesting, but I shall leave it out because I'd like to know if your explanation for this tallies with the one I have.<br><br>As for doctrinal differences. You insist that there are none, but this is not the case. There are doctrinal differences between the various denominations. For example, one denomination's (won't mention names for fear of libel) clergy is allowed to marry, whilst another denomination's clergy is not allowed to marry. How does one reconcile the doctrinal disparity? Should we return to the Bible and see what it says?<br><br>"It is good for a man not to marry." (NIV, 1 Corinthians 7:1)<br><br>Furthermore, there are doctrines which the Church no longer practices, either because it's considered outmoded, or too cumbersome. One of this is the covering of Christian women's head and hair during prayer.<br><br>"And every woman who prays or prophecises with her head uncovered dishonors her head." (NIV, 1 Corinthians 14:12)<br><br>Brings new meaning to the 'todung' (not sure if I spelt it correctly) controvosy in Singapore, doesn't it?<br><br>The question begs to be answered. What is the difference if the errors are numerical or event-related in nature? Isn't an error still an error? The issue is that errors and contradictions exist in the Bible, a scripture that most, if not all, Christians regard as infallible and inerrant. With the knowledge that such trivail errors can occur in the Bible, how confident are we that all the teachings in the Bible are rooted in truth? Or does Christianity call for a psychological double-bind? In which, as a Christian, I am supposed to acknowledge that "numbers and figures" errors do occur, but that there are absolutely no mistakes in the Bible with regards to doctrines and dogmas.<br><br>If such is the case, shouldn't there be only one unified Bible, instead of the many versions that we find today? Shouldn't there be only one Church, instead of one that is splintered by denominations?"<br><br>My point is, the greatest evidence that the Biblical scriptures were corrupted by men is the errors that are contained therein. Most Christians think that the men who recorded down the Biblical scriptures were imbued with the Holy Spirit. However, it is strange why the Holy Spirit never saw fit to correct the errors that abound in it. Even the early Church's criteria for selecting the books of the New Testament is suspect (if you want, I can reprint the "standards" that they used. I came across it in the World Book Encyclopedia) Hebrews and Revelations were not part of the orginal canon until later. They were added in on the "spiritually-guided" authority of the early Church.<br><br>I hope you can find the time to answer...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>PS: I appreciate that you lack Fishersprice's irrepressible charm...<br><br>[This message has been edited by yidd (edited 19 February 2002).]</div>

It could be man's translation thru language idiosyncrasies that such errors, if any at all arise.<br><br>You may say its blind faith. Well, when I step into an aeroplane, I expect the engine to work. There may be malfunction, but do you stop and inspect the plane after reading up all the mechanics of a plane, tearing it apart piece by piece to look for errors before stepping into one for your vacation? Of course you won't isn't it for people will think you siow liow eh? Do you call that blind faith?<br><br>Everytime we cross the road, the traffic system may not be completely fool proof and there is a possibilty that we may be knocked down no matter how remote, yet we cross it. Does that mean we have to dig into every nitty gritty thing before we can take a decision? If that is life, that will be terrible isn't it?<br><br>Of course we must not be reckless and have to narrow the margin of error to as slim as possible. Every philosophy, religion, way of life, atheist, agnostics...etc will have people challenging it having errors and inconsistencies. So are we saying that since the bible has "errors"( in ur own view), the others do not have and thereby all the rest are correct? Can you be sure too? Or do you have to challenge with all those?<br><br>Christian doctrine and so do many other religions speak on faith.

But it is a mistake to think that stepping into an aeroplane without first checking its mechanics is the same as stepping into Christianity without first questioning the veracity of the Bible.<br><br>If you think that a mistake like the one below is a "perceived" one:<br><br>"There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with GALL, but after tasting it, he refused to drink it." (matt 27:34)<br><br>vs.<br><br>"Then they offered him wine mixed with MYRRH, but he did not take it." (mrk 15:23)<br><br>Then you are right, blind faith is the order of the day... and fishersprice shouldn't propogate his religion at the expense of other faiths.<br><br>[This message has been edited by yidd (edited 19 February 2002).]</div>
