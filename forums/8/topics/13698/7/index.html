Also, care to tell me MORE about the TRINITY - Father (GOD), Jesus (God's son) and ESPECIALLY the HOLY SPIRIT...? What do they mean...?</div></blockquote>Hi Devil, to give you a further insight into the doctrine of Trinity, let me reprint an extract of the Athanasian Creed:<br><br>3. And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;<br><br>4. Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.<br><br>5. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>6. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is all one, the glory equal, the majesty coeternal.<br><br>7. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit.<br><br>8. The Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated.<br><br>9. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Spirit incomprehensible.<br><br>10. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.<br><br>11. And yet they are not three eternals but one eternal.<br><br>12. As also there are not three uncreated nor three incomprehensible, but one uncreated and one incomprehensible.<br><br>13. So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty.<br><br>14. And yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.<br><br>15. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God;<br><br>16. And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.<br><br>17. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit Lord;<br><br>18. And yet they are not three Lords but one Lord.<br><br>19. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord;<br><br>20. So are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say; There are three Gods or three Lords.<br><br>21. The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.<br><br>22. The Son is of the Father alone; not made nor created, but begotten.<br><br>23. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.<br><br>24. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.<br><br>25. And in this Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater or less than another.<br><br>26. But the whole three persons are coeternal, and coequal.<br><br>27. So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.<br><br>28. He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.<br><br>Interestingly, in Hinduism, the Supreme Godhead is known as Brahman. Hindus declare that there is only one Supreme Being and He is the God of all religions. Hindus view cosmic activity of the Supreme Being as comprised of three tasks: creation, preservation, and dissolution and recreation. Hindus associate these three cosmic tasks with the three deities, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Collectively, this unity is called "Trimurti". Lord Brahma brings forth the creation and represents the creative principle of the Supreme Being. Lord Vishnu maintains the universe and represents the eternal principle of preservation. Lord Shiva represents the principle of dissolution and recreation. These three deities together form the Trimurti. One must clearly understand that Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are not three independent deities. They represent the same power (the Supreme Being), but in three different aspects.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>[This message has been edited by yidd (edited 22 February 2002).]</div>

Even as you attain enlightenment, you got to leave your relatives and parents on Earth suffering. Remember that to reach enlightenment you got to cut off ties with your parents and relatives , you think that is acceptable? It's just the same lah, you're just giving yourself excuses.
