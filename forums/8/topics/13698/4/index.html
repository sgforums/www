I will believe your claims of divine assistance in your 'A' levels if you instead of mugging hard, languished in despair and hopelessness instead and then have the same results. Tell u my exp with 'A' levels. I thought I would flunk my Biology, but I got A! So did some of my frens, but we're not christians. There are logical reasons for things happening: a)My JC was purposely killing us with promos, make us mug harder. b)The standard of Bio students elsewhere is just too fud up! Bell Curve, no miracle.<br><br>Same with your work, good bonus, company doing good and you perform well. What if u get retrenched (touch wood), will u blame it on divinity? If not, why attribute success to it? Well, if you insists that your successes stem from divine intervention, then similar, under what kind of scenarios will it require to denounce divinity? I don't think any, becos even in worse case scenarios like death, christians have an 'escape valve', they claim *** have a larger role for the deceased to play.<br><br>To all believers out there, I say have a little faith in yourself, you deserve it, u are what u are credit to your actions, becos it will not happen if u sat there and do nothing.<br><br>[This message has been edited by CS (edited 19 February 2002).]</div></blockquote>Hi CS, as I have clarified to Meg25 about my prelim grades, I believe I am going to die there. My form teacher was trying her best not to make me more discouraged but I know she felt the same thing too.<br>But anyway, it's the past and God proved them wrong.<br><br>How many can climb from 3F to 3 "A" level passes and can still go S'pore Uni? I know what's like to have confidence with myself. Even with all the encouragements from friends then, I have none. Even when I am a a few weeks old christian then, I even doubted that GOD can help me. In fact, I am angry with HIM for not helping me in the exams because I felt no difference in myself.<br>But the Lord send me strong christians to help me. And all they can do is to pray for me. ANd so I waited for my results and see if that so call Jesus can help me. Well I am very surprise myself!!!<br><br>No confidence....it's like meeting a runaway lion. You cannot hope for strength against it, neither can you hope for speed. You can act like a stone statue or put your head in the ground to pretend not to see it. You know he is going to maul you down.<br>That's the kind of confidence I have in the "A" levels. And the Lord made me survive.<br><br>I have records of how God helped me thru' the NS, the Uni, when I am actually lost in the rural part of Malaysia, I have seen a 25 year old NTU fren kana a severe stroke and was meant to die (doctor said so) but God woke him up in time and the Lord restored him completely (he is now doing his IA), I have cancer patients that the doctors said have 6 months to live but the Lord cured her. All these are real, you can pretend not to to see it but I can show proofs...<br><br>I can pretend that all these are coincidence. But the number of times God let these coincidence occur before me cannot be ignored. I tried to compare the number of tragedies I have to the number of "coincidence" I have during my prayer...I gave up in the end because there is too many good things to count.<br><br>Thanks again CS for the encouraging words, I appreciate them.<br><br>[This message has been edited by MCD (edited 20 February 2002).]</div>
