            <div class='col-md body'>I understand in part how you feel about it. Cant possibly comprehend it entirely because I am not in the same situation as yourself. One thing I do know is He understands how you feel and He has all the answers for you that most of us here do not. Ask Him yourself, and I know you will find your answers. Have you heard Him address this issue with you? If you have not, then it only means you left without having any answers other that the ones you have decided based on your comprehension. Most of the time we cannot understand His ways and His thoughts untill we allow Him to speak to us abt them. The Lord will come to our level and talk to us thru the Bible, genuine people ard us(sometimes rude people), our inward witness...He will speak to you, only humbly seek Him and ask Him. As believers, we all have a "love affair" with Him that will last forever. He loves all of us, and yet loves each of us at the same time in a unique way. Dun depart from your first love due to earthly circumstances, God can restore all things if we let Him. Its really for you to open your heart and hear what He has to say to you.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by obiwan:</div><div class="quote_body"> MCD, Come to think of it, i guess i know why i did it.

No doubt I will have eternal life with god if i choose to believe him, but what about these souls, they will not be with me... what is the use of me enjoying in heaven while my earthly parents is in hell forever? will i be happy? will i forget about them? hell is no temp, but is an eternal deathbed for non-believers.<br><br>no, i won't be happy even heaven is promise to be sinless and without saddness, and god will take away all my pains.<br><br>just like the way you feel for jesus when he was crucified and suffered. I feel it the same for my earthly parents.<br><br>maybe i am stupid, but i am not heartless... if my earthly parents will to be burn in hell forever, then in hell i will go too...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Lord has already forgiven us of all sins. As written in Romans everywhere, once purgedand forver forgiven. Our yesterday sins, today and tomorrow have all been forgiven. God sees each believer as if He is looking at the Lord Jesus - sinless. The Bible said we can now boldly come into His presence, means we are sinless in the eyes of God. If God still judge us based on our merits we would have all been fried already. But He has given us the gift of righteousness, the abundance of grace...a believer does not earn his righteousness Christ paid a high price for it...a believer simply receive it. Many times the walk of a believer contradicts himself, but it can never undo what the Lord has done for him. The believer is completely forgiven so much so he now calls God his Heavenly Father and Jesus his big brother. Believers still do fall into sin because believers are still in the body of sin, the flesh is prone to sin. But if a believer realises the abundance of grace given him, he has the ability to over sin. We are all forgiven Obiwan becos of Christ. Any problems or issues, a believer needs only to seek the Lord and I promise you the person will get his answer. God doesnt just work in "msyterious ways", in fact those words were never used in the Bible...The Lord will come down to our level to teach us because He loves us all. We can humble ourselves and ask Him, and He will answer us. Its a relationship with the everlasting Father...not just a routine.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by obiwan:</div><div class="quote_body"> thanks rubbie, i know you really did understand how i feel and i too know what you are saying. i guess, like you all always said, god works in mysterious ways and we are only humans. how can we ever possibly understand the works of god and his greatness.<br><br>important thing here is not fighting, arguing and doubting, but follows what god tells you too and walk in the path of light and not darkness.<br><br>imagine i as a christian dragging to church every sunday, cos just to show my face.<br>imagine i as a christian speaks of god, but deep down inside, i walk a path of sins.<br><br>imagine everything i do is just a routine as a christian, say grace cos we must do it, pray cos we must do it, daily bread cos we must do it...<br><br>will it be good, no. that's why i also left christ because everything is not from my heart anymore, everything is just for show...<br><br>how many people really walk the path of faith with real understanding and example?<br><br>there are not many who can do it, but if you must know, for you it is jesus... you are not called christians for no reasons, remember christians - christ in me.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think this is the most interesting religious thread with yidd around controlling and putting those arrogant kids down. And i think religious arguement should end if possible or else flame might be stirred up again by some idiot out to create problems. Then we have to trouble yidds again to question them down and having them searching their bible fruitlessly for answer or finally ah_nic to close the thread again. It will never be ending. To those religious fanatic, post only if you can provide answers to those unanswered questions and not to behave like that what the fish Roy is doing posting only when he see a chance to tsk at others, quoting from bible without using his brain without consideration, agreeing to those who support his cause and still not providing answer but avoiding serious question by yidd.<br><br>Roy, seriously go get a life.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 26 February 2002).]</div>
