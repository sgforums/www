Unless someone out there can show me some hard evidence. I find it hard to accept christianity.<br><br>Secondly, if Christianity is so great. Why are there so many factions eg. Methodists &amp; Catholics. For all I can see, Christianity is bullshit. Take for instance Northern ireland, Pple are killing children for crossing their streets to get to their School just because, they dun belong to their "faction" of Christianity.<br><br>Lastly, If u read through SE Asia history. THe Europeans under the pretext of Spreading Christianity to colonise SE Asia countries. Especially Islam. We are made 3rd -class citizens in our own land. The Dutch, Portuguese, British all used Christianity to invade our land and oppress our forefathers.<br><br>Conclusion : Christianity is evil......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no religion is evil cos no religion ask people to commit crimes and start animosity. no religion advocates hatred and jealousy, nor anger and violence.  in fact, all religions preach otherwise - peace, love and harmony.<br><br>christianity evil? nay... you are liable to not accept christianity as your religion, nor that it's real. but to condemn it to evilness, that's a tad bit too extreme.<br><br>i'm not christian, but methinks it's a loving religion. don't condemn a religion before giving it a chance. same logic as don't judge a book by it's cover...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Xiaosa:</div><div class="quote_body">Any of you pple out there know the origins of the Bible.

I find it hard to accept christianity.<br><br>Secondly, if Christianity is so great. Why are there so many factions eg. Methodists &amp; Catholics. For all I can see, Christianity is bullshit. Take for instance Northern ireland, Pple are killing children for crossing their streets to get to their School just because, they dun belong to their "faction" of Christianity.<br><br>Lastly, If u read through SE Asia history. THe Europeans under the pretext of Spreading Christianity to colonise SE Asia countries. Especially Islam. We are made 3rd -class citizens in our own land.

            <div class='col-md body'>Benjamin,<br><br>I guess why you feel that way is because you have compassion. Compassion is a far greater than love itself. Love sometimes is selfish in some extent if you think of it. Actually you are quite right in saying the lamb thing, that is why buddhism does not encourage people to eat meat if possible. I am not sure if you know about buddhism. But here goes the reason, we believe that all animals are living souls too, the reason they are in this form is due to the fact that they are having a bad karma and they are repaying for it. Once they repaid all the bad karma, they will be able to get reincarinated to an better form like humans or gods.<br><br>Yup, about the god thing, actually you are not alone, i remember knowing a temple next to bukit merah library, but i cant remember the name. Their teachings is sort of a combined teachings of the 5 religions. The theory is something like yours.<br><br>As for the faith of christians, you can't blame them, their teachings is such that their god is the only one. they can't change it. Just like buddhism, we believe there are many gods, if you ask me to believe there is only 1 christian god, i oso cannot take it. Believing in something is very objective and personal. Your heart chooses depends on how the things around you affect you, how you are bought up, how you see things through your own intelligence and being. For example, some christians said that god has change their life, increase their studies and make them pass the exam, change their family lifes and have speak to them and they can speak in tongues, they have seen casting out of demons etc... this made them believe god is there. Some buddhists believe that buddha will give them 4D and strike toto, give them a son, or bless them and it really happened after that, they will said buddha is there to help him.<br><br>this is faith, faith pushes man forward when we are down, without faith, sometimes people couldn't live and chooses death.<br><br>The theory of christ dying for all our sins, and whoever believes in him will be saved sometimes is to christians is taken as it is. But for buddhism, we take a different point of view in it, although it is correct in some sense, but for buddhism, it is not the path, it still has some delusions as with some other god religion.<br>For example, if a person who kills so many lives in his years on earth, and before he dies and he believes in Christ, he will be saved and go to heaven. In Buddhism, we believe that if his thought on becoming a christian and really repent, he will be able to accumulate some good karma. but this good karma is not able to minus out the bad karma he have, there is no plus and minus for karma. Imagine who will answer to the lives of people he had killed? They are inncocent, why they need to die this way? How about those dying young, miscarriage, abortion? All this can't be answer by Jesus theory.<br><br>As for Buddhists, it is quite ok to scold the buddha, or called buddha names, or even said our scripture is not truth, or our faith is of the demonic way. We try not to be angry with it. The reason we know that is because people don't understand what we teach, and people sometimes is clouded by their own ego. And if buddhists is anger by his words, then this buddhists doesnt know the real teaching of the buddha.<br><br>As for the errors in bible, or in other faiths, nobody is able to judge since all of us is man, human and not god.<br><br>As for happiness, it doesn't matter where you come from, believers or non-believers oso can have happiness and saddness. it all depends on how you define happiness and how you view your life. One thing for sure, I am a very happy man now...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for arguing with a christian, i think you won't get any results or confirmation. Their mind believes only in the words of god or bible. To them, that is everything and the only thing that god have left for them, if you take that away, all of them will be crying. They are like little child, protecting their only toy and wouldn't want anyone to take it away. They are always right, and we are always wrong. If anyone does not believe in the bible, that means they do not believe in god and they are questioning god. And to them, that is a sin, they can't question god. nobody can. It is like a level, god is up there and human are down here. Even when they have eternal life next time, they will always be a level lower, they cannot be master of their own life. They have free will, but how free is it?<br><br>Actually, sometimes I think of the bible, I guess the bible is not completed, this is a part 2. Life in heaven. Why? because imagine someone broke the rule again in heaven, what will happen again? The bible is like a story book... and they live happily ever after, full stop.<br><br>I hope you can find your way some day and may your god help you and carried you as always. It is always good to believe in something and will be able to lived happily and contented. god bless  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>He who knows others is wise;<br>He who know himself is enlightened.</div>
