            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I am so glad that you have took all the trouble to try answering all my question thatÂ’s y I choose to reply you.<br><br>Firstly u are jus another Roy to me as u only view in godÂ’s Jesus wayÂ….<br><br>I donÂ’t know how to explain to u but if u ever go try study or even jus touch a little bit on the Muslim and Buddhism part, u will know that god sent not jus one but many translator down to earth, Jesus is HIS SON but translator like Muhammad and Buddha etc are all his followers which he sent down to earth to help us along the wayÂ…. jus like a army, u talk about the sword (Jesus) bout what about the generalÂ’s soldiers, horse, equipmentÂ… god is truly one and only oneÂ… jesus yes he is god son but he is also of the the translator which god has sent for us.<br><br>People like obiwan, diablo666 and meg25Â…. I choose not to reply them because they know what I trying to say but not u, yet because u have try some effort that why I will answer for what u did wrong.<br><br>quote:<br><br>God is really only one but that does not mean he only sent one Jesus to earth... there is also other....<br><br>Oh and I forgot, you speak to God. You don't even know which one to speak to. There is only one God but you choose to speak to everything else except God.<br><br>Yes I know that Jesus, the holy sprit and Jesus is one but does not mean when Jesus was sent to earth, the whole god was with him to earthÂ…. Jesus is godÂ’s son but let think further abitÂ…. does god exist alone? or he got a army with him? People like peter etcÂ…if yes I ask u one question, if u go to war, would u choose to sent your army to fight for the war or your son (or even yourself) if the answer is your army then I can say to my heart that Buddha and Muhammad etc are godÂ’s army which are being sent to earth to help usÂ…but in vain as man choose not to listen them which makes god sent his hope, him his son to earth to help us all with the power of loveÂ…<br>quote:<br><br>Sometime when we think about it.... yes I agree there is really one god.... but god have sent many so call &lt;people&gt; down to earth like Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad and many other which then have each of their reglious, no matter is Christian, Muslim, Buddhism, Hindus and many more.... in the end all are lead to god which are then the so call WAYÂ�@to god...<br><br>Everyone else you mentioned claims to be from God. But only one is from God, Jesus the Son of God.<br>Only He came back to life from the dead, all the rest died and remained dead.<br><br>Have u ever seen (little Buddha) the movie? ItÂ’s based on a true story and I think u miss one part outÂ…<br>A cup of water was unite together tightly in the cup, jus like u me or anyone, but when the cup breaks, the cup will be destroy like the human body but the water which is our soul live, its jus where the water will flow to, In the movie case it flow into 3 kid sprit, JesusÂ’ body was destroy by man but the sprit of him was not destroy and so he have came back for us, same goes to Buddha and Muhammad if u ever read themÂ….<br><br>quote:<br><br>now Jesus to me is what sin u have done in the end u believe him u will go heaven as he have help u repay for your sin and forgive u, correct me if wrong, Buddhism is a long way, what u do u will repay in the next life till u do not own what u have own other &lt;object&gt; and as for the rest u go check about it, now if they or so call god translator come down to spread their way to the only god... then y are there so many different way of achieve way to god, is it possible that any one of them have been changed this few hundred or thousand years?<br><br>They aren't the same.<br>There are only two types of religion in this world, one that believes only God can save you, and another that believes by your works; you can earn God's salvation. Only one falls into the first category. That is Christianity. We cannot save ourselves, if we could, there'd be no need for God.<br>And finally, Buddhism has no god. ItÂ’s a philosophy. Not a faith, not a religion. Go study it carefully. I have as I have all the others. Have you? Have you even studied Christianity carefully before talking so much?<br><br>I admit I do not know too much about Christianity but I do know that in the old testament that Christian should not eat meat as it was consider dirty, but in the new it was ok to do so but that is also what separate mulism and Christ, mulism was still using the old yet until it have change, Christ was therefore separate from MuslimÂ….<br>Buddhism is a philosophy? Have u ever read it a little before? Buddhism was infact so true in going the right way which cause me to have doubt, u believe in Christ as u are like Roy being touch by Jesus only and not seen the outside world yetÂ…<br><br>quote:<br><br>One of my friend told me that god in Christ say u can eat what u wan in earth but no killing of human or sin blah blah, then y mulism can't eat pork, Chinese can't eat cow? Buddhism can't eat meat? Is there a change over the years?<br><br>ItÂ’s simple; they aren't the same religion in the first place. and furthermore, who ever said they were? u urself, and only u. not me.<br>besides, only Christianity is right.<br><br>I repeat my answer to you again they are not the same religion but they are all the same route to god, different translator sent to this world each have different reglion, each of them speak for the god by not doing sin and evil, and lastly read my statement again before u say Christianity is right again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>Bible or what book u all read yes there are mostly correct but what makes u think its right as over the years it may have been change...jus a little or more I dun no.<br><br>the Bible is based on manuscripts dating to 30 A.D. or so, so its quite original.<br><br>You say that it is originalÂ….. but how do u know? Have u been born that year? And follow jesus all the way? What jesus have done and say is correct but it could have been change by evil-doingÂ…. Second warningÂ… read carefullyÂ….<br><br>quote:<br><br>As those who believe in Jesus will go to heaven or should I ask those who believe in Jesus that in heaven u will also have to repay them? If not what happen to those who have done all the crime and believe god in the end? You can say that Jesus have repay them by been hang on the cross but is that enough? Or is it because that god knows man are hopeless that all translator of god have make man so lazy to follow that he sent Jesus down to die for human so as to not repay what these human have done? If yes y not all religions all believe in Jesus alone can liao, remember god is fair...<br><br>its absolutely because all the good that mankind can every do, is never as good as Jesus has done. no man's life can ever match that of Jesus' life. when we compare and try to boast of our works compared to his, we lose. so we can use all our good works and try to use them as a reason to tell God that we shouldn't have to go to hell when we die, but when measured against Jesus, we are nothing, and can only deserve eternal death.<br>Yet Jesus's death paid for all our misdoings, there is no more punishment for those who accept that. But it doesnt mean that we should go on sinning, for a genuinely grateful heart will not do things to frustrate Jesus' goodwill and grace. We will sin, because we are imperfect, but we should do our best not to, if we really love Him. Still it is not our work, but His grace and death on the cross that saves us.<br>WE CANNOT PAY FOR OUR SINS, EVEN IF WE DIE. BECAUSE OUR LIVES ARENT GOOD ENOUGH. ONLY JESUS WHO IS GOD, AND WHOSE LIFE IS GOOD ENOUGH, WAS WORTHY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE PAYMENT FOR OUR SINS.<br><br>I ask you 1 question, is god fair? if he is fair, now I ask you, what do you call fair when a you hit a person, in the next life, he will hit you bad so as to repay, jesus pays for what we have doneÂ…but that doesnÂ’t mean we are not worthy enough to do anything so as to repay them, we are create by god, we are being loved by god, and by doing goods and not causing anymore evil to the world we are reducing our sin, and not saying we are not good enough to do anything so as to repay our sins or even to gods. Third warningÂ… read my statement againÂ….<br><br>quote:<br><br>Christian means ??? believe in Jesus if so y are there believe in god only, Mary only? Is there a relationship between them?<br><br>Mary was a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus, Mary is in no way God's wife if that is what you mean. There was no sexual relationship whatsoever.<br>But a miracle that out of nothing, a child was conceptualised in her womb. That is the miracle of Jesus' birth, to show that he was not born of a sexual relationship but of a miraculous work of God.<br><br>Go study on your clathoic before u say anything stupid, fourth warningÂ… read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>Remember if man can kill Jesus, y can't they change Jesus way...<br><br>the men managed to crucify Jesus because He wanted them to, so that His death could erase our sins. and by the way, mankind didnt win, Jesus came back to life. He didnt stay dead like the rest.<br><br>He din stay dead, of cus I know, y? I tell you cus human have misunderstand what jesus have thought or even does who have change wat jesus have taught that he came back for us again and again. Fifth warningÂ… read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>Magician can cast magic because they make the viewer think in their mind that what they see hear smell or touch is true...but actually its all trick... because this viewer can't see what behind the magician is doing. Same goes to those what the so call history changer has done....<br><br>well, the Bible is not like any history book, whilst it carries facts, it is also the Word of God. read it one time, cover to cover, i dare you. i have read the shintoist sutras before and the english quran. so i dare you to read it one time, and then think for yourself if it is true. because lies can be fictionalised but truth will definitely speak to you. dont understand what i mean? read it and find out what truth is.<br><br>Are you telling me that world war 2 is friction? It is a history of what have been done thatÂ’s y its been written down, in this case, the words of god, but what makes you think the bible is following exact information which god gave us, history can be change very easily in the past as there is no control, a simple overwritten or a new written bible in the past could change anything that is possible, try this, gif ur fre a msg and tell him to pass it on for a jus ten years, lets jus see wat the outcome will be. Sixth warningÂ…read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>You say donÂ�ft know what dead sea got what book which is the same as the bible, dun u think its another &lt;magician&gt; trick?<br><br>no trick. the dead sea scrolls lie in the museums for your inspection.<br><br>Read again the question, seventh warningÂ…. Read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>If there is good there is also bad, now if u are the bad what will u do if u wan to destroy the &lt; good way thinking &gt;if u are a follower of the bad....<br>Jus imagine over the years if in the bible that there is something call have sex with may people is also a way, will u still go for it? Remember because its what the book says<br><br>the Bible never promoted promiscuity. read it.<br>see for urself.<br><br>Are u born stupid ? or u does not know wat the word (IF) or (JUS IMAGINE) means? Eighth warningÂ…. Read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>Another thing jus by changing a little such as eating meat is fine because &lt;god has created this for u to eat&gt; this sentence, to u, u may think it fine but is it also one of a sin, which whom have overwritten?<br><br>eating of meat was never a sin. God gave all the green plants for food in the beginning to Adam and Eve. But in Noah's case, He told him that all meat was now for him to consume as well. It was never a sin. It was just never a desire to eat meat in the beginning at all. NOTE: never was it stated as a sin or even forbidden. it was just written that God offered all the green plants for Adam and Eve to choose as food.<br>read it.<br><br>Read again your bible again, I beg you, the new and old testimont, and also meat WAS offer to adam and eve as they have commit the sin for which god sacrifice a animal for them to eatÂ…Â…. but all this meat stuff is it true?Â….. ninth warningÂ…. Read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>I was confuse, all of the reglion is almost the same yet a few of them is like being change over the years.<br>A tree is called a tree because many people or book says itÂ�fs a tree thatÂ�fs y u follow.<br>Now if in a village 99 people rape their sister except u, and they say its wrong will u still do it? Jus because other people say so or do so will u follow them?<br><br>of course the majority is not always right. i hope u rnt that silly too. by the way, i told u before only two types of religion in this world. read my above comments.<br><br>Â…Â….i have no hope in youÂ…. I say it jus like wat u follow the bible, if the bible is wrong, will u still follow it? And about ur commentÂ… I read liao and its so little info in to to make anyone who read to convince himÂ…. Tenth warningÂ….. read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>No matter which reglious is fine with me as long as u have set your heart in it and not jus because itÂ�fs easy to follow which reglious so as to have the way to god thus u follow it<br><br>that is very sad and ridiculous that man should choose what God is like to him and follow that which suits his preference. then man makes God. not God makes man. utter rubbish.<br><br>God sent his translator to help us, so which one will in the end lead to him as all of them.. if u ever readÂ… is almost the sameÂ…. The difference of them is may be been change by those history-changerÂ…Â… eleventh warningÂ….. read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>U were driving a car, u saw a rabbit cross your first reaction is to brake because u know u will kill it which is a bad thing or sin, but at home your mum bought a chicken or even few crabs, will u kill it for chicken curry or chill crabs to eat? If u think its fine, then y not u ran over the rabbit and bring it home for supper too since the past two thousand years bible have say Jesus will repay the sin and forgive u? These entire three item we talking here are animals... think about it.<br><br>yeah i try to avoid the animal because i dont wanna splatter it all over the road. just because Jesus forgives u doesnt mean that u shud go and kill anything and any1 u want. think abt it. if ur mother forgives u for stealing, does it mean u go and steal everyday from her?<br><br>I ask you about the 3 animal, and u gif me answer for rabbit? For godÂ’s sake, of cus if we know itÂ’s a sin we should not do it, but wat about the chicken wing u holding now??? If u wan to answer my question answer it allÂ…. Twelveth questionÂ…. Read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>Second, y is there people out there saying stop killing the animals? Is it because they fear the animals will extinct or is it a sin which make them feel they should not kill animals anymore.... yet they still continue eating chicken and pork as these animal will not extinct so fast?<br><br>this is a question for the animal conservationists. not really related to Christianity. but perhaps they fear extinction of the animal. and as to why they eat meat, it is not my business.<br><br>If you dunno wat is going on in this topic, fineÂ… skip through like wat u did all this timeÂ…. This question is same as the first, u can believe god, but if u are doing sin everyday will u expect him to forgive u?Â…..thirteenth read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>Y do god sent so many so-call translators to earth? Is it because each translator for each different language people or is it because human have made many mistake that god have to repeatly sent so many different translator to correct the human way?<br><br>God only sent one Son, Jesus. The religious people of the other religions don't come from God, according to God. There are liars everywhere. These are called anti-Christs and false prophets. The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah and others described in the Bible however, are as you say, God's repeated warnings to His rebellious people.<br><br>To you god have sent only jesus, but if u ever read through other reglion, they are almost the same way of reaching to god. You say other reglion is liar but between good and evil, almost all of them are the leading the same way like jesusÂ…. If they are liar y din jesus in 30 ad told u anything about it? Remember most reglion exist before Christ and I saying Christ not god!!Â… fourteenth warningÂ…. Read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>In the bible, it only talks about birth and 30 years later of him, but in the middle of these years where did Jesus go? Have he ever travel to India or china before? DonÂ�ft give me crap about its far between country else are u trying to say da mo travel from India to china is fake?<br><br>no. it isnt necessary to describe every second of Jesus' life. so the Bible concentrates on His ministry, when He was 30 years onwards. He didnt go to China. He went to Egypt with His family as a boy though, because Herod the King was trying to kill the Savior. Question: why do you think the Bible doesnt teach you how to shave your moustache or wash your backside? Answer: Not important.<br><br>Are u telling me that jesus in his first 30 year on earth is total waste? Jesus is a god which u say it urself and are you telling me that we should not follow wats he does in his normal life? If itÂ’s ayumi or andy yes, we can forget about their everyday life, but we are talking about god now!!! A supreme that we should respect and loveÂ…. And wat is the answer u gave? Not important?Â….. fifteenth warningÂ….. read my statement again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>Mulism and Christian is so closely related which I have heard the story from my 30+ friend<br>That it is only by one line that separate them,<br><br>i wasnt there when this conversation with ur friend took place. u'll hv to clarify with him what he means.<br><br>I have not yet seen him for sometime but I will ask him for the answer again.<br><br>quote:<br><br>y is this so? What about osama's holy war? To me its a total crap as this is jus to create war... if so then y does those people who fight with him agree? Is it because they also knew its crap or they truly believe there is a holy war in their bible?<br><br>no, if u read the quran, it says they can go into holy war only if they are the minority in the situation. so osama is doing the wrong thing according to their book.<br><br>How do you know its wrong? Who are you to say its wrong? Maybe its correct? Â…Â….. you say its wrong, fine I agree with you but the meaning in this question s in the next statement.<br><br>quote:<br><br>If so y does u still believe in jus a bible as it may also have some wrong things in it that cause u to follow it and thus have lead to the wrong way...?<br><br>i believe in the Bible, i read it cover to cover. all of it. and it is true. read it and u will know what i mean. also i have seen God working in my life and in others' lives. it is not just a book and not just words. But God's Words. why? read it and u can tell. really! read it from beginning to end, it is one long story but worth reading! because it is God's love story for you.<br>and the Bible doesnt ever teach us to go into holy war, so dont worry. it is written in Revelation, that God Himself will wage the final war. Not mankind on his behalf.<br><br>The meaning which I trying to say is what if the total meaning given to you is like osama who have makes his followers to believe himÂ…. I not saying god, I am talking about those history-changer which may have cause all this thousand years of joke in the bibleÂ…Â… last warningÂ…. Read the whole meaning of what I saying before you answer.<br><br>quote:<br><br>I not trying to say u should not believe in bible or anything but I trying to say always follow your heart...follow your heart no matter what because that is where most evil have tried to attack.... yet not success as god is always with u and your heart... but if u dun believe in god.... evil will take over your heart one day.<br>All the words say here are all what I have thought these past years... and I will not answer to anyone of u as I still finding what the true way is.... I am like anyone of u... still lost and confuse.... dun think u know it unless u have read through all different reglious books no matter is Christ, Buddhism, Muslim or Hindu...until now no matter from age 18 to 81 still can't answer my question including u....<br><br>well, i have. period.<br><br>I have say clearly in this msg bible is a book which I say u should or not but always follow ur heartÂ…..there is a saying ren zi qu sin ben shangÂ… which is y if u ever create a sinÂ… u will feel guilty, and that is when u know u have create it, if bible is so correct, I must say this, all thing in bible is true except the meat part cus I know wat we done to other we will be pay back the same priceÂ…..secondly read again this statement dun think u know it unless u have read through all different reglious books no matter is Christ, Buddhism, Muslim or Hindu...until now no matter from age 18 to 81 still can't answer my question including u....<br><br>People nick like obwian, which after I saw their msg I felt a relieve cus at least he truly understand what I saying here but not u, what you have done so far have not even convince me 10% of wat obwian have say in jus a few sentenceÂ….cus wat u wrote is not the answer to my question but to only your point of view.<br><br>I am still very young and shallow to this god thing but yes he have touch me many time but yet I could not do anything to repay him, in which I decided to learn more about him by through people with heart and mind to think through what god have say and not people like you which use jus a book to say it all and I was wondering y u din quote out this sentenceÂ…..<br>To me follow your heart and your reglious is the best, u can believe what regliou u wan but think about it, go ask your believer friend some question sometime they may not be able to answer because they follow books or what their &lt;master&gt; say so.... they can give u crap because books have all the religious book have most answer to all question but not all if u really think about it<br></div>

Buddhism does not reject any other faith at all. Buddhism believe that all faith is leading to the same destination, athough the path might be different.
