            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br>have seen thru' the previous posts. A very impressive and controlled "debate" being carried out between Rubberduckie, Blurblop, &amp; YIDD. Appreciate the christians for not forcing the gospel down the NC's throat because the Lord Jesus never do that to any people. Appreciate YIDD for your genuine questions and clarifying your motives for asking them.<br><br>The center of all Christian teachings and belief lies on one person, Jesus Christ.<br>Rubberduckie, fisherprice, Roy, Hitsquad, Rapture etc. may come from different denominations, BUT ALL of us AGREE that the LORD JESUS IS THE CENTER of the Christian community and His works on the cross is the ONLY work of salvation that can bring man to God.<br><br>Our faith is on Jesus. We believe that He is the Son of God, we believe that He came to earth and die on the cross for all man and God raised Him from the dead and He is now sitting at the right hand of the Father(praying for us).<br><br>Shatter any of the above statement thru' historical findings or biblical facts, you  shake our faith.<br><br>Other "doctrinal" issues such as whether a minister can marry or not is not important because it is NOT the criteria to go to heaven. In fact, the one (Paul) who said that it is better for one to stay single is also the one that says, it is better to get married if one cannot stand against the temptation (of sex). If I am not wrong, Paul himself is married (need to study his back ground again...).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes, its better to believe. some people are really happier in believing. others aren't. i've seen happy christians. in fact, many christians seem happier than non-christians. perhaps its the belief that there's always someone to carry you over the sand(footprints in the sand!). i just saw 2 happy christians. they came to my house and told me a bit about the bible. in any case, they were pretty earnest and happy. though in my opinion not too efficient. if i were them, i'd try spreading the word of the gospel around hdb blocks. every 3 meters, 1 household, how efficient!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MCD, have a little more faith in yourself. I will believe your claims of divine assistance in your 'A' levels if you instead of mugging hard, languished in despair and hopelessness instead and then have the same results. Tell u my exp with 'A' levels. I thought I would flunk my Biology, but I got A! So did some of my frens, but we're not christians. There are logical reasons for things happening: a)My JC was purposely killing us with promos, make us mug harder. b)The standard of Bio students elsewhere is just too fud up! Bell Curve, no miracle.<br><br>Same with your work, good bonus, company doing good and you perform well. What if u get retrenched (touch wood), will u blame it on divinity? If not, why attribute success to it? Well, if you insists that your successes stem from divine intervention, then similar, under what kind of scenarios will it require to denounce divinity? I don't think any, becos even in worse case scenarios like death, christians have an 'escape valve', they claim *** have a larger role for the deceased to play.<br><br>To all believers out there, I say have a little faith in yourself, you deserve it, u are what u are credit to your actions, becos it will not happen if u sat there and do nothing.<br><br>[This message has been edited by CS (edited 19 February 2002).]</div>

(leave no man behind) if you believe is true then perhaps they have bought back the body but do they have every detail on their dead case? yet this movie is very good and u believe its true as it has a interesting (plot?).<br>same goes to the bible... people which is human, may have change anything which they perhaps dunno and add in other type of info which they knew it happen but was not there. jus think will do for i have no answer to any one of the question i make..<br><br>i can't prove you that all reglion goes to god yet... but in my heart, i alone and perhaps me , myself and only me knows that all reglion which their ways are in the end lead to god...the one who create everything including me or you. the only one which help me all these years, no matter when i start believe on chirst...or buddlism......, he was always there helping me....<br><br>lastly rubberduckieÂ….. I will stake my life that the bible and most of the othe way have been corrupt by human. What jesus say is what jesus say, what human say is what human say, you are reading from a book that jesus have say to human for them to spreadÂ….. the word spread rememberÂ….
