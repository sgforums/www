North America is one of the places where muslim women can exercise the full range of rights and freedom the enjoy in the original shari'ah (Islamic laws). In too many muslim countries overseas, women are kept in subjugation and even suffer violence because their shar'ah rights are denied. Even at the hands of the official "Islamic" authorities, which is a disgrace to the muslim society.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Wake up........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the US may seem like busybodies but when trouble comes its always the US that gets the job done. what has europe done to keep the world safe? sitting in their little offices making noise and telling evil regimes how angry they are and blahblahblah? in world war 2 who came to save everybody's arses? it was the US. what has europe done except voicing out their "concerns" about issues in the UN but never actually take any action or back out in fights..who was it that fought the terrorists? the US, europeans just hid in their rotting fortress europe like wussies trying not to offend the extremists. you may say that europe has become sick of wars, but remember the quote "the tree of liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots". its high time the so called big boys of europe stand up and start acting responsibly.<br><br>and all around arabs bitch about how israel took away palestinian land and such, they have so much fukking land cant they just cut a chunk out and give it to their supposed "brothers"? what did they do when their "brothers" got hit by the tsunami? nothing.</div>
