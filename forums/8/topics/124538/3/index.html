See history.<br>Non muslims will be discriminated or even killed.<br>What say you?</blockquote>The word Muslim itself is used for a person who <span style="font-style: italic;">voluntarily</span> chooses to follow the guidance of God. There is no place here for any kind of coercion. Can you see the <strong>hypocrisy</strong> itself in forcing unbelievers to compel? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> A simple reflection would do. Whats more, its ridiculous to say that any belief system, not only Islamic, can be pushed down the throat of a human being by force. Damn loonies.<br><br>And this is what the Prophet has to say. "Do you really think you can force people to believe ? If it had been thy Lord's will, they would all have believed,- all who are on earth! Wilt thou then compel mankind, against their will, to believe?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Discriminatory pratices are inherent in humans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> But then theres this given quote,<br>{O you who believe! ....let not the hatred of a people cause you to swerve from justice; be just; that is the closest to piety.}<br><br>God says that doing justice is the closest action to piety and we should strive for it. Muslims are to live by it including other self explanatory codes of conduct. Anyone or any state who violates commandments of God cannot be called correct. At any rate, we cannot blame Islam for any actions as long as those actions are in contravention of Islamic percepts, any more than we can blame other religions for their misdeeds of certain believers in violation of the teachings of that religion.<br><br>And i see a different kind of history.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Pyoro:</div><div class="quote_body">A thorough analysis of the Koran reveals that the US will cease to exist in the year 2007, according to research published by Palestinian scholar Ziad Silwadi.<br><br>The study, which has caught the attention of millions of Muslims worldwide, is based on in-depth interpretations of various verses in the Koran. It predicts that the US will be hit by a tsunami larger than that which recently struck southeast Asia.<br><br>"The tsunami waves are a minor rehearsal in comparison with what awaits the US in 2007," the researcher concluded in his study. "The Holy Koran warns against the Omnipotent Allah's force. A great sin will cause a huge flood in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans."<br><br>Silwadi, who is from the village of Silwad near Ramallah Â– the home of Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal Â– is not a world-renowned scholar. He said he decided to publish the findings of his research "out of a sense of responsibility because what is about to happen is extremely shocking and frightening."<br><br>His fear, he said, is that the world economy, which relies heavily on the US dollar, would be deeply affected by the collapse of the US.<br><br>"It would be fair to say that the world would be better off with a US that is not a superpower and that does not take advantage of weak nations than a world where this country does not exist at all," he added."The world will certainly lose a lot if and when this disaster occurs because of the great services that American society has rendered to the economy, industry and science."<br><br>Silwadi said his study of the Koran showed that the US would perish mainly because of its great sins against mankind, including the Native Americans and blacks.<br><br>"As soon as the Europeans started arriving in the new world discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492, they declared a war on the so-called Red Indians, the legitimate owners of the land," he wrote. "Then they began enslaving and humiliating Africans after kidnapping them from their countries and bringing them to America. Millions of blacks were brought to the US and treated with unprecedented harshness. Those who became ill during the journey were thrown overboard to feed the fish."<br><br>Silwadi pointed out that the US continued to commit war crimes and "ethnic cleansing" against humanity by becoming the first country to use nuclear weapons during World War II.<br><br>"International law penalizes such crimes," he said. "If these laws were not applied then, they are certainly implemented in heaven. If no one on earth is capable of punishing [the US], Allah was and remains able to do so. All these actions have been documented by Allah in a big archive called the Koran."<br><br>Silwadi said he reached the conclusion that several suras (chapters) in the Koran that talk about punishment for those who perpetrate heinous sins actually refer to the US.<br><br>As an example, he quotes in his study verse 40 of the Spider Sura, which states: "So each We [God] punished for his sin; of them was he on whom We sent down a violent storm, and of them was he whom the rumbling overtook, and of them was he whom We made to be swallowed up by the earth, and of them he whom We drowned; and it did not beseem Allah that He should be unjust to them, but they were unjust to their own souls."<br><br>Drawing parallels between Pharaoh and the US, who share the same "sin" of arrogance and excessive pride, Silwadi noted that the Koran mentions at least 12 times the fact that Pharaoh was punished by drowning for his evil deeds.<br><br>The Narrative Sura, he noted, clearly suggests that the US will drown in the sea: "And Firon [Pharaoh] said: O chiefs! I do not know of any god for you besides myself; therefore kindle a fire for me And he was unjustly proud in the land, he and his hosts, and they deemed that they would not be brought back to Us. So We caught hold of him and his hosts, then We cast them into the sea, and see how was the end of the unjust [verses 38-40]."<br><br>Explaining his theory about the approaching extinction of the US, the scholar went on to analyze many numbers and letters mentioned in the Koran. He said a careful reading and analysis of words appearing in the Opening and Yusuf suras show that the US will exist for only 231 years.<br><br>How did he reach that number? Silwadi said that by combing a number of suras hinting at US sins he reached the numbers 1776 (the year the US achieved independence) and 231. He added the two numbers and the result was 2007, the year when the US is expected to disappear.<br><br>In his lengthy study, which is being circulated in many Muslim countries, Silwadi noted that the US has often been compared to a tree that grows very quickly and bears fruit, but has no roots.<br><br>In an attempt to find a reference to this metaphor in the Koran, Silwadi said he counted 1776 verses from the beginning of the Koran until he reached verse 26 of the Ibrahim Sura, which states: "And the parable of an evil word is as an evil tree pulled up from the earth's surface; it has no stability."<br><br>How?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>orh.<br></div>

When Narzis took over Germany as a whole warring nation, bigger countries in Europe like Spain and France were lost as early as 1941-1943. Moreover, Italy was also an ally to the axis powers under the leadership of Musolinni. The 2 main countries fighting desperately against the Narzis are Russia and Great Britain. Russian alone has a wide spread of vast land which lacks cover and too far and wide for Hitler to advance. Coupled by weather conditions and the number of persistent Russians sent to fight and die against Hitler's advances, the Axis war found greater difficulty in progress from there. The other front south of Narzis Germany was headed by Musolinni but his troops were not as agressive as the battle seasoned German army during the early stages. African theatre of war is difficult for the Axis due to the dry weather and the shortage of water supply. Only tough outstanding general and commander (e.g the Desert Fox - Erst Rommel) earned the Axis some honor and reputation in the invasion. Gerat Britain (or rather England) was shielded from German invasion by the sea so Hitler had to deploy and overcome Churchill's sea and air Forces before any landing attempts or advances can be made on the country.<br><br>As for japan's involvement, it started only after a complete sweep through China.
