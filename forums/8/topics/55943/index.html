            <div class='col-md body'>Introduction<br>I'm sure you've heard about it. RIAA is now targetting on individuals sharing files illegally. This is no hoax. It used to be them sueing the P2P companies... but even if one goes down, another will go up; Napster went down, yet another P2P now reigns - Kazaa. So now, maybe if they start to target individuals, it will be more useful. But who're they kidding? We're talking about many million users at large.<br><br>But still warning letters from ISPs in Singapore have been issued to advise some unlucky users who were caught to stop their illegal file serving or be prepared for legal actions that will be taken against them. And the number of warning letters issued seems to be on the rise.<br><br>And recently, I've received and read a few such copies of warning letters which I had posted later in this article, from the internet when I was roaming around. And the letter from Pacific Internet had been proven to be authetic.. below is a letter from them. The authenticity of SingNet's letter remains a mystery still.<br><br>The letter appended below confirms Pacific Internet's action on our<br>customers who breaches our AUP specifically in downloading copyrighted<br>softwares and motion pictures.<br><br><span style="color: red;">This is a warning email that we send to our customers caught doing such<br>illegal activity.<br><br>We hope we have answered your queries. Should you need further assistance,<br>please email us again at abuse@pacific.net.sg.<br><br>Best Regards,<br><br>Abuse Response Team<br>Pacific Internet Limited<br>(Singapore)</span><br><br>So I think it's time to do something to save yourself if you've been doing the bad thing all the while. This is no joke.<br><br>How do they find out?<br>RIAA is using software which scans for copyrighted files in public directories available to any user of a P2P network, then it will download and log down the information such as time accessed, filename, etc. And also your IP which personally identifies you, and your ISP. A mail will be sent to your ISP, which in turn will mail you a warning letter accordingly. All these evidence will be used to file lawsuit against you. I believe it's like a "spider" crawling around the web harvesting for e-mails to spam at, but this time it's another variant scanning for copyrighted (music) files.<br><br>Also, someone can potentially sabotage you by sending a mail to the RIAA, with the same information that they need.<br><br>Yes, you probably have heard that there're P2P softwares claiming to mask the last octet of your IP, and you feel safe using it? No, there's absolutely no WAY a P2P software or yourself can HIDE your identity online completely. You're always opened to the public for sharing your files since IP is the most crucial information on the Internet to transfer files. (How else will the files be sent to you?) And when someone decides to check up on you, you will be be easily exposed. No doubt about it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Will it end?<br>There was a period of time, when video recording of shows aired on the television networks in (some countries) was considered illegal because of infringement of copyrights. Although video tapes are no longer as widely used as before, they were allowed to video tape shows (like you did years ago!).<br><br>I don't know the exact details, maybe my memory is failing me and I could be wrong but it happened too long ago and I can't find information on the web to support my statement. But I would like to say, maybe this fight against copyrights will peace down, but don't expect it to be soon. Still I would like to add on, I am not a representative of RIAA, so I don't know their plans. I just wish to give you an idea of what happened previously with similiar cases.<br><br>Who knows, maybe the next file sharing kingdom will begin with a 120GB external hard disk.<br><br>Privacy VS Piracy<br>The big question would be - wouldn't they be invading our privacy if they could just see what we do online?<br><br>No. According to the 2 mails I put above (and only these 2 mails), you can see that those 2 persons are caught because they're serving to/sharing with the masses(BitTorrent &amp; IRC). Their files are listed for the public to see... and since anyone can see, why not the RIAA's scanning software? So this is not an invasion of privacy, yet.<br><br>But I believe if RIAA asks for identities of the users who went against their copyrights, that's invading users' privacy. But I don't know the laws well(which I am sorry for not doing enough research on), but this might help you decide.<br><br>"Pacific Bell Sues Recording Industry for Customer Privacy"<br>External link : http://www.eff.org/IP/P2P/20030731_eff_pr.php<br><br>Nevertheless, if one day should they invade into your privacy to see what you are doing, you can safely assume from now onwards, <span class="large">Piracy is above Privacy. </span><br><br></div>
