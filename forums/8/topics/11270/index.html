            <div class='col-md body'>Long time no post.<br><br>Saw Ashley's signature which provoked me to think. It gave me courage. But seems like something's still holding me back.<br><br>Will we really have no regrets for the risk we take? I mean, it's true that not taking the risk could really bring regrets. But taking it, can make things that much better meh?<br><br>Sometimes, u know what your heart truly desires, and that it could make you happy, but aren't there instances when no matter how much you want to or how right you feel, you just can't say it or do it, cos it will ruin things?<br><br>U see, there's something I wanna say to someone, hoping for things to become better between us, but got very strong feeling that the other party might get unhappy hearing what I've got to say. So, heart say yes but head say no. Which one should I follow? Should I take the risk and bear all consequences? Or should I hold back and let it drag, hoping that one day, something else will happen to make it better?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just went through something like what you described. The only difference is that I genuinely feel that there is a chance that things will improve if I have the courage to speak my heart.<br><br>Sad to say, things just went straight down the drain when I told her my feelings and I think I may have just lost a very good friend. I'm still picking up the pieces for my foolishness. The disappointment and pain is absolutely unbearable, especially after all the fighting with my mind to gather the courage to speak my heart. Would have been better if I kept my mouth shut <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I'm sure your situation is different from mine and you probably have better instinct than me. All I want to say is NOT to have too high an expectation of the outcome just because you found the courage to speak your heart. You won't like it if things don't turn out the way you want.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm inclined to agree with DreamLord.<br><br>The regrets for some of my actions are very real. And it pains me to think of them. What is done cannot be undone. And thus, the deep regret.<br><br>But for something which I've not done, will I really regret? I know I sound like a coward to say this, but I often tell myself this. For something I've not done, I do not have to regret, but rather, I could see it as waiting for a better chance to present it in future. It brings me hope. And I feel better for now, and for future. But then, this is just what I tell myself to hide back into my shell.<br><br>If I always tell myself this, then when will the day come when I will finally do or say it? And when the day does come, if I allow myself to see it that way, will this same excuse not pop up again?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is more idealistic if i did not do the things i wanted to do. Since the outcome is unknown, the hope is always there.<br>It will be more realistic for the things that i did because the outcome is always so clear.<br><br>Actually, it is up to the individuals to choose the path, either to the idealistic world or the realistic world.<br><br>I will normally think of the worst of the 2 path  before deciding which way to go. I will choose the path which cause the least hurt. i would rather be not to be happy than be hurt. However, most of the time, i will choose to be idealistic cause the truth always hurts.<br><br>I guess that before deciding wat you should to do, know your priorities. Know clearly what you want or can do without in your life and then decide if the risk is worth everything.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Belle (edited 17 March 2001).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Belle (edited 17 March 2001).]</div>
