The line is very thin. However, freedom of speech does not involve only the speakers, but also the listeners. You need a sensible and open-minded society for freedom of speech to work. The public need to be able to see the different points of views and do not take defamations too personally, and at the same time, is able to identify a pure statement of opinion from a planned slander.<br><br>Freedom of speech does not work with restrictions and exceptions. Its either you allow everything, or nothing.</div>
