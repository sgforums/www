Schools should re-think what CCAs are for. Develop talent? Puis. It ain't the Singapore Sports School. Focus so much on the product for what? Sometimes, i feel that lose lose lah.. students will learn from losing as well what.. perhaps even more then what u can learn from winning.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in JC now.. no more CCA points.. from what i noe of in my JC.. alot prefer to join those less taxing clubs and societies now.. suddenly Audio-Visual and Visual Culture Club, CIP clubs.. damn lot of ppl sign up.. haha<br><br>perhaps schools can let students 'rotate' ccas,, for example some weeks join choir.. den change to maybe badminton.. den change around.. Of course it wun apply to those talented. competitive players.. but for some they dun really haf had developed an interest or ability in any specific area.. perhaps still better for them to try new stuff... Join a cca means stuck for 4/5 years.. cant change easily....</div>
