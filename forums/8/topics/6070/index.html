            <div class='col-md body'>Good grief.... first time back after a long break and this has to be the first topic that greets me! Why are you guys so obessesed about pre-marital sex?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Got something to share. My current bf was not a virgin. Worse still, he's had one-night stands- three in fact-before he met me. He told me about it right in the beginning and I'll be lying if I said I weren't horrified, even though he had claimed he was drunk and the women had come on to him. I wasn't even sure if I believed him at all. I told myself, "This one is definitely not boyfriend material."<br><br>But he was persistent and showed over a period of time that he was serious about me. He was so crazy about me, he would try to see me everyday and neglect everybody and everything else. When we were together, he never looked at another girl, not even when I was stuck with an eye infection and had to wear glasses for months. When I hit two particularly rough patches, he could have abandoned me but he stuck by, put up with my gloominess and crying, put everything aside and nearly got into trouble for it.<br><br>I still nursed occassional pangs of insecurity however. But it wasn't totally about him, it was about me too. I had been used and hurt before and I didn't relish going through that again. I was such an insecure witch that I got upset when I came across pictures of him with an ex-girlfriend. I would wonder what he felt for them and whether he loved them more.<br><br>But I came to realise that those girls didn't mean anything, at least not anymore. Maybe he had been a bad boy but he's grown up and changed. Besides, it's pointless to compare. To start on a totally clean slate would mean that I would not even allow him to have a crush before meeting me. Since he has chosen to be with me, I should have faith that he's done his comparisons and concluded that I'm the best  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Nowadays, I trust him totally. When he goes out alone with a female friend, I don't feel threatened at all. I also don't worry about him fooling around when he goes on an overseas trip alone. He loves me and cares for me very much, he wouldn't do something to hurt me or our relationship.<br><br>Ironically, although he's the only non-virgin among my boyfriends, he's the one I have the longest and I dare say, happiest relationship with. I've more or less decided that he's the guy I would marry and I believe he holds the same view too.<br><br>I think that you have to work through some issues of insecurity in every- and I repeat, every- relationship, so it's not really a matter of sexual experience. You might as well begrudge him an ex-girlfriend or a crush he had when he was 13. After all, isn't a person's heart worth more than his body?<br><br>Anyway, sex is not important to a relationship. Did you guys watch the last episode of Ally Mcbeal? As Ling said, men have this perculiar habit of judging the health of the whole relationship on how great 15 mins of sex is. I agree with her that this is simply ridiculous!<br><br>P.S: I feel that working out these insecurity issues have made me more mature and our relationship stronger, so I would willingly go through it again.<br><br>P.S.S: Even though I would never tell my boyfriend this, I'm glad that he's had the other girls before he met me. He wasn't ready to settle down and he didn't know how to value relationships. After being used and abused, he's now "broken into" a more stable relationship with me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

You can be totally faithful even if you've had other partners before.<br><br>Okay, this shall be one of my last comments on this issue. I don't intend to start another long argument about this issue. Everybody is entitled to their own opinions, however bigoted this may seem to others (this applies both to me and others of course). To me, it means little if you win the argument. At the end of the day, it's your life and you decide how you want to find your happiness. Anyway, my exams are coming and I don't intend to frequent this place, so excuse me if I'm not as "on" as I used to be   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 14 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, Belittled. It hinges on a person's character (a more appropriate word than personality I think), not so much on his sexual experience. I don't deny that there are many bastards/bitches out there who are only out to have a good time and don't give a damn who they hurt. But to assume that every person who's had pre-marital sex as "easy" is too simplistic.<br><br>(1) You don't need to have had sex to cheat on your gf/bf. I think most people would agree on this.<br><br>(2) It doesn't mean that because you've had sex before, you don't value it. It is valued- as an expression of love and intimacy. Note the emphasis on emotions.<br><br>(3) Should you begrudge your partner a past relationship where there's a certain amount of intimacy is involved? I used to mind, but I don't anymore. I let my boyfriend keep all the photos of his ex. She doesn't mean anything to him anymore and everybody needs a sense of history for them to grow.<br><br>(4) It doesn't mean that because you've had sex before, you're likely to do it outside a relationship. I'm not tempted to stray because:<br>(i) believe or not, I've never been attracted to another guy after I've met my bf. I've have other guys who have a nicer face amd body express interest in me. But none of them makes me laugh like he does, make me feel all warm inside like he does. He has his irritating bits but he's still the best!<br>(ii) supposing if I'm tempted, I still wouldn't do it because it's not worth the risk. On one hand, you have a strong satisfying relationship that you've taken pains to build. On the other, you have a cheap, meaningless one night stand. Which would you chose? It's a no brainer!<br>(iii) even if there's no risk involved (i.e. I am a swinging single with no one to account for), it doesn't mean that I'll fall into bed with every guy I'm attracted to. I don't believe in purely physical relationships. It gets very meaningless- and tiring- quickly if you're only out to use each other. If you're unlucky, you may even find yourself burnt, by a nasty kiss and tell for instance. What a waste of time I say.<br><br>(5) Some people make mistakes. Are you going to punish them for their whole life for one mistake?<br><br>(6) People change. You have to allow for that.<br><br>(7) Perfection, be it in a person or relationship, is not something you find. Nobody is perfect. Even if you marry a virgin, it doesn't guarantee happiness. If you have to pick on every detail, especially if it's already past, you're not allowing yourself to find happiness. Perfection, to me, is something you build.<br><br>Before I end off, I'll like to share another story. A few months ago, my bf and I organised a function. One of the foreign dancers offered him her hotel room key- with all that it implies- if he would do something for her. She's attractive and prances onstage in a really skimpy outfit. But my bf didn't take up the offer. He even chose to tell me about it. I think this showed better than anything else that he's put his wild hell-raising days behind.<br><br>It's easy to pigeon-hole people, especially those you've not had the experience of meeting before. But I'm sorry to say, life is never so neat. Give them a chance to show them what they are, don't condemn one and all just like that.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 15 April 2000).]</div>

Even if they have, they should not develop a r/s outside their marriage.<br><br>This world is full of temptations, and we are humans, we fall for temptations. If the person does not have a strength of character as to control his desire, i will not entrust my future happiness in his hands.

A person who practice one night stand will not attract me in the first place, not to mention starting a r/s.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>(6) People change.

It may become hidden for a while, even for years, but it may surface again one day.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>(7) Perfection, be it in a person or relationship, is not something you find.
