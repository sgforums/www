            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there.<br><br>I'm curious if any fellow Sgforum-er went through such surgery before. It is actually irritating me every night and my surgery is on the 22nd. Not like it is life-threatening or anything but I have read some online reviews/experiences and the process is quite scary.<br><br>Some say part of the process is to sign a "If I die, it won't be the hospital fault" form etc. Of course they aren't from Singapore. If anyone has gone through such surgery can you give me some pointers? How I can take care the aftermath etc? It is really bothering me even though the surgery is so far away.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what the doctor told me, they will cut 1/4 of my toe and it will not grow back. I guess vanity issues aside but what I'm afraid of it the process.<br><br>My surgery is actually in a polyclinic itself. AH and GH prices are just too expensive and what they do it they cut off the whole nail and let it regrow, which IMO is really too long and gonna take a long time to heal.<br><br>What I wanna find out is, will the doctors put me to sleep? Numbing of my feet is of course a will-thing but I'm pretty scared about the "signing of forms". Will they ask me to sign such forms as to, "if i die in the surgery it will not be their responsibilities" or something?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>They will definately only use Local A because General A needs you to be warded for observation, a.k.a post symptoms of General A.<br><br>Your Toe will be numb before they do anything to it, but you can still feel the pulling action, though without any pain in the process. However, my advise is for you to request to let the doctor do it only when you know your toe is numb.<br><br>Cause I have a friend who had a minor surgery carried out to remove part of his thumb due to an incident which he sliced his thumb and the Local A wasn't effective when the doctor started slicing the flesh and pulling out of the nail which eventually cause quite some pain. But don't worry, you have the rights to tell the doctor to wait or even inject more Local A during the process. Just complain that you still can feel and they will pump in more Local A.<br><br>The dressings will be kept as it is after it is wrapped up by the doctor/nurses after the operation. However, my friend being a qualified First Aider, he open the dressing daily and do the cleaning. Basically because he is worried of infection due to discharge, which is common after any surgery.<br><br>Remember to keep the dressing dry, BY ALL MEANS ! Else, you will risk a slower recovery of your wound.<br><br>Last of all, do not worry about the indemity form you're made to sign because it's part of the documentation. I've just underwent a Major Surgery 3 weeks back and here I'm alive typing away already.<br><br>You should be able to walk relatively well, but some slight pain which is able to be covered by the pain-killer.
