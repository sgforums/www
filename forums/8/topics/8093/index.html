Have people got nothing better to do then to specially travel out of the comfort of their home just so that they can't be traced???<br>Basically, what Tet wants here is simple. No apology or anything needed. She not so gian. All she wants is the pics be removed. Too difficult??? It really reflects very badly on the person to really go about this extent just to spite someone.<br>Will these people only be satisfied when a big war breaks out and people start leaving the forum once again??? I mean, things have been peaceful all these while, why ruin everything with all these nonsensical actions??? I am not smart, thus I can't see the sense in all these, can someone enlighten me?<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know what? I think you guys should meet up. Everyone who is involved in this mess should meet to clear up all and any misunderstandings. There's no use shooting each other in the fourms, it'll go on and on, with no end in sight. Just a simple meeting to talk things out, no need for shouting or threats of suing. Just talk. Agreed?</div>

Zeta has admitted in one of the related threads that he/she is waiting for lex to respond but why should lex? iÂ’m more than happy to flame Zeta on her behalf although i may not be able to do it justice as itÂ’s going to be a long week and i won't have access to the computer until i'm home late at night. well, my invitation to Zeta would be that he/she be an actual man or a woman and use his/her actual nick when he/she wants to frame someone.<br><br>okay, iÂ’ve to go again, if not, iÂ’ll be late yet again.<br><br>------------------<br>Passion for life is everything.
