              Hi, I am new here. I have just drawn a manga in Chinese, and needs some feedback from common readers. Is this a good place to link my website? Otherwise, anyone can give some good forums to look for feedbacks? Thanks.
              
              Edit : I am asking first before posting, to make sure forum goers are okay before posting my website or pictures. Thanks.

              <p>As long as your idea didn't have anything related to Naruto the pang sai where it is just an gay, uncouth, plagiarism - e.g from Dragon Ball and Journey to the west story. in short originality and some element of science fiction and humour like most of Marvel comic or slam dunk, I believe you can make it. One of the best example is Wallace and Gromit : <a href="http://www.wallaceandgromit.com">http://www.wallaceandgromit.com</a> or Harry Potter : <a href="http://harrypotter.warnerbros.co.uk">http://harrypotter.warnerbros.co.uk</a> , you might like to consist taking art and scriptwriting class to improve your skill.</p>
              <p>  There are also resources for improving your writing skill so that your manga will not end up as third-rate story and also you can switch to be freelance writer if things didn't work out :</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>REPORTS: <strong>S SHIVA</strong></p>
              <p>
              </p><p><br> LOCAL comic book retailer Bernard Ang has appeared in the second issue of the  new Earth 2 series by DC Comics.</p>
              <p>  In Earth 2, which features an alternative DC universe, the Green Lantern is gay and his chauffeur is modelled after the Singaporean.</p>
              <p>  Although Mr Ang is not the first Singaporean to appear in DC Comics, the way he ended up being featured is interesting.</p>
              <p>  The 31-year-old owner of GnB Comics had invited Earth 2 illustrator Nicola Scott for a meet-and-greet session at The Cathay on May 5, in conjunction with Free Comic Book Day.</p>
              <p>  "We specially invited Nicola Scott for the event, and promoted it to our fans via GnB Comics' Facebook page. It was a blast and we had a lot of fun," said Mr Ang in an e-mail interview with The New Paper. When contacted, Miss Scott confirmed that she had drawn Mr Ang into the comic.</p>
              <p>  The script for that issue had featured a character called Bernard. Miss Scott decided to model him after the Bernard she knew in real life, though the scene was set in Hong Kong and not Singapore.</p>
              <p>  "I'm often including people I know as extras, and this was a nice chance to do something for the guy who was about to bring me over.</p>
              <p>  "I looked up some photos from his Facebook account to get a firm idea of what he looked like and drew away," she said. <br>                                          <br>  The series is set in an alternative dimension of the DC universe, Earth 2.</p>
              <p>  In the comic, Alan Scott, better known as the original Green Lantern, is gay. In the  second issue of the series, which was made available on June 6, he proposes marriage to his partner, Samuel.</p>
              <p>  The fictional Bernard in the comic is the Green Lantern's chauffeur.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: red; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-SG"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: red; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-SG"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Created a buzz</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: red; line-height: 115%;" lang="EN-SG"></span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>  Although Mr Ang's appearance takes up only a few panels and he has only a few lines of dialogue, it has created a buzz among Facebook fans of his shop.</p>
              <p>  For Mr Ang, who declined to be photographed, being immortalised in such a landmark issue is a dream come true.</p>
              <p>  "I think it is cool to the max," he said.</p>
              <p>  Mr Sonny Liew, 37, a comic artist based here, said: "GnB Comics is one of the few traditional comic stores still standing, so it is definitely a great way for DC to celebrate his continued efforts in keeping the flame alive."</p>
              <p>  While Mr Liew feels that it is definitely exciting to see a Singaporean in Western comics, he added: "It is a little gimmicky perhaps, like the variant covers of the 90s, but fun for the fans for sure."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>WHO says comic book superheroes reside only in the Western parts of the world?  </p>
              <p>  Jenny Quantum is a Singaporean superhero. Clad in a suit sporting the signature red and white of the national flag, she has made many appearances in comics such as Birds of Prey, The Authority, and Stormwatch.</p>
              <p>  The brainchild of comic book veteran Mark Millar, the man behind popular comics like lhe Ultimates, Marvel Civil Wars and Kick-Ass, Jenny Quantum (below) has been featured in a number of story arcs since her debut in 2000.</p>
              <p>  Her character was further developed by award-winning writer Ed Brubaker, and she was last seen in the pages of DC Comics' Stormwatch series.</p>
              <p>  As an infant,Jenny Quantum accidentally destroyed an assailant, along with a significant portion of fictional Singapore, as she had not learnt to control her powers yet</p>
              <p>  She was the team leader of the superhero team known as The Authority from 2005 to 2008.</p>
              <p>  While Jenny Quantum is the first Singaporean superhero in Western comics, it is not the first time Singapore has been referenced in comics.</p>
              <p>  Singapore is regularly used as a setting for DC Comics. The first issue of the newly launched Wonder Woman comics began in Singapore.</p>
              <p>  In Birds of Prey, not only was Singlish included in the dialogue, but landmarks like Changi Airport could also be seen.</p>
              <p>  In the Marvel Comics universe, there is an island called Madripoor, which is said to be modelled after Singapore.</p>
              <p>  Before Mr Benard Ang's appearance in Earth 2, a Singaporean named Anthony Yeoh was included as a minor character in Birds of Prey.<br> <br>  He also gave tips to the writer of the series, Gail Simone, on how to make the setting feel more authentically Singaporean.</p>
