The last time i behaved like this, i got laughed and jeered at my many local guys/girls. Its just not the thing in society.<br><br>Besides. Gentlemen are extinct, they are replaced with MEN or GUYS.<br><br>But i am still the 1st paragraph, but scrapped the 2nd paragraph, hell, if u do a handshake its still considered too FORMAL here, the preferred thing is a wave followed by a "hi", a "how do u do" is jeered. Haha if u observe and listen, and "compose your thoughts", the rest will look at u like a weirdo retard mongoloid and shun u and exclude u in conversation over time.<br><br>Its just not the system/culture here. But i think its different for adults, somehow the feel is just right when u've got 4 wheels, a wallet full of cash, some fancy resteraunt, the feel of a suit and the feel of a dress, then that is when ppl here open up to the fantasies of European/American western dating films.</div>

When they get bored with jerks, they want gentlemen.<br><br>The fact that all of us are exposed to "wussy" moral behaviour in classes like CME already condition our mind to be BORED of the normal goodie behaviour, and are thus attracted to the "dangerious", "vulgar", "BAD-ass" qualities of jerks.<br><br>The fact that many jerks in the market seem to be in high demand shows that Males are responding to an indicator set by females to increase supply of jerks.<br><br>Thus, economic theory, 3, match supply to meet demand.</div>

But somehow what i see on the market these days really does not smack of gentility in men. Coz many of my guy friends are happily attached and all that stuff, while at the same time they are "vulgar serpents" who don't keep their hands to themselves. Many girls i know find the gentleman fading away, but they don't care. Gentlemen = good men, i suppose serpents are goodmen, the difference lies in the approach between the 2 groups.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it's it's more like a set of beliefs. It's more than the way a man talks, or the way he carries himself. It's a set of principles that are ingrained in a person, and it applies to gals as well, which compel him/her to be respectful to people and to respect himself. And his/her actions are governed by those beliefs.<br><br>I guess in a way, some actions, what people consider to be good deeds like helping an old person across the street etc, are done because it feels good to be able to help. It is satisfying, in the simplest sense. That, i spose, can be called chivalry, in modern society.<br><br>Chivalry, nowadays, means nothing more than lending a helping hand to whoever needs help. I don't think it should be limited to, like, the guy opening a door for a lady, etc.<br><br>There are many people in Singapore who are like that, though not nearly enough to make us a gracious society.<br><br>btw, as mentioned by somebody, gals are attracted to confidence. heck, guys are attracted to confident people also.<br><br>It's just that many people are immune to (c)rude behaviour that is actually unfair or disrespectful to others (eg. the guy who speaks the loudest, wins) and mistake it for confidence. Constantly trying to prove that I am better than the other guy, when taken to the extent of making him feel small, or saboing his efforts in his endeavours, i tink, not the mark of confidence but of insecurity.<br><br>Well, that said, i tink we can all be more considerate of the people around us. Just be ourselves, but a more caring, considerate person, and we can all be so-called, shu-nu - ladies, and gentlemen.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Otingocni:</div><div class="quote_body">The ancient Gentleman, anyone?<br><br>How a proper gentleman walks:<br>He takes slow gentle steps and is constantly aware of his surroundings such that any inconvenience is necessary avoided at all times. (Example: People, especially women, rushing and bumping into him.)<br><br>How a proper gentleman talks and conducts himself:<br>He greets everyone with a bow and a proper greeting of the day before he speaks. He will speak slowly and clearly enough for everyone and avoids any rash comments, rude hand movements. He composed his thoughts before he makes any comments, constantly observing and listening before he decides to put his thoughts to speech. This will avoid any unnecessary arguments and offensive comments. Before he takes his leave, he will bow and inform his chatting partners that he is taking his leave.<br><br>Are we rushing too much in life that we seldom see gentleman and ladies?<br><br></div></blockquote>wtf? slow gentle steps??? my steps are super gentle. in fact I walk without sound one. but slow? never!!!!<br><br>wtf? greet everyone with a bow? thats so lame. but as for composing my thoughts and listening before I speak, thats what I do all the time  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
