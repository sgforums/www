On normal day, nevemind.  But big project comes, she will end up wanting me to focus with her on something trivial.  I don't want to tell her what to do, just because I was more powerful in my last job (my ex boss left everything to me).  I just want to help.<br><br>For example, the deadline is Friday evening.  On Monday I told her "Since it's needed on Friday, I will start working on these few last parts of the project.  Otherwise, on Friday, it will be too rush."  And she would go like.... "No no no.  Let's look at the data first.  Computer data screwed up again!"  I mean... the deadline was only on that one day, so why not focus on this?  The website will not run away.  Plus, we were getting busier each day with the deadline.  We would not even have the time to look at the data.  So we solve the data problem for what?????<br><br>In the end, I didn't want to quarrel with her.  Since she said data impt, ok lor.  I looked at data lor.  I ended up not having enough time to do the project thing.  Certain things, from the look at it, I know I need so many hours to do.  Same for the project.  Somemore, she is so messy.  I have to tidy up a lot of things and at the same time, get the project done on time.<br><br>While I was doing her data problem, all of the sudden, she said the boss wants this and that (related to the project).  And the boss wanted it NOW!<br>I was extremely annoyed.  Cuz that thing the boss wanted, I had intended it to be done long ago.  Not NOW.  Now that the boss wanted it and I took some time to complete it, instead of sending it to her immediately.  I don't see how this is going to impress my boss.<br><br>On the whole, she is a nice person.  So I don't feel good complaining to my boss.  Besides, my boss trusts her more since she is there longer.  I keep telling my boss that she is a nice person and we get along (only tell the positive things).<br><br>But this morning, my ex boss called me.  Somehow, my current boss called him (they know each other very very well one).  My current boss asked him whether I can meet deadline when I work.  Somehow my ex boss didn't have a very good feeling about this.  He told me that the girl must have said something.  (ok lah.  She did sabo me once last month, but I have forgiven her already)<br><br>All the problems that I mentioned about prioritzing work, project deadline etc... I think they are going to be ongoing lor.<br><br>I know you all think that I should tell my current boss.  Yes, she is very understanding one.  But I don't know how to tell her without bad mouthing my colleague.  Maybe I am mentally tired... cannot think anymore.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Actually hor....

Its to explain that somethings you follow instructions and these are not in your control.

If you don't start clarifying yourself now, your boss (if you're like me a virtual boss), when there is a big fat issue that blows up and you became the scapegoat for her. You only have yourself to blame for covering up for her everytime and by then when you want to tell your boss of all the cr.ap she's done, its too late.

I have been so slow in my work because of this colleague.  And I'm so frustrated now.  You see, when you're in a job, you want to do your best.  It will make you look good what.  But hor... now working with this colleague, I macham like a newbie, an intern or what.  Plus my boss most of the time not in office.<br><br>Sometimes ah... she needed something.  I gave her via email.  Then two months later she will ask me again.  She is doing it at least once every week.  So one day, I damn sian of her like that.  I told her that I lost that email, cuz it's already two months.  I must have deleted it.  She said "You should not delete it"  <img src="http://forum.mediacorp.com.sg/board//images/smilies/mad.gif">  She herself doesn't keep that email properly, it's her problem!  Only after a while, then I retrieve and gave it to her cuz boss chasing her for that.  When I gave it to her, I made sure I forwarded the one that I sent to her two months back with the old date on it and then cc to my boss.<br><br>I damn sian ah1!!!</div></blockquote>As long as you're not UNDER her, you can always try working your own style? That is IF you're CONFIDENT ENOUGH that it'll work out FINE...?</div>
