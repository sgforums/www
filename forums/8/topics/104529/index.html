            <div class='col-md body'>Yes wanna complain about this person I am working closely with.<br>She is very disorganised (I don't see she cannot be organised after working there for three years and she's a wife and mother).<br><br>She keeps getting all the priority wrong.  On normal day, nevemind.  But big project comes, she will end up wanting me to focus with her on something trivial.  I don't want to tell her what to do, just because I was more powerful in my last job (my ex boss left everything to me).  I just want to help.<br><br>For example, the deadline is Friday evening.  On Monday I told her "Since it's needed on Friday, I will start working on these few last parts of the project.  Otherwise, on Friday, it will be too rush."  And she would go like.... "No no no.  Let's look at the data first.  Computer data screwed up again!"  I mean... the deadline was only on that one day, so why not focus on this?  The website will not run away.  Plus, we were getting busier each day with the deadline.  We would not even have the time to look at the data.  So we solve the data problem for what?????<br><br>In the end, I didn't want to quarrel with her.  Since she said data impt, ok lor.  I looked at data lor.  I ended up not having enough time to do the project thing.  Certain things, from the look at it, I know I need so many hours to do.  Same for the project.  Somemore, she is so messy.  I have to tidy up a lot of things and at the same time, get the project done on time.<br><br>While I was doing her data problem, all of the sudden, she said the boss wants this and that (related to the project).  And the boss wanted it NOW!<br>I was extremely annoyed.  Cuz that thing the boss wanted, I had intended it to be done long ago.  Not NOW.  Now that the boss wanted it and I took some time to complete it, instead of sending it to her immediately.  I don't see how this is going to impress my boss.<br><br>On the whole, she is a nice person.  So I don't feel good complaining to my boss.  Besides, my boss trusts her more since she is there longer.  I keep telling my boss that she is a nice person and we get along (only tell the positive things).<br><br>But this morning, my ex boss called me.  Somehow, my current boss called him (they know each other very very well one).  My current boss asked him whether I can meet deadline when I work.  Somehow my ex boss didn't have a very good feeling about this.  He told me that the girl must have said something.  (ok lah.  She did sabo me once last month, but I have forgiven her already)<br><br>All the problems that I mentioned about prioritzing work, project deadline etc... I think they are going to be ongoing lor.<br><br>I know you all think that I should tell my current boss.  Yes, she is very understanding one.  But I don't know how to tell her without bad mouthing my colleague.  Maybe I am mentally tired... cannot think anymore.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

It was a big mess, I admit.  That's why I am sooooooo annoyed now.  Last time I ownself did a few roadshows outside plus events at my work place, I could do it in orderly manners.  There is this thing call "To Do List" which I will always create for myself as I can be forgetful and with so many things going on.<br><br>But this colleague of mine, never do that one lor!  She can early in the morning ask me help her to get something somewhere (for work one lah) when I was on the way to work.   She didn't know that she needed it last night meh!???!?!  That thing was so impt.  She cannot write down somewhere to remind meh!?!?!?  I am not a neat person myself.  Last time depend so much on my Admin Asst and Intern to help me get things organised.<br><br>But now I get to see someone so much worse than me.  Don't organise things nevermind.  Messy nevermind.  But don't mess up my work with your own mess lah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just had dinner with my ex boss, cuz I helped him today on his project (very last min one).  Then we had dinner.  He told me what he heard from my boss and what he believed to have happened behind my back.  He just told me to be careful of my colleague.  Not much info from him.  But he wanted to hear my side of the story in case my current boss talks to him again about me.  sighhhh</div>
