              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif">   1. If your friend choose the shop gal, he'll hurt his current gf if she finds out. There probably won't be a chance for your friend to continue with her if it doesn't work out with the shop girl.</p>

              <p> Its like a 50 50 risk hes gonna take.</p>
              <p>Well firstly your friend has gotta ask himself whether he loves his gf, if he doesnt love his gf. Then just dump her. Whats the point of loving both when you even can't? If he doesn't make up his mind, he will lose both.</p>
              <p>He's risking his relationship to be with a girl he barely knows. So why dont start off as general friends and see whether you get along well. You can simply test a girl, ask your questions and see how she responds. That's how I always prepare myself for the worst.</p>
              <p>It's your friends choice to decide how he wants to react to it.</p>

              <p>so that means ur so called "friend" finds girls based on looks only?</p>
              <p>ask ur "friend" what is he looking for in a girl, is it just about looks only or personality is more important?</p>
              <p>if u think ur "friend" feels pressurized to be with his current gf, then the answer is quite obvious already. but if ur "friend" still truly loves his gf and willing to tolerate her nonsense, why still find another girl? ur "friend" is obviously a jerk.</p>

              sigh....is it my buttie's fault again?!
              
              apart from the shop gal episode 
              my buttie is constantly fighting w his ol gf
              they fight fast and makeup fast too
              but really can get quite weary
              
              yesterday they went out to suntec 
              then met this pretty gal wearing a v nice short dress 
              not the type of body hugging zouk cheong type 
              but soft summer babydoll dress type
              
              bec mall lift v crowded and sinkaporeans really v ks all squeeze and squeeze
              till she got v v close to my buttie 
              she really smells quite gd and got really nice legs
              
              then afterwards when they got out of the lift
              the buttie just innocently told the gf just now tat babe dress quite nice
              accentuated her legs
              
              then the gf exploded
              WTH!

              the reason she said that is bec last time once 
              this gf ever visited my buttie house
              then buttie's mother accidentally commented tat her skirt howcome so short
              it was jsut a passing remark nothing much
              
              and she got a bit pissed off
              bec she is the rich man dotter type 
              v wilful do watever she wish all the time nobody dare to tell her off type
              
              my buttie was pretty neutral didnt really said anything
              but gals really have elephant memory 
              small small thing also can rem so long

              actually the gf was wearing a short denim skirt yesterday too
              the buttie also complimented she look quite gd but never complain to her 
              he dont like her top
              
              she was wearing this v super thin white tshirt w black bra
              esp with her hair tied up really look a bit on bitchy sluttish lianish type
              but he also endured never said anything
              
              bec she always say she look pretty attract attention also bring face to the buttie
              but the buttie is dont like this kind of attention he himself is v low profile type
              look sexy in own bedroom can liao no need to go out parade mah

              in comparison the shop gal is much nicer person
              temper much better she really listens and do watever my buttie says
              
              should buttie fire this gf and be together w the shop gal?
              or continue to endure this gf and hope to reach more mutual understding in future
              and just be a v gd fren w the shop gal?
              
              its becoming a typical bad attituded sg gal vs gd natured penang sg thing now

              i think the shop gal will make a v nice little sweet wife and mother
              but she is a bit kampong spirited live in a diff social world 
              there is a gulf between her and my buttie
              
              the ol gf is closer, sinkaporean mah, same social circle same culture
              but also have the bad typical sinkaporean attitude - kiasu kiasee v competitive 
              
              both gals are decent looking may not be mega babes 
              but i think above average for sg standard liao
              comparable if not better than most pc show gals 
              
              penang shop gal is slightly taller, leggy, sweeter demure looking
              ol gal is slightly shorter, slightly more boobs, hot but dao looking
              looks wise they are quite = no one is significantly better
              
              but looks are not everything
              char is more impt for long lasting relationship
              having a flaming sex bomb in bed but cannot stay together not much pt isnt it
              
              man not beast leh
