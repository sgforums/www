              <p>Well.. I don't post very often but I do go around reading up on different threads. To be true, it's not difficult to see threads being hijacked by msbonker and dadood.. The conversations usually are not related to the topic of the thread...</p>
              <p>To be fair to msbonker.. I don't think it's her going around attracting attention.. From what I have observed.. It's the guy who has been doing the pestering.. Kinda of turn off as I think this action of him has usually resulted in the thread going off track...   </p>

              <p>look whos's going OT now. This thread isnt anything about hijacking. if u are so strict as to sticking to the thread topic and nothing else besides it, why are u slapping ur mouth now? u love self contradictions?</p>
