            <div class='col-md body'>It's the whole package...really...even if eyes aren't so nice or smile not so nice, but if somehow everything somehow fits just nicely then it's ok wif me...I've met a lot of really pretty girls also, but never even felt any kind of attraction at all towards them...no chemistry i guess....<br><br>Actually I find most girls attractive until i talk to them...It's when I find out if I feel any attraction or not....hmmm...that's all........but actually hah, she must have a quite nice body...he he:-) did I just contradict myself?<br><br>I'm kind of strange because If i know the girl can do things and is very capable...i will be hugely attracted to her...Love women who are intelligent and are independent and are talented...But on the other hand, I am also a big sucker for girls who are not so smart or able...it somehow makes them seem helpless and it makes me want to really take care of them...I know this girl, and she's so sad and a bit pathetic, but knowing that, I feel so compelled to go over and give her a hug or buy her something...(of course I doubt she's so helpless) just as long as I can somehow make her happy...<br><br>Strange...u see what i mean by i find most people attractive?  I also like really birtchy girls..altho i might complain...I get so turned on...or I really like very sweet girls...but usaully they don't like me much...cause I'm a bit too open for them.<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 25-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, it's gotta be a pouty lower lip. On my first date with my boyfiend, I kept staring at his pouty lower lip and fantasizing how it'll feel like to suck on it. When he smiles, his lips are especially full, and he has this way of licking at them. Really turned me on. I got to lock lips with him eventually, by the way, and they feel every bit as good as I had imagined.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 25-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Asure - if the story's true, then i think i was born an old man! i've always had a thing for butts and legs....more so i think than that part of the female anatomy you call crude.<br><br>but i dunno, let's see....maybe in pri school, we're all so short....so we don't notice the legs....and only looked at the face.....but in sec school, since gals grow faster than guys, then naturally you'd think we were staring at ur breasts.....when we guys were really only looking straight ahead.<br><br>but i dunno abt looking at the legs when ur old tho....maybe the old folk are peeping at u from the top of their bifocals, so they have to tilt their heads....and so u think they're staring at ur legs....haha!<br><br>interesting article.... but dun think any of us remember the way we look at girls in such historical detail tho....we just know we were always looking at them! the exact part don't matter man!<br><br>what's also interesting is the way u made a leap from "sec school" to "old man".....what happened to all the time in between? looking at ur bellies maybe? yeah.....from sec school to old man, we spend 40 yrs oogling ur belly button....hehe!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by fadingstar (edited 26-11-1999).]</div>
