            <div class='col-md body'>I'm seriously fed up with people who say things like 'Tsunami helps Singapore win'. That Indonesia allows Singapore to win because Singapore helped them.<br><br>This is an absolute insult to both countries. On one hand, you are insulting the Indonesia team for their lack of backbones, you are saying that they have no sense of national pride. On the other hand, you are saying that Singapore is a skillless squad, that only the backboneless Indonesia team will let them win.<br><br>Let's look at the two match. Indonesia played a attacking game with four attacking players, hoping to penetrate the Singapore defense as soon as possible and scoring enough goals to seal the game. Those watching the match would find it quite shocking for Daniel to score suddenly even when the Indonesia team is taking the game to the Lion's mouth. It was a long range 'let's try my luck again!' shot from way out. Somehow his luck is good, the ball got deflected and went in. Next we have the Indonesia attacking, attacking and attacking(they almost scored, but it hitted the post)! Left, right, center! At the 27mins, after a strong tackle from Baihakki, their danger man Boas was withdrawn. With that, the Indonesia attack lose steam.<br><br>The second match was play with Indonesia lacking their main men. Two suspended player and one injuried. The Indonesia team have to throw in a make-shift defense and a attack without enough bite. Throughout the game, we can see Indonesia attacking the Singapore goal without a break. Singapore had but a few chances. An early goal by Indra  greatly demoralize the Indonesia team. And Indonesia jsut keeps on attacking, and if not for Lionel Lewis, Singapore would be the losing team, with their tail hidden somewhere.<br><br>Since 1977, Singapore have played Indonesia 22 times. Winning 13 times, and losing  6 times. In the last 10 meetings between the 2, Singapore won 6 times and Indonesia twice. A few months before the Tiger Cup, Singapore beat Indonesia in a friendly game 2-0. The truth is Singapore have been constantly good against Indonesia, and have not lose to them in the last few meetings in 2004. Can we beat them on our own merit? YES!<br><br>But it's time to stop looking at the Tiger Cup and move on to scale taller mountains. First, bring the Sea Games Gold back! If they can win the Tiger Cup, why not the Sea Games Gold?</div>

Indonesia played a attacking game with four attacking players, hoping to penetrate the Singapore defense as soon as possible and scoring enough goals to seal the game. Those watching the match would find it quite shocking for Daniel to score suddenly even when the Indonesia team is taking the game to the Lion's mouth. It was a long range 'let's try my luck again!' shot from way out. Somehow his luck is good, the ball got deflected and went in. Next we have the Indonesia attacking, attacking and attacking(they almost scored, but it hitted the post)! Left, right, center! At the 27mins, after a strong tackle from Baihakki, their danger man Boas was withdrawn. With that, the Indonesia attack lose steam.<br><br>The second match was play with Indonesia lacking their main men. Two suspended player and one injuried. The Indonesia team have to throw in a make-shift defense and a attack without enough bite. Throughout the game, we can see Indonesia attacking the Singapore goal without a break. Singapore had but a few chances. An early goal by Indra  greatly demoralize the Indonesia team. And Indonesia jsut keeps on attacking, and if not for Lionel Lewis, Singapore would be the losing team, with their tail hidden somewhere.<br><br>Since 1977, Singapore have played Indonesia 22 times. Winning 13 times, and losing  6 times. In the last 10 meetings between the 2, Singapore won 6 times and Indonesia twice. A few months before the Tiger Cup, Singapore beat Indonesia in a friendly game 2-0. The truth is Singapore have been constantly good against Indonesia, and have not lose to them in the last few meetings in 2004. Can we beat them on our own merit? YES!<br><br>But it's time to stop looking at the Tiger Cup and move on to scale taller mountains. First, bring the Sea Games Gold back! If they can win the Tiger Cup, why not the Sea Games Gold? </div></blockquote>true true...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
