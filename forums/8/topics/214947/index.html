But even there, lighting is drastically reduced.<br><br>The result, as shown in this picture taken one night earlier this week, is a startling contrast between the blacked-out north and the south, which is ablaze with light, particularly around major cities and the capital, Seoul, in the north-west of the country.<br><br>Mr Rumsfeld showed the picture to illustrate how backward the northern regime really is - and how oppressed its people are. Without electricity there can be none of the appliances that make life easy and that we take for granted, he said.<br><br>"Except for my wife and family, that is my favourite photo," said Mr Rumsfeld.<br><br>"It says it all. There's the south, the same people as the north, the same resources north and south, and the big difference is in the south it's a free political system and a free economic system.<br><br>"The people in the north are starving, their growth is stunted. It's a shame, a tragedy."<br><br>An aide added: "This oppressive regime is too busy trying to make war to make life comfortable for its people."<br></div>

Their spin machine was working overtime. Saddam was a cruel dictator and he massacred his own people.<br><br>Recently again the spin shifted to Mr Admadinejad. I can only watch in dismay, in truth Mr Ahmadinejad is a very simple man who avoid luxuries, a principled man, and a conservative. He is trying to defend Iran honour while Iran is being talked-down by USA. I really sympathize him. Western spin media try to portray this man instead as some sort of Anti-Jewish 'insane nuts'.<br><br>Now back to North Korea, I just have a question to ask you all here:<br><br>Why is North Korea testing a nuclear bomb? Why is North Korea testing missiles?<br><br>I have a similar question to ask along with those questions:<br><br>Why is Singapore having compulsory military conscription?<br><br>Why is Isreal having compulsory military conscription? Why Isreal has 200 nuclear missiles?<br><br>Why Pakistan tested nuclear bomb?<br><br>The answer is all the same.<br><br>Is it true, that Kim Jong Il is an insane man, that North Korea government is filled with irresponsible officials?<br><br>Is it true, that they want to develop nuclear weapon, because they want to threaten world peace?<br><br>Why is a poor small country developing nuclear weapon despite being pressurised and cornered by world superpowers? They have nothing better to do? They have extra cash they want to spend?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before Mr Bush, the true insane president, had a brilliant idea of terming North Korea as 'Axis of Evil' , do you think this will happen?<br><br>If USA agree to hold bilateral talks, do you think this will happen?<br><br>If USA resolves peacefully its differences with North Korea, do you think they want to spend their effort, money, time, to develop a nuclear weapon?<br><br>If USA did not cancel its water reactor deal and did not put financial blockade on the poor nation, which scuttle the negotiation process, will this happen?<br><br>What are they supposed to do? Their tanks are soviet made from 1960s, no electricity, no fuel, they are very poor, they even have to maintain one of the world's biggest army.<br><br>Look at Iraq now, that is what happen Bush 'Axis of Evil'.<br><br>Iran is a developing story, soon to follow.<br><br>So is it true that by having nuclear detterent, they are insane? They are irresponsible?</div>
