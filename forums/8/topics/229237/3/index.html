They will replace for you. I've replaced a monitor. It's FOC.<br><br>After 30 days, they don't replace for you. Rather, you have to hunt down the different distributors. You can always ask the Fuwell people, they will tell you where.</div>

If you don't know how to build, they will build for you, in about 1 to 2 hours time, depending on the number of customers they have. Extra service charge for this, how much I forgot.</div>
