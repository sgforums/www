And i can see that she works just for her pay.<br><br>Things that she do.<br><br>1: She kind of refuse to help students that are weak in mother tounge. And for those that fail, she will call up their parents and force them to join CLB.<br><br>2: She does not even check and mark our work. Some of my friends even hand in undone work all the time as they know she wont check. And during double periods. She will provide our monitor the answer script ask him write on the blackboard and we mark ourself. She wont bother to explain until someone ask.<br><br>3: She dont really teach all the shen zi of the shou ce. If she do, its only a breif explanation. One "ci" she take about 20seconds she skip to the other ci liao.<br><br>4: As our form teacher. She does not really bother to collect giro forms from us. Most of the time she just assign everything to monitor to collect. Same goes to our chinese zhou ye. She expects our monitor to collect every single zhou ye from us and mark see who never hand in. And i can see this is very tiring for our monitor.<br><br>5. Sometimes she comes in to the class. With radio set and CD. Can listen to the same passage a few times. Which is meaningless. Then bell ring she go liao. Other times she comes in with a few close passage and ask us do. While she sit there slack.<br><br>6: She does not even bother to check for errors in test papers. There was this time when the test paper has alot of mistake. And my friend had to slowly point out one by one to her. Then even the test "compre" got lines alot also dunnoe. Ask us bring out foolscap to write until my friend tell her that got provide lines. Obviously never even turn over the paper to see.<br><br>Can complain? Like that no motivation kind of teacher. KNN.
