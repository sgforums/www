            <div class='col-md body'>When I say a teacher is good means like he/she is able to by any means get the students to have interest and study for the subject.<br><br>I have one amaths teacher who is damn fierce and every lesson he will be shouting. Not to mention he also will target students personally etc. No body likes him and if you never do his homework his punishment is not to give you worksheet or make you drop Amaths. many people are actually scared of him.<br><br>U know what, even if everyone hates him, my sch amaths distinction rate is 90% and end of the day everyone thanks him for their grades. so if the teacher is willing to put in the effort in chasing students and giving them real punishments that will make them feel scared, he can produce a class of all As...<br>The worst is like 4-5 students get b3,b4.<br><br>Let me tell you for chinese my school's MT department is damn slacky. My teacher is very identical to yours except that he actually tells alot of jokes. His a guy, quite young 30, when he tell jokes his quite cute and stuff so the class likes him. He does what your teacher does BUT he gets his way without everyone else knowing. His not like ur old hag that bitches around and anything she does also people don't like.<br><br>About my sch's MT department, all the sch does is to have an intensive ISP program like for 2 weeks EVERYDAY after school. Students are like forced to memorize stuff for onli this 2 weeks. For me, slacker type, I pon almost like half of it. End up, my class is like almost everybody gotA1,A2 except like 10 people who got b3. And only 1 C6. it's not very fantastic results but..u see, things can be chionged at last minute. At least, Olevels is EASY enough for pple to do that. No nid to worry about everyday lessons one.<br><br>And in addition. chinese is like taken in mid years. It's like a standalone subject so you got ALOT of time to mug for it. It's like for that one week you can focus on nothing but chinese. Even if you suck balls in that subject u surely can scrape through and get a B3 like me. Compared to end of yrs Olevels where you take ALMOST everything. Which is easier, u tell me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Xephone_xenon:</div><div class="quote_body">I am sorry to say i have a really slackish form teacher this year.<br>She teaches us chinese too. She is in her mid 40s. And i can see that she works just for her pay.<br><br>Things that she do.<br><br>1: She kind of refuse to help students that are weak in mother tounge. And for those that fail, she will call up their parents and force them to join CLB.<br><br>2: She does not even check and mark our work. Some of my friends even hand in undone work all the time as they know she wont check. And during double periods. She will provide our monitor the answer script ask him write on the blackboard and we mark ourself. She wont bother to explain until someone ask.<br><br>3: She dont really teach all the shen zi of the shou ce. If she do, its only a breif explanation. One "ci" she take about 20seconds she skip to the other ci liao.<br><br>4: As our form teacher. She does not really bother to collect giro forms from us. Most of the time she just assign everything to monitor to collect. Same goes to our chinese zhou ye. She expects our monitor to collect every single zhou ye from us and mark see who never hand in. And i can see this is very tiring for our monitor.<br><br>5. Sometimes she comes in to the class. With radio set and CD. Can listen to the same passage a few times. Which is meaningless. Then bell ring she go liao. Other times she comes in with a few close passage and ask us do. While she sit there slack.<br><br>6: She does not even bother to check for errors in test papers. There was this time when the test paper has alot of mistake. And my friend had to slowly point out one by one to her. Then even the test "compre" got lines alot also dunnoe. Ask us bring out foolscap to write until my friend tell her that got provide lines. Obviously never even turn over the paper to see.<br><br>Can complain? Like that no motivation kind of teacher. KNN. I know students also not much motivation la. But then teachers are suppose to lead,guide and push us right? If can complain how ?<br></div></blockquote>1, 2 and 3. If you are from a graduating class and she has taught you guys last year, she most likely has given up on your class. Me got first hand experience...<br><br>4. Hmm... different schools work differently? I remember my school also like that. Alternatively, assign subject representatives and other kinds of representatives, so as to lighten his load.<br><br>5. It's not meant to be meaningless to keep hearing the radio repeating the passages a lot of times. This is to drill the words into your head, so you know how to read those words when you come across them again.<br><br>The last part on she slacking... probably related to points 1, 2 and 3.<br><br>6. Nothing to say for your teacher...<br><br>You guys could complain to your principal or HOD for Chinese (provided she's not the HOD, if she's HOD for Chinese, go straight to principal)<br><br>As I said, if she has taught you guys before and belong to the graduating batch, she has probably given up on you all... then no point complaining. Just need to be on your own now...</div>
