We all know picking up languages is hard<br>And its not like the stronger students have really excellent chinese.<br>I am not asking for much.<br>I am just asking for the teacher to put in more effort and at least gurantee 80% of the students a C6 when they reach O level.<br>But she aint doing it. For everyone that fail, she just ask them to take CLB.<br>At the same time, if more pupils go to CLB = less pupils in class = less work for her.<br>And for the better students, she kept encouraging us to go for the express stream. Even when we told her we wont be able to cope there. She didt care. She just force us to go.<br>She even suggested to the HOD to transfer some of our class students to the class next door during chinese.<br>For many things she do. Somehow it relates to decresing the amount of pupils in the class.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even if the class is hopeless, my school never do that.<br><br>I would suggest that you bring this up to the HOD or your Principal. If it doesn't work out, you can get the class to sign the letter and get it forwarded to the Principal and CC to MOE.<br><br>I'm just being thankful that my Principal was rather helpful. For eg, my class was sandwiched between 2 NT class which is very noisy and disruptive. We were badly distracted for 1 week and we brought this issue up to our teachers and the Principal and we got to change our classroom within the next week.</div>
