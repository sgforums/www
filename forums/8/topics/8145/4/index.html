I managed to catch some sleep on my first day of work, but only a few winks. The rest of it, immediately when I came back had dinner and everything, continued my beauty sleep til the next morning. Still didn't have enough sleep and continued to do the same today at work, hehehe......but now I am not thaat sleepy yet, hehe......<br>And no, Dino Zoff should not resign. For I truly agree with his tactics, his emphasis on defence, that only a good defence is a surefire way of winning a tournament. The team lost, but it was not his fault. So I hope he doesn't go.<br><br>&gt;&gt; FNU<br><br>Kevin Keegan is a big disgrace lah. And I heard Terry Venerables is interested in getting back the old job. And I seriously think England under him would be better too. At least they went to the semi-finals in 96. And one important reason why Arsene Wenger doesn't qualify - he is French.<br><br>&gt;&gt; Moose<br><br>For info, France is already in the World Cup finals, and I am sure you know the traditional soccer powerhouses who will surely feature in the World Cup finals. So it wouldn't be too difficult to guess what will happen. It will be a Japan vs Korea finals, hahahaha......<br><br>&gt;&gt; i-am-twat<br><br>well, i dunt know whether u can do that, but if u say u can, i am sure u can then  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zoff resigned after attack from Berlusconi<br>By Sean Smith<br>Italian national coach Dino Zoff has resigned after his side's 2-1 defeat in the final of Euro 2000 against France on Sunday.<br><br>His resignation comes after he was severely criticised for his tactics in refusing to man-mark Zinedine Zidane and his side's defensive approach throughout the tournament.<br><br>Zoff had been under pressure even before the tournament began after embarassing defeats against Norway and Belgium and few people in Italy believed a side under Zoff had much chance of success.<br><br>But an impressively easy qualification from Group B raised the country's expectations and after riding their luck against the Dutch in the semi-final hope was at its highest.<br><br>Losing to a last gasp equaliser and a Golden Goal was too much for some early critics to let pass though and the influential owner of AC Milan, Silvio Berlusconi, could not resist another crack at a coach he had taken much delight in criticising before.<br><br>Berlusconi said after the final that he was 'indignant' that Zoff had not assigned a man to mark Zinedine Zidane, saying the result of the final would have been different if he had.<br><br>In a protracted tirade from the centre-right leader he also described Zoff's strategy as 'undignified' and 'the actions of one of the last amateur coaches'.<br><br>Zoff immediately replied with a press conference in which he declared his intention to reply 'personally' to Berlusconi. He also handed in his resignation.<br><br>It is not yet known whether his resignation has been aceepted by the Italian FA. Zoff becomes the third Euro 2000 semi-final coach to have left his team after the resignations of Portugal's Humberto Coelho and Holland's Frank Rijkaard.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> FnU  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>------------------<br>Â·RÂ¤Â£Â·RÂµÂ²ÂªGÂ³Â£Â±Ã�Â¤HÂ¶Ã‹Â¤ÃŸ Â§ÃšÂ¤Â£ÂªÂ¾Â¹DÂ¸Ã“Â«Ã§Â¤\Â§@Â¨MÂ©w<br>Â¤Ã€Â¤Ã¢Ã€Â³Â¸Ã“Â¬OÂ­nÂ¥Ã½Â­ÃºÂª_<br>Ã�Ã™Â¬OÂ¥Ã½Â§Ã‘Â°O Â§AÂ¬OÂ§_Â¤]Â¦Â³Â¬Ã›Â¦PÂªÂºÃƒÃ¸ÃƒD<br>Â§AÂªÂºÂ«iÂ®Ã°Â¨Â½Â¦Â³Â§ÃšÂªÂºÂ©RÂ¹B Â§ÃšÂ¤Â£ÂªÂ¾Â¹DÂ§AÂ·|Â¤Â£Â·|Â¨MÂ©w<br>Â§ÃšÂ·QÂ§ÃšÂ²{Â¦bÃ�Ã™Â¤Â£Â°Ã·Â²MÂ¿Ã´<br>Â¸Ã“Â·RÂµÃ›Â§A Â¸Ã“Ã‚Ã·Â¶}Â§A<br>Ã�Ã™Â¬OÃ„~Ã„Ã²Â°kÃ�Ã—<br>Â¡@</div>
