              <p>used this M1 broadband daily in Tanjong pagar area. 512K plan</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>seems to have some problems running on Vista - even the M1 Paragon techs guys also can't solve it currently (sometimes the drive of the M1 device can't be detected by my notebook, tried on other notebooks as well, so facing the same problem)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>overall</p>

              <p>I am currently subscribed to the M1 Broadband V1800 plan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Feedbacks on....</p>
              <p>Speed:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Connection speed is slow slow slow. Period. All the talk about speed is spit. All the claims about "New Super Fast" is bullcrap.</li>
              <li>What is 'Slow' I hear you ask? Well, previously I was subscribed to the Sunsurf and M1 Broadband on my Nokia E90 is NO faster. At least not significantly. What's all the talk about 9 times...blah blah blah... What device I am using? I'm basing it on my Nokia E90 with the lastest v07.40 firmware.</li>
              <li>So how do I know if it's not due to my phone? Well, cos when I connect via my wireless LAN from home, it's fast fast fast (based on my average Starhub broadband sub via Apple Airport).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Issues:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>I kept getting 'connection error' when making voice calls. I.e. cannot call out.</li>
              <li>Others cannot call in and were divert to my voicemail inbox.</li>
              <li>SMS gets jammed somewhere.</li>
              <li>'Web time out', 'Server not found', etc...I guess that's why the unlimited plan is for...so that you can try and re-try. Tested while making parallel surfs on pc.</li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Policy:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>They do not provide dual/multiple SIM card for this service (what service?). So what it means? It means that whenever I need to use the 'loan' SIM modem, I will have to remove the SIM from my mobile phone and slot in into the SIM modem. And connect the SIM modem to my pc via usb. And here's the best part, in order to receive incoming calls, I have to use a LAND wired telephone!!!!!!! I can screw my $1.3k Nokia E90...</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Wow.</p>
              <p>Maybe M1 cannot track usage thus sub can only use ONE SIM card at a time.</p>
              <p>So, what I am getting out of this whole policy is that....for those road warriors that M1 Broadband is targeting, they (we) have to carry a SIM modem AS WELL AS a fixed LAND line telephone so that when we need to surf wirelessly all over the island, we can have access to telephone calls!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What about sms??</p>
              <p>I guess M1 has decided for you that since incoming smses are free and that the SIM modem cannot make sms out. You being the consumer are pretty much set!</p>
              <p>Wow. Wow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SIM Modem - Huawei E960 router:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>This is the load item I was talking about. Bus powered. All you need is a usb cable, SIM card, AND windows OS pc! Wtf???? I'm an Apple user. Hello???</li>
              <li>And the fun apart. It can be AC/DC powered but the power adaptor is not provided. HAHAHAHA...they loan you a set by you need to buy the power adaptor. Buy adpator for a loan set g*ml*n???<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Flipped.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a M1 user since '98. M1 Broadband sounds promising but they are not delivering. For the M1 Broadband v1800 that goes UP TO 1.8mbps....I am disappointed. I never experience that speed on my mobile phone. Think it's always 512 most of the time IMO.</p>
              <p>Unlimited data charges is attractive....but after the dust has settled, I will prefer a more reliable source of connection. Now, the only connection I get is to 1627 technical helpdesk and their corp comms!</p>
              <p>Maybe I will try Singtel IDEAS soon. Any feedbacks on IDEAS?</p>

              <p>nice write up :)</p>
              <p>but i do have the power cable for E960 router .... they provide. but the advert saying this is the new device for the future and most office or company will use is totally crap... is better for them to use the dial up... cos its faster that way..</p>
              <p>i dun even get 200kbps.. how can i feel the 1.8MBps as claim ? and 1 sxxt thing is.. once u got it.. 6 months u r dead with it...</p>
              <p>any good suggestion for wireless one ? going to abolish this one very soon !!! total crap !</p>
              <p>Amazingly funny.. that i have a Malaysian 3G card that i think is much much faster then this M1....</p>

              <p>I tot I would have given up calling M1 1627....but as I was having my dinner at Han's Upper Thomson road today, internet connection came to a complete halt!!!</p>
              <p>WTF?</p>
              <p>So I called up 1627 (surprise surprise it got thru..) and I was told that they have numerous reports of lost signal in Upper Thomson area???!! Wtf???</p>
              <p>i'm not the asshole consumer so I politely asked the officer if he had a solution. It wasn't a direct answer but simply put - NO.</p>
              <p>Since I have made me feedbacks to M1 countless times on M1 Broadband...I told them to inform some 'mgt level' peeps...guess they are all glorified CC peeps...siazn...</p>
              <p>What should I do??? I hope to stay with M1 but with that kinda of service, they are eroding my faith in them and I would rather pay for better services, if there are any in Singtel or Starhub.</p>
              <p>Advise?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P/S: I dun mind trying out other telco since I do not have any contracts with M1.</p>
              <p>Now listen M1, I have been patience enough...if you dun have it...dun flaunt it.</p>

              <p>Well er....the other post was locked cos there is some resemblance to this thread instead...well...whatever Hebe said, should be right anyway...</p>
              <p>Anyhow, the question as above...anyone diss M1 (whether it's for M1 Broadband,  Sunperks, Sunsurf, watever...M1 as a whole....)???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And just to add that they (M1) is doing their youdeservebetter thingy....farney i went online today 28 April...gave them my 5cents...and submit....damn....the T&amp;C said that the campaign ended 25 April 2008!</p>
              <p>So what it means to me? It means that coining 'youdeservebetter' is another marketing ploy which fails. Why fail? No, I'm not judging by the amount of awareness they have chalked up via paid tvc...it failed cos they ask you to tell them what you want, but they need to dangle 3 carrots to lure you to do that...to me, that's not ask us for opinion, it's a marketing farce.</p>

              <div id="post-body-8044268" class="body">I always think that if anyone is serious with getting feedbacks and public opinions of their products and services, they dun need carrots cos their earnest supporter will, without fail, offer their wish lists.</div>
              <div class="body"><br></div>
              <div class="body">Check out the 'survey' and data mining ploy...what sorta survey was that?</div>
              <div class="body"><br></div>
              <div class="body">So where do I stand now as M1 customer? I am a fustrated M1 Broadband v1800 customer who can't wait to change to another telco once there is a competive offer. M1 may be laughing at me now...well...it's not gonna be long.<br></div>
