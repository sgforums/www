            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure you've had heard ppl always comment that army personnel are a bunch of lazy bummers. Only lazy, people with no ambition, not educated and what have you sign on with the army. I'm not going to try to deny any of the above, in fact, i agree and testify, to a certain extent, the truth that can be found in that statement cause there are bound to be black sheeps in every occupation, i.e. Bishops with sex scandals, Presidents' and prime ministers with sex scandals, infidelity among royalties, Major crimes, rapes and drug abuse, committed by sports/superstars who are idolised by millions. I think i've made my point.<br><br>You could argue that these are isolated cases, but why can't you do the same for people who carve out a career in the army? People who literally bleed and sweat to earn their pay, how many jobs out there can say the same thing? (no offence to the coustruction/building industry or foreign labours and any other whom i missed out) Though i won't be able to say that the majority of the army personnels are there because of patriotism or honour, but at least 20% of them fall into that category, the rest are just there to earn their keep. But i'm quite positively sure that in times of needs, most, if not ALL of them will be there to do their job, during the tsunami, 1 Coy of SAF personnel was activated to indonesia for manpower assistance. While the rest of us just scurry away to our safe haven in foreign lands, these people, whether they like it or not, are out there. That's called professionalism.<br></div>

I could work towrads nothing for a decade without any outcome. but such a life would be meaningless. There must be something for ppl to look forward to, and hope that they get there with effort of cos.</div>

Only lazy, people with no ambition, not educated and what have you sign on with the army. I'm not going to try to deny any of the above, in fact, i agree and testify, to a certain extent, the truth that can be found in that statement cause there are bound to be black sheeps in every occupation, i.e. Bishops with sex scandals, Presidents' and prime ministers with sex scandals, infidelity among royalties, Major crimes, rapes and drug abuse, committed by sports/superstars who are idolised by millions. I think i've made my point.<br><br>You could argue that these are isolated cases, but why can't you do the same for people who carve out a career in the army? People who literally bleed and sweat to earn their pay, how many jobs out there can say the same thing? (no offence to the coustruction/building industry or foreign labours and any other whom i missed out) Though i won't be able to say that the majority of the army personnels are there because of patriotism or honour, but at least 20% of them fall into that category, the rest are just there to earn their keep. But i'm quite positively sure that in times of needs, most, if not ALL of them will be there to do their job, during the tsunami, 1 Coy of SAF personnel was activated to indonesia for manpower assistance. While the rest of us just scurry away to our safe haven in foreign lands, these people, whether they like it or not, are out there. That's called professionalism.<br></div></blockquote>ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
