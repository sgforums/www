            <div class='col-md body'><br>&gt;One day a teacher asked her students to list the names of the<br>&gt;other students in the room on two sheets of paper, leaving a<br>&gt;space between each name.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Then she told them to think of the nicest thing they could say<br>&gt;about each of their classmates and write it down.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;It took the remainder of the class period to finish their<br>&gt;assignment, and as the students left the room, each one handed<br>&gt;in the papers.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;That Saturday, the teacher wrote down the name of each student<br>&gt;on a separate sheet of paper, and listed what everyone else had<br>&gt;said about that individual.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;On Monday she gave each student his or her list. Before long,<br>&gt;the entire class was smiling.<br>&gt;"Really?" she heard whispered. "I never knew that I meant<br>&gt;anything to anyone!" and, "I didn't know others liked me so<br>&gt;much." were most of the comments.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;No one ever mentioned those papers in class again. She never<br>&gt;knew if they discussed them after class with their parents, but<br>&gt;it didn't matter. The exercise had accomplished its purpose. The<br>&gt;students were happy with themselves and one another.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;That group of students moved on. Several years later, one of the<br>&gt;students was killed in Vietnam and his teacher attended the<br>&gt;funeral of that special student.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;She had never seen a serviceman in a military coffin before. He<br>&gt;looked so handsome, so mature. The church was packed with his<br>&gt;friends.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;One by one those who loved him took a last walk by the coffin.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The teacher was the last one to bless the coffin.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;As she stood there, one of the soldiers who acted as pallbearer<br>&gt;came up to her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Were you Mark's math teacher?" he asked. She nodded: "yes."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Then he said: "Mark talked about you a lot."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;After the funeral, most of Mark's former classmates went<br>&gt;together to a luncheon. Mark's mother and father were there,<br>&gt;obviously waiting to speak with his teacher.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"We want to show you something," his father said, taking a<br>&gt;wallet out of his pocket. "They found this on Mark when he was<br>&gt;killed. We thought you might recognize it."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Opening the billfold, he carefully removed two worn pieces of<br>&gt;notebook paper that had obviously been taped, folded and<br>&gt;refolded many times.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The teacher knew without looking that the papers were the ones<br>&gt;on<br>&gt;which she had listed all the good things each of Mark's<br>&gt;classmates had said about him.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"Thank you so much for doing that," Mark's mother said. "As you<br>&gt;can see, Mark treasured it."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;All of Mark's former classmates started to gather around.<br>&gt;Charlie smiled rather sheepishly and said, "I still have my<br>&gt;list. It's in the top drawer of my desk at home."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Chuck's wife said, "Chuck asked me to put his in our wedding<br>&gt;album."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;"I have mine too," Marilyn said. "It's in my diary."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Then Vicki, another classmate, reached into her purse and showed<br>&gt;her frazzled list to the group. "I carry this with me at all<br>&gt;times, " Vicki said and without batting an eyelash, she<br>&gt;continued: "I think we all saved our lists."<br>&gt;<br>&gt;That's when the teacher finally sat down and cried. She cried<br>&gt;for<br>&gt;Mark and for all his friends who would never see him again.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The density of people in society is so thick that we forget that<br>&gt;life will end one day. And we don't know when that one day will<br>&gt;be.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;So please, tell the people you love and care for, that they are&gt;<br>&gt;special and important.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Tell them, before it is too late...</div>
