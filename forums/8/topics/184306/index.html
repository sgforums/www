For instance, the terrorist threats that we face or the occasional threats we hear from the region about our security. That's what makes us want to build up a strong SAF. They lack this sense of deep knowledge and conviction, which I think can only come through if you go through two years of NS," said Irene Ng, chairman of GPC Defence &amp; Foreign Affairs.<br><br>"It opens my eyes to what the guys go through in Singapore. They are ever ready to defend the country, sometimes you ask yourself as a female, are you ready to go through what they go through," said Meishan Krishnan, who participated in the LEAF@NYAA programme.<br><br>"At least you get a clearer idea of what they go through. Prior to that, you only have this fuzzy idea that they go in and come out but you don't know what they actually go through. Now, we can fully appreciate what they go through," said Denise He, a participant of LEAF@NYAA programme.<br><br>Following this experience, the girls can put forward their views on National Defence when they meet Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean next month.<br><br>- CNA /ls</div>

Implementing NS for females might just boost up the birth rates.

            <div class='col-md body'>Getting girls to serve in national service can come in many other ways. For example, they can be trained as nurses or paramedic and serve in hospitals etc. Since there is a shortage of nurses out there and the hospitals kept importing nurses into Singapore, the government might as well make use of training girls and letting them serve in hospitals for 2 years. Moreover their skills could be useful in times of war. 1 day in Tekong will not make those 50 women know alot about army life.<br><br>Its like in secondary school where CCAs have their open house.  They will tell you how good their CCA is and what you can get when you join them. But after you join the ugly side of them comes out. You will never whats in the ugly side of life until you truely experience it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For nursing is also not a viable choice. Not all men is cut out for medic vocations, similar to that not all women is cut out for nursing.<br><br>Previously, we also seen suggestion like streaming women into other civil service, etc, etc. But think of the problems, how it will cost the budget which will indirectly affect the bulk of the population in taxes. How it will cause the admin problems of streaming correct ppl into the correct civil service not as simple as the SAF.<br><br>And at the end of the day. We live in a imperfect and unfair world. If men should shoulder the responsibilty of the defending the national then so be it. Why need to complain/whine that women need to serve also.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
