              <p>In the 1990s the government put a ceiling on the numbers of lawyers to be produce in Singapore. This led to a shortage of lawyers 10 years later, foreign lawyers were allowed to practice here.</p>

              <p>Having an LLB gives you the opportunity to work in a wide variety of fields. From being a lawyer in a firm to a legal councillor in a company to any kind of office work and/or all the way to the Hague, Nato and the U.N.</p>
              <p>It really depends what you want to do with your LLB. You can be a mediator or an arbitrator while being a lawyer at the same time or not.</p>
              <p>You can be a law-clerk for a Judge, activist, social champion, criminal's salvation... whatever.</p>
              <p>Even if you are unable to find any job in Singapore whatsoever, you can always travel to any of the commonwealth countries and apply work there.</p>
              <p>If you were to fail your admission into the bar, it is not fatal either. You are still armed with the knowledge anyways, just that you cannot "practice" as a lawyer in a firm. That's not the end of your story either.</p>
              <p>To work in the Hague, e.g you have to take up Public International Law + International Criminal Law papers and to work in the E.U, at least an European Union Law paper.</p>
              <p>During your course of study, as you participate in the events, functions and competitions, you will slowly realise what you really want to do with your LLB.</p>
              <p>I know of many honour students that graduate with excellent marks and decided not to pursue the profession as a lawyer, but instead work as advisor's in big companies. There are differences between in-house lawyers and lawyers in a firm.</p>
              <p>So ya..  hope that sort of gives you a very simple idea. Oh and if you are studying your LLB overseas, make sure that the your LLB programme meet Singapore Bar Association's requirements to admission in case you want to be admitted into Sg Bar.</p>
              <p>My personal thought in the current market is you can go "where the money is at" e.g Family Law one of the elective law papers, or "where you want to be at", prep yourself to be flexible enough both Criminal and Civil jurisdiction. Currently what I see in Sg with increas of FT, there will be conflict. And conflicts need resolutions. You can look into Immigration papers, Employement, Human Rights....etc.</p>
              <p>New occupations appear and disappear, but the lawyer, like that other instrument of social hygiene the vulture, is always valuable. LoL!</p>

              <p>Lawyer jobs are plenty in Singapore, but they are not as glamourous and easy as they sound.</p>
              <p>Work super long hours, working on weekends too. Got work no life. When I see my lawyer friends, I think my working offshore isn't that bad.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Like any professional, you get those that work hard, those that work smart. Those that are good in research and those that are good in litigation...etc. That is why I emphasize on going out there, exposing yourself while pursuing your qualification.</p>
              <p>Dont like going through hundreds and thousands of pages or documents, contracts and agreements ? Go criminal. Dont like the blood, the gore, the guts and criminal elements ?Go civil.</p>
              <p>Hate everything else but love only Intellectual Property Law ? Sure. Do that. Be a specialist in that field.</p>
              <p>One thing is for certain, lawyers are paid to read. The more we read the longer it takes us to read, the more its going to cost you. The long hours, the no life is just part of the profession. If you cannot handle it, go do hospitality or fine arts or whataever. Like I said, its not for everyone.</p>
              <p>Same with Engineers and Doctors. Most of the doctors I know dont want to be doctors but because it pays well, stable, it comes with the long hours. But they are good at it. They like to save lives may be one of the motivation. Doing justice can be one of your motivation too. But mostly everyone goes "where the money is at".</p>

              I know of ppl who earns alot but still drag themselves to work becoz too stressful or bad working conditions etc...<br><br>
              
              as for jobs oppurtunity, u can do alot of things wor, not just being a lawyer... Legal consultants, advisors, IPs...<br><br>
              
              Being in law and having a secondary degree such as finance, banking, business or technology will even propel you even further... I wouldn't say no job opportunity but u have to see what u are expecting in return, might not be the dream career u are looking at... I suggest u to go to speak to some working adults in different fields and they can tell u how they are doing then u can decide...

              <p>it's very difficult to answer TS's question because whether a job is well paid or not depends on 1 very important factor, supply and demand. give you 1 example, last time if you're in IT during the 1980s, you can make $10k-$20k easily so every parents rush their kids to school and by the time everyone graduate, IT people are like everywhere, and that pushes the salary down by multiple factors.</p>
              <p>but my advise is very simple, go into the field that you enjoy working. i went into a field i love and everyday i look forward to working. i'm almost happy everyday! there are times of stress of course, but because you enjoy the work, that stress is not like the stress you encounter when you have no money + no interests + life lack of motivation combined.</p>
              <p>while everyone is dragging their feet to work, you can be like warran buffett says, tap dancing to work everyday.</p>

              <p>Working professionally - money is not that great.</p>
              <p>Working commercially - job is relatively boring</p>
              <p>Flexibility - you be confine to a limited field and only to singaporean law. Most othr countries don't recog your law degree - you have to undertake additional test to be able to practice in Australia or UK.</p>

              <p>Just to share from another perspective. <a href="http://www.itsuptoyou.net/why-you-shouldnt-go-to-law-school/">Why you should not go to law school. </a></p>
              <p>It is based on the U.S market. Most of the problem lies in the debt from study loan.You can read about one of the class action suits <a href="http://cache.abovethelaw.com/uploads/2011/08/Filed-NYLS-Summons-and-Complaint.pdf">here</a> regarding Law Schools misrepresenting post-grad employment prospects being filed in the court.The job scope represent post-grads as lawyers working in firms.</p>
              <p>You can extrapolate the numbers and compare locally.</p>

              Law degree is very versatile.  If you don't want to be a lawyer, you can just go do corporate legal advisor or something, or do corporate affairs kind of job in corporations.  
              
              I believe law degree holders should not be having difficulties finding jobs.  At least, so far I have not seen a jobless law degree holder.
