            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh....Tok so much also no use lar.....When you both go for interview searching for job, then you will know the usefulness of knowing more language. I believe waiter in the air with japan airline is gonna be a temp job. So even a temp job will be given to you first due to the fact that you know some jap language.<br><br>What i mentioned is being a engineer. Most engineering grad don't bother to learn other language and hence the market is shortage of engineer who can speak other language. As i had said, there are alot of engineering firm even those doing website design like my friend's company that do business or use technology from japan. Like what you had said, no all japanese know english well. So when you go over there to learn technology or do business with them. It will be good to know their local language. Firstly, it will impress them and make them feel comfortable doing business with your company. 2ndly, the company no need to waste money getting interpretor along with you on every business trip. 3rdly, knowing jap lang in japan will be more convenient for you to get around too cos not all japanese know english. Even for locally, it will come useful. It's an extra skill for you. True, the japanese who came over to do business with you should at least know some english or bring along a translator but it will impress them at least if you know their language. So during interview with this kind of firm, do you think you will be given priority for the job?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During my university time, i went along with a group of 20+ schmate in a cultural exchange programme to japan and stay with a family over there. I was quite surprised that those japanese who joined in this cultural exchange group are damn zealous in learning other pple's culture and language. My host's wife turn out to be very fluent in chinese language both in writing and speaking but not very good in english, her husband the opposite althought he not considered very good in english also. He told me that of all the foreign language, english to them is the hardest to learn, difficult for them to pronounce. I was surprised that some even know french, hokkien, cantonese etc. So it not true like what da_xing_xing had said these people from other countries dun even bother to learn the language that we speak. It's becoming sort of an interest for them although they are not using it commercially.<br><br>After the trips and stay with the family, I still keep in touch with them through letter mail or postcard. I also got to know a group of japanese university girls helping out in the programme. From them, then i came to understand that japanese woman has very low status in japan society. Discrimination still exist to hinder their advance in their careers cos moslty will be the guys who are considered for top position in the company. And maybe that's why they wanna learn foreign language so that they can work oversea and have a better career path and future.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 17 February 2002).]</div>
