              <p>Precisely. If there is life after death, and it is a better
              life, why don't u encourage mass suicide ?</p>
              <p>U can think and reason without the need to be able to do evil
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Why does evil exist then can necessary lessons be learned ? U
              can still learn tat helping others give them happiness. U can still
              learn tat playing a piano is enjoyable. U can still learn science
              and apply it.  In fact u can learn a lot of good things
              without evil. And it does not means helping other is senseless. U
              help other because they need help, not because u wanna go to heaven
              or something. U help a granny cross a road because u think it helps
              her. It is not senseless choice. It is meaningful even when there
              is no evil</p>
              <p>With evil, wat do u learn ? U learn to be defensive to protect
              yourself. U learn to hurt others to prevent others from bullying u.
              U learn how to lie to prevent yourself being blamed. U learn how to
              cheat to earn money. All these r bad and necessary things to learn
              when evil is abound. But if evil is not around, these skills become
              redundant</p>
              <p>Why does evil means being able to use your brain ? R u trying to
              say evil people r smarter then ? Then Ghandhi and mother teresa r
              idiots while einstein is pure evil. They r mutually independent
              events. Without evil, people can still learn how to play music or
              learn a language. Without evil, people can still research and
              study. Without evil, people can still make decisions. Evil and
              thinking r mutually exclusive. Give me an example why evil have to
              do with thinking.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U r making a logically flawed argument. U r saying animals r
              stupid and does not display morals code and conclude tat without
              displaying evil u r as stupid as animals. It is the same as
              saying smelly toufu (food) taste good if they
              use very smelly and rotten toufu and conclude all
              dishes must use smelly and rotten toufu to taste
              good.</p>

              <p>wrong.....the only way for man to learn is to experience.....some people can becoz they learn from others's experience....so being able to do evil is imoprtant......its not about wot you have done, but wot you will do in the future</p>
              <p>yes, smarter people are able to do more evil than dumb people coz dumb people dunno how to differenciate good and evil at times......</p>
              <p>i didn't say einstein and ghandi was evil, but the fact that they were able to yet they didn't do it is an example that they are learned men........they learn and know wot is good and bad and they choose.....</p>
              <p>like i said, in this world, without the ability to do evil, do you think people would've known wot is evil? same goes to animals, they dunno how to differenciate between doing evil and good....fighting for territories etc....men have many times over fought for territories to but we learn not to harm each other in the process over years and decades......animals, uptil now have still fought for territories the same way they did since who knows when.....people may still be killing now and then, history repeats itself but hell at least we learn from them......</p>
              <p>if there is no evil, the world overpopulated.....global warmin may still happen and wot are we gonna do to the overpopulated world?</p>
              <p>the world without evil maybe a good thing if you see it.....who wouldn't......but the most important thing is how you use it......many breakthrough technologies have been found from wars etc.....i know you would probably say that it is possible to find these technologies without war but it has happened.....you cannot change it....just live through the times......</p>

              <p>Well obviously the advantages r more than the disadvantages. U encourage people to have wars ?</p>

              <p>well learning from evil is the same as learning one's mistake.....once learn you try not to repeat the same mistake unless you choose to do it for some reason......</p>

              <p>Learning from mistakes is not learning from failure <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> U r mixing up failure and evil as the same thing. Evil is doing something tat harms other party while failure is the inability to make something succeed or work. They r different. U can learn from mistakes and failure but tat is different from learning evil. Learning evil means becoming evil.</p>

              <p>If the world has no evil, then obviously society will help them more than if there is evil</p>

              <p>I will quarrantine the city. And tat is not evil because I do it in good faith. If evil exist, then people becomes selfish and will try to escape from the quarantine and doom mankind.</p>
