              <p>Ans(1) You wounds heal because of doctors and modern medical science. Only crackpots wld believe risk the lives of loved ones by taking them to see a so-called spirit healers or televangelist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ans(2) Only the gullible and credulous believe in "miracles". Most of the time, they are taken advantage of by cranks trying to sell them "magic healing stones".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ans(3) Successful amputees become so because of their hard work and determination - and not because of the supernatural.</p>
              <p>There are also more "average" amputees compared to "successful" ones.</p>
              <p>Only modern prosthetic science can enable amputees to walk again....not prayers.</p>

              <p>this is the problem with humans......</p>
              <p>we expect to be spoon fed......</p>
              <p>i recall a story fromt he quran i think whereby the archangel gabriel asked god why would he make a creature that would shed blood......and god told the angel that he knew nothing about humans that god do......</p>
              <p>i think wot the "thing" that the angel didn't know is that becoz of our free will, we are really free to choose wot we do since they have never experienced it.......so as to say we are given power to our lives......</p>
              <p>but the ultimate question of all is whether mankind would be the one to destroy itself? hmmmm......world wars after world wars we have many times over pledged not to hurt, kill etc....but the killing spree goes on.....</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Einstein most certainly did not believe in a personal god, contray to what Catknight said. When Einstein used the word "god" in his conversation or writings, he used it as a metaphor to mean "nature" or the universe at large" and not the god(s) that religionists recognise.  This is similar to me saying "Santa came early this year" when I get a big bonus fr my boss in June, but it certainly does not mean I believe in the existence of Santa Claus.</p>
              <p>Einstein is either agnostic or atheistic. Einstein also felt that a belief in a personal God is a main source of conflicts in the Mankind's history: </p>
              <p>The following are Einsteins's own words:</p>
              <p><em>It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.</span> If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it. <br></em><br>- Albert Einstein, letter to an atheist (1954), quoted in <em>Albert Einstein: The Human Side</em>, edited by Helen Dukas &amp; Banesh Hoffman</p>
              <p> ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p><em>I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">idea of a personal God is a childlike one</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You may call me an agnostic</span>, but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth. I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being. <br></em><br>- Albert Einstein to Guy H. Raner Jr., Sept. 28, 1949, quoted by Michael R. Gilmore in <em>Skeptic</em> magazine, Vol. 5, No. 2</p>
              <p><em>-----------------------------------------------------------</em></p>
              <p><em>Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer</span>, i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being. <br></em><br>- Albert Einstein, 1936, responding to a child who wrote and asked if scientists pray; quoted in: <em>Albert Einstein: The Human Side</em>, edited by Helen Dukas &amp; Banesh Hoffmann</p>

              <p>This is just like animals.......if you wan the ability to not commit evil, then be an animal which have no moral code.......becoz they dun have this ability, it wouldn't be a sin to them for eating their young and fighting each other off to the death.......</p>
              <p>the ability to do evil is very important coz it has put senses to our brains.....</p>

              <p>well.....from my learning and in this case, if there is life after death, then wot is the problem with dying?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Precisely. If there is life after death, and it is a better life, why don't u encourage mass suicide ?</p>

              <p>U can think and reason without the need to be able to do evil <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>if men didn't have the ability to do evil, he won't know evil in the first place and if he didn't know evil, there won't be any lessons to learn.....this means that life would be senseless........thus doing all those things that you mention would have no impact on your morality.......giving, helping etc. would be no more than a senseless choice expect becoz they need it.....these are the properties of a robot......</p>

              <p>Why does evil exist then can necessary lessons be learned ? U can still learn tat helping others give them happiness. U can still learn tat playing a piano is enjoyable. U can still learn science and apply it.  In fact u can learn a lot of good things without evil. And it does not means helping other is senseless. U help other because they need help, not because u wanna go to heaven or something. U help a granny cross a road because u think it helps her. It is not senseless choice. It is meaningful even when there is no evil</p>
              <p>With evil, wat do u learn ? U learn to be defensive to protect yourself. U learn to hurt others to prevent others from bullying u. U learn how to lie to prevent yourself being blamed. U learn how to cheat to earn money. All these r bad and necessary things to learn when evil is abound. But if evil is not around, these skills become redundant</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>This is just like animals.......if you wan the ability to not commit evil, then be an animal which have no moral code.......becoz they dun have this ability, it wouldn't be a sin to them for eating their young and fighting each other off to the death.......</p>
              <p>the ability to do evil is very important coz it has put senses to our brains.....</p>
              <p>if we dun have the ability to do evil, then we won't have the ability to think.......both co-exist......if not, even kicking a granny into a pit hole wouldn't be considered a sin.....and that would make us an animal</p>

              <p>Why does evil means being able to use your brain ? R u trying to say evil people r smarter then ? Then Ghandhi and mother teresa r idiots while einstein is pure evil. They r mutually independent events. Without evil, people can still learn how to play music or learn a language. Without evil, people can still research and study. Without evil, people can still make decisions. Evil and thinking r mutually exclusive. Give me an example why evil have to do with thinking.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U r making a logically flawed argument. U r saying animals r stupid and does not display morals code and conclude tat without displaying evil u r as stupid as animals. It is the same as saying smelly toufu (food) taste good if they use very smelly and rotten toufu and conclude all dishes must use smelly and rotten toufu to taste good.</p>
