As FireIce has said, it's cluttered, too many banner ads, links that lead to nowhere or more links to don't know where. They seriously need to study IA before putting up a website.</div>

If they are not creative then why Sph care to step into this business???<br><br>Clearity is good but dont make like one subject take up the entire page. YOu can not read ??? you dont try to use your common sense to find links in the page??<br><br>Creativity comes from experience.
