WOW ... please elaborate if you can, i like to learn more.<br><br>what you meant to say was that HP, IBM (lenovo i think), ACER have china factories to produce low cost parts. but i prefer taiwanese produce, they are the real world leader in computer parts foundry and innovation, china are good for mass producing low cost parts like casing etc. i am sure every IT savvy person knows that. and of cos needless to say, the internet is invented in USA and so are many wonderful things ... it is a fact that every other country is only making a copy of something that is invented by someone else. some copies it better, some cheaper.<br><br>singapore has creative technologies, which is why it is faced with so many copies.

(hmmm is that why china wish to take over taiwan?)</div></blockquote>Plugins as in softwares that tweak your system. For example, the very basic ones are the download boosters. Theres at least 50 choices the chinese know of. Some are easy to use, like Flashget. Some requires you to enter configurations and etc.<br><br>Also, there are softwares available for you to change the destribution of your computer's processor's percentage, even the address of RAM. Changing the processor's destribution can shut down almost all processes on your PC and use your processor for only certain task. Microsoft had strict warnings against this and if not done right, 9 out of 10 tried you will get your PC hang. By changing the address of the RAM, you can sometimes speed-up your RAM's virtual memory capacity by 40%. Cons are RAMs are easily damaged and life span cut.<br><br>Not will bring us to high returns. If you get a computer thats packed with different plugins and tweaks and softwares that are not supposed to be installed and you did not do them the right way, then of course it gets into serious problems more often.<br><br>However, i agree with you that China should really review on their quality controls.<br><br>Finally, the Taiwan problem. There are benefits, and China's got many countries' support, so why not take it over?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
