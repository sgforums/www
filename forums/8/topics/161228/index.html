            <div class='col-md body'>ON THURSDAY I was at my friend's condominium, Bishan8, for a class barbecue when we had a most shocking encounter.<br><br>My friends were swimming in the pool in PE shorts and T-shirts when a security guard told us that a couple sitting on the other side of the pool had complained that we were not properly attired.<br><br>The guard said that it was not against the rules but he had to act on the complaint. Upon checking the rules, we found that we were allowed to wear our own clothes in the pool and my friends continued to swim.<br><br><strong>The woman approached us and started yelling Hokkien vulgarities at my friends and my friend's mother. My friend told her to stop verbally abusing her mother and the woman yelled: 'You want to fight, come up and fight, lah!'<br><br>A while later, her husband went up to my friend, shoved her and slapped her on the face for being 'rude' to his wife. Mind you, this was a 15-year-old girl who was half his size.<br><br>When we yelled at him in indignation, his wife showed my other friends the middle finger.</strong><br><br>As a 15-year-old, I am appalled at the behaviour of these adults. They portray the ugly side of Singaporeans and give Singaporeans a bad name.<br><br>I hope that we can do something to change the mindsets of such people: that they are educated and therefore are above everybody else.</div>
