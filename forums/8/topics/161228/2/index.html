Upon checking the rules, we found that we were allowed to wear our own clothes in the pool and my friends continued to swim.<br><br>[b]The woman approached us and started yelling Hokkien vulgarities at my friends and my friend's mother. My friend told her to stop verbally abusing her mother and the woman yelled: 'You want to fight, come up and fight, lah!'<br><br>A while later, her husband went up to my friend, shoved her and slapped her on the face for being 'rude' to his wife. Mind you, this was a 15-year-old girl who was half his size.<br><br>When we yelled at him in indignation, his wife showed my other friends the middle finger.</strong><br><br>As a 15-year-old, I am appalled at the behaviour of these adults. They portray the ugly side of Singaporeans and give Singaporeans a bad name.<br><br>I hope that we can do something to change the mindsets of such people: that they are educated and therefore are above everybody else.[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
