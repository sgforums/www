              <p>.....hmm, there is nothing wrong for been a romantic. Our society is too practical that we desperately need some romance.</p>
              <p>.....topic wise, if the women already pre-set their mind that they don't need a man, chances are that if a good fish swims by, she won't be able to recognise it. So the chances of a romance to materialise is pretty remote....</p>

              <p>BUT</p>
              <p>Now he earns more than me and I wouldn't say he is any less intellectual. Maybe when it comes to some investment stuff he needs me to explain to him but that doesn't mean he doesn't learn and he is much more street smart then I am.</p>
              <p>Seriously attitude, charc and personality are bigger considerations. I think these days in a material world, people just look at material things and not look deeper.</p>
              <p>Btw I don't want a man with a fancy car and spends lots of money but hor he is living on credit.</p>

              <p>but then when one finds another, doesn't need the other yet wants to be with him or her, and chooses to be with him or her, isn't it wonderful?</p>
              <p>i like the idea of choice..</p>
              <p>i love her so much... i don't need her, yet i want to be with her.. and then juxtapose that with she loves me so much.. she does not need me, yet wants to be with me..</p>
              <p>and if both find each other, and a decision is made out of love to be with each other, committed to each other, isn't it beautiful? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>many will not agree with me, but heck! i'm still a hopeless and hopeful romantic at heart <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>YEAH! Why the hell do u want someone to stay with you simply cos she NEEDS you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Love isn't about 2 halves making each other complete</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's about 2 whole individuals, making themselves as complete as possible and giving all they have to the other because they WANT to! And sort of like... 2 colour lens you know.. when u superimpose on each other, they create a new colour~ that makes life together great.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Love that is built on need will become very tiring for one party.</p>

              <p>Now he earns more than me and I wouldn't say he is any less intellectual. Maybe when it comes to some investment stuff he needs me to explain to him but that doesn't mean he doesn't learn and he is much more street smart then I am.</p>
