              i feel that you should not care abt the word "need" so much though. i do however agree that couples should complement one another, that way they can support each other though. it also takes a decision on both parties to be committed to one another though.

              passion will dies off one because when everyone is old, the looks will fade. it's important that both parties have to be committed to one another and love each other for what they are truly. looks will fade but character will still stays though

              by maintaining the relationship lo, like still do special things for one another not only on occasions but on normal days too. if things are going stagnant, do something to spice up the relationship. communication very important though. always remember the best of the person, not focus on the bad things abt the person though. always remember why you love this person so much not because of what the person have, not because of what the person can be but because of who the person is.
