            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong><br><br>Obvious examples are a pair of scissors, a pair of gloves, a pair of bookends, etc; they never come singly. Or, if you are describing two individuals who are similar or are in some way associated with each other: a pair of liars, a pair of seal pups.<br><br>I therefore don't see why two tickets should be turned into an inseparable pair, suggesting that one on its own would be useless, which is silly.<br></strong></blockquote>He's contradicting himself here.<br><br>The two tickets he is referring to are indeed 'similar or are in some way associated with each other', aren't they? They look similar, they feel similar, they're from a similar source and they're for a similar purpose. Two liars are similar, and two seal pups are similar, why can't two tickets be similar?<br><br>Moving on to the next paragraph, don't tell me that if you separate 'a pair of liars' or 'a pair of seal pups', they each become useless. I honestly didn't know that liars and sea lions can only exist in pairs and not on their own. So following the writer's reasoning, a person can never lie on his own, for it would be useless and silly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
