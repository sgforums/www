I had just arrived there while my friends have shifted from a table to another just to "provide space". Actually we don't mind finishing our dinner earlier, but when he put the "RESERVED" tablet on the table while I was eating, I was really pissed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find that generally, taxi drivers down here give very lousy service...especially the fact that they never bother to help you with any luggages or heavy things. I have been to quite a few countries, and so far ONLY Singaporean taxi drivers don't help me with the luggage.<br><br>Then got another time, reserved 7:30pm tickets to watch movie at Tiong Bahru Plaza. Reached there, found that there's a long queue. So I went to the counter and said I had a booking. I was told to queue!!! Nevermind, I queued. When it reached my turn at 7:00+pm, I was told they sold my tickets liao!!! I was so angry I called for the manager and gave him a piece (very big) of my mind. In the first place, I should not be queueing like a normal customer since I have made reservation. Then they tell me sold my tickets liao!!!!! In the end, he gave me tickets to the last row, centre seats  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
