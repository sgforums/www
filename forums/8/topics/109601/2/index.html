            <div class='col-md body'>I am doing my part by doing a small donation in cash, and also i am asking around (my frens) to chip in the donation too.  I am hoping to raise $300.<br><br>it's reali a tragedy, but i realised that some singaporeans are reali not so willing to give and share. sigh<br><br>i went around asking for donations among my frens, of course most of them are very willing to share, even a small amt like $10.  But some jus rejected flat, giving reasons that they are broke.  Den some say they wanna buy hp, and buy other stuffs, but helping others isn't more impt? hmm, i guess it's becos singapore is v fortunate to be 'unaffected' directly from this disaster, and ppl dun realise the seriousness of this disaster.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>

We're  paying for our own air fare and we have made arrangements for our accomodation too.<br>As you'd have seen on TV lotsa people and children are suffering from lack of food and clothes. I know that there are many organisations out there helping by collecting money, clothings etc.<br><br>I appeal to you to contribute some money so that we can buy the basic long lasting necessities like milk, biscuits, bread etc for these victims.  If possible we want to pitch a tent to cook them a few meals.  I think food is very important to all of us and we have plenty of it here.  I do want to help them in someway and I know you too feel that you want to help.  Perhaps you don't have the time to leave your work and responsibilities to go there to help.  I want us all to start the new year by feeling that we have helped the less fortunate in some way.<br><br>Please either give me cash or make a cheque payable to "Devagi Sanmugam" and post it to<br>Devagi Sanmugam<br>52  Jalan Leban<br>Singapore 577589<br><br>Please also include your name and address so that I can send you the accounts.

I am also sure many, if not all, of you have already<br>contributed aid of one kind or another to the affected countries.<br><br>Like you all, Budak Pantai would like to do our part to raise funds for<br>the tsunami relief efforts.?We were originally scheduled to perform at blue<br>Moo (YMCA) on 7 January 2005 as part of our regular first Friday<br>concerts.<span style="color: red;"><br>We will now be pledging this performance on 7 January to the tsunami<br>disaster aid.  Entry for adults to this performance will be at $25<br>whilst students and children pay $10.  We will donate ALL proceeds from this<br>performance to the Singapore Red Cross.</span><br><br>It will be difficult for us to be enjoying ourselves doing the 7 January<br>show, but rather than cancelling it out of respect for the victims of<br>the disaster, we thought we could turn it into a fund raiser instead.?So,<br>if you'd allow Budak Pantai to entertain you for a good cause, please come<br>to the YMCA on 7 January 2005.<br><br><span style="color: red;">You may make a reservation by writing to writeus@bluemoo.com.sg</span><br><br>It's a sad end to the year but I believe there is something we could<br>take from this, for example, that as precious as life is, it is also<br>unpredictable.?So, let's not take it for granted.
