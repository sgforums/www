No, you are officially out of fatty gang becos you want it tat way not becos of me, no one can force you to opt out unless you want, just like when you decided to leave that forum. Don't push the blame to others.<br><br>Till now you still wanna talk badly about her, you think i don't know anything, but i know more than you, in fact i think she calls me more often than she calls you.<br><br>Whatever it is, you should accept the break up with grace. Personally i don't think she is wrong, she has her rights to choose her own happiness.<br><br>Duckie, since you hate even the sight of my nick, ok, then i shall leave this forum. Just hope that you can stop being so self-centred,and if i were doreen, i would have choose to leave you too, since i am leaving i shall tell you the truth, in our group of poly friends, no one ever like you, we all tot you were too childish. Not becos of the things that doreen told us but becos of your behaviour, no one had a good impression of you, we all tot doreen has no future with you. Well, you may see this as an insult, but think about it, what makes all of us think the same way about you ??<br><br>Also, just to tell you something, the biggest mistake you made is to tell my story in forum. Its something that you shouldn't even know, she told you my secret becos she trusted you that time and i'm sure she wouldn't have know that you are someone who cannot be trusted with secrets, you not only broke her trust just to get back on me but you also showed how despicable you are. Till now you still don't admit that its wrong of you to do that. Backstabbing i'm never as good as you, in my eyes you are just a sole loser.<br><br>To those who thinks that i'm poking into their business :<br><br>Sorry, but he made it public himself and asked everyone if there is any commends they wanna tell him, so i don't think i am wrong. i hate to see my friend being targeted as the "culprit", they are only in a relationship, she still has the right to choose, moreover i know doreen way before he knows her. We know each other in real life before coming to this forum. This is between me,her and duckie, i don't wish to see any one else involved in any way.<br><br>This is the last post i'm going to write to you, don't bother to reply as i wouldn't be coming back anymore.<br><br>PS: Remember that you said that you wished that i will suffer 100 times more than you, just to inform you, whatever you cursed on other people will come back to you in three times more. So don't anyhow wish that bad things will happen to other people, cos its really bad, bad to the other party and even worse to you yourself.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>

Don't push the blame to others.<br><br>Till now you still wanna talk badly about her, you think i don't know anything, but i know more than you, in fact i think she calls me more often than she calls you.<br><br>Whatever it is, you should accept the break up with grace. Personally i don't think she is wrong, she has her rights to choose her own happiness.<br><br>Duckie, since you hate even the sight of my nick, ok, then i shall leave this forum. Just hope that you can stop being so self-centred,and if i were doreen, i would have choose to leave you too, since i am leaving i shall tell you the truth, in our group of poly friends, no one ever like you, we all tot you were too childish. Not becos of the things that doreen told us but becos of your behaviour, no one had a good impression of you, we all tot doreen has no future with you. Well, you may see this as an insult, but think about it, what makes all of us think the same way about you ??<br><br>Also, just to tell you something, the biggest mistake you made is to tell my story in forum. Its something that you shouldn't even know, she told you my secret becos she trusted you that time and i'm sure she wouldn't have know that you are someone who cannot be trusted with secrets, you not only broke her trust just to get back on me but you also showed how despicable you are. Till now you still don't admit that its wrong of you to do that. Backstabbing i'm never as good as you, in my eyes you are just a sole loser.<br><br>To those who thinks that i'm poking into their business :<br><br>Sorry, but he made it public himself and asked everyone if there is any commends they wanna tell him, so i don't think i am wrong. i hate to see my friend being targeted as the "culprit", they are only in a relationship, she still has the right to choose, moreover i know doreen way before he knows her. We know each other in real life before coming to this forum. This is between me,her and duckie, i don't wish to see any one else involved in any way.<br><br>This is the last post i'm going to write to you, don't bother to reply as i wouldn't be coming back anymore.<br><br>PS: Remember that you said that you wished that i will suffer 100 times more than you, just to inform you, whatever you cursed on other people will come back to you in three times more. So don't anyhow wish that bad things will happen to other people, cos its really bad, bad to the other party and even worse to you yourself.<br><br></div></blockquote>if u never ever started anything, i would have shut up already. i juz posted some things that the forum dun even have b4, u take it i am aiming her. so sensitive to whatever i post, might as well i dun post anything?<br><br>well, because i dun want to make FnU to be in a difficult position, fatty outing with me inside will cause probs. thats y i wanna leave. u ppl can enjoy all u want, dun bother abt me.<br><br>and what are u saying? me talking bad abt her? she herself said like that, and she did the opposite thing. in terms of integrity, she dun deserve my respect. i already let the thing go off graciously, but every single topic that i posted in the forum, was flamed by u. because u think i am wrong to post whatever. if freedom of speech is condemned by ur kind of ppl then ppl no need to speak. i left that forum because i dun want to be flamed by u, even though my topic is DIRECTED TO NO ONE. only asking ppl to share their views.<br><br>why shld i care abt how u ppl feel? and u bring this up again, SO MUCH FOR UR "STOP TOKKING ABT IT". i know very well already. and u dun have to say anything, all u gals do is talk talk talk, what really happens, u know?<br><br>well, if u NEVER ever ignited my anger, i wouldn't have done any of those things. u shld know already, i dun get angry at all. u ppl can bully me, can say bad things abt me, but i won't get angry. but y did i flare up? ask urself.<br><br>and abt making things public, u took it too sensitively, all my first post was to declare that its over, without ur FLAMING none of this would have come out. well, u keep saying i am petty or what, well, dun u think that u are one too?<br><br>and pls, remember, i never POINTED a finger at her to say that she is a culprit..<br><br>u can leave, up to u, i still wanna post to clarify the matter. I WILL NOT TAKE THIS FINGER POINTING, LYING DOWN.<br><br>i already am bitter that i am being bullied most of the time, i WILL NOT ALLOW PPL to SAY ANYTHING ABT ME, that is not real.<br><br>this time, u can say i am really heartless, or cold hearted. everything was alright b4 u started flaming me.<br><br>that's all i have to say.<br><br>------------------<br>Never will I be the same again.<br>Winds of change bring me to a different light.<br>The darkness merges with the sun.<br>And the moon shines with eternal brightness.</div>
