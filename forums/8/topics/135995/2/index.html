            <div class='col-md body'>Trouble hear in singapore is this, people dont stay in one job for very long ...... which as an employer when i see a CV with lots of jobs in a short space of time makes me ask questions like:<br><br>why so many jobs, is it because this person isnt settled, in which case can be disruptive to the company, do they have so many jobs because they are slack and get fired,<br><br>The biggest concer thou is loyalty, as a employer you want your staff to be loyal to your company, and not train then up and then they leave.<br><br>To have too many jobs in a short space of time is not a good thing when going for a new job.<br><br>Reading forums here and looking at what you guys have to say it really isnt a wonder that low pay and retrenchment is growing.  If you dont work hard at your job, what can you expect</div>
