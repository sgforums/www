            <div class='col-md body'>I personally think that Seed is better in terms of mobile suit functionality. The operating system , power levels and stuff. How it reacts on the sand and the laser beams being  distorted in the desert.<br><br>But the characters are really boring. I like Asuran though , at least his character is developed quite a bit. Kira is a cry baby , cries too much , gets very annoying.<br><br>In Wing , the gundams look nicer , although it is extremely ridiculous , but that's what all animes are anyway. Initial D is ridiculous too  , i would love to see someone drive downhill at high speeds without spilling water out of the cup or breaking the tofu in the trunk.<br><br>Anyway , Freedom looks like Wing Zero with a few more guns attached to the body and the wing replaced with some metallic tubes.<br><br>Buster and Duel look very plain. Strike too. Providence is... i think it's a rip off from Gundam X , the enemy who is a manufactured New Type. He has similar self guided laser beams too.<br><br>Anyway to each his own.</div>
