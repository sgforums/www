            <div class='col-md body'>A Secondary 4 student from Bedok South Secondary School yesterday dashed out of his class during a Science lesson, climbed over a ledge and jumped off the second floor.<br>.<br>The 16-year-old fractured his ankles and was warded at Changi General Hospital where he is in stable condition.<br>.<br>When Today visited him yesterday evening, he was wearing a neck brace and had bruises on his face and arms.<br>.<br>His grandfather told Today at his bedside: "He has never done anything like this before. So, we really don't know what to think."<br>.<br>When asked, the teenager would only say: "It was a foolish act, but I was just sick of everything."<br>.<br>Police spokesman Victor Keong confirmed that police were alerted at about 10.45am and that the boy was sent to the hospital in a conscious state. Police are in the middle of investigations.<br>.<br>The drama, which unfolded just two days before the school holidays, shocked many students of the school, which is situated off Bedok Road.<br>.<br>A classmate who declined to be named said: "It was all so sudden. The science teacher had just walked to the door to ask some of the students who were outside the science lab to lower their voices."<br>.<br>That was when the boy "just got off his seat and walked straight to the ledge and jumped off", she added. She said the boy, who would be sitting for his N-Level exams this year, had had recent problems with his girlfriend.<br>.<br>Another Sec 3 student was having her recess when she saw the whole incident. "He just climbed and jumped. Then, he just lay on the ground and screamed in pain," she said. "Some of us started screaming because we just could not believe he did what he did."<br>.<br>Speaking to Today, the principal of Bedok South Secondary School, Madam Khoo Teck Siew, described the student as being a "cheerful boy" who was a boy scout until recently, when he decided to concentrate on his studies.<br>.<br>She added that the school was still conducting its investigations, and its primary concern now was the boy's well-being.<br>.<br>"We have spoken to him and the other students and have informed them that there are various people they can approach if they need to talk about their problems, even during the coming holidays.<br>.<br>"We will be paying special attention to his needs and will do everything to ensure that he is well taken care of," she said.<br></div>

Police are in the middle of investigations.<br>.<br>The drama, which unfolded just two days before the school holidays, shocked many students of the school, which is situated off Bedok Road.<br>.<br>A classmate who declined to be named said: "It was all so sudden. The science teacher had just walked to the door to ask some of the students who were outside the science lab to lower their voices."<br>.<br>That was when the boy "just got off his seat and walked straight to the ledge and jumped off", she added. She said the boy, who would be sitting for his N-Level exams this year, had had recent problems with his girlfriend.<br>.<br>Another Sec 3 student was having her recess when she saw the whole incident. "He just climbed and jumped. Then, he just lay on the ground and screamed in pain," she said. "Some of us started screaming because we just could not believe he did what he did."<br>.<br>Speaking to Today, the principal of Bedok South Secondary School, Madam Khoo Teck Siew, described the student as being a "cheerful boy" who was a boy scout until recently, when he decided to concentrate on his studies.<br>.<br>She added that the school was still conducting its investigations, and its primary concern now was the boy's well-being.<br>.<br>"We have spoken to him and the other students and have informed them that there are various people they can approach if they need to talk about their problems, even during the coming holidays.<br>.<br>"We will be paying special attention to his needs and will do everything to ensure that he is well taken care of," she said.<br></div></blockquote>2nd floor only.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
