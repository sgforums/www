As technology improves, of course toys must improve too. Don't really expect the children now to be playing those wooden tops and capteh now.<br><br>Even mobiles phones are commercial orientated. Why can't people now use those Tua Leng Gong Ericsson and Motorola phones since they all have the same use ; making phone calls.</div>

And then there's one leg hopping inside the court, used to be so popular that you can find more than 50 students participating in it, everyone can be so fit last time coz if you're good in that sport, you'll be quite popular in school, lol.

            <div class='col-md body'>Back in my primary school(not in singapore) we had this game of splitting into two teams on each side of the football field. Then we'd use a tennis bal and throw to the opposing side - the stronger, higher and faster the better. There's no catch to this game just that whoever gets the ball shall just throw it back.

Kinda felt that it's cartoons and storyline are nothing compared to the past cartoons.<br><br>Anyone remember M.A.S.K, Legionaries (Visonaries??), The Transformers G1, G.I.Joe, Star Com( they had magnets on their foot base).<br><br>Even the old Tamiya 4WD toys were fun. Our first experience at modifying and tuning cars hehe.<br><br>I think there are much more toys than those i mentioned above. Do share if you think of more.</div></blockquote>Ahem ahem... dunno about others... but since when Generation 1 Transformers got storyline... I was not borned then... but it was labelled as the most successful 30 minutes commercial...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
