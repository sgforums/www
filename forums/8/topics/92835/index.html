            <div class='col-md body'>Smart was kidnapped at knife point, according to her 9-year-old sister, who was in the same bedroom with her and pretended for at least another two hours to be asleep before telling her parents (Ed Smart and Lois Smart). The investigation was national, and Salt Lake City police had signaled that their prime suspect was a man already in custody for unrelated reasons. That suspect, Richard Ricci, died in jail from a brain hemmorage a few weeks after he refused to provide Utah corrections officers with a confession.<br><br>A massive community search effort, organized by the Laura Recovery Center, looked for Elizabeth in the days immediately following her abduction. Up to 2000 volunteers a day were dispatched to the area surrounding her home trying to find any trace of the missing girl. Volunteers combed the hills above her family's home and extended the search using search dogs and aircraft. After a week of intensive searching, the community led search was closed by the local volunteers and efforts were directed to other means of finding Elizabeth.<br><br><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/upload/thumb/3/35/180px-Mitchell.jpg"><br>Brian David Mitchell<br>(born October 18, 1953)<br><br><img src="http://en.wikipedia.org/upload/thumb/2/2b/180px-Barzee.jpg"><br>Wanda Ilene Barzee<br>(born November 6, 1945)<br>Just over eight months later, Brian David Mitchell, who was wanted by police for questioning because he had worked as a handyman at the Smart residence for one day in November, 2001, was spotted by residents in the street with his two companions not far from the Smart home in Sandy, Utah. When he was stopped by the officers, Smart was wearing a gray wig and a veil. She was finally recognized during questioning and was promptly reunited with her parents, little sister and four brothers. Mitchell and his companion, Wanda Ileen Barzee, were taken into custody as suspected kidnappers.<br><br>Mitchell, who called himself "Immanuel David Isaiah," is speculated to have sought Smart as a bride.<br><br>To protect her from face-to-face media exposure, Elizabeth was kept close to her family, and her father stated that she was not being "questioned to death" at home about her activities. Later in the year, however, the family was receiving counselling. Elizabeth even took her parents to the location where she claims she had been chained by her kidnappers.<br><br>In the hours that followed Smart's recovery, several people came forward with details of sightings in which Elizabeth did not seem to be held against her will. She was even photographed attending a party wearing a veil, and on another occasion, strolling with Mitchell and Barzee in a park. Peer-to-peer networks have purportedly been circulating a video of Smart freely roaming about during parties she attended. Other attendees of those parties were not aware that Smart was a kidnapping victim, and Smart did not attempt to seek their help. According to Elizabeth's father in appearances after the recovery, Elizabeth did know about some of the family's search efforts, but missed the billboards on the freeways. Also, she had heard her uncle calling for her during one of the search efforts in the hills behind the Smart residence, but was either unable, or unwilling to draw her uncle's attention. There is speculation that Smart may have been a willing participant rather than a helpless victim. In response, the Smart family claims that Elizabeth willingly cooperated only because she was brainwashed by Mitchell and Barzee into believing that God wanted her to be Mitchell's wife.<br><br>Elizabeth had been "on a cord" for many months, and never off it, according to Lois Smart. Through time, Mitchell would free her from time to time. During one of those times, while Mitchell and Barzee were in an argument, she tried to escape. Mitchell caught her though and said "what do you think you're doing or where are you going?"<br><br>According to the arresting officers, Elizabeth initially identified herself to them as "Augustine." She also said, "I know what you're thinking. You guys think I'm that Elizabeth Smart girl who ran away." When pressed further by the officers to admit that she was indeed Elizabeth Smart, she finally said, "Thou sayest it," a possible reference to the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible, in which Pontius Pilate repeatedly questions Jesus about his identity. Officer Victor Quezada said he "took that as a yes." It is alleged that Elizabeth had lived under a constant threat of Mitchell having the ability to murder her and harm her family, but when initially discovered and questioned by Officer Quezada, she claimed that she "ran away".<br><br><strong>The kidnapping</strong><br>Psychologists not associated with the case have speculated that Smart likely would exhibit symptoms of Stockholm syndrome, where kidnap victims eventually embrace the beliefs of their captors. Smart's father immediately claimed that Elizabeth had been brainwashed, which was supported by Barzee's estranged 27-year-old daughter, who added that drugs may also have been involved. Authorities indicated that no drugs were found on the kidnapping suspects and there has been no evidence that Mitchell or Barzee practiced any brainwashing techniques on others. Furthermore, mind control theories are not part of accepted psychological science, and the concept of brainwashing is not used by most psychologists and social scientists.<br><br>As noted, the facts surrounding Smart's alleged abduction are still unclear. For months, the only available witness to the abduction was Mary Katherine Smart, Elizabeth's 9-year-old sister who slept with her in the same bedroom. According to Mary Katherine, Elizabeth was instructed at gunpoint (a detail later altered to "knifepoint") by an intruder to put on her athletic shoes and leave with him. The little sister said she tried to follow them outside the room but returned to hide another two hours before telling her parents of Elizabeth's disappearance. There was also confusion over whether a screen had been cut from outside or inside the house, for purposes of either entering the house or creating a red herring. The screen being cut from the inside would indicate that Elizabeth and/or her sister were willing participants in Elizabeth Smart's disappearance. No matching prints for Mitchell were found in Elizabeth's bedroom.<br><br>Perhaps most puzzling is the fact that the sketch released by the Smart family and based on Mary Katherine's recollections depicts a perpetrator with no facial hair, whereas photographs of Brian Mitchell both before and after June 5, 2002, show him with a full beard.<br></div>
