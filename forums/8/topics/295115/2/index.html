That will command respect from us.<br><br>Sometime older people just dun understand us, like my brother, alway with ears phone on at home, either for h/phone or music from his Ipod, and my mom keep nagging all the way till dawn on all of us including the maid. Then she ask my brother why alway put the ear phone on, if you like music so much, be a singer lah, but she didn't know the ear phone is to shut all nagging noise from her. And the worst is that Ipod was what she bought for his birthday present.</div>

In fact I was the one who taught them ... but at the same time I will explain the evil of gambling but we do not wish to restrict them so much that they may be too tempted to try out outside..  afterall, forbidden food always tastes better ..<br><br>Asking the children to sleep early so that the children can concentrate better during class.  Imagine the children sleeping during class, how to pass exam,,   If I switch the tv off, I go to sleep with the children too ..  I cannot expect other to follow lor ... maybe your parent thought you sleep leow lor ... ya, the same old grandma tale ...  what the parent do is for your own good ...</div>
