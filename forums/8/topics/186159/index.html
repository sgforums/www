You then get "I should not whack Raffles or other pple, with majong paper". As well as "I should not whack myself, or let myself be whacked, with majong paper".<br><br>"Jessica should not push me causing me to spill milo". Turn It Around. You then get "I should not push Jessica or other pple, causing them to spill milo". As well as "I should not push myself, or let myself be pushed, causing me to spill milo".<br><br>So you realize that what these incidents are really teaching you, are these TurnAround statements. In truth, if Jessica did push you, or if Raffles did whack you, then it means that they *should* have whacked you or pushed you, in that particular incidence, for you to have the chance to learn the lesson of the TurnAround. So don't blame them, coz they also didn't expect things to turn out this way, they were just doing what they thought is ok to do, have some fun, etc. This is being understanding and compassionate. And indeed, you can be grateful to them for doing this to you, so as to give you the opportunity to learn your own lessons about yourself here.<br><br>But it doesn't mean that you should continue to let yourself be whacked or pushed. But it also doesn't mean that you should hit them back or hurt them to punish them. Or feel angry, upset, or miserable about them, about yourself, or even about your lack of control over your emotions.<br><br>It (the true meaning of these incidents) only means that you should use the chance to clarify your emotions, apply the TurnAround to learn the true lesson behind these incidents, and become a more conscious (of your emotions) and loving (and understanding and compassionate) person.<br><br>Be patient with yourself. Don't be frustrated over your lack of control of emotions. The first step is to be compassionate and understanding with yourself, then you can be compassionate and understanding with others.<br><br>Love yourself first. Only then can you truly love the universe and others.<br><br></div>
