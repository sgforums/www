            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I studied in ngee ann poly previously and am currently studying in NUS. It is possible to enter local university with a GPA of maybe 3.2 and above. However, there will be limited course to choose from. Also, if I am not wrong, SMU requires interview and NUS medicine and law requires interview and some admission test too. Anyway, if u all are interested, u all can check out the local univeristy website for more info.<br><br>Hope this is helpful!<br><br>Regards,<br>Kethy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My sister graduated from poly last year with a GPA of 3.8. She got into mass com course in NTU but pulled out later because she wanted to go to SIM where the same degree will take 18 months instead of 3 years. She told me that GPA above 3.5 will have a good chance to get into local uni. Anything below that is very tough.<br><br>For medicine at NUS, you will have a harder time than JC students. All applicants who are shortlisted need to go through 2 interview sessions (each about 30 mins) and write an essay. The essay is like a test because you do not know what they are going to ask you, and they can ask you anything ranging from ethics to opinions to character to personal life experience. As for the interviews, its like a grilling session with 3 interviewers for each interview. They will make you feel you are so not going to make it into medicine because they slap you with tonnes of questions including medical ones.<br><br>For law at NUS, they require 1 interview as far as I remember my friend told me. They like to ask on current affairs and your opinions on ethics and stuff like that. Best to be well read for it. I'm not sure about law at the other unis cos none of my friends are in it.<br><br>For dentistry at NUS, they require 1 interview and 1 manual dexterity test. The interview is another grilling session like medicine's, with 3 interviewers. The manual dexterity test will test how agile you are with your hands. Whether you are technical enough. Its not a very reliable gauge but yeah.<br><br>Apart from these, you have to show a keen interest and must have a much more wonderful portfolio compared to a JC student's. I picked these 3 courses to talk about in particular because they are the hardest for poly students to get in. I know this year 2 out of 259 med students are from poly. Thats a good start. None got into dentistry. And im not sure about law.<br><br>Just read up and get prepared. Practise your speech because if your GPA is not good enough, you are likely to be called in for interview even if the course doesnt usually require one. Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>depends on the course u want la. ntu engine my friends 3.7 and the other 3.92 got in. the 3.4 one got rejected. so i guess maybe 3.5 like most of you say to get in la.<br><br>NUS FOS need 3.7 and above.for FASS got a friend with 3.2 entering but taking a course she say very low in demand and got no interest in.she just wanted a degree.<br><br>SMU business admin is different from business management. SMU business admin i heard hardest to enter among the local unis. so when u applying a course in SMU differetiate admin and management.management is easier to go in my friend with 3.3 entered.<br><br>for medicine and law all these... surely 3.999 or 4 + damm good cca or whatever records you have.<br><br>every year the min req will change slightly la,so its good to have a rough idea.</div>
