            <div class='col-md body'>Desperate guys out there, QUICK THANK ME ON A BENDED KNEE <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Regardless of the type of man you are -- strong with bold opinions, moderate with no taste for confrontation, or passive with a gelatinous backbone -- guess what?<br><br>Unless you're made of wood, you're going to be dating, you are going to get into arguments, and the expectation (at least from the feminine perspective) is that you are going to lose those arguments.<br><br>Any type of man could, at any time, find himself in any kind of an argument. Maybe your pants were off when they really should have been on. Perhaps you zigged when you should have zagged, or, despite your best intentions, you simply just spoke out of turn.<br>The trickiness we must deploy to save face in a fight is to always be prepared. You wouldn't go out for a night on the town without some cash and a pressed shirt, would you? So why would you head into a relationship battle without your best artillery?<br><br><strong>There are rules to follow</strong><br><br>Nobody wants to be that guy in the corner taking a browbeating from his best gal, especially when, whether that beaten man was wrong or right, he could have come out unscathed. There are rules involved in this. Pay attention.<br><br>Logic is frequently abandoned when arguing with your girlfriend for one reason: They will not admit they are wrong. Ever. Not going to happen -- so put it out of your head. No matter how compelling you may be, or how wrong she might be, fair is not the name of the game. The trick is this: proving to yourself that you're right, while making her believe she's right as well.<br><br>Different men have different expectations about winning arguments, but the art of war is the same. Here are a number of tricks to ensure that you'll never lose an argument with your girlfriend.<br><br><strong>1- Don't raise your voice?</strong><br>Regardless of the nature of your fight (your suggestion for ice cream taken to mean you want her to fatten up, or your failure to mention ice cream taken to mean she's too heavy already), watch your voice. No matter what you have planned in your defense, always speak softly. As the composed one, her anger will only need run its course. Settle in for a long one, but remember; if she joins you on a conversational level, you've won.<br><br><strong>2- Be the first man to listen?</strong><br>Men have a reputation for being poor listeners. Be the exception. She wants to talk, and yell, so let her. But when it comes time for you to cough up a defense, reiterate her points back to her to prove you're listening to -- and understand -- what she's saying.<br>If you spend your cross-examination explaining herself to her by recapping her words, you may never actually have to ever have an original thought. And she'll think you're the keenest listener on the block. Once you see the look on her face as she hears you reiterate her sentiment, you will begin to see the Matrix. Go forth, Neo. Follow the white rabbit.<br><br><strong>3- Stay on the subject at hand?</strong><br>Whether the battle royale is about music, dinner reservations, Depp flicks, or the State of the Union, pick your battle and fight strong. Arguments are won or lost on the ability to prevent other gripes from creeping into the contest at hand. When the mood is confrontational, bring up nothing but that which you have been called out on.<br><br><strong>4- Admit wrong &amp; you win?</strong><br>Sometimes winning an argument is more about the aftermath than the battle. She can never, ever win a fight if you admit you are wrong first. Check your pride at the door. There will be tiffs in which you won't care if you're the victor. In these instances, no matter how much she wants to spar, lay down dead. Sometimes a nice glass jaw in the ring will score you big sensitivity points with the judges. The scorecards are in, and the winner, by unanimous decision, will be you.<br><br><strong>5- Play the emotional card?</strong><br>There are times when women just want to fight because they're feeling emotional. What we forget is that we men also want to fight because we are emotional. It is about the release; and what we are so ingrained to avoid, which has the same consummate effect, is letting the emotions flow.<br>Fight strong, and fight with honor, Young Jedi. But do not be afraid to act hurt by the things she says. To a woman, an aggressive man who shows emotion in the heat of an argument is the king of men. And you'll always win.<br><br><strong>6- Tell her off?</strong><br>Many men have stood with their hand on the little button, ready to end life as we know it. It is where the men and boys are separated. If winning the argument is worth destroying the relationship, or destroying the relationship is worth winning back your life, then fire personal insults at will. Be warned: there is no going back after inputting this launch code. Remember that sometimes, civilization as you know it is a tough thing to rebuild.<br><br><strong>for argument's sakeÂ…</strong><br>Take all arguments with your ladies with massive grains of salt and remember; you can always win by letting her believe what she needs to believe. That should be clear about four seconds in.<br>Where we stumble is when we need to prove to ourselves that we can win no matter the contest. Don't forget that it is in our nature to protect what we believe. If we spent all our time getting along, there would be no such thing as make-up sex<br><br>Takes abit of self control, tested method and proven by me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>ISO cetified 9002</div>
