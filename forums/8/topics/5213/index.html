            <div class='col-md body'>auser, I dun see a problem with that actually... I mean everyone hv different views and values, so there wil definitely be people who support certain things and vice versa.<br><br>There are always people who thinks that girls who do x are sluts and guys who do y are idiots, and there are certainly people who think otherwise, isn't it? Thats what makes the world such a troublesome place becos people always hold different ideas...<br><br>I dun understand your outburst, or did I understood your post correctly?<br><br>------------------<br>Whens the end coming?

            <div class='col-md body'>ohhh....you've replied to atax.<br><br>well it can seem that way. but the global village isn't as united as u may think it is. ppl dunno what to post, so they think of a topic. likely to be one born of prejudice....then ppl discuss it. try to make sense of things and, most importantly, learn from other ppl's experiences. in the process they learn not to be so narrow in their views. it's not what is posted up. it's how u choose to react to it.<br><br>i think ppl here are being themselves....cos nobody noes who they are. so if it's anyone who is narrow, it's the ppl. they dun become narrow or judgemental just cos they choose to post their views here in the forum. maybe this is a good indication of how ppl are really like out there? sad huh?<br><br>and by the way, nothing wrong abt ppl justifying their life choices....it's what ppl do to tell themselves they're doing alright....take that away and they kinda lose their sense of identity i think.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you're right again, as people respond i think i'm understanding more what it is that upsets me ..or maybe even less !<br><br>it's moral certainty, i'm never sure of my beliefs or values, they shift and change as i grow and meet people, but .. in many of the posts i read there's so much certainty .. no room for ambiguity or confusion .. everything must make sense, if you smoke you must be bad, if you enjoy your sexuality you must be bad,<br><br>that's frightening don't you think ? .. that people can be so sure, is it a case of 'well i seem to be ok, i'm content, i have a x,y, and z so i must be right' ? .. what is the yardstick by which people measure the 'success' (bad word but can't find another right now !) of their beliefs ? i dunno ..just thinking aloud.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fadingstar got it absolutely right here... I'm one of the beneficiary of fellow forumites contributions here and there, especially in my post of "Canada, USA or UK".<br>many forumites gave all kinds of different views on different issues of the countries that was mentioned, and another country which was not mentioned, which was Aust(thks pacman). did you read the post?
