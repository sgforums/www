              <p>I believe that no matter of whatever race and religion or skin colour we hail from it does not change the fact that we are still humans of the same kind.</p>
              <p>TS, your post is incomplete and it makes me feel as though you believe Singaporeans are Top-Notched? Lets face the fact that we are spoilt and pampered too much. Born with that silver spoon in our mouths.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are very good at something which is to complain. Our ethnics and way of life believe it or not is highly disgusted by the Japanese because we lack manners. Which i firmly agree. We do lack manners.It put me to shame when i went to Japan and i realise they quality of service and the way they portray themselves. Yes you may just say they have weird porn but who are we to tell them when we are not equally productive? At least they have something that people know them by. What about us?</p>
              <p>How many times when someone holds the door for you, you would actually say thanks? How many excuse me have you said? Lets face that what ever people say. is what they have seen. I believe you will do the same. If talking about hypocrites, then almost everyone here is one, including yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nuff said. Do not be offended. Im just telling you that your not high and mighty just because your Singaporean. One nuclear bomb and you will be in heaven drinking tea with God asking him what happen. He will prolly tell you OH! the Chinese bombed you for scolding them. You never know what might happen yea?</p>
              <p>So cool it. Keep it to yourself. Your just spiting the anger some people have for the chinese from china. And if your chinese by any chance, Your ancestors are Chinese too. So please, be mature and do not be so judgemental. Ain't healthy. Internet is a very powerful weapon.</p>

              <p>I remember other posts like this about you SIngaporeans complaining about CHinese people.</p>
              <p>One post i remember looking at was in mandarin, and i remember that what the PRC chinese person was saying about Singapore was indeed very reasonable. So don't be too quick to hate PRC chinese people, you ought to examine your own behaviour 1st.</p>
              <p>People have a right to complain about Singapore, last i checked our government and culture was that draconian. Complaints and negative criticisms are good because they encourage the good wellbeing of the state/country to evolve and remodel itself to become better. So when i say Singaporeans are not courteous and the locals don't have much soul in them (compared to europeans or angmohs in developed states), we see a lot of courtesy campaigns, smile campaigns, kindess campaigns intended to change the system to make it better.</p>
              <p>Criticism and complaints are not evil. So don't take offence. The so called "west" is what it is today because of centuries of complaining, struggle and criticism.</p>
