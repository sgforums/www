            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by kaio:<br>Don't you find her extremely fake, trying to maximise the publicity blitz by magnifying every single bit of her life. She has a waist injury, her husband's private life, how she suffered for NKF blah blah blah, supported by a posse of possessive fans who make sure their idol is artificially supported and never allowed to free fall from her arched position on the small throne.<br><br>What puts me off her is how she tries to "qiang jing tou" (grab attention) every charity show by crying. Cry so much for what, trying to elicit sympathy? I despise her attempt to elicit sympathy in such a crude manner. If she retires from showbiz, she could find a second career as a professional mourner at wakes for $20 per hour.<br><br>In fact, realistically who can take critics so calmly except for the victims who are the ones who should be rebutting &amp; worrying for themselves but instead you get these silly blind leading the blind supporters speaking in strong defence of their own idols. What kick they get out of it, after all it's all gossips &amp; up to ppl to believe. It's natural for normal ppl to wile their time away talking rubbish in forums. <strong>If you can't stand it why engage &amp; make yourselves so furious over an actress?</strong> Can you expect every one to agree with you that she is really the best, fabulous, talented, beautiful, famous, unsinful, pure, most friendly i.e. every word must be excellent? No one can think nor agree alike.<br><br>Whether you like it or not the rumours are not new &amp; will continue the next 10 years if she is still around in acting. This is not the only forum that has this gossips, all over the website, even her own zoe website gossips has it. So who are you arguing with or about. Nothing much you can do to stop so many forums, message boards from spreading, it's all over Singapore &amp; the internet, there4 the whole world can get access to it. But the more you rebut the more you get attacked, what for? Leave them alone &amp; move on! Why get heated up cos you asked for it!</blockquote>I think its u who is getting carried away...</div>
