            <div class='col-md body'>got one time I was taking MRT to school early in the morning the MRT damn crowded. there was this stupid bitch standing behind me, an uneducated, disgusting looking, and stupid woman kept pushing me on my school bag and saying "Oi!!! Bag!!" "Oi!! Bag!!" apparently my bag was close to her Fucking body. but the MRT was crowded, so the brainless bitch kept doing it. eventually I got fed up and I turn around and said "stop it stupid Bitch". then she muttered something and shut up.</div>
