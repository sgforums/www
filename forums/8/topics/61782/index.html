            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Rob Chen:<br><strong>while a little religion would do no harm,<br><br>i hope u guys can stop bring religion (whatever) into this, while Karma is a buddhism concept.... i m refer to more of the non buddhism/non-religious... modern concept of 'karma'....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> [b]some more real life examples ...??</strong>[/b]</blockquote>You are wrong. Its not only buddhism concept - in fact, many fields of thoughts and religion share the same ideal.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In astrology - we called it Law of Cause and Effect.<br><br>Yes, karma exist in everyone - without them, you wouldn't be what you are now. It's like the existence of friction - its always there, although nobody always witness its effect or bother to take note. The kind of retribution we see on movie and drama is too dramatic liao (Lightning strike, etc). In fact most of the time, it wouldn't happen.<br><br>Why? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Because in life you are to receive or to repay. If the ill deeds is on the repaying side - you are just balancing your spiritual account book with that particular him/her. A HUGE BUT is that human ALL have free will to employ - in fact most of the time, it wouldn't balance equally, therefore next life where you and him/her would cross each other's path, you have to pay/receive again.<br><br>E.g. Borrow ten dollars from you, returned you 14 dollars (now you owe me 4 dollars). You pay back 7 dollars (Now I owe you 3 dollars) and so on.<br><br>There is only one way to break through the karmic bonds, which is forgiveness. All religion taught us to forgive and to love our enemies - in reality, who actually does that? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>E.g. Aiya forget about the money, consider that a treat.<br><br>***<br><br>Are you able to forgive those who backstabbed you?<br><br>Are you able to release yourself from your old lover whom hurt you deep?<br><br>Are you able to forgive the father who abuse you outrageously?<br><br>No?<br><br>The cycle continues.<br><br>***<br><br>P.S: You have karmic bonds with your parents (That's why THEY are your parents and not somebody else). Some of you have parents always in conflict with you, while others have very harmonious family life. You have karmic bonds with you BGR partner. (That's why you fell in love with them and not E.g. sgboy2004 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ). You have karmic bonds with people that instantly capture your heart - your crush/love at first sigh. You have karmic bonds with your children and the whole damn list goes on.<br><br>If there isn't such thing as karma. EVERYONE WOULD BE BORN WITH EQUAL STANDARD, STATUS, POSITION, POSSESSION and everything because everyone is equal and there wouldn't be difference between people. This happened when human was first created - no such thing as money/status/etc - you ONLY have your body, mind and soul and all the natural resource found naturally. Everyone has their equal chance to survive and everything.<br><br>By numerous reincarnation - this is not possible anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
