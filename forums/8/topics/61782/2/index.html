To me religion and karma are separate issues - I said that its not purely just a buddisim theory, therefore the second half of your debate is a little out of point,  though I fully understand what you are trying to bring across.<br><br>You are generalising the preception of reincarnation and karma - slaughter pigs, etc, which is in fact NOT applicable to the actual theory I know. That is buddisim point of view - therefore monks are non-meat consumer. Reincarnation occurs only from a human soul to another human soul - that's the theory I learn and knew. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I said in my prior post - forgiveness and willing to release yourself is the key to break karmic bonds. Even though enlightenment is a natural part of the process - its NOT about a Buddha's wisdom to do that. In fact, you see them everyday; e.g. when people decide to wake up and stop hating their ex? When you decide to mature and accept your dad, who ditch your mum? The list goes on.<br><br>Lastly: I never said I cannot and everyone cannot forgive. I am just saying the cycle continues because the resentment remains. This creates an invisible cord between two humans. You can only sever the bonds through forgiveness (and if you wish for a religious point of view, in fact all major religion taught the goodness of forgiveness and I am just telling you what's the actual effect of it in your karma.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Well, its your belief and I have <strong>no intention </strong>to change that seriously. Basically I am a free-thinker, who studies relationship as an interest, therefore my views are NON-RELIGIOUS. Don't talk to me about religion - because the topic isn't about it. It seemed inter-related, but my post isn't. And my now if you realise (and I am repeating again) - karma &amp; reincarnation isn't just a Buddisim theory. In the same way as Thou shall not murder in a Christian's point of view - I feel the same way as well. In fact, it isn't just a Christian theory.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
