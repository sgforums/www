However his influence on his team is not high. Then look at beckham, how many times have he pick out a play the opponent fail to mark. In term of vision, I doubt anyone can surpass him. Figo a great player,quick on his feet, have vision and pace to take on any defence. Tower of strength for any team.<br>But the best player has to be Zidane, Look at hiim when he holds the ball, space seemly open for him. His opponent seem rooted to the ground while he waltz pass the defence. Look at how his body flood on the field and bring the ball with him, poetry in moment might I add. His body seem to be bulid to play soccer, with every touch of the ball and every intent of his mind bring such enjoy for us to watch.....<br><br>To the world's best player Zidane</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For this season, in terms of CONSISTENCY, i would nominate Beckham. In terms of skills and vision and EVERYTHING else, i would say Zidane. Figo don't even come close if i had my way. Vison is the most important aspect of footballing. Beckham has good vision and definitely has the most determination yet i still choose Zidane. Why? Zidane uses his vision VERY WELL. He doesn't need to cross the ball or give through pass and all that. He really uses his brain on the field. Something he did just took my breath away one time. It may seem very very very normal at that moment of time yet i am full of admiration.<br>I forgot which team he was playing against but he was playing for the France team. 2 times he did through passes without even having time to look around and control the ball. The ball wasnt at his feet. The other players were struggling and suddenly a france teammate slides the ball away straight at Zidane...normally a player would be taken back at such a fast and unexpected ball and would control it first.<br>What did Zidance do? Head it forward straight thru the defense and to the striker which i tink was Anelka. Another time was that someone crossed a ball and it was cleared away very quickly and the ball was again travelling towards zidane at a fast speed yet he one-touch it back straight to the striker in front of the penalty box. I was amazed and replayed the tape again n again. I wrote this and when i read it, it felt very mild to me...but i cant describe the feeling when i see Zidane do all these.<br>Player of the Year, Zidane.<br>Special Mention, Beckham.<br>Overrated, Figo. He's good but is he worth that much before Euro 2000? Think about it. I know he's good, but think hard.<br><br>------------------<br>-=^Wynternight^=-<br>None as blind or deaf as those who refuses to see or listen.</div>
