            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, I always feel that eye contact is important. If you hold the guy's gaze long enough, he may be tempted to sneak a kiss on you and of course, the setting must be right too, certainly NOT in some crowded fast food restaurant. However, guys are good at stealing quick kisses. Well, maybe can start from those stolen kisses too?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>
