            <div class='col-md body'>just curious, how do you initiate that first kiss if youÂ’ve been dating for a while? iÂ’m not talking about your very first kiss but the first kiss between courting couples or between people you like very much. does the guy usually make the first move or does the girl? does it even matter? and how would you like to be kissed for that first kiss? and oh, do you need to be at least at the holding hands stage before going to the kissing stage?<br><br>and yes, it has been a lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng time since i dated, so nobody crack jokes at my expense please, thanks. very rusty at the dating game, just need ideas, not practice, so this should preempt all the jokes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for gals, if you really want to be kissed, make it happen... meaning you help to initiate the situation... watching tv will help you to get some ideas... afterall, TCS8 actors/actresses are always boasting of giving their first screen kiss to so and so...<br><br>Just to be explicit, if you want to be kissed on the forehead, lean against him (shoulder, body,etc...) As for on the cheek, be next to him, so that he can kiss you without awkwardness... If you want a full kiss on the mouth, stand in front of him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For guys, if the lady is so explicit in wanting you to kiss her, pls lah, go ahead and kiss her... if not you will embarass her.  But if you are trying to initiate that first kiss, then create the mood and ambience... For example, you can whisper sweet nothings to her, then wait for her to blush, then kiss her on the cheek.<br>If you want to kiss her on the lips, one way is at the end of the date, when you're saying bye to her, then bend forward and kiss her... again, ambience is quite important...maybe look into her eyes first before making the move...<br>And if you are thinking of giving her a kiss on the forehead, do that at your own risk... are u looking for a sister?<br><br>Finally, for a first kiss, I will prefer a lip-to-lip first kiss  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a time after being with him for a while and the world has slowly receded away.  I never set out deliberately to get a kiss but the moment usually comes out of its own volition anyway.  Then either I stare at his lips or I play to be a shy Shanghai girl by not meeting his eyes and will blushes to appear on my cheeks, both usually work just fine.<br><br>------------------<br>My notion of a husband at forty is that a woman should be able to change him, like a bank note, for two twenties.</div>
