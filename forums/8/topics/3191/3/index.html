            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Colette,<br><br>I know what you mean by those kisses that you just wish would end quickly. When I was younger, I used to worry that I wasn't normal but I've come to realise that like everything else, not all guys kiss well and they have to be "guided". Hmmm.... I wonder if I would make a killing if I start a kissing workshop. Anybody keen to sign up?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>BTW, I kinda envy your first kiss, even if it was stolen and you were too young to know. I was a good ten years older when I got mine; by then, I was only too aware of the underlying sexual tension. Oh, how good it would be to experience kisses both greedy and innocent!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>colette:<br><br>Is that question post to me? You should leave such amorous request in private.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Purr:<br><br>I think your workshop is not gonna sell, I conducted a virtual session a couple of full moons ago. You can check it out and we can compare notes. If you are interested, a practical session is not out of question.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/001189.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/001189.html</a><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Lip Sealing studies - Initiation<br><br>Well, first kiss? Hmmm.....I think I better discount those kiss on the cheeks and the young fumblings....they are not worth mentioning. I am after all trying to sell myself on how good a kisser I am anyway.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Sad to say, my first kiss was given to some ah lian when I was a roaming bad boy teasing young impressionable ah lians. By the way, I can't recall any lians (no offense) who can kiss really well, I call them dead fish, cos their tongue are just dead pan.<br><br>Announcement: If there are any differing views on this matter from any ah lians out there, I would gladly entertain you on this matter to prove my point....literally.<br><br>Ok You all should know by now that I am really deperate for a wet tongue tieing session by now, but I have not kissed in months so pardon me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Well...back to the topic.....I can't help but digress sometimes.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Well, I can't say for sure the exact way to initate a first kiss. But I can say it takes a lot of work to put the mood right. I dun believe in waiting for the right moment, for it might just take too long for things to be in place naturally, I perfer to make things happen.<br><br>Well...I suppose as all romance goes, the setting got to be romantic....it can be anywhere....from the cinema, to the carpark, from your home to the MRT, it is a matter of creating that moment. You should attempt to at least plan where you want to go, you should know where would be romantic for the 2 of you, that I shall not discuss further.<br><br>Again...as usual, the gaze is very important, for this is what I call the lining up for the kiss (as in all airplane landings there has to be a lining up) If you are looking into each others eyes, your mouth is most probably in the correct direction. Dun look too long, for it might just be too intense for her and she might back off. Something like 3-5 secs is enough anything more would be a waste of time.<br><br>Breathing, yes breathing is very important, have you not notice that on the big screen, breathing heavily means that something exciting is going to happen? Well take it as a way to tell her that you are ready and that you want to kiss. If she reacts the same way as you are it is most probably a nod. Else show further signs....like slightly parting of your lips....no darting tongue though....not yet. Note that piror to this action, you should not take any garlic and some oral deorderant would be useful. *psst psst*<br><br>Hold her, if you like you can hold her by the waist, this position allows you to control the timing of the kiss, you can pull her closer if it is intense enough, and pull her away if you need some fresh air. Of course you can also lead her to the bed, but that would be another lesson all together. If you feel uncomfortable being in such close proximity, you can lift her chin lightly with your fingers gently, and lean forward to initiate the lip sealing. Note that you are not suppose to squezze her cheeks to pucker her lips, imagine her doing it to you, it would be most uncomfortable, what more, you are restriciting her tongue from achieving full lenght and flexibility. Of course there are many other position, just use what is most comfortable for yourself and her, the above are just suggestions.<br><br>For kissing techniques please refer to Frech kissing 101 as provided by the link above.<br><br>Disclaimer - Note that the above is written solely on one's personal experience and not the view of the general public. Any injuries, physical, mental, spiritual and egoistical will not be beaedr by the writer. You are allowed to use this as reference, but it will on ly stop there. If it does not work for you, it just means that you are ugly. Thank You.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 07 August 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*luffs* You sound like the kind of bad boy I used to love flirting with. Too bad, I've "retired" ; otherwise, I may just consider taking up your offer to "compare notes" *grin*<br><br>Yes, you're right, my workshops probably wouldn't sell. I can't do any practicals or else there'll be a enraged bf (mine) hopping up and down somewhere.<br><br>Anyway, you've brought up a very pertinent point.  I love love love intense gazes, they send a shiver down my spine. But it's also true that the gaze should not be held for too long. If the other party is uncertain whether he/she wants to kiss you, the extra time will create an opportunity to back off.<br><br>As for heavy breathing, I'm not so sure. Other cues are usually sufficient for me, e.g. the guy coming closer and bending his head slightly so that he can kiss me more deeply later. It's a bit strange for me to see the guy being so excited even before the kiss begins. It's a bit of a turn off for me if the guy expels his breath all over my face too...<br><br>I like being held at the waist when I'm kissed. Usually, I like to run my hands up and down his biceps when he does that, it feels very good. But the best part is, this position also allows me to restrain him when his hands wanders too far above the waist *grin*<br><br>Kudos to Callan for being so firthcoming. Anybody ekse would like to add more tips?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 08 August 2000).]</div>
