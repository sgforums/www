A simple 'How are u today' can brighten a guy's day.<br><br>26. No one knows how guys are feeling and going through, unless they haf a buddy.<br><br>27. Guys hate it when gers use them to noe their guy friends.<br><br>28. Love means devotion, caring and happiness to a guy, in that order.<br><br>29. Guys jus wan someone who he likes n feel in love.<br><br>30. Guys wan nothing more than to feel loved.<br><br>Feel free to edit it. haha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> </div></blockquote>1. When a guy says he's sad, but he isn't crying, it means he's crying in <strong><span style="color: red;">his</span> </strong>heart.<br><br>4. If a guy loves a ger, she will always be on <strong><span style="color: red;">his</span></strong> mind every minute of the day<br><br>7. When a particular ger flirts with a guy very often, a guy would start thinking the ger likes <strong><span style="color: red;">him</span></strong>. So if you treat a guy just as a friend,<br>jus treat him as per normal pls, dun induce misunderstandings. lol<br></div>
