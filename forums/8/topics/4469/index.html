            <div class='col-md body'>As we all know... lesbian and gays' population is on the growth in Singapore. Wat would u do if u discover your goodfriend is a homosexual? Would u ignore them and make them cease to exist in your memory? Or do u just accept them as wat they are?<br>How many of u have visited lesbian pubs and gay pubs? (there is alot in Singapore) And wat is your feeling when u r there?<br>Who do u blame when they turned homosexual? They themselve? The society? Their parents?<br>Many people i know (esp GUYS) will go "eeee" and than make fun on them. But do u know how they actually felt deep inside? IF they have a choice.. they would want to be normal, but u must understand they r born like that. Why cant u people accept them as wat they r? Wat makes u any different from RACIST pigs that exist in this world? U r just another "sexual racist".<br>Wat is your views on this issue? Please do discuss.<br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>From "ex-defunct" moderator<br>Ah_Nic<br>(He is not lesbian/gay but a person who accepts them and felt angry on how Society treats them.)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't hate them but i simply feel UNEASY with them. Yes, UNEASY is the word, especially gays. When they sit so close to you and put their hands on your shoulder, really dunno wat's on their mind .... just feel uneasy lah. Lesbians ok lah, at least I know lesbians won't have any designs on me hehe.<br><br>But i really wish that the society don't get TOO supportive with homosexuals. It is ok for them to be around but dun openly support them. I am considering more about my children, dun want them to think that homosexual is "alright" and "normal". To me, i think homosexuality, to a certain extend, is an acquired characteristic. I think there is a need for us to help them get back "straight" instead of "accepting who they are".</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well! well! This gotta be a sensitive issue. However, we have to come to terms with it, like what Ah_Nic said, the gay and lesbian population are on the rise.<br><br>This is probably due to the fact that Singapore is moving away from a more conservative past as we are now into the first quarter of a new millennium. Time changes so do people in society.<br><br>Well basically, i feel after all they are still humans right so we ahould not be prejudiced against them. After all, i guess they did not want to turn out that way right!!!<br><br>Thus if i have friends who are gays or pple who have inclinations to the same sex, i would not look at them in the eye and ask them to butt off, but rather treat them normally. This is because they are who they are so we have to give them the respect and dignity they so deserve and not to be look upon as pariahs. I would think this is what a gracious society should have; that is respect for each individual regardless of what they may be.</div>

I dun want my children to be homosexual. Hence I dun mind being around but let's not support them openly. Just like prostitution. I dun mind them being around, but let's not publicise and promotes it.<br><br>Do you know your spouse can suddenly turn homosexual too ?? Scary sia !<br><br>Is there homosexual behaviours in animals or not ah ? I know of some experiments where mice are "made" to be gays lah but do they exist "naturally" ?<br><br>btw, homosexuality is one of the main cause of AIDS.

            <div class='col-md body'>They might be gays and lesbians but that does not mean they are any diff from us in anyway. We haf feelings and do they.  The gulf btw hextersexuals and homosexuals is juz sex preference thats all.  Othet then that everything s still the same.  If we cannot learn to accept them in our society then we will really the the outcasts. Lets face it in this world there are so many ppl and everyone has their own faults. in other words no one is perfect.</div>
