A lot of games have blood and gore genres, don't tell me that the makers are following the heels of Moron Kumbat?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

MK did not. At least it had concept and idea intervoven excellently into the characters, story and their abilities</div>
