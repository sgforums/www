            <div class='col-md body'>They probably has had tons of complains about the layout of the escalators already... They are just thinking for the folks on the less busy side of building because they pay the same rent as the others, yet they get less customers because of those straightforward escalators. How would you like it if you opened a shop at that corner, you pay the same amount of rent, yet the amount of customers you get are less. Unless they cut rent for people on this side of the building in order for them to use the extras for publicity, I think this is the best way for the tenants to at least get some customers and the management to keep their pockets lined with the tenants money. It's a money making society in Singapore. Safety is impt too, but do the management care? My answer would be no.<br><br>Just a few cents as usual <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
