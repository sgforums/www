The first thing you have to think about is whether you are ready to take on the responsibility of owning a dog. You also have to consider the kind of housing you live in, whether it is a flat or a landed property etc. If you live in a flat, you are only allowed to keep small to medium dogs. Next, you must think of the amount of time you can spend with your pet. Dogs require attention and need daily walks for exercise If you are very busy and you want to get a jack russell, itis not very advisable, coz they are very very active and can be destructive when they are lonely. I have owned a maltese before andI currently have a shetland sheepdog. Both these breeds have a very nice and friendly temperament and are easier to handle. Ultimately, owning a dog is a huge responsibility and at the end of your day, it's your choice and how dedicated you are to it. They can really bring meaning into your lives<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
