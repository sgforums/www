It was almost full save for a seat in which the guys on either side had their legs spread so wide you'd think they had 3 feet wide dicks.<br><br>anyway, i squeezed into the seat and sat down. Both guys didn't budge or "close-up" so i slowly opened my legs till i got a comfortable leg room. The guy on my left realised and repositioned himself.<br><br>Not so the guy on the rite. At a subsequent station, when more seats opposite me became available, he suddenly aggressively got up, deliberately brushing me as he did so and sat at one of the opposite seats.<br><br>I gave him a hard and annoyed stare. Guess his reaction?<br><br>Acting the typical ah beng, he raised his head and stared back and raised his voice at me, saying: WHAT? READ YOUR PAPERS LAH!<br><br>Such uncouth behaviour man...i decided this guy wasn't worth my trouble so i shook my head and carried on with my reading, ignoring him.<br><br>Funnily enuff, ppl sitting on the opposite side next to him eventually changed seats.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Thats why i prefer to stand in the MRT, espically the place where the 2 cabin connect, very windy when it goes undergound... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
