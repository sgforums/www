The world is no more Singapore or Canada, we depend on one another to survive. Every nation in the world today consist of ppl from many different nations. That is true for Cananda, it is also true for Singapore. Quitter or not is really no big deal, it's how you want to view it and how the politicians want to influence you to stay and make a difference. In the next 10 yrs, many more Singaporeans will leave and many more foreigners will come to take root here.<br><br>Freedom is about the right to choose. We shouldn't put down those who leave Singapore for greener pastures overseas... have you ever blamed your great grand parents who came to Singapore in search of a better life from China or India? Do you think your great grandparents who came here for a better life are quitters of China?<br><br>It is only human nature to seek for a better place to live, a better place where he/she could survive with his/her skills. And Singapore may not be the place for everyone. Just like other countries may not be the place for every Singaporeans.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hear the M word again!<br><br>I agree with weirdo and dragg that the word quitter shouldn't apply to Singaporeans who migrated overseas. It is just their choice to do so. In fact using that word disgraced all our forefathers who migrated from India or China. Just like peanuts was quoted by Mrs. GCT, quitters was quoted by Mr. GCT. Now I think more are beginning to understand the minds of our politicians.<br><br>The author is right that taxi drivers are complaining about life in Singapore. Just ask one when you ride a taxi next time. It is a fact that Singapore is no longer an ideal place to live. Of course life may not necessary be greener in other countries. I guess it is how much sacrifice you can accept and how well you can adapt.<br><br>Those who want to stay, just stay and those who want to leave, just leave. It is really a matter of personal choice. Please quit labelling those who want to leave as "quitters"!<br><br>Just in case anyone is thinking of migrating to Edmonton, Canada, the winter can be as cold as -17Â°C.</div>
