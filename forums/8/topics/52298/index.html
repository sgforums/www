            <div class='col-md body'>as written on Life! today, here are some of the edits appearing in the revised novels:<br><br>1. In the condor trilogy, Huang Rong's father is now no longer 100% devoted to his deceased wife. It will be hinted that he likes his disciple Mei Chaofeng<br><br>2. The Guo Jing-Huang Rong pairing will now be revised from a seemingly elder sis-younger bro r/s to a more equitable standing<br><br>3. The standoff at Xiangyang city will now be moved to Qingzhou city after Jin Yong has realised that the mongols had not laid siege to the former in any of their wars<br><br>IMHO, new ones may not be better than old works. By intending to fix some loopholes in the stories/adding spice to the plot, the author has unwittingly added new flaws. Here are some of my views:<br><br>1. To point 1, Jin Yong has slightly added more insight into Huang Yaoshi's personality. Perhaps this new teacher-student r/s will explain why he is supportive of Yang Guo's r/s. However, such a move make him as deplorable as Wu Santong, considering that his wife was alive back then.<br><br>2. Not much comment on pt 2, except that i liked the old r/s back then; would prefer to keep it that way.<br><br>3. Finally after so many yrs, Jin Yong's realised that he'd made a historical mistake on XY city and decides to to relocate the siege to QZ. So how is Guo Xiang gonna get her namesake if they weren't there in the 1st place? Sure he could have altered the plot again to compensate for this loophole, but the character will lose some monumental value. Given the excellent plot depicted on the sieges at XY, i think many readers would prefer to leave it that way,<br><br>To change or not to change, that is the author's decision. However i'm sure that many readers will share this same thought: If it ain't broken, don't fix it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>at the beginning of the story, guo jing is supposed to attend to a duel 16yrs later. Assuming his mentors took no more than a year to find him, he should be around 16,17 yrs old when he left the steppes.<br><br>when guo jing first met huang rong, she was described as a lad of 13,14 yrs old. As such, the reader is given an impression that the guy is older by 1,2 yrs. sidenote: very young couple. u would think that in today's society they would be discouraged from going steady by their mentors,parents etc<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, if it is not broke why fix it,most of his novels are just works which use a certain historical era as a back ground with frictional characters.In this way all the events are already not true history, so why does he need to clarify certain portion.<br><br>At least for me,it is the good interaction of his various characters in the novels that make his novels such classic. By changing part of the story to accomadate history is just like taking away a certain portion of some of the characters. In this way history gain a point but it really has done nothing for that portion that has captivates so many people to like his novel. May even make it worse off in the end.</div>
