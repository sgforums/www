            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by o0sadd0o:</div><div class="quote_body">Not long ago, i patronized a Macdonald outlet at the west of singapore. I giggled while ordering my food because i made a mistake in my orders. And guess what? To my horror, the counter guy actually told me " Can u stop laughing?" I mean what the hell is this? So, i wrote a complain letter and no feedback form was available there. Then he approached me, and insisted that i was at fault. Im the customer, i should expect the best service from whichever outlet i patronize. Is laughing against the Macdonalds rule?? Should i receive such attitude? should customers be treated this way? it isn't fair..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>Yes, you are the customer and you can expect the best service.  However, there are basically two types of customers.  The "GOOD" and the "BAD".  Just be reminded, they are the seller and they do have the rights to request you to finish your orders.  Perhaps you didn't notice that you are in a que and it is a counter.  Do you think it's fair to keep giggling and ask the counter staff to wait till you finish?  He might have other pressing stuff to do.. i.e. serving the next customer? or to take care of the french fries etc.  I would complaint about his services if he simply walk away before I finish my ordering.<br><br>If you still feel that you are right about it, try doing such things at whichever outlet and see what surprises you can get.  And also, go and work in these fast food joint for once... you will understand more about being a customer.<br><br></div>

There are still good service... sometimes it depends alot on your luck and timing and of course, your demands.
