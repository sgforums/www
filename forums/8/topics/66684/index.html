            <div class='col-md body'>A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was.<br><br>So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly.  The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.  The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with an unanimous "yes."<br><br>The professor then produced two mugs of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.<br><br>"Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.  The golf balls are the important things--your family, your health, your children, your friends, your favorite passions--things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. "The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else--the small stuff.<br><br>If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house, and fix the disposal.<br><br>"Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand."<br><br>One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented. The professor smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple cups of coffee."<br><br>Ps: So spend sometime and give your friend a pat on the shoulder or give your loved ones a kiss...<br><br>OK!

            <div class='col-md body'>Reminds me of this AH MENG Maths lecturer we used to have... He's always talking about his OWN life experiences and investment during classes and nothing related to the class at all... Half of his class he would be talking about those 'nonsense'.... The other half he'll be referring to the text book (which he told us to buy) to copy and write down the step by step solutions from it and try to EXPLAIN to us from there.... But there're just a few problems...?<br><br>1. The explanations are already IN the book....<br>2. He can't even COPY it properly... Always ended up asking us how to do...<br>3. He always don't have enough time to finish his tutorial and lecture propers YET have so much time to yak yak non-stop about his own 'experience'... -__-`~</div>
