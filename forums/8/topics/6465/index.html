            <div class='col-md body'>hey i think that sometimes fate is cruel but i think there is always a way around it. if my wife cannot concieve i will be very supportive and will not try like mad to have a kid. i will ask her what she wants and if she does not mind adopting then i will adopt one. if not, we will live happily ever after without kids...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Let him that move the world, first move himself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'll still love her. Of course, we'll probably try every means possibly, but it shouldn't become an obsession. If there really isn't any option, then we'll just have to adopt one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, it's me again.<br><br>[Pressure]<br>Pressure is defintely there. Not only from parents but frens, colleagues etc etc. They will just ask you jokingly "when are you going to be "promoted" ah ??" If this happens everyday, you'll get sick of it. And Chinese New Year will also be a time you dread about. So how ?<br>IF this happens to me. I will accept it and find out what is the problem exactly. Then when my frens/relatives ask about it, I will patiently explain to them. It is nothing to be ashamed of becos it is nobody's fault. People will even admire you for being such a caring and understanding husband.<br>The only way to solve problem is not to run away from it but accept it and face it.<br><br>[Adoption]<br>I do not really support adoption if there is still a possibility of us having a biological child (unnatural means)<br>Adoption will be my very last resort.<br>The reason is, there is always this question about this child's biological parents. It bothers me (at least now). And it may bother the child in the future. If I really need to adopt a child, I will choose to adopt someone whose parents are known (but died in accident etc) instead of those abandoned ones. So that I can answer the child when he asks,"Who is my real mummy and daddy". I think I have to be responsible to answer such questions. And I will not hide from the child that we are not his biological parents.<br><br>[Medical]<br>There are many other ways to help a woman conceive.<br>InVitro fertilization (IVF, aka test-tube babies). The ovum is fertilised outside the womb but the baby will still be carried by the biological mother as the fertilised ovum will be implanted into the woman's uterus after fertilisation. This solves the problem of low sperm count and failure to erect.<br><br>[Surrogate Mother]<br>If the problem is the woman's inability to carry a baby (failure to implant after fertilisation of the egg or woman too weak to support a baby in her) she can employ a surrogate mother to do the job. Dunno if this is legalised in Singapore or not though (can someone tell me ?). But issues like trust in the surrogate mother arises. The best is to get a relative to be your surrogate mother.<br><br>[Male Pregnancy]<br>This is probably the wildest thing you can do. But it is not impossible. Don't believe me ? Check this out : <a href="http://www.malepregnancy.com" rel="nofollow">www.malepregnancy.com</a><br><br>Well, many of you are talking about "love". How much you "love" your wife and how you should do this and that because of "love". I would like to add that it is very ideal to think that way. In a marriage life, it is not all about love, though it is important. It is definitely more complicated than that.<br>But no matter what decision you make, both parties must agree FULLY and BELIEVE that that is the BEST solution. Stick to that solution for the rest of your life. And you will live happily ever after  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Here's my 5 cents worth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
