            <div class='col-md body'>personally, i see punctuality as an indicator on how late comers value the other party as a friend, if done on a regular basis.<br><br>i have heard many justifications from people with completely no sense of timing and one of the excuses is that they dont like to wait for others. frankly, who does?<br><br>and to think they proudly see it as their trademark.<br><br>if one can be punctual for their exams or interviews (events in which being late could lead to his or her <strong>OWN</strong> losses) but choose always to be late for appointments with their friends, it kinda shows the degree of self-centeredness.</div>
