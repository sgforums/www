            <div class='col-md body'>I was sad and upset when I heard the news of the bijani sisters' death on radio this afternoon. I ask why they insisted on going on with the separation when german doctors had already told them they will die or become vegetative and therefore rejected their pleas for an operation. Then they came to Singapore and asked for the same thing to our doctors who later made the decision to separate them. What upset me is why the doctors didn't ensure that they can really be seperated? Even though the sisters wants to separate "in any and all circumstances", is it not the doctors duty to ensure that they will not as a result of the op kill someone? Is that legal? Noted that its a historic operation for Singapore doctors, it is then even more important to ensure the safety of sisters?</div>

I believe our doctors here were put in a very difficult situation. Their professional skills would tell them that the operation was too risky however the temptation of such a celebrity case was hard to resist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You pple are mixing the concepts of "mercy" killing and risky operations up.<br><br>The reason for the operation was the give both twins, by their wishes, a shot for a new life.<br><br>And though the operation was risky, the docs. felt that there was a reasonable chance that it might suceed, not a slim chance, but a reasonable chance given the best possible care they could. I think in this area they have already done their very best to maximise the chances of the twins surviving, but of course, fate had different cards to play today. Sometimes, miracles just don't happen, and it's sad when it happens, but we know that we tried our very best, and that's what matters.<br><br>Celebrity case? Maybe you should think before you say such things... as a matter of fact, this is a risky operation in which failure could mean a large dark cloud over any doc's carrer... if it was celebrity cases they were looking for, they would have treated low-risk, celebrity figures. This was an operation taken with everything to maximise the chances as humanly possible under the insistence of the twins after they have understood the risks. So be it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even as I'm sadden by the tragedy, I thank God that both sisters have finally found peace everlasting. It must have been very hard for them to live their 29 years together, bathe together, sleep together, date together, eat together and everything together. I'm sure most of us would have gotten sick and tired if someone else (esp a sibling) is always next to you watching your every move and some more doing the same things as you are doing. I applaud their courage to take the risk and the doctors' hard work to help them get what they wanted so much to have.<br>I prayed for the sisters and I know they are happy in heaven to be seperated at last. I am proud of what the doctors have done, that they took the risk (at the cost of their career, reputation etc.) to op the twins in front of the whole wide world. We know that most Singaporeans are afraid to take risks that may jeopardise even the slightest things in their lives. I thank God for the brave doctors and I know everyone is very proud to know that we have heroes in Singapore.</div>
