Tiny, barren, location strategic for now because it lies right on the spot that allows a Boeing to re-fuel before it can fly off elsewhere and ships must dock for servicing before it can sail elsewhere.<br><br>These valuable properties were recognized a couple hundred years ago and provided more jobs than its inhabitants, the orang asli on this soil could work for. So our grandfathers came, worked and settled. Their decedents enjoyed 3 generations of prosperity because they made this bold move to migrate to Singapore while their down to earth counterparts chose to remain in China.<br><br>Sadly, like a river that runs dry, so too, resources deplete, condition changes. The spirit of migrants on a pilgrimage runs in our blood. Go forth and seek a better life. If not here, then elsewhere.</div>
