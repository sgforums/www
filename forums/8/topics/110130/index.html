            <div class='col-md body'>These are the words used by Kareemoff Sumyun Gy from Jakarta when he wrote to BBC to report the huge earthquake that struck this morning. The earthquake off the west coast of northern Sumatra was measured at 8.9 on the Richter Scale by US Geological Survey. As a kid I have learned about earthquakes and I have always been awed by the power and destructive forces of earthquakes. Never do I expect to read about a magnitude 8.9 earthquake during my lifetime, one that happened so near. A check with the US Geological Survery's website showed that the 8.9 magnitude earthquake struck Sumatra at about 8.55am Singapore time. It then sparked off a series of earthquakes in Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands, two islands in the India region. As of 3.38pm Singapore time, a total of 12 earthquakes had been recorded. ABC News reported that the earthquakes launched tidal waves that swamped villages and seaside resorts across Asia, killing more than 10,000 people in five countries - Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. In Singapore, people here felt tremors. I also read that Maldives is under 1.2 meters of water in some areas. BBC posted reports from its readers who witnessed the events. Here are some of them.<br><br>The whole of Male and all islands are under knee-deep water after huge waves washed the islands. - Mohamed Latheef, Male, Maldives<br><br>This morning my brother called me to say that he is alive. He lives on the small tourist island, Koh Phi Phi near Phuket in south Thailand. He reported that: "The whole island is smashed, there are dead people all over!" He was trying to find his Thai girlfriend and a Danish friend.- Stinus, Copenhagen, Denmark<br><br>Waves never seen before hit the island of Penang, Malaysia, devastating coastal areas. Waves of more than 10ft high swept away wooden stilt houses at coastal areas. Ambulances are seen rushing to affected areas.- Victor Tan, Penang, Malaysia<br><br>The Sumatra earthquake is the world's fifth most powerful this century and the most powerful since 1940. Ancient civilisations have many legends regarding earthquakes. Some believed that earthquakes were directly caused by their god when he is angry. Maybe god is indeed angry today and we are feeling his wrath through mother nature.<br><br>source: http://izreloaded.tripod.com/december2004.htm#magnitude9killerearthquake</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am just a messanger for this post:<br><br>A colleague of mine was saying that god (according to him its a Xtian god) is angry with the non believers and etc thus using the tsunami, in one swoop right after Xmas, to rid of all these people. His theory is that even Taiwan and HK which setup all those busshist statues, are punished for worshipping idols by god as they always and this year 2004, by having so many typhoons, and hurricanes.<br><br>-------<br><br>My take is that, these natural disasters happen all the time before "god" as far as the history of earth goes. Indonesia is part of the Ring of Fire (high earth quake zones) and therefore, it is bound to happen one day. As a matter of fact, you might have read about Krakatoya, the volcano in indonesia. That thing exploded many years back and the noise was actually hear all the way across pacific. The amount of ash it threw up dropped the world temperature by 1-2 deg for years. The ash was said to have flown around the earth for years. So being in high earth quake zones always pose this danger of  more natural disasters.<br>But I think some people like to believe whatever they wish. May be, as he said, god is punishing us for treating our fellow people so poorly.  However, aparrently, to me there is no god, cause wars still happen, innocents always die, politicians still lie, evil deeds are still happening, bad people are still having it good, fools still wait for some godly entity to save them.<br>I await what will happen in 2005 ...</div>

I wonder what would people say of England and America gets hit by serious natural disasters.... like California sinking into the sea or a high country size ice berg in the north plunges into the sea and the whole of the north america, england, alantic ocean has a tsunami like here (Its a possibility)... would people say the same or would people start saying their "lord" is punishing them for evils theive done and or would they think that their "lord" is  giving them a test ???? (knowing Xtians, it would be the latter cause they like to think they are good and assume the ROW is bad) Surely, be more objective than using religion as a buffer to better understanding.<br><br></div>
