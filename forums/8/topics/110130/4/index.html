The earthquake off the west coast of northern Sumatra was measured at 8.9 on the Richter Scale by US Geological Survey. As a kid I have learned about earthquakes and I have always been awed by the power and destructive forces of earthquakes. Never do I expect to read about a magnitude 8.9 earthquake during my lifetime, one that happened so near. A check with the US Geological Survery's website showed that the 8.9 magnitude earthquake struck Sumatra at about 8.55am Singapore time. It then sparked off a series of earthquakes in Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands, two islands in the India region. As of 3.38pm Singapore time, a total of 12 earthquakes had been recorded. ABC News reported that the earthquakes launched tidal waves that swamped villages and seaside resorts across Asia, killing more than 10,000 people in five countries - Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. In Singapore, people here felt tremors. I also read that Maldives is under 1.2 meters of water in some areas. BBC posted reports from its readers who witnessed the events. Here are some of them.<br><br>The whole of Male and all islands are under knee-deep water after huge waves washed the islands. - Mohamed Latheef, Male, Maldives<br><br>This morning my brother called me to say that he is alive. He lives on the small tourist island, Koh Phi Phi near Phuket in south Thailand. He reported that: "The whole island is smashed, there are dead people all over!" He was trying to find his Thai girlfriend and a Danish friend.- Stinus, Copenhagen, Denmark<br><br>Waves never seen before hit the island of Penang, Malaysia, devastating coastal areas. Waves of more than 10ft high swept away wooden stilt houses at coastal areas. Ambulances are seen rushing to affected areas.- Victor Tan, Penang, Malaysia<br><br>The Sumatra earthquake is the world's fifth most powerful this century and the most powerful since 1940. Ancient civilisations have many legends regarding earthquakes. Some believed that earthquakes were directly caused by their god when he is angry. Maybe god is indeed angry today and we are feeling his wrath through mother nature.<br><br>source: http://izreloaded.tripod.com/december2004.htm#magnitude9killerearthquake</div></blockquote>Think we have an angry man who just blame god for things<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stupiddissmart<br><br>U got the story wrong, he sent down his son but god himself kill him so it become a sacrifice for him himself. If he can be kill by mere mortal men, then doesn't tat show how powerless he is ?<br><br>are you a christian? if you are i'm so sorry but its back to the bibles for you. he is kill by mortal men as he himself came down as a man with flesh and blood and went to the pain of the crucifix its only when he die as a human he raise after 3 days.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  just a discussion</div>

If u care to notice when he was brought to some magistrate, he said tat no people can made him go over as a prisoner, only god have the power to do tat. He was really bought over to be killed by god himself. If u ask me, <strong>if</strong> there is such a person as jesus, he probably just a normal human being and killed by mortal men because he was powerless to stop them. If u r a prisoner sent to a death penalty, can u stop the executioner from carrying out his work ? So in conclusion, christian believe he was crucified by god indirectly, god wanted him to be tortured and die, but I believe <strong>if</strong> there is such a person called, jesus, he is just a normal person. Much like wat the jews believed. So wat r u ?</div>
