You assume God exists. You are a close-minded person. And I know why. You are afraid the evidence that we uncover will prove to you that all you've believed in is a great lie. A good Christian of the faith will look at both sides of the argument and use science as proof, instead of relying on the Bible and scriptures alone...for they were written by people long ago who have little knowledge of the world they live in, and so there are flaws in their writing.</div>
