One cannot perceive what the mind is unable to know. Knowing (knowledge) is both subjective (experientially) and objective (observation and speculation). One can know G_D within the constraint of the pre-existing mind in a closed Universe within the space + time continuum. This is within a closed environment known to us, and which one would define as the space + time continuum<br>Yet when one thinks of G_d in reality within the mind, one is enable to preconceive G_d as an Entity. The idea of God maybe like an ALIEN from faraway. G_d may exist outside the space time environment constraints in an OPEN abstraction beyond the reach of scientific observation and even any possible knowledge other than that of speculation.<br>Admittedly, the mind can really conceive of God in this speculative sense. God therefore become an ideal not necessary to be real! Nobody would want to believe in a speculative God, because it 's likely he may not exists! However, one may believe in an ideal God ? Just think about how many people do believe like that,but that really is still an artifical God!<br>"I believe in an ideal God because he is ideally good!" - Aristotle<br>However one may believe, that idea alone cannot deny nor obliterate the existence of G_d.
