Well what was really happening: my car had just entered into a no-rain area and everything became clear and better focus again!

            <div class='col-md body'>Proof that God sucks:<br><br>okok first off that galieo dude. he said that the earth revolves around the<br>sun, but that went against the teachings of the church so they placed him<br>under house arrest untill he died. GUESS WHAT?? the earth revolves around<br>the sun!<br><br>2nd christianity says that god created every thing, but who created god?<br><br>3rd christianity says that you should love every body and treat them<br>fairly...hmmm lets see weren't the nazis chritian? Also the crusaders who<br>raped,killed, and looted from tones of people did it all in the name of<br>"god." Slave drivers that were devoted chritians treated thier slaves like<br>nothing. what a way to follow ur religion<br><br>4th the whole adam and eve thing. the bible states that god created adam and<br>eve first, but fossil records clearly show that things where on the earth be<br>for humans.<br><br>5th the virgin birth. right...just think about it and you will realize how<br>stoopid that is. how can a virgin give birth?? that just goes against all<br>science except the type of lizard that can clone itself. <strong>if you still belive<br>in the virgin birth are you implying that mary was a lizard?</strong><br><br>6th noahs arc 2 of every animal ehhh lets see...a boat that can hold 2<br>elephants, rhinos, giraffs, hippos, kimono dragons, apes, wolves, and etc.<br>is just im possible. it would take a genious to design a boat able to do<br>that and noah wasn't a genious.<br><br>7th again bout the noah story. god loves you right? well then how come he<br>drowned everything on the planet except 2 of each animal?<br><br>8th Ahhh Noah. A few questions for you too then - where did he get the polar<br>bears, penguins, etc from? Noah sends a dove out to see if there was any dry<br>land. But the dove returns without finding any. Then, just seven days later,<br>the dove goes out again and returns with an olive leaf. But how could an<br>olive tree survive the flood? And if any seeds happened to survive, they<br>certainly wouldn't germinate and grow leaves within a seven day period. When<br>the animals left the ark, what would they have eaten? There would have been<br>no plants after the ground had been submerged for nearly a year. What would<br>the carnivores have eaten? Whatever prey they ate would have gone extinct.<br>And how did the New World primates or the Australian marsupials find there<br>way back after the flood subsided? Noah kills the "clean beasts" and burns<br>their dead bodies for God. According to the bible, this would have caused<br>the extinction of all "clean" animals since only two of each were taken onto<br>the ark.<br><br>9th "Love your enemies."<br>Well, it's a nice thought. But it seems strange coming from someone who<br>damns his enemies to hell.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you've watched the movie Alien Vs Predator or read Erich Von Daniken's book, Chariot of the Gods, there is a possibility that God is one, or many, aliens who visited the Earth in primitive times to guide humankind through evolution and technological advancement. To the ancients, a highly advanced alien species would have technology that the early people would call 'magic'. Imagine how a man living 26,000 years ago would see the world today, of the 21st century. That is probably how the ancients saw the aliens in the past, as a race of people that could only be Gods, because of their advanced technology, unlimited knowledge, and great intelligence...</div>

Now that is stupid because the 'almighty, all-knowing, omnipotent' God never helps us. He watches his followers fight their wars for him, die for him, and while he sits back, relaxes, munches on popcorn, and watches the world rot away...What good is a God who does nothing but allows evil to flourish in the world? What good is a God who promises paradise for his followers but condemns unbelievers to hell? Every person deservers a right to his or her own opinion and I say God has no fcukin right to decide the fate of any one man because of his beliefs. Of course, God doesn't exist, so we don;t hafta worry about that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
