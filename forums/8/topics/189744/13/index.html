Religions however, are not technological realities nor scientific ones. Its is spiritual and got to do with one's belief. It has no possible scientific proofs available to determine whether a person is true or although it may well be as real as the facts of ABC with someone who believes<br><br>However, it need be said that there are certain methods used to determine the veracity of certain facts in religious beliefs. For instance, both Archaeology and History are common disciplines where certain facts in the events can be determined as accepted  or just by some sects or small group of believers. We know that dinosaurs used to roam the earth and we have the proofs of the bones to show! WE also know Julius Cesar was the not first empire builder** though he was the conqueror of the ancient world and had established the ancient Roman Empire. Some facts are likely, some unlikely and perhaps falsified, and no amount of scientific proofs can certify it as real as a historical event that had happened, even though they are accepted as universal facts. The simple fact is the resurrection of Jesus or the re-carnation of Buddha or a certain so and so who came back to tell all his grand children that Hell is a very hot place!...and<br><br>All these so called simple facts are simply accepted as beliefs by people who believes and therefore, very hard to verify!<br>It is just asking the pawnshop person to determine the value of an ancient piece of artifact even though it is pure gold or some Buddha tooth found by someone in old Ceylon monastic places![[User:Terry How|: Terri talk 01:12, October 8,2005 (UTC)]] 09:41, 22 May 2006 (SGT)<br><br>there were others like Alexander the Great who built the great Grecian  Empire<br>Retrieved from "http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Realities"<br></div>

Since u do not require a logical answer to the creation of the universe, then u can really put anything u like in.<br><br>And BTW, where and why do u say tat god is illogical ?<br><br><blockquote>Science is another subject of faith.<br><br>There are many laws and theories but little facts. </blockquote>If science is nothing but simply faith, then u should be afraid of sitting in a car or using computer and basically living in high rise HDB because the theories for building these things is not tested, not proven and may very well be wrong. Thankfully the devices r based on sound theories tat were tested, never found to be false and can be reproduce in other areas and as such science can produce the many equipment we see today. If they r not based on "facts" then why do these things works ?<br><br></div>
