However, one that still deeply troubled mankind is the their very own existence. Difference in belief can divide the world apart.<br><br>In heated discussions, many believers of God had problem in holding onto their believes, while many anti-god fellowers started to believe in the theory of the Creator. However, after all those arguements and insults fired across the table, how does it help?<br><br>We conduct discussions not to find the ultimate answer, but to understand more on an subject. At the very end of the day, ask yourself. Does it really matter who or what our creator is, or whether or not there is a creator? Will finding out the true answer help us being a better person? Or would it be better to think about how you yourself can be your own creator, and therefore take responsibility in your own life and spent time on things of a greater worth than wars in forum.</div>
