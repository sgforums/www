If God is indeed the creator of all living things, then all things here should submit to His power unquestioningly.  Like the vessels produced by a potter, they should remain without any individuality of their own. If that is so, how can there be an opportunity for any one to practice virtue?<br><br>2. If this world is indeed created by God, then there should be no sorrow or calamity or evil in this world, for all deeds, both pure and impure, must come from Him.<br><br>3. If it is not so, then there must be some other cause besides God which is behind Him, in which case He would not be self-existent.<br><br>4. It is not convincing that the Absolute has created us, because that which is absolute cannot be a cause. All things here arise from different causes. Then can we can say that the Absolute is the cause of all things alike? If the Absolute is pervading them, then certainly It is not their creator.<br><br>5. If we consider the Self as the maker, why did it not make things pleasant? Why and how should it create so much sorrow and suffering for itself?<br><br>6. It is neither God nor the self nor some causeless chance which creates us. It is our our deeds which produce both good and bad results according to the law of causation.<br><br>7. We should therefore "abandon the heresy of worshipping God and of praying to him. We should stops all speculation and vain talk about such matters and practice good so that good may result from our good deeds.<br></blockquote></div>

We won't truely know who the Creator or none unless we die and return to the state of origin if there is one.The thing is, if we return to the state of origin, would we even know that? Same like when we come from an origin, we wouldn't know that too. But if we are not suppose to know whether we came from an origin or not, why am i typing this? Of course, these are just theories and intelligent guesses.</div></blockquote>No need to explain why you type... we are all typing if you didn't notice...<br><br>If you say that you don't know and even if you die you might not know, can you live with that? many cannot and they have a "God shape hole in their heart." Do you?</div>
