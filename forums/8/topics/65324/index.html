            <div class='col-md body'>Nalgene bottles may ooze chemicals<br><br>by Drew Swayne<br>December 04, 2003<br><br>Every day, thousands of students fill Western's campus, many of whom carry colorful Nalgene bottles. Students assume these bottles are safe, but a recent study involving plastic lab cages may prove otherwise.<br><br>According to a study by Patricia Hunt, a geneticist at Case Western Reserve University, bisphenol-A, a chemical found in polycarbonate lab cages and polycarbonate Nalgene bottles, increases chromosomal abnormalities. The abonormalities can cause miscarriages and birth defects.<br><br>BPA, a building block of epoxy resins (adhesives) and polycarbonate plastics, is a chemical that mimics the hormone estrogen, which also may leach into water or other liquids from Nalgene bottles.<br><br>Steven Dillman, interim chairman of the engineering technology department, said this study should be approached with skepticism.<br><br>"There is very little BPA in the polycarbonate (used in Nalgene bottles)," Dillman said. "The amounts of residual BPA are very, very small."<br><br>Dillman said if any effect on a user were present, it would be a small one.<br><br>"I wouldn't be concerned unless this effect is really demonstrated (through further testing)," Dillman said. "It seems unlikely to me that this would (cause) a big effect."<br><br>Dillman said the amount of BPA humans ingest from Nalgene bottles or other polycarbonate products is tiny compared to the amounts of estrogen humans ingest from eating animal products.<br><br>"(Hunt's study) observed this problem when they washed the polycarbonate with a harsh detergent," Dillman said. "It is an issue if you are doing biological experiments, but I don't think it's an issue for consumers."<br><br>Dr. Emily Gibson, the Student Health Center medical director, said high amounts of estrogen cause many symptoms, including premature development in young girls and breast development and feminization in young boys.<br><br>It also interrupts normal menstrual cycles in women and damages fetuses. She said these symptoms require significant doses of estrogen.<br><br>Nunc International, the producer of Nalgene bottles, denies any side effects would be caused from BPA leaching from the polycarbonate bottles, according to its Web site.<br><br>Spencer Anthony-Cahill, Western assistant professor of chemistry, said BPA would mimic estrogen by binding to receptors inside cells, resulting in the synthesis of proteins that do not normally occur without estrogen.<br><br>"As long as it fits the receptors, the body considers it estrogen," Gibson said.<br><br>Although the body responds to the BPA as if it were estrogen, the risk of side effects is low, according to the Nunc International Web site.<br><br>"Government agencies worldwide have spent over four decades researching the effects of BPA and have found that BPA in plastic does not pose a (high) risk to consumers or to the environment," according to the Web site.<br><br>Bellingham REI supervisor John Smith said the polycarbonate Nalgene bottles are some of the most popular items at the store.<br><br>He said people tend to choose the polycarbonate Nalgene bottle instead of other plastic Nalgene bottles because they are more durable.<br><br>Smith said he also uses the polycarbonate Nalgene bottles, but he is not worried about any adverse health effects.<br><br>"I haven't noticed any funky growth on me," Smith said.<br><br><a href="http://www.westernfrontonline.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/12/04/3fd0ebfa56783" rel="nofollow">http://www.westernfrontonline.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/12/04/3fd0ebfa56783</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Concern Raised About Health Hazards of Lexan<br>The Outdoor Network - January 7, 2004<br><br>COLORED WATER BOTTLES AND DISHWARE COULD BE LEACHING HARMFUL CHEMICALS<br><br>By Ethan Decker, Editor-in-Chief<br><br>The November/December issue of Sierra Magazine suggests that the popular, brightly colored drinking bottles made of GEÂ’s Lexan could be leaching harmful chemicals that damage human reproductive systems.<br><br>Concern about the health effects of estrogen-mimicking chemicals in plastics has been raised for years, but a recent study on mice suggests the chemicals may be more harmful than we think.<br><br>The core finding of the study, conducted by a team led by Patricia Hunt, an associate professor of genetics at Case Western Reserve University, is that exposure to high doses of bisphenol A (BPA) produced a spike in chromosomal abnormalities in the eggs of female mice.<br><br>BPA is an estrogen-mimicking compound commonly used in polycarbonate plastics such as clear plastic baby bottles, food and drink containers, metal food and drink can liners, dental sealants, compact discs, motorcycle helmets, appliance parts, and most famously, colored Lexan Nalgene bottles.<br><br>Hunt told the Outdoor Network that the cages and bottles used in the experiments were made of Lexan polycarbonate. Leaching of BPA from the material was greatly accelerated by cleaning it with a harsh, alkaline detergent.<br><br>The studyÂ’s authors say that this research provides an Â“unequivocal linkÂ” between environmental exposure to BPA and chromosomal abnormalities in mammal eggs. Scrutiny of the original research paper shows conclusive evidence of this link.<br><br>Such chromosomal abnormalities in human eggs are the leading cause of miscarriage, mental retardation, and congenital defects like Down's syndrome. In mice, they result in miscarriage via fetal reabsorption in the womb.<br><br>Hunt et al. then speculate that humans using similar polycarbonates might be at increased risk for such problems. Rather than recommend that BPA be banned from human use, though, they call for more research.<br><br>Â“Clearly, the possibility that BPA exposure increases the likelihood of genetically abnormal offspring is too serious to be dismissed without extensive further study,Â” they write.<br><br>In a statement on its website (and echoed by the plastics industry), Nalgene dismisses HuntÂ’s concerns, citing research and policy that support the safety of BPA. Â“Nalgene is confident in offering the most versatile, reusable, environmentally friendly bottle available,Â” the site says.<br><br>Governmental bodies are moving at different speeds. The European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food recently lowered its Tolerable Daily Intake for BPA five-fold.<br><br>The Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) does not intend to further restrict the use of BPA, reports Chemical &amp; Engineering News. George H. Pauli, FDA associate director for science and policy in the Office of Food Additives &amp; Safety, said, Â“We're continually evaluating BPA. It has been in the news for years because of its endocrine effect.Â”<br><br>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) conducted a review of the various and confusing low-dose BPA studies. They found that several Â“provide credible evidence for low-dose effects of bisphenol A.Â” However, a specific low-dose effect on human reproductive health Â“has not been conclusively established as a general or reproducible finding.Â”<br><br>There are several important steps in the chain of logic that must be rigorously tested to determine whether #7 plastics like Lexan, which are common in the outdoor industry, are hazardous to human health. The biggest questions are, do food-grade polycarbonates commonly leach BPA at high rates, and can the human body eliminate BPA sufficiently at those common exposures to avoid the harmful effects?<br><br>Until the jury is in, there are some precautions you can take in case BPA leaching from Lexan does pose a health threat:<br><br>&gt; Women planning to get pregnant, who are pregnant, or who are nursing; newborns; and young children may be most vulnerable, and consequently may want to be more careful.<br><br>&gt; Use bottles and dishware made of other materials. Glass and stainless steel, for example, are generally inert materials, though heavier and harder to use in the backcountry. #2 HDPE, #4 LDPE, and #5 PP also are apparently safe materials for reusable dishware. (The white, softer plastic Nalgene bottles are HDPE and LDPE.)<br><br>&gt; Use mild, pH-neutral soap to clean your Lexan. Since most automatic dishwasher detergents are mildly alkali (Cascade has a pH of 10.6, for instance), only hand-wash your Lexan dishware. And donÂ’t use strongly-alkali detergents (Undiluted, Ammonia has a pH of 11, chlorine bleach is about 12, and Comet is 13).<br><br>You can read the full research paper at http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Plasticizers/BPA-Mouse1apr03.htm<br><br>Contact the editor at editor@outdoornetwork.com or 303-444-7117 x 108.<br><br>Copyright Â© 2003 The Outdoor Network</div>
