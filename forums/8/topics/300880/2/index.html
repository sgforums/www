            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS. I suppose you're around 18/19 of age and have just completed your JC life? I'm not from NUS med, but I was from the trip-science fac of a certain JC that recently moved to Bishan, so I have lots of friends in med. from what I hear:<br><br>1) So the rumour goes. They split the candidates into 4 levels according to grades, or whatever other indicators. The top-tier candidates are accepted; the second tier ones are NOT accepted so that other industries and the scholarship boards have some pple to choose from; the third tier candidates are accepted; and the bottom they keep for appeal or reject. This is why we had lots of rather good students who failed to get into NUS med - they were the second tier ones. And mind you, we're easily talking about 4As for the 3rd tier candidates even, so there're actually quite a few things out of your control here.<br><br>2) Since you're a foreign student, you will not need to do NS. Write to all the hospitals in Singapore and intern there. Get a good recommendation letter etc etc. This few months will give u the edge over the other candidates.<br><br>3) For essays, interviews, etc. Just do your best. I've got quite a few friends who don't seem to be that great at interviews either but they still got through.<br><br>4) Most important point. At age 18 or 19, you do not have any idea of what you want to do in the future. Believe me. None of us believed other pple when they told us that when when we were in your shoes. Not getting into Med does not mean the end of everything. I've seen lots of cases like this. Pple move on and end up in meaningful courses and careers even when they didn't get their 1st choice.<br><br>Yup all the best!</div>

A star offers medicine scholarship as well but its extremely limited.<br><br>And the cost for overseas medicine isn't really that high.

However, I have other things working against me: I'm a foreigner, so some quota applies to me, and I don't exactly have a wonderful track record when it comes to interviews. I'm really worried that I might not get accepted into medical school because I don't seem to have a genuine interest in other fields.<br><br>My biggest anxiety now is that I might not succeed in my career next time if I don't become a doctor. My passion lies solely in medicine; many things have inspired me to pursue that path and I want my dreams to come true, or I'll probably regret forever.<br><br>Does anyone here have any advice for an aspiring medical student?</div></blockquote>I thought you only like kungfu and filming your "stunts''?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You can be a stuntman for movies!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey btw, if you're interested, there's a charity musical by NUS medical fac at UCC tonight. Its talks about their lives as a medical student and stuff. Watched it last night. It's really quite good <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Posting it on behalf of a friend.<br><br>The musical aims to generate greater awareness of and support for the problems faced by needy medical students. The comparatively higher costs of a medical education, compared with other degrees, impose greater strain on this significant group of students. In response, the University and School have initiated more Bursaries for these students in need. We are also heartened to note that the Singapore Medical Association and the medical student body has thrown their weight behind this effort and galvanised support for its own members.<br><br>Ticket Categories<br><br>Student: $30 per ticket<br><br>Adult: $50, $80, $100 ($250 for the Gala performance on 5th January with pre-show reception)<br><br>All ticket adult ticket-sales will also receive double tax exemption receipts (please provide your name, NRIC, and mailing address)<br><br>There will be one more show tonight at University Cultural Centre NUS. So do go and catch it tonight if you are interested.<br><br><img src="http://inlinethumb43.webshots.com/37930/2869895850102059215S600x600Q85.jpg"></div>
