By the time of the interview, at least they have some relevant experience in the field.<br><br>But don't get too disheartened if you don't get in.. I have friends taking medicine from famous universities in Austraila. There they have only 1 exam at the end of the year and its MCQ.. The NUS medicine examination system is MUCH more hectic.

You get to practise medicine as well after you graduate.

I have had access to Uni Melbourne's previous med fac papers as well as USyd's  and they sure as heck don't look like MCQs to me.<br><br>They have alot of assessments.<br><br>Which university are your friends in?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey RETARDED_MORON( I feel weird typing that),<br><br>I went for a medicine interview at Monash university, melbourne last July. (Applicants for Australian medicine entry will have to take an aptitude test first, something like an IQ test, the top cohort will be selected for an interview). Just a little background about myself, I went to Australia for tertiary studies after my 2 years stint in NS last year. I was fortunate to pass it but the offer given to me was conditional depending on my grades( which I studied in Australia)<br><br>Just a few tips for the interview:<br><br>1. Its very important to be yourself. Do not try to put on a different personality just to impress the judges. They can see through you.<br><br>2. Be consistent with your answers. You should not add in experiences or stories which are untrue, because all the questions posed might indirectly lead back to  the very first question. Hence, if your answers seems inconsistent with what what you said earlier, then you are in hot soup.<br><br>3. Always put on a simile( this I'm not sure with NUS, but it worked for me) throughout the interview. It makes you look more friendly and warm. Fortunately for me, my interviewers were very nice people.<br><br>4. Since at least 1 of the interviewers is a medical doctor, it always helps to read up on medical news. Remember, what they are looking for in a potential doctor is to be able to keep updated on new developments in the medical field.<br><br>5. Lastly, motivation, leadership, maturity and flexibility are characteristics of a doctor they are looking for. You should try to emphasize these points and demostrate that you possess such qualities in your secondary, JC  or high school.<br><br>Hope this helps with your interview. My aim of writing this is to allow you to understand what the interviewers are looking out for. I hope that this knowledge would calm you down a little prior to your interview and I wish in all the best in your interview.</div>

              <p>RETARDED_MORON, I think what you can do is to sell your strong points, i think one of your strongest points is your self-confidence, and doctors must have a lot of that - the ability to make spilt-second decisions etc. Harp on this!</p>
              <p>Also, it's good to back it up with examples! Here's one: Sell to NUS Med Fac about your reptuation as a cocky, arrogant bastard who sneers at people who do lousier than you in their results (yes, i am from your JC, and have seen some of your posts last year being totally dismissive of Throughtrain students who do worse than you). Print out some of your forum posts as supporting evidence for NUS, and I am sure they will admit you, man, if your self-confidence is literally oozing out of every pore of your body</p>
              <p>Warmest Regards, and hope you are successful with your application</p>
