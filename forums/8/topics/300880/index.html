There is an incredible feeling of fulfillment associated with the improvement of the quality of life that makes me very interested in medicine. I also see medicine as a calling; to undertake the noble responsibility of revitalising my fellow human beings with the power and knowledge I hope to gain by attending medical school.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Eh, really pays to boost up ur CV a little. get involved in some medical volunteer work. Go volunteer your service at a local hospital or something. A friend of mine went for the interview and was told by the interviewer during the interview she was too slack.<br><br>During the months after A levels, most of the them would get be involved in some form of internship. By the time of the interview, at least they have some relevant experience in the field.<br><br>But don't get too disheartened if you don't get in.. I have friends taking medicine from famous universities in Austraila. There they have only 1 exam at the end of the year and its MCQ.. The NUS medicine examination system is MUCH more hectic. Exams every month and they aren't usually MCQ.<br><br>So if you have the financial capabilities to study abroad, do consider alternative places lah. You get to practise medicine as well after you graduate. Its really 5 years of hell if you do it in Singapore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey yo fellow batch mate!<br><br>Want to study in NUS medicine? Please do take note the following points:<br><br>1) Your application essay must be well written<br><br>2) Your grades must be good enough for their requirements. This point I am quite sure you are qualified. Chemistry grades is important too. Since you are constantly top 20 in chemistry in the level + chem olympiad gold, this should be no problem too. Bio would be a good bonus and you take it too, so pass (Do not take their words that Bio is not necessary. It is not necessary but it is certainly a BIG factor)<br><br>3) You must give them what they want during the medicine interview. Being brutally honest is not going pay. Everyone loves sweet talks eh? It helps too if you have some relatives who are possibly on the panel or know people on the panel (i heard there's this guy from hci whose father and uncle is possibly on the interview panel). Yea connections do help. It sux but it's the reality out there.<br><br>4) Do some internships in medical boards like NUH, SGH etc etc. Get the idea?<br><br>And the rest is really a function of the position of the stars, the moon, the sun, the planets and your luck.<br><br>These are just what my seniors told me. Anyway do consider that a good 4 to 5 years is spent studying medicine in NUS. By the time you finish your housemanship of around 2 years, your peers in other courses may already be higher on the wage ladder. If you want to be a surgeon, you are looking at your 30th birthday before you can start to work as a doctor properly.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by angel7030:</div><div class="quote_body">You want to take aspiring pills? U need to go JB or other countries, i think singapore govt banned aspiring here.<br><br>There was a time when peoples took aspiring here and was admitted straight into NUH, maybe u can try, it not difficult, just swallow a few pills will do. </div></blockquote>Really. If you do not talk, no one will say that you are dumb.<br><br>BTW, it's aspirin, not aspiring. Aspiring is a continuous form of the word aspire.<br><br>OMG you are truly more retarded than the TS here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
