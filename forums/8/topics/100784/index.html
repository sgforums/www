            <div class='col-md body'>This is what I think of the Gahment sending Armed Police to Patrol the Heartlands<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Stupid </strong></span><br><br><a href="http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/sub/topstories/story/0,5562,282654,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/sub/topstories/story/0,5562,282654,00.html?</a><br><br>What's the point? At best it's gonna give locals a false sense of security(as if we dun have enough of that already). At worst it's gonna scare off the tourists. I dun know about u, but if I start seeing Armed Guards when I'm on tour, something is very wrong with the place.<br><br>Sending Policemen armed with submachine guns isn't going to stop anything. Last I've heard, Bomb &gt; Guns. Here's what I mean<br><br>Gahment's Ideal Scenerio: I see armed guards carrying cool looking submachine guns patrolling the streets. I got so scared I shit my pants and hands the bomb over to the police. Game Over.<br><br>But things dun always goes as we plan<br><br>Scenerio 1: Policemen tries to arrest me after they spotted the words "I have a bomb on me" written all over my face. Given the fact that the local policy is to talk first and shoot later, that'll give me time to detonate the bomb. Everyone is happy<br><br>Scenerio 2: Police finds me suspicious and tries to search me. I detonate the bomb anyway. Happy music plays in the background<br><br>Scenerio 3: Police suspects nothing and walks past. I detonate the bomb. Everyone rejoice<br><br>Scenerio 4: No police around. Bomb detonated. Advance to next stage<br><br>Seriously, it's not going to stop anything. Dun believe me, juz look at Iraq. They have far more Armed Guards with more powerful weapons patrolling the streets all day. I dun think I need to remind u of what is happening over there. The only time that submachine gun is going to prove useful to stopping terrorist is when some loony takes an AK and starts shooting everywhere. Not going to happen.<br><br>If u ask me, if they freaking have so much freaking time and extra manpower, they should jolly well try to stop that before they make it in here. Given the fact that a certain Mr Took(go read the news if u dun know who he is) managed to sneak out of the country after the police "detained his passport", we should really be worried.</div>
