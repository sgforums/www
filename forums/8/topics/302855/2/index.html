Its not like your mum cooking kangkong, and you shoot it? Thats a bit ridiculous.<br>It should be something more meaningful, like you did the cooking yourself for the first time yourself etc etc.<br>I posted pictures of lunch like Boon Tong Kee chicken rice with the chicken shining, my frens ask where was it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>02, wrong, some people DO have the patience to scroll and look at them, at least they know where is it etc. it depends how many pictures you list, 6-8, accetapble, but 10-20? no.</div>
