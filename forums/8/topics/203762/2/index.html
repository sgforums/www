Do you even know what features a PS3 has?<br><br>First of all, like Nitendo Wii, PS3 has motion sensor feature. Now in shooting game, you hold the controller like a gun. Instead of pushing analogs to move ur character, you just move around yourself and the character will follow. Same goes for all types of games.<br><br>All market experts and games developers says Microsoft will soon drop to the bottom of the list as in the years to come, developers will push the gaming industry to a new edge, and only making games for motion sensor consoles. Microsoft will end up gameless if they don't do something soon.<br><br>Some might argue that Microsoft can always come up with a plugin motion sensor controller, but its a technology that takes years. Nitendo took 10 years to perfect theirs. Hurried creations will only lead to lousy operating controllers. Also, if you are going to buy another motion sensor from Microsoft, total cost will be more than $1000.<br><br>Ok now. Anyone heard of blu-ray player? Well, that technology is no doubt going to replace DVD in years to come and buying one which might be available in Singapore next year cost well over $1000. Sony PS3 has a build-in Blu-ray drive to reward its customers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>There's a lot of misinformation in your post.<br><br>Motion sensors are nothing new.  Microsoft and some other companies came out with such a controller years back but it never took off.  There's nothing to indicate that motion sensor games are the future.<br><br>In any case, Wii's motion sensor and PS3's motion sensor are completely different in design and function, with Wii's being the more advanced and sophisticated one.  If at all, Wii will succeed and not PS3.<br><br>Market reports and game developers all say Sony will lose its dominance in the console gaming industry - primarily because of PS3's pricing which in turn is due to the blu-ray player.  That leads to the other point - blu-ray has already majorly lost the first round against HD-DVD in the next gen video format war.  Which means when you fork out &gt;$1,000 in November to buy PS3, you'll be spending that extra cash on a player that is inferior to the competition and might well phase out in years to come.<br><br>Xbox360 on the other hand has an established and reliable online gaming system.  And while it is one year behind PS3 in technology, gaming developer giant EA Sports has confirmed that the games for both 360 and PS3 that will be released at the end of this year will look alike.  Not surprising because a lot of techies have come out to say that the 360 architecture is more suited for gaming and graphics than the PS3.<br><br>So please get the facts right before deciding how you wish to spend your money.<br><br></div>

Though both works equally well, i must agree with you that Wii is better. Microsoft? Yes, they try to lead in every industry, but did you see how they screw up Windows?<br><br>Glad you did some research on giants like EA. But you didn't go deep enough. EA, according to their last report plan, was investing 80% of their capitals on motion-based games for 2007 2nd quarter.<br><br>Currently, Blu-ray lead the sales for players in Europe and States. This is due to the vast number of companies backing it and only 2 companies backing for HD-DVD. Buyers went for the obvious choice, thats the one with the most market influence.<br><br>Though all movie and game industries agreed to give both formats reproduction rights, many agreed that dued to the huge influence of Sony and Universal Pictures in movie industries, and Apple Computer for developers, sometimes they have no choice but to go for only 1 format.<br><br>Talk about Xbox online? Yes, Xbox has a successful online network in the States, where the service is cheap. How about Singapore? How much is a month's suscription? How many ppl went online with their Xbox and continued with it in Singapore?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I am bias towards Sony and Nitendo, of course. But everyone has their preference, and nobody is wrong. I do admit Xbox 360 has many advantages, but i do not agree that PS3 is totally worthless. I might make huge mistakes in my facts, as stated by Rexdriver, thus i would suggest anyone who is getting a new console to do some research yourself and came to your own conclusion. After all, it is your gaming experience that you are going to buy.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Generally, if you are rich, connect your constantly upgraded latest tech PC with multiple accessories to a LCD TV and you'll always have a superior gaming experience than any console gamers.<br><br>Xbox Live has been great for me so far with Xbox Live Arcade, demos, and various downloads.  The only reason I haven't gone Gold with Live is because I suck at competitive gaming.  But I'm still enjoying the Silver Live content for free.  We don't know anything about PS3 online yet, so no comments.<br><br>Xbox360 has wireless controllers...<br><br>Yes, PS had more Japanese RPGs.  In fact, its all about the games why most people choose one console over the other.  But Xbox360 is getting more of those Japanese games now, so we'll have to wait and see.  In the meantime, no Japanese RPG beats Oblivion imo, but that's just me.<br><br>My main objection to the PS3 is that Sony is forcefeeding the blu-ray on gamers when all gamers really want is a game console.  That's exploiting the PS fanbase imo.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PS3's got my vote.<br><br>Have been following PS since its PS1 days.. and looked back since. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Hell, I don't mind waiting for what I see as a superior console.<br><br>Besides being more aesthetically pleasing than Xbox360 on the outside, PS3's <strong>next-generation Blu-ray DVD compatibility</strong> and a <strong>graphics processing unit capable of pumping out pixels at the 1080p HD res level</strong> (goosebumps) is bound to give Microsoft a run for their money... Msoft's Xbox 360 has less impressive specs with its current-generation DVDs and max res of 1080i and 720p.<br><br>PS3 also has more complex polygon models than Xbox 360... The PS3 FPS "Killzone" (E3 demo) makes Half-Life 2 &amp; Quake 3 look like DOS abandonware games.. totally stunning.  The large Japanese game developers' preference for the console is no secret - <strong>big names like Final Fantasy XII, Metal Gear Solid 4 and Devil May Cry 4 are also to be released on PS3</strong>.<br><br><strong>Xbox 360 appears to be more versatile than PS3, but I can hardly see myself affected by it since those capabilities are taken care of by my trusty desktop PC</strong>... I'll be only be using the console for games.<br><br>One thing I have to gripe about PS3 is the goddamm controller.  Looks painful to hold for long periods, absolutely cannot imagine trying to marathon an RPG on it.  Perhaps the only other put-off would be the launch price tag.<br><br>My argument's pretty one-sided I guess.. and we won't really know which will be more successful ("better") till PS3 is launched.. so I suggest you go read up more balanced reviews and decide which console's best for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PS3 would be my preferred choice as I m more of a RGP fan than action. Furthermore XBox360 isn't that flawless at all. It has a problems with backward compatibility with XBox and the XBox live also isn't working well with some games. Some of the players complain that they r facing problems that the online games hang halfway when they r playing.<br>Although I couldn't guarantee that PS3 will be proceeding as peacefully after it is release since I heard that the production of it are done by 3 different manufacturing companies and if I m not wrong they r China manufacturing companies. But at least I have more faith in the game companies that r behind Sony rather than the ones behind Xbox360</div>
