            <div class='col-md body'>think about it, if the spacecraft is human, why would it come near WTC? where it can be seen by so many people in one of the busiest places on earth..If its a top secret military aircraft i dont think the US government would be so open to "advertise it"...or test it in a place like WTC<br><br>Obviosuly its evident that watever piloting the carft isnt human and it has a raging interest in the world's superpower , the US and WTC.something's wrong here...obviously those things want to find out what the heck with WTC...this means they know things about us..they know about US, WTC ect...<br><br>Or did they know beforehand 911 was coming?..all  can say is there are "politicians" out of this world<br><br>I wish to say it cant be a spy aircraft from Russia or wherever, obviously it would be destroyed before entering US air space.and further more where it can be seen by so many people like in WTC?..So its obvious that it came directly top from the sky into US airspace..<strong>which makes only one theory possible.

            <div class='col-md body'>Corner velocity<br><br>Corner velocity /also called corner speed or maneuvering speed/ is an important value for each aircraft. <strong>It is determined by plotting the structural limitations /in G forces/ against airspeed. The corner velocity is the minimum speed at which an aircraft can pull its maximum rated Gs. An aircraft at corner velocity attains maximum instantaneous turn performance.</strong><br><br>The corner velocity for the F-16A in a stock configuration is 450 knots. This means that at 450 knots the F-16 has its best turn performance. At speeds above the corner speed, turn performance drops off.<br><br>Corner speed also affects the minimum turn radius. The size of the turn radius of an aircraft depends on the speed it is traveling. A faster aircraft requires a larger circle to turn in than a slower one. However, the turn redius isn't only a function of speed. It also depends on the number of Gs a pilot pulls during the turn. An aircraft at a constant speed will make a relatively wide circle at 1 G but will turn in a very tight circle at 7 or 8 Gs. The corner velocity is the speed that gives the optimum balance between turn rate and turn radius.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>G forces<br><br><strong>You can't fly combat aircraft without considering G forces. G forces are the forces of acceleration that pull on you when you change your plane of motion</strong>. They are the forces that pilots encouter when engaged in high-speed dogfighting and BFM. There are both ppositive and negative G forces; both can be dangerous to a fighter ppilot. The force of gravity on Earth is used as a baseline for measuring these forces of acceleration.<br><br>The force of gravity when you sit, stand or lie down is considered 1 G. In normal activity, we rarely experience anything other than 1 G. But flying a combat aircraft such as the F-16 is not exactly normal. The F-16 is capable of pulling 9 Gs without even trying. But the effect of 9 Gs on your body will be significant. As you pull more Gs, your weight increases correspondingly. Your 10-pound head will weigh 90 pounds when you pull 9 Gs!<br><br><strong>If you continue to pull high Gs, the G force will push the blood in your body towards your feet and resist your heart's attempts to pump it back up to your brain</strong>. You will begin to get tunnel vision, then things will lose color and turn white, and finnaly everything will go black. You've just experienced the onset of Gravity Induced Loss of Consciousness /GLOC/.<br><br>So those points ive mentioned in bold, are aerodynamics and physics..<br>these are the physics of flight..<br><br>im puzzled on how did this 1 video challenged the physics which i believed in my entire life!!<br><br>This video should be fake..<br><br>1) Aliens couldn't have mastered G-Force..<br>2) That kind of braking in mid-air is unseen only in helicopters.. and yet it can brake in mid air like a helicopter and travel like a plane,  shoot towards the sky like a space craft<br>3) It has the speed of the fastest spacecraft ever built by humans..and yet as well as the most agile i have ever seen?</div>
