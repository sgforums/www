            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Xephone_xenon:</div><div class="quote_body">What's a Twit?<br><br>1) Superb typing skills. Twits have amazingly mastered their pathetic little brains to control their fingers to type with alternate caps. I'd suggest they stop doing that else their poor brain will explode soon.<br><br>2) Weird mentality. Somehow, twits tend to think very differently from most homo-sapiens. They call it CREATIVITY. They enjoying habouring ideas of creating pink dancing thongs as toys for toddlers so that Singapore's population would be flooded with them in future! They're just waiting for the right chance to launch into the market. But unfortunately, their ancestor's inheritance have been squandered by them lavishly.<br><br>3) Spastic sense of answering questions. Each time they're engaged in a topic, twits have a fetish to make irrelevant comments such as "dogs lyk euie all r sho disobedient, stp tis nonsence!" when we were simply discussing about the importance of English.<br><br>By the way, if I'm a dog, I'll be busy screwing a bitch.<br>And if I were to find one, that'll be you, Ms Anonymous.<br>On second thought, I would not risk myself into getting Gonorrhea that your mom has passed to you when she screwed your greatgrandfather.<br><br>4) Attention grabbers. Twits love attention. And that's what we're here for. Twits would resort to any methods just to get attention, such as using their ever whiney voice to scream at an ant 10 metres away.<br><br>5) Horrible language. A very prominent factor of a twit. You will never spot them without lehs, lors and lahs in their sentences. Most of the time its incomprehensible. Thanks to the fact that we proper homo-sapiens have the ability to analyse and digest infomation, we've cleverly outwitted them. That is, WE are able to understand what they say; but their mutilated brains are unable to understand our language.<br><br>forget it, euie tis kinda of ppl r hard to interact wif,dunnit to use cheem english to de miie , i noe i`m nt good inenglish ...<br><br>The wonder of Languages.<br>English with Chinese would be "wo men ish..."<br>English with Hokkien would be "they ji siao me lor"<br>English with Malay would be "my boifren lagi yandao"<br><br>6) Contradiction. Twits are always contradicting with their own words and actions.<br>From Ms Anonymous "euie tink i gif a darm to wad euie all toking abt? stp ur nonsence!"<br><br>If she doesn't give a DARM (from what I concluded to be DAMN) to what we've posted, she wouldn't be posting like a mad spastic in our board. She wouldn't even have spent time reading and conclude to herself that it is nonsence (yes its nonsense, she can't spell)<br><br>7) No mind of their own.<br><br>Quoted from Ms Dot<br>23:08:31pm "stop it la cb..you all want then talk about cindy tt slut..don't say others la.."<br>23:11:50pm "i don't like cindy want..that is why i'm here.."<br>23:19:09pm "i think it is you people who are wasting time instead of the anonymous lo.. stop all your rubbish la.. you will get your retribution want lo.."<br>23:28:43pm "i just find it unreasonabe because anonymous is an innocent party yet you peeps are quarrelin with her.. i don't mind you talkin about others in the blog because that is what your blog is for.."<br>23:26:35pm "fuck off la you peeps..acts mature but infact you peeps are not at all.."<br><br>The only adjective I can think of to describe this, IRONIC. Twits can't fucking make up their minds to stick to a point.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Annoying.
