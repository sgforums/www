Similarly He made the world with moral/spiritual laws as well, such as that the disobedience of which will prove eternally costly. Therefore, let the God who so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, heal your hurts in the way that He knows best. While it may not be in your ways, trust that He who made you and I, knows the best way, His way.
