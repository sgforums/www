According to World health organisation (WHO) report here: <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/sing.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/sing.pdf</a><br><br>Singapore has around 400 suicides in 2003 10.1 per 100,000<br><br>How many of those gets reported?<br><br>Furthermore, those cases on board the cruise ship are technically in Indonesia and there is no evidence that they commit suicide, just that they have disappeared into thin air.<br><br>The tangkee suggestion is impossible because all the passengers have to hand over the passports to the ship management when they go on board. When they go back, the ship gives them back their passports. Those that they do not take back their passports... it is a ship... where can they be other than jumped overboard?</div>

The ship might be in Indonesian waters but gambling is illegal in Indonesia so everyone simply pretends that it is in International waters. There are also no evidence of death or suicide. Unless the body surface somewhere and those that discover it launch an investigation.<br><br>If the ship choose to keep quiet about it (bad publicity) no one will be any the wiser and he/she gets into the unsolved missing persons list.<br><br>I don't know what the international shipping law is with regards to cases like these, where the ship passenger simply disappears.

The clincher might be the opening of the casino because the casino is like the crack cocaine of drugs... highly addictive.<br><br>Just make sure that you do not give him or lend him any money whatever the reason he gives because you can never trust a gambler. (Never ever trust your in-laws with money no matter what reasons they give.)<br><br>Make sure you ask him to give you the money for the wedding now and save it beyond his reach like a joint account requiring two names to make withdrawals, if you intend to marry.<br><br>After you are married, make sure you get him to pay for the household expenses.<br><br>Never ever allow him to use your name to borrow money other than for housing or car. Never ever let him use your name to borrow CASH and credit cards.<br><br><strong>Of course after he pays for the household expenses, whatever he does with his money, even if it is for gambling, is his own business.</strong><br><br>If you can do that, then your chance of getting married to him is higher and being married till old is better. If you think, "trust the one you intend to marry or marry someone else is bullsh*t." You need to make every marriage work; it does not go on automatic.<br><br>Give him money and you will be doomed and your marriage doomed if he uses it for gambling. In gambling winning is useless because it is always only temporary. Gamblers also always lie and say that they are winning or have won even when they have lost and are losing badly.<br><br>So think of this as saving your marriage.</div>
