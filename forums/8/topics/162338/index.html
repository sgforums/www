            <div class='col-md body'>seems to me that guy's can never be on time. all 3 times that i was suppose to meet up with guys, they were VERY late.<br><br>but i still waited for them anyway...got pissed at the 3rd guy though.<br><br>first guy (ex classmate; homosexual): he tells me to meet him at 6pm, and at 5:30pm he tells me hes having dinner at his friend's house, so he said to meet at 7:30 instead. since i was out, there was no point going home...just walked around J8 window shopping.<br><br>at 7:15, he calls me up and tells me to meet him at bugis MRT. sighh...stupid guy. we finally met at 7:45.<br><br>second guy (female to male trans): wants to meet up with me. we planned to meet at somerset MRT at 6pm, but when i reach he tells me hes still on the way, tells me to walk to cineleisure. 6:30, call him up again, he tells me hes caught in a jam and that he'll take at least 20 more minutes. so...i just hung about the game shop looking at the games. at 7pm, i SMSed him again, and he tells me hes still in the jam and that hes really sorry...arrgh. finally met him at 7:10pm.<br><br>third guy (male to female trans, but still living as a guy, and requested to be refered to as a guy): he asked me some time ago if i could come to watch him perform on the 26th of december, as his church was putting up a performance at MGS. on that day, i specifically asked him 'what time do i need to be there', and he replies me 'erm, be there by 5:30".<br><br>i didnt really want to be late, so i left orchard (i was out with my friend earlier) at about 4pm, since my friend told me it'll take about an hour to get to bukit timah road. it took much shorter than that though, and i arrived at 4:55, but i thought there was no harm being early.<br><br>how wrong i was...that stupid play started at 7pm, and i had to wait outside for 2 damn hours. (although i'll only hold him accountable for 1Â½ hours) still was bloody pissed though, and i almost wanted to leave.<br><br>i left the play immedietly after, and SMSed him asking him why he asked me to come 1Â½ hours before the play. you know what he replies me? he says 'oh i ment registeration starts at 5:30', when he clearly told me to 'be there by 5:30'.<br><br>dumb bastards...and they werent even that close to me either. still wondering how i could wait that long...guess i'm just not hot tempered enough to storm off...</div>
