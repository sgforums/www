Maybe now she got dumped by the person whom she left u for and haven found someone better , but i bet if she found sure dump you . &lt;--- no offense<br>Never be so soft hearted just because she come back to you.Maybe she feel lonely alone(got dumped by bf) or whatever reason.<br><br>It's better to forget her as it already in the past.<br><br>PS:Love is blind , but your eyes is not so look and think twice before making such decision or else you might be hurt again.</div>
