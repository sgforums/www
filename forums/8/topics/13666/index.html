(i shall assume you're not so ignorant.)  during each passing out parade, they invite the major religions down to pray for them. catholics, buddhist, taoists, christians, muslims, hindus, jews... they have their own representatives to pray for them. for the whole group.  what, may i ask, did you do when you see this? walk away from the well-wishes of other people? i shall assume you're not so rude. if i am a non-believer, and i say god bless you... will you spit on me? despite that my intentions are good?<br><br>think then. IF... (just picture in your mind since you've such a vivid mind) IF one day jesus does meet up with... say buddha. or had they met up once upon a time... just think, what will he say? "you loser..."? "you liar"? "you fake"? honestly, i think not. cos i believe jesus knew more humility than you did. and what will he say if one of his follower's misunderstood him? accuse him of being disloyal? NO! he'd sit them down and explain softly, slowly, and kindly... not like how you're treating your own brothers who tries to discuss with you the bible's teachings...</div>

(i shall assume you're not so ignorant.)  during each passing out parade, they invite the major religions down to pray for them. catholics, buddhist, taoists, christians, muslims, hindus, jews... they have their own representatives to pray for them. for the whole group.  what, may i ask, did you do when you see this? walk away from the well-wishes of other people? i shall assume you're not so rude. if i am a non-believer, and i say god bless you... will you spit on me? despite that my intentions are good?<br><br>think then. IF... (just picture in your mind since you've such a vivid mind) IF one day jesus does meet up with... say buddha. or had they met up once upon a time... just think, what will he say? "you loser..."? "you liar"? "you fake"? honestly, i think not. cos i believe jesus knew more humility than you did. and what will he say if one of his follower's misunderstood him? accuse him of being disloyal? NO! he'd sit them down and explain softly, slowly, and kindly... not like how you're treating your own brothers who tries to discuss with you the bible's teachings... </div></blockquote>number one, i never said i was holier than u.<br>number two, i dont know which army u are talking abt, but it sure isnt the army that i went thru.</div>

Note the time the posts and replies only one minute apart? This fella is an egomaniac and wants attention lah. This is already giving him benefit of doubt.<br><br>I am already wondering why he is doing all this to make people detest our faith. He has a hidden agenda. A sinister motive to drive people away from God.<br><br>Wondered why he kept repeating that is the way Elijah, John the baptist, Amos preached. Those were prophets before Christ's salvation. Those were the days where works only counts.
