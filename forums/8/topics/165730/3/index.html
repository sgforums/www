            <div class='col-md body'>There are pros and cons being a commando.<br>During my NS time got few friends kenna commando. Some drop out. Some got injuried. One of them injuried the shoulder and now very easily dislocated. Another injuried the knee. Went for oeration also no use. Forever walking with pain, not to mention jogging or running. Both of them injuried themselve at the age of 21. One of them pass out as commando and can find work more easier. Commando will have a slight advantage in job interviews. Employers think that they have more discipline and more focus in doing work.</div>
