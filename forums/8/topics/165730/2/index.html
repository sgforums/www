Same IPPT, SOC, route march etc ... the terrain and elements never changes so the training too will never change, If your training is soft then I'll be really worried.<br><br>Our time there's not much welfare but those who went before us will say we are lucky just like today there is so much welfare we say you are lucky. But lucky or not the training is still tough and everybody needs to go thru.<br><br>Frankly from the way you post you are trying to bait, you dun seem to be someone in combat NSF, combat NSF people not so haolian or maybe you 8-5 clerk behind your aircon desk trying to talk big.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Signing on is always a major topic one.<br>My family is not against the idea of me signing on but you see i have this bunch of relatives who are so against and all they do is to dissuade me signing on and physco my parents to stop me from signing on. I don't really like them because they keep making noise here and there ! They don't want me to go commandos<br>Kindda sad to hear from some of them.All they say is signing on will ruin your future and they keep saying they don't want me to get injured and if i do i deserve it.They don't say it out but they hint. They even say red beret is for show nothing at all.I have this uncle and cousin who kept saying i will definitely cry in the camp. Cry? Why did they think so lowly of me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>Luckily i have another uncle who is supportive of me and even encourage me to prove them wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  But afterall this is still my life right? Why did they try to interfere?</div>
