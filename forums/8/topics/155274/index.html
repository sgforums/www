Dozens of police - some in riot gear - surrounded them, ordering them to leave or face arrest.<br><br>Police said they were acting on a complaint from a member of the public that the protesters were causing a nuisance. All four complied with the police request.<br><br>"We have the right to hold peaceful protests," said Yap Keng Ho, one of the three protesters who filed the suit. "Both the police and protesters have to be guided by the court, so we want the court to tell us how to do peaceful protests without being dispersed by the police."<br><br>Yap said they were also filing the lawsuit because they planned to hold more protests in the future, but declined to elaborate. The case will be heard Oct. 21.<br><br>Though Singaporeans are guaranteed rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly under the constitution, public dissent is extremely rare in the city-state, where outdoor gatherings of five or more people require police permits.<br><br>Police have repeatedly refused to issue such permits, citing potential "law and order problems."<br><br>The group claim police had not properly investigated the situation to determine if the four protesters had caused any inconvenience before moving to disperse them. They also demanded that police return T-shirts and placards which were seized from them.<br><br>Officials from the Home Affairs Ministry, which oversees the city-state''s police force, could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.</div>
