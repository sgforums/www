              <div id="post_message_543298" class="vb_postbit">Recently, the "no maids allowed in condominium pools" policy has come under fire again. <br><br>On The Straits Times forum last week, Ms Sabrina Chang posted her question on why our condominiums openly discriminate others because of their job and nationalities. She also stated that her children are less than five years-old and cannot play at the pool without supervision of her maid when her husband and her are not around.<br><br>But Mr Francis Zhan, the chief executive of the Association of Management Corporations in Singapore (AMCIS), begs to differ. He says that the rule has been around for about 20 years, and the rationale is that "maids are here to work and not to enjoy themselves", and "if we allow al lthe maids to swim in the pools at the various condos, it will be swarmped and over-utilised." <br><br>A poll of 100 condo residents was done by The New Paper and it revealed that 63% of the residents felt that that policy was unfair.<br><br>What are your thoughts?</div>

              <p>if the maid can swim in the pool. Then they will be ask to bring the children to the pool by themselves. If the children get drown, it becomes the maid's problem for not looking after the children. If I am a maid, I will not want to take more responsibility. </p>

              <p><br>i agree... its sad we treat maids this way...</p>
              <p>maids usually no breaks or holidays, paid peanuts, get abused, get look down in lucky plaza, cannot have babies, now cannot swim.. i didnt know abt this rule..</p>
              <p>no wonder many maids like working elsewhere except SG</p>

              <p>Hey...dont say condo security guards should not swim....this is mistreatment and is treating them like slaves....</p>
              <p>Or how about golf course attendants.....</p>
              <p>Can they play golf there ?</p>
              <p>Dont say those attendants cannot play golf.....this is mistreatment, discrimination, and is similar to slave treatment.</p>

              <p>But they stay as workers.</p>
              <p>Some workers stay overnight.</p>
              <p>They should be respected as workers and as employees.</p>
              <p>Anyways,</p>
              <p>I believe the original writer wanted the maid to look after her kids.</p>
              <p>But I believe the maid can look after the kid from the pool-side.</p>
              <p>No need to enter.</p>
              <p>Anyways,</p>
              <p>Even if she enters, actually it is Ok for me. Because it is part of work.</p>
              <p>But the angle from Straits Times and from some readers or comments have widened the issue.</p>
              <p>It become discrimination issue.</p>

              <p>thats why there has been discussions on having life guards at condominiums...</p>

              <p>the quarrels to have or not to have maids will only end up with a great divide in opinions...and legal suits on possible deaths and injury without supervision and pools misused by maids...</p>

              <p>Sooner or later, we will become the maids and gardeners and they will become condo owners, and we will have to beg them even for a slice of bread.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"></p>
