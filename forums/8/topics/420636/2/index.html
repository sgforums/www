              <p>Huh ?</p>
              <p>What does this have to do with the Western world ?</p>
              <p>How is it relevant ?</p>
              <p>And why are you so concerned of getting approval from the Western world ?</p>
              <p>Anyways what you said about people's snobbishness is very offensive.</p>
              <p>I believe it is you and the people like you who are being snobbish.</p>
              <p>You are the ones who assume the mantle of elite equality snobs, and you look down on regular people with common sense as lower than you.</p>
              <p>So when some people just go about their daily normal lives and apply common sense to their surroundings, some elite snobs like you would pop out and stick your noses, because you think they do not conform to the ideals which would gain approval from "the Western world" - whatever that means.</p>
              <p>That is why I stood up and will continue to stand up against this lynching.</p>
              <p>People like you are sickening.</p>
              <p>You degrade and dehumanize the maids, and you also degrade and dehumanize the condo management people.</p>

              <div>Recently, the "no maids allowed in condominium pools" policy has come under fire again.<br><br>On The Straits Times forum last week, Ms Sabrina Chang posted her question on why our condominiums openly discriminate others because of their job and nationalities. She also stated that her children are less than five years-old and cannot play at the pool without supervision of her maid when her husband and her are not around.<br><br>But Mr Francis Zhan, the chief executive of the Association of Management Corporations in Singapore (AMCIS), begs to differ. He says that the rule has been around for about 20 years, and the rationale is that "maids are here to work and not to enjoy themselves", and "if we allow al lthe maids to swim in the pools at the various condos, it will be swarmped and over-utilised."<br><br>A poll of 100 condo residents was done by The New Paper and it revealed that 63% of the residents felt that that policy was unfair.<br><br>What are your thoughts?</div>
