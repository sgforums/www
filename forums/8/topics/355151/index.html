              <p><br>I think you'd deliberately phrased it wrongly. We don't 'pray to the dead'. We 'pay our respect to our forefathers'. You're right to say that it's a form of fillial piety from the Chinese's point of view.</p>
              <p>If you religious belief forbid you from doing so, then don't do it lor. No one force you what. But from our point of view, you're considered as a big-time traitor å¤§é€†ä¸�é�“.</p>

              <p>i think it's about the context of it?</p>
              <p>like, most christians wouldn't hold joss sticks, because that's something that is used for worship. it's not something that's known to be for showing respect.</p>
              <p>bringing a bouquet of flowers, something which the deceased previously owned and was memorable to put on the coffin, that's something which seems to speak more of respect, and not worship.</p>
              <p>but all in all, because we believe that once you die, that's it. Souls do not come back, and cannot communicate with living people. That's why we don't believe in tang ki channeling our dead relatives - either he's channeling a supernatural being, which isn't from God, or he's a fake.</p>
              <p>reason being, is that we believe in 2 supernatural powers, God, and Satan. If something is not from God, it's from the other side of the camp. that's all to it.</p>
              <p>just sharing, humbly.. =)</p>
              <p>like my family we goto bright hill monastary, because my granddad's ashes are placed there. we don't burn joss sticks, or paper money, or paper cars etc etc, because we believe it's of no use, that wherever he is, he can't receive it. If he's in heaven (which i don't think so, i don't know), He's with God, and wouldn't need anything.</p>
              <p>if he's in the other side of the camp, he can't receive anything either.</p>
              <p>so ya.. it's about the context of it. personally, i'm still working on paying respect and showing love to my living grandparents, and it's not very successful so to speak. so i think before everyone bang tables about why christians don't show respect etc, i think the piority should be about the living first.</p>
              <p>besides, it's all personal opinions. i personally think that playing mahjong at a funeral is so much worse than not holding joss sticks if you're talking about respecting the dead.</p>
              <p>so it all boils down to your defination of respect - to me, it's about remembering the days when the deceased was alive. what they have done to impact your life, how they added colour into your life. and holding joss stick offers none of that.</p>

              <p>most probably, 90%</p>
              <p>but the bible also says that God has written the laws into our hearts (creating our conscience), and the default judgement is that we are judged according to our deeds. if we obey the commandments written in our hearts and are able to be perfect etc. </p>
              <p>But it goes on to say, now a righteousness is found APART from the law, which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
              <p>if my grandpa haven't heard the gospel, i believe God don't hold him accountable. but if he had heard it, and rejected it, then he will be held accountable.</p>

              <p>then i suggest you shouldn't speak of christian matters.</p>
              <p>especially since you said this:</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Chinese has the long held tradition of praying to the dead such as Qing Ming festival.Although Chinese think it is a form of filial piety, <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">but our God</span></span> says no praying to the dead because we are not praying to the dead we are praying to demons.</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>if you're not a christian, you are not in fellowship with Christ, neither are you in fellowship with believers. you shouldn't be pretending to be one, preaching out of your hat, which you don't even know what you are preaching about and giving others bad impression of believers.</p>

              <p>you won't find ppl like him in heaven. even the worst criminals, when they repent, and die, when they end up in heaven, they are sinless. they won't have the imperfection that you and i have now - impatience, wrath, sloth, etc etc.</p>
              <p>alot of people have the conception that ppl in heaven are the same as the people they are now presently. horrible attitude, smoker, foul tempered, or foul mouthed etc.</p>
              <p>i assure you, that is not true. we will all be renewed at the end. sinless. =)</p>
