            <div class='col-md body'>Aside from the facts that girls like guys to be caring, humorous, honest, blah.....blah, I wonder if the 5Cs (Cash, credit cards, cars, etc.) are important to the girls too in choosing their guys?  Is it just an added bonus or a must for a guy to have all the 5Cs ingredients?<br><br>I will post my reply later about my personal expereince of trying to go after a few girls when I was in late teens and early twenties before I finally settle with the girl that I will be marrying in 1 and 1/2 years.<br><br>Anyone wants to share their stories or insights?<br><br>I think I can pretty much expect the type of responses similar to what I have in my mind, but I am still curious!

            <div class='col-md body'>for my side, definitely not all the 5Cs are important. Career is one of the must-haves definitely.  Although the notion of "house-husbands" are gaining popularity elsewhere, i still prefer my guy to be self-supportive!<br><br>Cold hard dough, otherwise known as "Cash" ..... this would come with Career right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Doesn't have to be filthy rich though!<br><br>Credit Card ..... who needs credit cards when you have Cash?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Car ....... i would like to own one myself too!  but looking @ the current COE prices (together with road tax, car insurance, petrol prices ....), i would probably have to settle for a toy car now.  besides, singapore has a great transport system, a car is not a necessity.<br><br>Condominum (or izzit Country Club?) ..... definitely not a must.  i would term them as "luxury" items. Besides, i dislike condominums!<br><br>oops, message looks kinda long.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  anyway, hope this would provide some insight.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe it does<br>having the 5C's looks good on your love life resume. it looks good anywhere!<br><br>its sorta like a signal that says that this guy is successful. he's strong. he's wise and he's man enuff to get what he wants. women, like men only want the best when it come to choosing their mates. so they impose a further criteria to their potential mates. i believe the need is apparently stronger in women who are above the age of 17 living in an Asian. So if u wanna hook a looker, do what your mum says: study hard and get a high paying job- then the girls will flock.<br><br>i hate to say it but any girl who decrees that she's not biased towards poor guys or claims that money and all its trappings ought to be hung- they're lying thru their teeth and i wish more of them would have the guts to admit it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HERE HERE!!!  I always thought that no matter what women say, they always do the opposite of it.  And most of the time it's true.<br><br>How many times have I had to sit and listen to girls telling me how they are going to handle this or what they think of that....only to have them turn totally around the next day....especially when it applies to guys...<br><br>No matter what kind of guy the girl is looking for...if she's pretty, there is this automatic impulse to be attracted to the more successful guy.  Probably because in their subconscious minds, they know that they are pretty and can basically get what they want...true or not?  Society treats better looking people with preference...and we all know this...so why wouldn't a pretty girl "ask" for these things from guys?<br><br>hmmm.  sure to get flak...:-)  all u poor ass guys out there(me included), just be sure that u don't delude urself into thinking that u can get pretty chicks just by ur charms and personality as well...or you will be sorely dissappointed...and never believe it when a girl tells u ur the kind of guy she's been waiting for...why can't he be more like u?....ring a bell....Hello!!!? we're here!? ur looking at him?!!!<br><br>The sad fact is, it isn't what they are looking for...let's just say theat u just happen to be a billionaire's son and were friends witht that same girl...What are the chances that u would  be able to get with her?<br><br>80% if she doesn't feel anything for u.<br><br>500% if she likes u in some way.<br><br>sure to get flak.<br><br>So the lesson for the day..or night, is to make money...and lots of it, so u can get the girl of ur dreams.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firewire,<br><br>count yourself lucky. If girls fall for you just because you're rich kid, i say you're conned. When crisis come, the dust settles, your girl will dump you if you got no more money. If you have a bit of money only, she'll still dump you, because you're no longer rich.<br><br>So better be averagely rich ( or averagely poor??) , and this will repel all the blood-suckers. But when you find one who accepts you, she'll stick through you thick and thin. So, it's your choice!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it's natural that people want what's best for themselves. Guys want good-looking girlfriend with good character to match. Girls want good-looking boyfriend with good character to match plus financial stability. Wait a minute, something is not right.....<br><br>Anyway, I think that in a real relationship, you have to be practical. I mean, look at society here, if you are not financially stable, you'll face a lot of difficulties. As a result, your relationship will be strained.<br><br>I guess it's not fair to stereotype girls to be all like Anna Nicole Smith who marries a rich, old man. And when he died, she fought for the inheritance. Guys can be bastard sometimes, like Fann Wong's rich boyfriend who try to hit on Ericia. So, there you go, there are always people like that in this world are just BNB (Bitches N' Bastards).<br><br>Coming back to the topic, I guess most girls want stability while most guys look for excitement. That's why I suppose there's a general tendency for girls to place certain priority over the 5 C's.</div>
