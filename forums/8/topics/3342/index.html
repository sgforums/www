            <div class='col-md body'>There's someone I know who is now a university undergraduate. Frequently, he complains about taxi-drivers and motorcyclists, because he claims that the former are road devils and the latter love to cut illegally into his path when he is driving. He wants them taken off the roads. Also, he says that he doesn't mind the bombing of MRTs because he doesn't use tham and it will be an "interesting" thing to happen.This fellow is also very proud and looks down on army clerks, saying that they are weak and useless, compared to himself who was sent to OCS, largely due to his grades than anything else as he was not exactly full of leadership qualities or had top-rate fitness. He comes from a reasonably well-to-do family and regularly associates with those of his own social standing. He is intent on marrying someone rich as he wants to maintain his lifestyle without working hard, and he says it will be the easiest way to go. Although, in fact, the land area of his home is already bigger than a full block of flats, he wants to stay in a mansion with a tennis court, basketball court, swimming pool, sauna, gymnasium and fountains. This person is also very lazy and freely admits to copying and cheating in tests in university. In fact, he proudly proclaims that when he gets his As, it is due to copying, although that doesn't come too often. What do you all think of such a person?</div>

What do you all think of such a person?</div></blockquote>This person will not succeed in life. As he has no social responsibility, his personal resposibility will also be lousy. That being the case, such a selfish person will hve no real friends. His friends are likely to be around him because of his family's status or characters similarly like him cos they also no friends.<br><br>Since he is not a team player, it is unlikely he can do well in his career as every organisation needs you to cooperate with each departments and colleagues. With attitude as such, he will have no social skills and communication and public relation with clients will be awful thus any business he does will be doomed from the start.<br><br>You said he was sent to OCS? In OCS, one is also graded on teamwork, character, social skill(how else to command troops without this) and there is such a thing called peer assesment (graded by own colleagues  on their perception if he makes a good leader). With all these procees will sift out real leaders. This is where he is likely to fail.<br><br>Whatever it is, you are what you live your life to be and the course of one's destiny is in his own hands. He thus will destroy himself if he carry on this attitude. Not only in carreer, personal relationship but his own family too as how can an irresposible person raise a good family?<br><br>Then again, whatever I say, take it with a pinch of salt lah. I not philosopher mah.
