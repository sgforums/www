            <div class='col-md body'>hello, i have a digital camera and have been using it for yrs.....anyway all the photo i taken was stored in the computer......is this a good way to store all the pic? I look into the whole My Picture and was shocked to see that there was 3k files and it was using 1.11 GB from the computer's memory....i still have 12 GB left but i am worried that after a few yrs later, the My Picture will accumulate 8-9 GB and that will make the computer slow. So is there another thing to store lots of pics to it???<br><br>Thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>U dont need to worry that storing your photo files in ur computer will make ur computer slow. It doesnt work that way. The photo files will take up your hard disk space, thats all. It is not called "memory." "Memory" is RAM, a different thing. Storing photo files in ur computer will not affect ur RAM in any ways. If u store more photo files, u use more hard disk space.<br><br>It is true that if u continue to store more files, someday there may not be enough hard disk space left. But that day may never come. Because so far u only use 1GB+ hard disk space and still have 12 GB left. It means u have the capacity to store 12 times more photo files than what u currently store. And in any case, once u dont have enough hard disk capacity left, u can upgrade and buy a bigger capacity hard disk. Now in the market it is common to see harddisks which are hundreds of GBs.<br><br>Also, I recommend u back up ur photos. In case ur hard disk crash, or ur home catches fire, or any other sudden disasters, u can lose all ur photos. It is therefore a good practise to backup ur photos. Not only ur photos, but also other important data in ur computer. U can open online internet accounts and copy ur photos and data there. You can also copy the photos and data onto a portable storage device such as a CD.<br><br>Finally, when u store so many photos in ur computer, it is a good idea to sort the photos and place them in different folders. For example. "Holidays" or "Birthdays" etc.  When u open the folders, the loading time will be faster. It also makes browsing more systematic and logical.</div>
