            <div class='col-md body'>don't u just love them? LOLMAO. PLEASE CONTRIBUTE SOME STORIES IF U HAVE....<br><br>Ghost Story #1 (WOOoooooooÂ….*scary sound*)<br>When I was young, I lived in a deserted kampong deep in the jungle. Every night, my mother could ask me not to go home too late as there wonÂ’t be any transportation after a certain time.<br><br>One night, before going home, I ta pao a kueh teow soup for supper. I was late and I waited for the taxi/bus but there was none. I was getting worried as the night was getting darker and darker. So I tried to flag down private vehicles to take me home.<br><br>There was no one stopping for me, till one motorcyclist took compensation on me and stopped to give me a lift. He was a man with a kind face. I accepted his offer and got onto his motorbike.<br><br>On the way home, we would pass by a temple. At night, the temple would look eerily spooky with the dim lights from the candles.<br><br>At first, the motorcyclist was warm and friendly. When the temple was approaching, the motorcyclist eyes grown bigger and bigger. His kind face turned to a face of anger. He was muttering something loud but was not audible to me. I was so scared that I closed my eyes in order not to see his angry face.<br><br>Then, the motorcylist stopped in front of the temple and then yelled at me.<br><br>Â“Your kueh teow soup is so hot!! It is burning my thigh! Can you please move it away???Â”<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ghost Story #2<br>When I was young, I have two friends who were very close to each other. They played with each other everyday. It was like, if you see A, you would see B next to him. They were always together.<br><br>A loved fried eggs. Whenever he went out for lunch or dinner, without fail, he would ask for fried egg on top of his noodles, fried rice, etc.<br><br>One day, A involved in an accident and died. B was devastated. B went to the cemetery to pray everyday. He would go to the nearest restaurant and ta pao a box of fried rice with an egg on top to be offered to A when he went to pray to him.<br><br>The next day, he opened the box and there was no egg inside! B was petrified. He thought, must be A who came and took the fried egg away.<br><br>The same thing happened the next day and the day after that. B was confused. So, one day, he asked the chef to make the same fried rice with a fried egg again. Then, he went to the cemetery to offer it to A. Curious, he opened the box to check for the egg. He was angry to find that, there was no fried egg in the box after all.<br><br>Feeling that he had been cheated, he went back to the restaurant and demanded to see the Chef. Â“Where is the fried egg?? I told you there must be a fried egg inside!! You have cheated me for a few days now! Gimme back my money!!Â” Then, the Chef got really angry and opened the box - the fried egg was inside the box.<br><br>The Chef said, Â“Stupid! You open the box upside down. No wonder you cannot see the egg!!Â”<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ghost Story #3<br>When I was young, I went to town to work with a group of friends during our summer holidays of two months. Being young and away from home for the first time, we drank and smoke like nobodyÂ’s business.<br><br>One night, we were pissed drunk and flagged the last bus down to go home.<br><br>Being tired, we slept in the bus. It had been awhile that I fell asleep. I was awake by the<br>chilly wind. I was shocked to find that there was no one in the bus, and I was the last passenger. I looked in front to check out for the driver. But the driver was no where in sight. Yet, the bus was moving.<br><br>I panicked shitless. I rubbed my eyes to make sure that I was not dreaming. The night was dark and cold.<br><br>I hysterically jumped out from the bus and tried to run as hard as I could to get away.<br><br>Then I heard someone yelled at me from behind the bus.<br><br>Â“Hey! DonÂ’t run away! Come over here and help to push the bus!Â” yelled the bus driver.<br><br>I saw my other friends helping to push the bus, which broke down while I was asleep.]]&gt;<br><br></div>

One evening he went to town for a movie with his friends. He was having a lot fun before he realized it was getting very late. He quickly made his way home. It was unusually dark and creepy that nite. As he was walking, he was astonished to find an old, creepy-looking street peddler selling some books along the road. It gave him the shivers when he noticed this pale old guy staring at him.<br><br>&gt; &gt;The old guy said, "Son, why don't you get a book ... it will keep you company". My friend acted brave and thought why not. He had a look at the old man's collection ... his hair began to rise up on end when he noticed all the books were related to the supernatural. Nonetheless, he found one that was very interesting so he asked the old man, "How much is this, Uncle?" The old guy replied, "Well son ... that's an interesting book ..it's $25." My friend was shocked and said "But ...but ...that's so expensive.." The old man said nothing but glared at my<br>friend which freaked him out. He quickly rummaged through his pockets &amp; found $20.<br><br>&gt; &gt;"T-t-this's all I have" he said. The old guy replied,<br>&gt; &gt;"It's okay, son... u can've the book for that price." As my friend<br>&gt; &gt;hastily paid for it &amp; made a dash for home, the old man called out to him and said, "Son ... whatever happens, don't u ever flip the book to it's last page .... remember these words ...or u will regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Reaching home, he quickly asked his parents," Dad ... mom ... are there any new booksellers nearby?" "Not that we know of ... but we've heard of a creepy old man that appears only at nite during a full moon &amp; then disappears just as mysteriously. Nobody knows who he is, or where he comes from but many have become victims in his wake... why son?"<br>"N-nothing just asking", said my friend &amp; ran straight to his room.<br>Nervously, he opened the book &amp; began reading, all the time remembering the warning the old man had given him. But after a while, he grew tired &amp; fell asleep. At midnite, as he was sound asleep in bed, a cold gush of wind blew in through his bedroom window which startled him and sent chills down his spine. He looked at his table &amp; noticed the wind had blown the pages of the book to its last page!!!!! For awhile, he laid in bed - frozen in fear, but soon curiosity got the better of him.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;He had to know what was on the last page.Slowly he got out of bed &amp; carefully picked up the book. As he glimpsed at the last page, he let out a blood-curling scream &amp; fainted...<br>&gt; &gt;This is what he read on the last page:<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Retail Price : $ 10.99<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Promotional Price : $2.99<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay then, here goes. This is what i heard from my senior actually. It happened on one of those warm and wet monsoon days...<br><br>Have you heard this rumour that there was this shop in the kallang area which sold siewmai made from human meat ?<br>Well, my senior was quite a brave guy, and so he didn't think much of it, and he went to buy some from the store. He was passing by this dark sideroad on his way home and the streetlamps aren't working WHEN,  suddenly he started getting this feeling that there was someone behind him. But when he turned around, there was no one...<br>Then he suddenly felt that something was wrong, so he opened the box... and he found that there was ONE LESS SIEWMAI in the box.<br>He froze in his tracks, but he tried to tell himself that surely the person at the store forgot to put in the last one.  But he felt REALLY unnerved by it, so when he went round the corner, he opened the box cover again. And this time, there was still one less siewmai in the box!<br>He got really freaked out this time, so he started rushing home. After he caught his breath, he opened the cover again, and this time there were TWO less siewmai in the box! He screamed, and he closed the box and opened it again...<br>There weren't a single one left. How can that be possible?! He was scared stiff, and he took a close~ look at the box...  They were all stuck at the bottom of the box cover...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. My friend.. Let's call him Suman.<br><br>Suman is in the Xcountry cca.He lives a few blocks away from his ex-coach.<br>Suman runs around Ang Mo Kio every night to train himself because there is no time for him to do that in the day-other then his training... However... On this fateful night, 12 of April, he sensed that something was different.. Suman could feel a presence near him, how ever, did not turn back. Suman continued running and running... The shadow kept following him...Until it was gone....Suman finally sat at a seat in the void deck to have a break. Suddenly, from the corner of his eye, the Figure pop out from no where.<br><br>It was his ex-pri school coach. He said " dammit Suman, you still run like a girl.
