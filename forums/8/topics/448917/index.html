              <p>Hello there</p>
              <p>I am not sure if drug offenders are priviledged to early release or home detention. However i believe they should be.</p>
              <p>If i am right, every inmate(except for serious crimes) is automatically entitled to the home detention scheme. However from what i know, the home detention scheme is not 6 months, but is 1/3 of the total sentence duration</p>
              <p>The leg tagging system only applies if the inmate is entitled to home detention.</p>
              <p>This home detention machine if im right, is made by cisco, or only installed by cisco officer, or something about cisco.<br>For home detention, the inmate will serve his/her 'sentence' at home, and they are entitled to 2 hours off(if i remember correctly) per day, and usually it is from 12 to 2 pm. <br>During this period u can go any where in singapore, i think pulau ubin also can, as long as u are back in the 'detectable area' of the machine before the time ends</p>
              <p>This "2 hours off timing" i believe can be 'negotiated' with the inmate's officer, but you can't change the duration, only the timing.<br> This can be done during the day of release.</p>
              <p>During the home detention period, if in an event whereby the inmate is sick and needs to see a doctor, he/she must call the prison and inform them first, seek permission before he can go to see the doctor(if i am not wrong), and he/she must ask for an Medical Certificate from the doctor.</p>
              <p>The detector for the leg tagging thing is a very sensitive and strict system, and it's works like the wifi router in your house. There is a distance in which you must stay within, and i was told the system will alert the headquarters if it detects the inmate is 'out of range'.</p>
              <p>If you are staying in the landed property with 3-4 stories kind, they may install more than one of these system, just to increase the range.</p>
              <p>If your father is eligible for the home detention, the prison will call u up to make an appointment on the date to install this system, and if i am right(again), this system operates on your home telephone line. <span style="color: #ff0000;">SINGTEL MIO Voice is not compatible, as far as i know. Dun ask why, i also duno why la very jialat and troublesome</span>.</p>
              <p>Don't worry, prior to the home detention program, the inmate's officer or chief or big shot will call the inmate's immediate family,asking if you are agreeable to this home detention thingy. <br><br>If yes, they will call u and one of your family members to the prison for a 'briefing'. You can bring more people for the briefing, but the room is actually the officer's office, added with a lot of chairs to accomodate the family members, so it is quite cramp in the sense.</p>
              <p>The person who will eventually escort the inmate home, must go for the briefing, and he/she must be<span style="color: #ff0000;"> above 21,</span> and must be <span style="color: #ff0000;">immediate family member</span>(means boyfriend/girlfriend/aunt/nephew etc NOT ALLOWED), and the person must be l<span style="color: #ff0000;">iving in the same house as the inmate</span>, i.e. the <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>IC must be same address</strong></em></span>(they will take your IC and check). the person must also come on the day to pick up the inmate</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>INFORMATION such as date, time, address will be given during the breifing</strong></span>. So better attend. Make yourself free the day during the day of the breifing, at least 3-5 hours of free time. <br>As they prison brief batch by batch, and the office is not very big, and you may need to wait for your turn to be called to the breifing. <br><br>There will be an officer calling out "Families of &lt;&lt;inmate's name here&gt;&gt; please report at counter xxx". Be very attentive when u see ppl lining up or calling names, they dont use speaker, and background noise will cover their voice.<br>Tip: Seat near the counters</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the breifing you can ask questions. Held at the 2nd floor of the prison(in the officer's office). When you go to the 2nd floor of the prison for the briefing, you must put handphone at the locker, etc. Then they will use the metal detector to scan if u bring some unauthorise things. Standard procedures<br><br>Before the day of release, the inmate will be transferred to another 'camp', it is called selarang camp.</p>
              <p>During the day of release, max 2 immediate familly members can go there(means go inside the "restricted area") and pick the inmate up, there will be briefing on the home detention scheme.<br><br>Whole family can go to the place, but only 2 can go in. Others can wait outside. Outside No aircon very hot, but there are fans.</p>
              <p>However inside the breifing room, the aircon on until very cold, u can ask the officers there to turn up the temp.</p>
              <p>Don't worry to much, from what i feel, singapore prison seeems very professional.</p>
              <p>This is written to the best of my knowledge, because i didn't pay too much attention during the breifing, just the main points, come on la, everyone's mood is to bring the inmate back.</p>
              <p>Look on the brighter side, your father is only 1 year, during the times when i went for the briefing, televisiting etc, ive seen sad faces, and being kaypoh, i overheard a mother telling her children they are going to see their father for the last time or last few time before death sentence or sth. Somemore the kids still young. Then the kids still duno wad happen liddat. Quite sad in my opinion.</p>

              <p>Bigger rooms can up to 12 ppl sleep (2 toilet)..walking into room got to take of plastic slipper, cos the place u step VERY POSSIBLE is the position where ppl head is when sleeping cos inside very hot, sleeping at door is cooler.</p>
