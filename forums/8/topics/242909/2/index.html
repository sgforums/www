By law this is not a con or anything unless he say he is from HDB or some government unit for housing. But the main thing he offer is repair your poles for 1000 dollars, he can charge you 1 million also can. As long as you agree to it and he does it for you after you pay money, it is not anything illegal.<br><br>So be careful of these kind of conman especially, because you cannot even call police to help you settle as they have not broken the law. Basically they are  using psychological tricks. First they say they are repairing pipes or something, so you will feel secure and good about them. Then they pretend to be helpful and concern about your house well being, lastly they say this is a problem, your maid or whoever may fall down and i will do it for you cheap and it's really good, so you think you are getting a bargain. As always, don't be greedy and think rationally to avoid being conned.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
