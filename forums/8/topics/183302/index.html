            <div class='col-md body'>Why is it we rarely know that we are dreaming when we sleep? Most of the time, we feel as if we're actually a part of the dream, that it is really happening to us. Is our mind deceiving us? Is there something it does not want us to know? Is our sub-consciousness playing tricks on our physical mind? But sometimes, when we lucid dream, our physical mind breaks through the barriers of deception built by our sub-conscioussness and we realize we're dreaming. How does lucid dreaming happen? Is it because of clues that our physical mind, as an observer (because we feel as if we're watching ourselves in a movie during the dream), finds clues, or even glitches in the activity of the sub-conscious mind that sends a signal to the sub-consciouss to stop its pretence and hence we realize we're dreaming after all, and that all is not real?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How do we know we're not living in a Matrix-type reality? If, for example, in the Matrix, a person sees something unusual, such as a flying man, he would know that the matrix isn't real. That, when compared to our dream state, is exactly what is happening to us. When we dream, we do not know we're dreaming because everything and everyone seems SO real. But, what if, something we see in our dream, like a car with wings, we would know instantly that we are dreaming because that is not possible in current-day reality. A glitch or error in the Matrix, like the flying man, will cause its inhabitants to realize the truth. And so it is the same with lucid dreaming. When we lucid dream, we realize we are dreaming because clues in the dreamworld trigger a warning to us, telling us that what we are seeing or hearing are not real. And lucid dreaming is triggered when we see something abnormal or out-of-place in the dream.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Strangely enough, if we are not intently looking for dream signs during sleep, we will accept everythingÂ—no matter how strangeÂ—as we would during the waking hours. Quite obviously if you were allowed to think analytically in your dreams, the absurdness of some of the above situations would be quite apparent to you. Even if you stop to question something in a dream youÂ’ll usually become quickly distracted by something else and lose your transient rational-train-of-thought. For instance, it may occur to you that you shouldnÂ’t be able to leap over the entire parking lot, but then it may suddenly dawn on you that youÂ’re 5 minutes late for work and youÂ’ll rush into the office, completely forgetting about your parking lot adventure. Within our dreams we generally accept whatever happensÂ—we usually just go along for the ride. It takes training to spot and fully-realize the obscurities inherent within our dreams. You have to instill the idea within your head that if a blue dog should happen upon your path, itÂ’s very likely that youÂ’re in fact dreaming.</div>
