              <p>To be honest, I dont think Singaporeans hate Malaysians at all. Its more of a political thing that doesnt extend to the people of Malaysia. We all know about the Singapore-Malaysia rivalry, but its a political, not socio-cultural issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, I think most Malaysian chinese are very capable, smart, hardworking people who are repressed by the stupid Bumiputra policy. I have tons of friends who are Malaysian chinese, and they are the most intelligent,atheletic,friendly people around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So really, I dont have any prejudice against Malaysians. Especially the chinese. And if all of you migrated to Singapore I think we'll be even more successful, hahaha.</p>

              <p>Well, for sure I am not a Singaborean here but yet I join this forum months ago and even visited Singapore last month.</p>

              <p>Singabo is a beri clean country I can say, but my lecturer mention to me it is a souless country, I wonder how true it is</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I noted Malaysian always say to me, Singaporeans hate Malaysians working in Singapore and start it treat them double standard. i.e office politics , or they have a certian Singapore gang and Malaysian gang where both don't mix. or the Malaysians need to do more work ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know how true it is but I always hear that from friends. I am not here to tarnish Singaporean but since we are all Chinese and come from China ONCE UPON A TIME does this have to happen in the real world ? just becuase you felt that your ricebowl is overturned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I am informed that there are many suicide cases in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore is a very advance and fast moving country, before I visited it last month , I taught all the Singaporeans are good looking but to no avail some are just that normal looking and their taste for clothing is just SO so .</p>

              <p>No! we dun hate malaysians, we got cheap DVD, petrol, foods, spa, facial, golf, resort and tour there too, why should we hate malaysians??.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We should in fact thanks and welcome the malaysians, accordingly to my economics lecturers, they are the traditional one who came and help us to build our economy in the early 70s and 80s, today there are about 30 thousand malaysians here with PR or gain citizenship while doing professional jobs as bankers, MD, accountants, managers etc etc..however the workers are getting less, as other non traditional workers start to pour in, the likes of china, bangala, etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh, we are cost saving people, we like to save for future raining days, so we use to shop for clothes and fashions in malaysia, so we become so and so only. If you visit USA and Japan, the world first and 2nd largest economy, you find lots of ang mo and jap beggars on the street and railway station too. So, we are ok liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are not souless, we accept multi nationals society, that is way many come here and work, it suit them well. We protect them under the employment act, we dun degrade them even they took our jobs away, because we know, without them, our economy will fall. That is why we got celebrate foreign workers and professional outing on MayDay just soley to thanks them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u said that there is alot of suicides in Singapore, I think every country have suicides, it can be out of love, money or illness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In conclusion, Singapore can be an envy to many foreigners and envying come with jealousness. And jealousness turns to hatre and misleading others into downgrading us. Its ok, we understand.</p>
