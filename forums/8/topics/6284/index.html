She was his classmate. This slut has been calling him on his hp, msging him when we were together. Then, last christmas, he called me up and said he regretted but didn't know what to do. duh! Soon, he started calling me up almost every night. He told me he didn't love her at all... i got all so confused... we kept arguing over her. I mean, if he is not serious why is he with her? grrrr. i m so fustrated now cos of all the hurts and pain he had to make me go through... not once but twice.
