You compare diploma holder with a degree holder, obviously we lose out. A poly education may be good, but a degree holder learns more than us. Why do we further our studies in the first place? Poly only learns this much, but when we go uni, we learn more. If we can learn as much as those uni students in 3 years, we can study for Masters after our 3 years.<br><br>Well, not all polys have lectures. The newly-opened poly has no lectures.<br><br>What the government does to us poly students doesn't really affect us. If we work hard, we will still be able to do the things we want. Besides, application for a scholarship here fails, we can look at overseas universities. Nobody is stoppable when determination plays.<br></div>

Its either you get a good job, or not a job at all. This is because there are just too many people holding a U degree! <strong>Companies would rather give a 3k job to a Poly student who has experience on working in the real world, rather than a JC or U student, who only learns and does not know how to apply. </strong>Being in JC, its either you work hard and go on to get a Masters, which will get you good job, or you does not get jobs.<br><br>( I am not biased towards the Poly student. Personally, I am on IP to a JC, so no reason i should favour the Poly. Just stating facts. In Singapore this situation might not be obvious, but in States, China, Hong Kong this is what is happening )</div>
