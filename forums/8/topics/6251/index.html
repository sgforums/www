I wouldn't say you are unlucky .. more like you weren't lucky enough to get away with it. But anwya .. these things happen .. you take a risk and you loose .. sometimes you win sometimes you loose. The point is these things happen. Everything we do have consequences. Good or bad .. it's up to you .. learn from mistakes, experience makes a difference. If it makes you feel better, I got a 100 dollar fine for parking in a clear way zone, one of those parking spots that is a parking spot until 4.00 pm .. then it becomes a road.<br><br>------------------<br>ZeroS</div>
