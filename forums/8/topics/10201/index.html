For one in such situation, the call of almighty Death will be strong, and sure he must be clinging to something he values in order to survive. For normal people without motivation, they will choose death over life.<br><br>And ya, death is sweetest thing in the world. I have never tried death before and I'm obliged to say it cause I'm the Devil.<br><br>PS: It's easier to be a coward than a hero.<br></div>
