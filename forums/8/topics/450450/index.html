              <p>Her problem(correct me if i am wrong) lies on the stereotypical SINGAPORE judgement of norms, which are actually inappropriate.</p>
              <p>For example, if she dresses herself as she described in japan(not in their countryside), she would be pretty much be seen as norms or even unfashionable to them. In Singapore, she might be seen as 'wanna-be'', ''emos'' or ''attention seeker''.</p>
              <p>I love japanese anime/games/manga/dramas, been to japan a several times too. In fact, I find that those singaporean(me included) that are into japan's culture would find singapore's cluture 'too-traditional' in many ways: Fashion, educational system, politics, businesses, etc.</p>
              <p>Then again, many western critics are describing Japan companies' management style ''too-traditional'' - predominantly, how SONY - 7 times value of APPLE ard 10+ years ago and is an ICON of innovation(portable radio, cd, discman) - has lost it's position to APPLE and SAMSUNG.</p>

              <p>I have your dilemma before.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with people wearing clothes that doesn't go along with the trend. What's Singaporean's fashion trend? T-shirt and jeans, lol. I remember an article a famous globe fashion designer labelled Singaporeans have the worst fashion sense around the globe.</p>
              <p>The problem is with our culture. We play safe too much. We were upbrought in such a way that we must be the same as other people or else.. people judge and labelled as attention-seekers. I wore a strip black-white long sleeves before, a group of people looked at me. One of them said to another friend, "Must be from the circus" while giggling away. I mean, it's only strip sleeves. What's up with that?</p>
              <p>Our people lack fashion education. Another may argue, "How being fashionable going to be beneficial and earn you money?". A person who argues that have problem with their mentality. It's only something only Singaporeans would think of. Other countries never judge fashion in such way before.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans lack knowledge about fashion because of few factors:</p>
              <p>1. <strong>Hot climate</strong> - People think that they can't be fashionable with a hot climate. They're wrong. Being fashionable doesn't mean dressing up like a snowman.</p>
              <p>2. <strong>School upbringing</strong> - People were taught to look the same as everyone in school. All boys must have a one short hairstyle. Girls mustn't let their long hair go nor have a curly hair. Every schools have their standard of uniforms rules. With these drill into their head for 10 years, they grow a perspective as an adult. A perception in such way that they must look the same as most people and afraid to be judge differently.</p>
              <p>3. <strong>Laziness in fashion</strong> - We're never taught ourself anything about fashion during school. Every weekday morning, we only open our wardrobe and take out our uniforms. Unlike most countries without school uniforms, they've to choose a set of clothes every morning. Practice makes perfect. Singaporeans lack this. Therefore, when they graduated, their lifestyle continues. They'd pick the same everyday clothing they judged to be "safe" to wear. This causes a trend.</p>
              <p>It's our people who give judges like these to fashionable people "emo", "attention-seeker" and "wannabe". Other countries will never judge what you wear. This stereotype only occur in Singapore. It's a common mental illness among Singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Her problem(correct me if i am wrong) lies on the stereotypical
              SINGAPORE judgement of norms, which are actually inappropriate.</p>
              <p>For example, if she dresses herself as she described in
              japan(not in their countryside), she would be pretty much be seen
              as norms or even unfashionable to them. In Singapore, she might be
              seen as 'wanna-be'', ''emos'' or ''attention seeker''.</p>
              <p>I love japanese anime/games/manga/dramas, been to japan a
              several times too. In fact, I find that those singaporean(me
              included) that are into japan's culture would find singapore's
              cluture 'too-traditional' in many ways: Fashion, educational
              system, politics, businesses, etc.</p>
              <p>Then again, many western critics are describing Japan companies'
              management style ''too-traditional'' - predominantly, how SONY - 7
              times value of APPLE ard 10+ years ago and is an ICON of
              innovation(portable radio, cd, discman) - has lost it's position to
              APPLE and SAMSUNG.</p>

              <p>You are assuming the Japanese society are not critical or sterotypical like Singaporean.</p>
              <p>It is the courage of the Japanese youth who go all out to indulge in their passion, regardless, and establish themselves. </p>
              <p>Singapore youth are giving excuses for not having the courage to act out. They stop themselves even before they start. They think about what Singaporeans <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would</span> think and put the blame on that.</p>
              <p>They need to dress themselves up, and walk down Orchard Road, to do it again and again until it becomes the norm, no excuses.</p>
              <p>They need to overcome their inhibition and need for approval.</p>

              <p>hmm, why is the responsibility of being fashionable exclusively on the youths(assuming 19 and below)? Are our adults trendy? Are youths being discriminated? Do adults in Singapore have the courage to act out? Youths follow the example of adults - notably, their parents. If adults themselves cannot set an example, what do u expect from the youths?</p>
              <p>In fact, if u walk down the streets of orchard or CBD areas on Mon-Fri, lots of well-dressed businessman(expect for hairstyle) and OL. On weekends, Sat and Sun, a HUGE HUGE contrast - u should be able to visualise. Perhaps, we(Singaporeans) only put in effort when money is concerned - wear nicer bussiness suit, clients/employers perceive u as more professional and therefore happier.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I have nothing against people that are not fasionable. As long as u are nice, I am more than willing to be ur fren.</p>

              <p>without a doubt, appearance is the first thing a person notices about another person.</p>
              <p>the first point of contact isn't it? and i believe it's inevitable to judge or be judged.(be it consciously or not)</p>
              <p>so yes as per the first reply, why bother what others think if you're happy doing what you're doing?</p>
              <p>unless you're hurting or disadvantaging anyone in the process of course. in which, i don't think dressing fancy does at all in any ways!</p>
