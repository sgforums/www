In Singapore, MCDS is concentrating on soccer, badminton and basketball. Interestingly, the sports which have won Singapore medals tend to be the not-so-popular ones. Sailing, swimming, water polo (all water sports!!!), wushu and recently gymnastics. That girl really did us proud, but behind her were rich parents able to give her the money for the training.<br><br>Good to know someone with gymnastics background.

In another words, you are irrelevant to me, my life, my career and so on. So whatever  judgements you have, who cares?<br><br>You have not proven yourself as a mature sensible adult, who dont see his words and deeds are hypocritical, and which can have serious consequences.<br><br>You played God<br><br>You played a hypocritical bigot who yell at everyone who hold views different from yours.<br><br>I have already listed those topics in which you attacked other people religions. I have one more to add, the topic in which you attacked Roman Catholicism.<br><br>Want me to add Bear's posts as well?<br><br>While people question actions of some Christians, you on other hand, question the principles, the essence, the beliefs of other religions, as well as attacking  your own fellow Christians who are Catholics. Btw, I seen you attacked the Jews as well in the Roman Catholic topic.<br><br>Heed my advice, after chatting with you on msn, and seeing your topics, please go get psychiatric help. You seriously need one. You gave me the feeling you are obsessive, weird, and psychotic.<br><br></div></blockquote>Jews..why would i comment the Jews from which my salvation comes from?<br>Like i said....truth is truth and is offensive. It is plain for all to see, though not all are humble enough to see. I dun attack people because people are always failing..no Christians is perfect and by attacking them...its not fair and no basis. I comment on the faith itself..not the follower.<br>You keep insisting your ways, and expect ur ways and ur methods and the things u choose are correct. I dun think my choices and the things i do is perfect. That is why i uses God's Word as a benchmark. i dun pour hatred on any thing jus because i am not from there or because it simply dont look good in my eyes. I hate what God hates.<br><br>Dun sow discord between me and Bear. we do argue over posts but we dun attack each other personally and hate one another.<br><br>Different people have different stands, i stand by what God says. Offensive as it may be. I shall not turn this topic into another flaming thread...which u always like to start by the way.</div>
