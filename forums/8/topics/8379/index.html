            <div class='col-md body'>Simple platonic relationship can definitely exist between guys and gals, no problems about it, although sometimes, it is also quite difficult to convince others around u that this is truly the case when u r seen spending extra time with someone of opposite gender.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that platonic relationships do exist because I do have some platonic guy friends, and I do go out with them on a one-to-one basis which I feel is perfectly all right. To me, itÂ’s simply means going out with a friend, doesnÂ’t matter whether itÂ’s a guy or a gal friend. Probably going out with a girl means more shopping, while going out with a guy means more movie-watching (generally).<br><br>However, many relationships develop out of friendships. Which is why I say that it would be easier to remain platonic friends when either one party is already attached (assuming that it doesnÂ’t create more problems by having one party turning into a third party instead). Of coz, if both are single, itÂ’s still very possible to remain platonic friends. Personally, letÂ’s just say that IÂ’m less worried about giving the wrong signals to guy friends who are already attached (simply because they are attached), and thus itÂ’s much easier to become closer friends this way. With single guys, I do worry sometimes that they will want something more, especially when they start doing things for you that they do not do for their other friends (e.g. calling me and telling me that his family has bought a lot of durians, do I want some?? I wonder why doesnÂ’t he give some to his another friend who is just staying next block to him?). I would wonder if theyÂ’re doing this just because they treat me as a close friend, or is it because they want something more out of the friendship. And when such things happen, I would start to maintain a little distance from him and observe and see how things go.<br><br>When you have crossed the boundary to become pals, it doesnÂ’t mean that things will always be stagnant and stay that way, that you will only be friends forever. You will only continue to remain as platonic friends only if thatÂ’s what <strong>both</strong> of you want it to be (Best case scenario  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">). But people sometimes do let emotions get the better of them, and let themselves fall in love with their friends of the opposite sex, at the risk of their friendships. When this happens, either  (i)they become a couple, (ii) one party gets rejected and they lose their friendship, (iii) one party gets rejected but they are able to maintain their friendships at a platonic level after taking some time to get over the initial awkwardness. Personally again, several of my guy friends and I are platonic friends again only after going through (iii). Which is why in the past, I didnÂ’t really believe that close platonic friendships between friends of the opposite sex could exist for me, until more recently, I finally found out that itÂ’s possible coz IÂ’m on quite good terms with one of my guy friends now (and he has recently gotten attached). And I know that him being attached now removes a lot of uncertainties for me, and it plays a part in me being more willing to share my problems etc. with him, which helps in bringing the friendship closer. Not sure how many of you actually understand this part, but itÂ’s just based on my Â“experiencesÂ” with guys (hmmmÂ….heheheÂ…..dun anyhow think hor), maybe should say my encounter with guys, since not that experienced atcually  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>Ok, I think I have said too much, just conclude by saying that itÂ’s not easy to find a close platonic friend of the opposite sex, it probably will as people get more and more mature and are able to handle and control their feelings and emotions better. So if you do have such friendships, do treasure them well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Rev: maybe itÂ’s not coz youÂ’re the only guy in the family thatÂ’s why youÂ’re able to hang out with girls well, maybe itÂ’s coz your preference is not towards girls?? HehehehehehheheÂ…think youÂ’re going to scold me for this againÂ… :p<br></div>

Gets pretty sickening when people start insisting that that you like a certain guy/girl just because the two of you are hanging out with each other often. These days, I don't bother to convince. If I say that there's nothing going on and some people still want to believe that there's something going on, then I just let them believe lor. Want to believe me, good, don't believe, I also don't care.<br><br></div>

Let's face it, what do guys say when they want to get to know a girl? They would normally say "Can we be friends?" even though we all know that many times it's not just being friends that's on their mind.<br><br>If the girl actually takes the word for it that the guy just want to be friend, and proceed to be friends with the guy, they risk getting getting accused of giving the wrong signals if the guy had meant being more than friends. So I guess girls do try to be more cautious to avoid giving the wrong signals.<br><br>[This message has been edited by sparkle (edited 18 July 2000).]</div>

Like say, in sgforums, I would think that most guys probably do not have thoughts of being more than friends with fellow female forumites. Wanting to know the girl would probably be due to the fact that they exchange posting often, so everyone has become friends even before they have met the other party.<br><br>In school, don't quite agree with you. Unless he's a fellow classmate, or somehow there's reason for him to want to be just friends, otherwise for a guy to just approach a girl out of nowhere, even if it's in school, i would think that the guy wants something more.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm....interesting topic...been a while since there's a serious topic arnd...so how can I not reply to this interesting thread?!  *sticks tongue out*<br><br>I personally believe that platonic relationship exits.  Why not? Not all guys that hangs out with girls are courting her and the other way around.<br><br>I have been in a platonic relationship for the past 5 years.  We both understands that there is nothing that can happen between us just because of the fact that we just understand each other too well.  He will know exactly what I am thinking when I am bother by something. Like the chinese saying "move your tail and I already know what you are thinking."  This kinda thing really scares me...how some other person in this world can read me like a book, but as I think deeper into this issue...I find myself very lucky to have this special someone in my life.  Someone that can totally understand me.  How often can you find someone like this in this world?  Even if you are married, it's unlikely that you can find someone that totally understands you.<br><br>He is someone that I can say/tell anything to.  I can tell him about my boys problems and he can tell me about his girl problems.  We have both been through relationship while this platonic friendship exist and there was no hard feelings or jealousy what-so-ever. He is someone I know for sure will not judge me for what I say and all my evil plots *grins*  We can chat on the phone until the sun raises and still never run out of topic to talk about.  I remember once in college, I was coming down with a fever &amp; flu.  He drove 1.5 hrs in the middle of the night to my college just to deliver medicine for me.  Where can you find a friend like that?!  I have to say I don't even think my girlfriend will do such thing for me.<br><br>Like sparkle said, friends do tease us about being a couple at times, but we can't be bothered by it.  We used to explain to people, but then later found out that it's a waste of time.  People already have a fixed mindset on what we are and there is no way we can change their thinking just by telling them so.<br><br>Have the thought of him becoming my boyfriend ever cross my mind?  Yes, and we have discussed about it also.  We both understand that things will not work out and we are both not willing to risk this friendship.<br><br>I guess what I am trying to say is...in order to maintain a platonic relationship, both parties must first reach an understanding and it doesn't matter if one party is attached or not, cause if the feeling is there it will be.  It will not go away just because someone is attached.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inzaghi,<br><br>well, perhaps you would understand better if you know what a difficult position it can be to have to reject people, especially if they are your friends. It's just like guys finding it difficult to pick up their courage to tell someone they like how much they're in love with them.<br><br>Which is why I would reject the friendship even before we have become friends if I sense that the guy wants something more, rather than becoming good friends with him first, and then having to reject him later. Isn't this better for the guy as well? Rather than thinking that the girl is giving you chances by becoming your friend and getting more upset and hurt later on when you discover that she just wants to be friends, you're getting a clear message that she doesnt want anything more?<br><br>I'm not afraid of missing out on opportunities at this stage of my life, since I'm not looking for a partner right now. Being single is more carefree, and I can go out with my guy friends without having to worry about what silly ideas might be going through my partner's head when I do that, hehe. I think it would be too tedious to make friends with every guy who approaches you, it's tough to maintain a friendship, and I always get the feeling of being betrayed when a friend wants something more out of the friendship. Not his fault, but I do get that kind of feeling.</div>

I think ppl now-a-days read too much into what the other's have to say.  To me, even when I get pick up at clubs, I will keep in mind that they only want to be my friend and get to know me better, never will I think that the purpose of them approaching me is to chase after me.  I agree with you.  If I have to think that every guy that approach me is chasing after me then I will be cheating myself of many good friendships.  Just like when I flirt on-line, I am just merely trying to get to know the other person better, not because I want to be their girlfriend.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To make things clearer, I would only think that a guy wants something more if he merely approaches me out of nowhere, that is if he had been a stranger in the first place. Or if he does anything that gives me reason to believe that he wants something more. Other than that, I don't see any reason why I would not be just friends with guys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sparkle:<br>ya, i do have to admit that rejection is as hard to say out as to telling a gal that i like her cos u know u are like ending a friendship...i talked to Rinoa before and truly understand how she felt when she gotta reject her good friends. but unless he moved his first step clearly that he wanna be more than just friends, i think u should not be too worried and i believe that gals are more sensitive than guys, u gals seems to know when the guy has fallen in love with u, so maybe if u sense something wrong, u will wanna avoid him and i bet he can catch the signal...</div>

I rarely give out my contact to guys that I just met, even if I feel like he is worth my friendship, I will just tell him that I will be at this club again next Sat or whatever.
