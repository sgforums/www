Moreover, I will be picking the girl, rev will be asking for the number, you got nothing to do, so you just fork out the reward for the winner lor. everyone must play a part mah. But if you insist, your suggestion is also not bad, if i lose, the lunch treat you are supposed to give me in the singles thread will just cancel out lor, i got nothing to lose.  But i wonder, even if rev manages to get the girl's number, it doesn't necessarily mean that the girl will want to have a meal with you wat. how you treat her?? so if she refuses to eat with you, i will just sacrifice myself and get the treat from you for her. how? and hor, rev also not stupid what, even if he wins, he gets nothing. tell you what, rev, i make sure I choose a very very pretty girl for you, so your prize will be the phone number of the pretty girl, not bad too rite?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>inzaghi,<br>i think it all boils down to the fact that you want to get to know the girl, if not get to know her sisters if she has any. Leave that girl alone lah, if rev gets her number, then you don't go and disturb them. I tell you, I have a very pretty elder sister, if you treat me well enough, i may consider introducing her to you. Want or not?? But you must be very very very nice to me first, and start showering me with lots of presents and goodies...i just saw a really nice pair of sparkling diamond earrings the other day..you noe what to do now??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well well.......<br>this has been discussed many times and its so difficult to get a uniform answer.<br><br>I would say it depends on each individual.  Lets just have three scenarios.<br><br>First scenario: gal likes the boy (or vice vs) in a special way but onlie one-sided.  The outcomes will be<br>1) The boy can't take rejection and the frenship is lost leow.<br>2) The boy can take rejection and frenship con't without any difference.<br>3) The boy can take it but there is some strain in the frenship leow.<br><br>Second scenario:  When both parties like each other leow.<br><br>1) Both get together happily ever after<br>2) Got together but realise that better off as frens and go back to past.<br>3) Realised not suitable after all and relationship turns sour and not easily remedied.<br><br>Third scenario:  When both knows that they reallie click well as frens but not so as a couple.<br><br>1) remain as frens and let time wash away that special feeling and develop a pure platonic frenship.<br>2) heck care and try and fail miserably<br>3) heck care and try and stay together as can come to a compromise.<br><br>ehheheaaaaaa......so platonic or not depends on each person's character and ability to handle situations......    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Some can take it so they can enjoy company of the opposite sex freely whereas some can't take it and so o prevent any 'mishaps' they avoid being close to the opposite sex.  So we gotta ask yourself which type do we belong to and which type does the 'platonic fren' belongs to loh...... Its inevitable that some sparks may fly betw two ppl of the opposite sexs when they get to know each other more and become closer.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>heheheaaa....sounds complicated?  Well, bo bian!  Thats life........as the saying goes, "frens come and go"............<br><br>[This message has been edited by TinDonGal (edited 24 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree with the possible outcomes that tindongal has suggested, but I think you usually will be able to discover how the two people felt in retrospect. I tend to think that before someone says something, signals are easily misintepreted; words are easily misunderstood; actions are taken the wrong way.<br><br>If 2 people have the same intentions, then all will become well. If 2 people have different intentions but manage to work it out, thats just as well. Thats basically what I think Tindongal is trying to say, but I just think that in practice its not easy to assess before anyone reveals anything.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If i could add my 2 cents worth. i think all in all a platonic relationship can be maintain but it depends on the mentality of the person involved. One might think possible while the other think otherwise then i think the relationship cannot continue then.<br><br>i have come across ppl who were bf gf b4 maintain their friendship till both get married and have kids they still go shopping together even with family. she happened to be a relative.<br><br>in view of this there are oso ppl started out as frens but feeling developes. it is oso possible. this is a close fren.<br><br>Wat i am trying to say is when it comes to feelings u cant quantify them. when it happens it happens. You cant say a guy befriend a gal surely wants somethings more. Sometime guys do need a diff view of things and gal are better observers and are usually more patient with ppl.<br><br>Keep an open mind and the possiblities are endless.<br><br></div>
