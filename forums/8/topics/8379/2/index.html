One will only cheat themselves once they limit their options.  So what if you have a guy to gal relationship, or a gal to gal relationship, or even a guy to guy relationship.  At the end, the only thing that counts is who was there when you needed them the most...who was there to stand by you when you needed support...who was there to care for you...and of coz friendship is not just a one-way street...<br><br>To me, flirting is just an art of communication.  It is when one reads too much into another person's words that makes misunderstanding happens.<br><br>Okie...I feel like I am yakking away already! ahahhahaa time for me to shuddup!<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm,<br><br>in my view a platonic relationship is possible. Had a very good and close gal friend before but when she got married, we're kinda not so close. I don't really think I should talk to her that much after all I do think her husband might get jealous though. We had been really close and good friends for like 2 years if I remember correctly. I do call her on ocassion now to ask her about her baby but nothing much to talk as compared to the past.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inzaghi,<br>guess what u said is true also, but since i'm still a student now, i seriously doubt that guys who just approach me out of nowhere now only want to build up their social network. probably like what you once said, I'm of no worth to them right now. So I can just eliminate the possibility that they just want to build up their contacts.<br><br>[This message has been edited by sparkle (edited 18 July 2000).]</div>

But what if the above scene is played out when we're only in our 1st or 2nd year of uni? Would he be thinking about establishing contacts 2-3 years ahead, even if he's from the same faculty??<br><br>yes, i understand what you are trying to tell me. People do approach others just for the sake of building social networks. Afterall, things get done easier when you have the contacts. That's why we should be open about meeting new people. But do you also understand what I'm trying to say? Many guys approach girls for other reasons than what you have mentioned. And that is why, to answer the original qn posed by you, some girls think that guys who approach them out of nowhere probably wants to be more than friends (simply becoz so many such guys exist).<br></div>
