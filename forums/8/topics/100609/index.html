            <div class='col-md body'>Topic inspired by the following article<br><br><blockquote>Source : <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/sub/life/story/0,5562,282409,00.html?" rel="nofollow">http://www.straitstimes.com/sub/life/story/0,5562,282409,00.html?</a><br><br>Nov 1, 2004<br>Girl talk<br>Oh no, I've to pay double<br><br>Bargaining is a life skill that combines charm, wit and street smarts and I don't have it<br>By Tee Hun Ching<br><br>AGHAST at what I'm paying for a photography package, my friend Bing suggested I go back to the studio and get the price slashed.<br><br>Failing which, I should wangle some sweeteners.<br><br>Tell them your friends paid much less (hers cost less than $1,000, mine is double that).<br><br>Ask them to throw in freebies (she got cards printed with her pictures).<br><br>Say it nicely, she summed up.<br><br>I looked at her, helpless and sheepish.<br><br>I am bad at bargaining.<br><br>Bing, I'm positive, is an anomaly among my peers.<br><br>The policy of fixed prices predates our birth, so where did she go to hone her haggling skills?<br><br>Even in shopping havens such as Bangkok and Hong Kong where only idiots don't bargain, I'm pathetic.<br><br>The scene usually plays out thus: The girl quotes me a price. I counter with a figure half of hers. She shaves 20 per cent off her asking price.<br><br>I try again, topping my previous offer by 10 per cent, the tremor in my voice betraying my faltering nerves.<br><br>She shakes her head, repeats her 'best price' and watches me impassively.<br><br>As I struggle to make a decision, she loses interest and turns away.<br><br>I'm left stranded like a fool. I walk away, betting that her bravado will crumble and I will soon be begged to return.<br><br>I'm now miles away and still, no pleading cries.<br><br>Then, like the loser that I am, I return and settle for her miserable 20 per cent discount even though I know I've been had.<br><br>You would think that guys, with their thicker hide, are better at this game.<br><br>'When I have to deal with my contractor, I always get my Mum to go along with me,' an otherwise fearless male colleague confesses.<br><br>Another has decided to give Sim Lim Square a miss because he can't take the stress of having to bargain his heart out for every item and still leave feeling as if he has been outwitted.<br><br>He just heads for Mustafa Centre, where prices are fixed but generally lower than those of major electronics stores.<br><br>Even Bing is not invincible.<br><br>When she failed to have a dish for her wedding banquet upgraded to one of higher value, she roped in her mother-in-law.<br><br>The elder woman delivered a winning pitch: 'You are a five-star hotel. Surely you don't want so many people to think you serve such mass-market fish?'<br><br>The seabass was promptly replaced by red garoupa.<br><br>Haggling, it seems, is a dying art in Singapore.<br><br>It is not just an instinct for a good deal and then going for the kill.<br><br>It is also a life skill that requires charm, tact and quick thinking to counter the shifting sands in an ongoing negotiation.<br><br>Used to the clear signals and targets that guide our entire lives and define things as either black or white, we often lose our bearings when treading on grey areas.<br><br>Life is so easy and comfortable, we've lost our parents' knack of working around bumps and humps.<br><br>We act only when the green light has been given, rather than push ahead till we are told to stop.<br><br>A friend, who grew up in the days when taxis came without meters and fares had to be agreed upon before the journey starts, points out the difference: 'We bargain because we have nothing to lose. But you all think: 'What if the man screams at me?' Your skin is so thin.'<br><br>Liang, a friend my age who is working in Beijing, notes how people there 'love it when the rules are not so clearly defined'.<br><br>When dos and don'ts are not all cast in stone, the fluid system fosters adaptability and creativity.<br><br>It forces people to be resourceful when faced with hurdles.<br><br>It trains people to be street-smart and field curved balls.<br><br>Even something as simple as crossed communication wires can trip us up.<br><br>A colleague, who has been based in Beijing for the past two years, recalls being stunned by a local taxi driver two weeks after he arrived.<br><br>'How much do you make a month?' the man asked point-blank.<br><br>The good, honest Singaporean blood in him urged him to give a straight answer, but the desire for privacy held him back.<br><br>After wrestling with his conscience, he finally managed a vague 'few thousand yuan'.<br><br>These days, he is a lot smarter.<br><br>To such personal questions, which he has learnt form an acceptable part of social interaction in China, he replies with 'bu hao shuo' (hard to say) or 'hai ke yi' (can do or so-so).<br><br>'These can convey a whole lot of meaning without saying anything in particular,' he says.<br><br>I should have picked up this nifty deflection earlier.<br><br>Recently, one of a few contractors I called asked for my renovation budget after being briefed on what I wanted done to the apartment.<br><br>Instead of giving him a blithe 'bu hao shuo', I answered him honestly.<br><br>When I told my father about it later, he laughed at my naivete. 'You should have pressed him for a quotation instead. Now, his costing will exceed your budget.'<br><br>True enough, when the quote came back a day later, it was $7,000 more than what I was prepared to fork out.<br><br>My lame bargaining line - 'Can be cheaper or not?' - worked no magic.<br><br>It could well be that I had been unrealistic in my budgeting.<br><br>But my father had made his point - younger Singaporeans may be bursting with textbook knowledge, but they sure need tuition when the real world beckons.<br></blockquote></div>
