            <div class='col-md body'>A fortnight ago, i encountered a new kind of scam. It was 12mn, and i was sitting in my living room, reading my newspaper. My wooden door was opened, (but the metal grille was locked lar), because i wanted to enjoy the natural breeze. Then suddenly, a malay lady approached me. And she appeared really distraught and at a loss.<br><br>She said that her husband is working in the late shift, and that her baby infant is running a severe fever. She says she has run out of cash at home, but she urgently needs the money to bring her baby to A&amp;E. Somemore, she stressed that she lives one unit above me. (I am indeed aware that my neighbours upstairs is a muslim family, so i never doubted this part of the plot).<br><br>Out of sympathy, i gave her a $50 note, and she said she will return the money to me. within the night itself or the next day when here hubby returns from work. But yeah, in the end, u know.. i didnt get the $ lar. I went up one level to speak to my muslim neighbours and they denied having any persons with a baby infant in the household.<br><br>The cheater's plot is credible because<br>1) Some muslim families are indeed so poor that at times, there will be no $ at home one.<br>2) It is common, that Muslim Men are really hardworking people, and they will work late shifts to earn more $ to support their family.<br>3) The cheater already knows that the neighbours living above me are muslim family, so it was easy to lie the premise of her story that she lives upstairs.<br>4) Manipulation of a mother's love for her infant child. Wah this really got to me. My heart jz caved in to this.<br><br>so Yeah. kudos to such a Brillant plot. KNN.. I admit defeat ler.. ;-(<br><br></div>

But i guess.. at that moment in time. humans being an visual being, will be so grossly concentrating their attention at what their eyes sEe.. i.e. A mother is Distress, she needs HELP.<br><br>Hmm yeah..i need to be more rational next time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Bond with your neighbours. It's not about pride and stuff.<br><br>Another way is to ask her come in, you lock the door immediately in case she got a "look out" for her, if you dont lock, it might well end up into a burglary.<br><br>Once lock the door, take all keys, call hospital using a cordless phone. Distance yourself with her. Make sure she is not armed.<br><br>By doing so,<br><br>1) You sure she's real.<br>2) If she's fake, you locked her in. Police will deal with her. 1 less trickster in the world.<br>3) The look-out cannot harm you.<br>4) You have advantage over her. She cant harm you.</div>
