Over the same three-month period, they grabbed more iPods - a far higher 4.6 million units.<br><br>Mr Sim said he expects global sales of all MP3 players to double to 60 million this calendar year alone.<br><br>To get 40 per cent of that pie, he has announced a US$100 million marketing blitz and deployed over 1,300 engineers in research and development just to fight the 'MP3 player war'.<br><br>Mr Sim also plans to grow his market share through big United States retail players such as supermarket giant WalMart and on-line giant Amazon.com.<br><br>Another strategy is to team up with major original equipment manufacturers, giving them access to Creative's design, technology and manufacturing capabilities, and either branding the products as their own, or co-branding with Creative's own brand-name.<br><br>'We have successfully migrated ourselves from the old world (producing sound cards) to the new world (making MP3 players),' said Mr Sim, who described the current challenges as '100 times more exciting than the Soundblaster days'.<br><br>Creative made its name with Soundblaster personal computer audio systems.<br><br>The personal digital entertainment segment, which includes MP3 players, now makes up 64 per cent of Creative's revenues, he added.<br><br>Creative is now poised to take on the big consumer electronics giants. 'We are now in that league,' he said.<br><br>As for future trends, Mr Sim said it is just a matter of time before MP3 players are equipped with mobile phone capability.<br><br>'The moment that the cell phone and MP3 markets converge, we will enter the market with full credibility. I have good audio. I will have a strong MP3 position. I will also have tens of millions of customers using my products. I will be a tough nut to crack,' he said.<br><br>Rather than compete with him, the electronics giants might want to team up with him given the value-added he can offer, said Mr Sim.<br><br>Creative also announced yesterday that net profit for the second quarter fell 71.4 per cent to US$11.8 million after it wrote off US$65.2 million in acquiring a computer graphics maker in 2002. But for the current quarter, Creative is targeting a 50-per-cent jump in revenues.<br><br>(WHO'S NEXT TO TALK BIG &amp; ACT SMALL?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With Ipod, Apple has effectively created a new product category of lifestyle MP3 products and has declared itself the market leader. This proves to be self prophecizing when consumers rushed forward to buy into the trend, fashion and hipness that the Ipod represents.<br><br>Having created this product category, Apple sets the rules, and decides for the consumer what's hip and what's not.<br><br>When a product category is created like this and adopted by the consumers, the creator has free play in going any directions and still have consumers follow suit. For example, Ipod would build a color LCD screen and declared that this is coolest feature to have. Consumers rush forward to buy. The rest of the manufacturers had to follow to make color LCD screens too. By then, Apple has already thought up new things to put on the Ipod.<br><br>The next point is industry's support. Ipod successfully garnered support from 3rd party manunfacturers making speakers, headphones and other gadgets for the Ipod effectively spuring a cottage industry around its product. To the consumers, buying an Ipod means buying a product supported by not just Apple alone, but also the support from the MP3 gadget industry. Will 3rd parties Ipod gadget manufacturer allow Ipod to lose popularity? The answer is no. The verdict is that Apple has built strong allies and thus, any acts to try to tilt Ipod's leadership will only be met with strong defence not from one company, but from an entire ally.</div>
