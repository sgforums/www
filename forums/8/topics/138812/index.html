            <div class='col-md body'><br>Well not all ladies here are like that but what I do agree is that the typical singapore ladies tend to be more materialistic. Maybe its the environment. Who knows?<br><br>My mum was a Malaysian before she became a Singaporean. She is very kind. I've known some lady friends that are Malaysian. They are very nice people too. Some people might often end up calling girls from Malaysia simple mineded and stuff but its simply not true. The fact is after what I have experienced, there is only a minor difference that makes a lot of difference. They are more KIND-HEARTED. They can be very good friends and can be there when you need them. Local ladies on the other hands however have a tendency to "qin tian shong shan, yu tian shou shan." Local ladies are YES very sophisticated I agree to the point of being shallow, they judge you by a lot of materialistic stuff yet they do not want to admit it. Hypocritical. Malaysian girls on the other hand will be honest enough to tell you outright.<br><br>Thats my view to your thread.<br>And my closing address is "Bing dong san cher, fei yi ri zhi han"<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Harris_JeyaRaj:</div><div class="quote_body">Face it.

In a world class fight the Singaporean girls lose out hands down.Their not being as good-looking as Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, etc. girls is not their fault.

They always think they are so damn cosmoploitan and worldy and stylish and such and such. They only think good things of themselves. Whenever tehre is something screwed up in their lives, their country i.e. Singapore they just say "oh, it is the fault fo the Singaporean guys.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, you are all right. The problem with most Singaporean chicks [I won't say all as there are still some nice ones out there] nowadays is that they watch too much teenage idol dramas, Korean dramas and too much U.S drama serials. Always try to fantasise that they are the female leads inside and replicate them in real life. The worst is that they have the tendency to think that they are very high-class and pretty. High class? Pretty? My ass!<br><br>Some S'porean girls out there are really capable and are able to achieve material success in life and it's really admirable. But what happen to those who cannot make it in life and yet want to satisfy their lust for a luxurious lifestyle, they will adopt the theory of Mother Nature by transforming into a parasite or a leech that feast heartily on their host to survive. But do not be surprised as this is a day in the life of a typical parasite.<br><br>Let me cite one real life example, not exactly but close: I got a good female friend called Linh and one day, Linh was having lunch with her other female friend and me. Linh lamented that she run out of money. And do you know what her other female friend said? She told Linh that if she needs money, she can always get it from me since I came from quite a well-to-do family. What more can I say? Of course, this is just a mediocre case to serve as a supporting example. I believe that there might be other worse experiences that a S'porean boy face. Do tell.<br><br>But of course, there are always exceptions. My above comments do not necessarily apply to all S'porean girls and if you are not one of them, there is really no need to get too worked up.
