Race drivers are trained to always expected the unexpected... and the training is designed in such a way to increase our "instantaneous" reflexes... a trained racing driver can definately avoid the "tai tai who does something stupid" better than your average driver. Have you ever watched racing on TV? Ever seen a 1st lap 1st corner pile up? Imagine having nowhere to go... the whole point is not just about racing well... but about reacting well... and that is my point. A racing driver has been trained up to react fast, AND more importantly, react smart in any sort of unexpected situations. Hence he/she WILL be better prepared to react to any unexpected on the road situations than any normal driver. And don't think everyone is always going in the same direction... you'd be suprised how often newbies end up facing the wrong way n decide to take a trip the other way 'round...</div>

If u watched last sunday's F1 race at Germany, you can see..... 1st lap 1st corner only....... wham blam thank you ma'am!<br>As for unskilled idiots.......... all I can say was once due to an unskilled idiot out on track during practice session, my friend following behind me ran right up my left rear wheel and flew past me on the left side... b4 nose diving onto the tyre barriers...

And oh I do hold a interntaional racing licence so i am sure i know what i am talking about when i speak fo track racing. You? speaking about track racing from what? from nothing? if u never experienced it before at a pro level then maybe you should consider twice before you want to speak on something you know nuts about. why don't you expose yourself more to the world instead..........grow up? i'll grow up when you get a life... gramps...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI racing on the track in fact can teach you good driving habits.... so its not 2 diff. things... only tt there are oncoming vehicles... Like wad heng@ said.. they can teach u how 2 react quick in order 2 avoid accidents cos in the normal rd speeds are nt as fast as opposed 2 the track... so u hafta be fast if not u'll hit the tyre wall or something or get caught in a pile-up</div>
