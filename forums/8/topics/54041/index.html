We'd all eat u alive n run circles around u. On the road, anyone who does has the ability to do well is bound to be a damned good driver on the road as well.<br><br>If u can overtake by diving down the inside into a 90 degree corner, outbraking your opponent at the same time have enough awareness to avoid giving the other rival behind you enough of an opening to slip through plus having to think about your line and exit traction and slip angle of your tyres for max accel out of the corner plus setting up for the upcoming 180 hairpin which is less than 5 metres away and all that while out in the hot sun, no aircon, suited up in a thick nomex suit and helmet and u r roasting alive and your eyes are stinging from your sweat.......... see how much brainpower n general awareness is needed? If u can do that then driving on the road normally is a piece of cake.</div>
