In comparison, women because of their nature tend to be more careful.<br><br>I read somewhere that it is because of the above that men tend to be involved in fewer accidens on the whole but when there are accidents it will be more serious accidents (take more risk) whereas women tend to have more minor accidents (skretching car park pillars) etc<br><br></div>
