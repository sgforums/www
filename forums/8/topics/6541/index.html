            <div class='col-md body'>OK everyone...I have not posted since God knows when..I think nearly 3 months ago already...but something I read in the papers had sparked this off...so here goes !<br><br>In Sunday Plus, Sumiko Yan (the ever-enterprising Japanese Lady) has written an article about "women wasting their eggs". A sort of auto-biographical and cynical way to comment on Singapore's women I guess.<br><br>The question is: What role does marriage have to play in many girls' lives ? Do they actually wish to marry and have kids soon, or would rather adopt the attitude mentioned in the article (which is career first, or maybe no maternal instincts etc...)<br><br>My friends in University always complain their bf are so career-minded, and never seem to give a dam* about settling down, so don't even THINK about children.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But I feel that  eventually when they start working, they might be saying the same thing too.<br><br>As for guys, please comment on your idea of marriage and having kids...seems one reason why Sumiko is undable to get hitched and married is becos she meets "men who have a phobia of marriage".....is this JUSTIFIED ?<br><br>Personally, let's just say that I am the kind of guy who looks for true love with a woman, and to settle down with her and start a family as soon as possible. But the dream always remains a dream for me because I am not even attached yet. Still, I see couples all over the place "wasting" their chances to enjoy a good, happy family life because they have postponed it for work-related reasons.<br><br>So how do u think I feel about this ? It's the classic case of "I wish I could be in his shoes"...because some men (and women) don't appreciate being attached and don't feel any commitment to getting married or having children.<br><br>It may sound sad everyone....but to me, those who truly believe in love and marriage and having kids seldom find their right partners; whereas those "bastard" guys who neglect their gf and are too "career-minded" get the girl's undying love and afection.<br><br>It's happened to me in real life and I've seen it, so don't say it's not true. It's just a sore spot for any unattached person, whether girl or guy.<br><br>I know a friend (girl) who is worried to be a spinster for the rest of her life....yet she is a nice girl, passionate and not bad looking. Who can explain why she was never approached by men ?<br><br>Please feel free to air your comments....I would really like some frank opinions on this.<br><br>Hopefully Singapore is not as "condemned" as I assumed it always was...when it comes to settling down and having children at least..<br><br>Cheers all !   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whiz<br>Cool topic u have...as for me...career is secondary as long I have a happy family to settle down. Of cos I would like to put my career into its peak before I devote all my life and dedication to my family...I love kids and preferbly have 2 and I think it is my responsibility and raise them well and provide them a good education...I have a very good feeling about my future family and that is important...<br>One have to look at all possible reasons why a couple does not want to have children...is it because of finanacial burden or woman are afraid the side effects of conceiving, like growing fat, having stretch marks or varicose veins?<br>As to why the female fren u have are not approached by men...there are a few  possibilities...maybe she is too ncie and ppl feels that she is easily manipulated...some man like woman to have an opinion of their own...or she might be giving guys the idea she is not interested in a relationship...<br><br>Or woman should ask why they are so often appraoched by man instead haha...?I want to know.<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 12 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on your reflections of the subject, I do not think that this only applies to Singapore women but rather to the women population as a whole.<br><br>Nowadays, due to the over-emphasis of materialism and basic survival in everyday life, men and women are inclined to feel threatened. In reponse to that, men who have always been the career-oriented creature, turn to the alternative (love and security i.e. family) whereas women would turn to careers. Its neither right nor wrong to do so as their basis of doing so is instinctive. Women have been 'condemned' to be child-baring machines for centuries and finally, they are able to have their say in life and get what they really want - equility in society. Many will develop egos just like men. Men feel threatened and many of them will retreat while others will fight head-on by 'proving' that they can manage both sides of their lives (family &amp; career) just as well as women. However, maternal instincts will catch up on the career women sooner or later. All humans want to lead a stable life in every aspect possible. There are many who will up give everything that they've worked for and others will remain in their careers. To say that the latter group does not 'regret' the path is nearly impossible as they'll too will need someone to spend old age with.<br><br>The most important thing to do is to keep an open-mind about absolutely everything in life and take it as it comes. Always know your priorities but do not only SEE those and nothing else.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm.<br><br>Some women don't give a damn about children and so do some men.  I don't think your sex has a lot to do with whether you are more inclined to have children or not.  It's good that the feminist grandma's few decades ago have freed women from having to have children and to want them so now women can choose.<br><br>Choice is good.<br><br>I asked the forum last month on their reasons why they want to have children in view of the varicose veins, the constant back ache and pain in giving birth, financial drain etc...the replies were encouraging, maybe you can have a look.<br><br>Personally, yes, I would love children and I agree with Rinoa that we are responsible of giving them a good environment for growing up, and I suppose it means enough money to pay for french language course or to buy the hyper play station V 99 (exaggeration, since I'm not having kids all that soon)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt;&gt;As for guys, please comment on your idea of marriage and having kids...<br><br>ok ok, my 5 cents worth.<br><br>Marriage ?<br>Well, i myself is a very family person. I have been making sure that i will become a good husband all these years. Learning how to cook ... so that i can cook my wife nice food when she is pregnant or when she is tired (so children won't starve  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ), thinking of a job that have flexible time but yet high pay ... so that I can have more time with my family etc etc.<br><br>But as i grow older, i do find marriage a horrible thing. You see, you choose this ONE person and give her your eveything. You are going to spend the rest of your life with her. If she is the right one, excellent, but wat if she is not ? This gal may be your right one now but may not be so in 20 years' time.<br><br>There is a lot of things to consider when choosing a life partner, not only love. I am not saying that love is not important. It is. Love is the foundation to a marriage. But character, background, thinking, believes and ideals are all important. It does not mean that a ger with excellent character will be a good wife.<br><br>Marriage is a gamble. When I think of the consequences, sometimes I fear. What if my marriage failed ? All those people queuing up to divorce once married because of love.<br><br>I believe most of you had watched American Beauty right ? What if your family turned out to be like that ? I'll rather be single. Remember Ally McBeal once said, "I'll rather remain single than to live with someone wrong for me" (can't remember her exact words) And pple nowadays do have the ability to live alone, adopt a child ...<br><br>It's not that I am phobia of marriage but it is a big decision in life. This decision once made has no turning back. Huang Shu Jun has a song which sings, "wo(1) xu(1) yao(4) gen(4) duo(1) yong(3) qi(4), cai(2) neng(2) cheng(2) nuo(4) ai(4) ni(3) zi(4) si(3) bu(4) yu(2), fo(3) ze(2) yi(4) shi(2) cuo(4) wu(4) de(3) jue(2) ding(1), que(4) yao(4) zong(1) shen(1) lai(2) shou(1) shi(2) can(2) ju(2)" Which means : I need more courage before i can pledge my eternal love to you. I dun wish to spend the rest of my life clearing up a mess i created due to a moment of folly (marriage). Very true you know. It is easy to just propose to a woman but hard to live with one <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Well, I am still looking forward to have a happy family (who dun?). But i just want to be more careful in choosing a partner. I used to think that XXX ger is my ideal wife, but after some time, i turned out to be wrong. Then I thought YYY is my ideal wife ... once agin she is not. You can easily (or not so easily lah) break up with your gf, but it is very difficult to divorce especially when you already have kids. And you thought the ordeal will end after divorce, but actually, it just started.<br><br>I like to tok to married pple and ask them about marriage, well here's something i like to share with you guys :<br><br>"enjoy your youth, marry later" -- a 35 man on the verge of divorcing<br><br>"choose a wife who can go thru not thick but thin with you. Someone who will not run away from you when you are in trouble" -- a 35 yr old man married for 7 years<br><br>"Just do it" -- a man 12 years into his marriage<br><br>"It's the small little things that break up a marriage, like nagging, untidy, different ways of living one's life etc etc. And these things cannot be seen when you are dating your gf" -- a man 8 years into his marriage<br><br>"Marriage is lots of hardwork, both persons must be willing to work at it. Any one give up, the marriage is over" -- a man 10 years into his marriage<br><br>"Before marriage, follow your heart, after marriage follow your brains ... and heart" -- a man 12 years into his marriage.<br><br>I always believe that you should think and think and think if this person is right for you be4 marrying her/him. But after marriage, dun think any more !! Haha.<br><br>Well, I am definitely a family man. But I have better things to do now, marriage can come later. I cannot face the consequences, so I will tok about it later.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>How i wish i am still a kid, so that my parents will make decisions for me ... if they make the wrong decision, i can blame them .. hehe .. blaming myself is just too painful.<br><br>But there is definitely something which I had learned : It is more important for us to learn to work things out togethr than to search for that perfect one and assume everything will be perfect if he/she really appears.</div>

See, Musicwhiz, this has to eventually gotten back to your thread!<br><br>Affairs are real. Ultimately, some men appear to be able to ply between the family and the wayward delectable flower... and yet assume no guilt. They are able to rationalise this by differienting between the social cognetiality of a sanctified instituition (marriage) and the excitement of a fresh diversion ; the brilliant part of course is they want the best of both worlds. If you subscribe to capitalism, then you will have to negotiate in a world where money can buy you power in which you can use to trade for human relationships.<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>No universal history leads from savagery to humanitarianism, but there is one leading from the slingshot to the megatonne bomb.<br><br>Adorno</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, musicwhiz,<br><br>Hmmm, Sumiko Tan is famous for writing provocative and provoking articles. The last article which I was really amused and almost thought of rebutting her, was her article in defence of Ally Mcbeal...<br><br>The whole problem with the current rising of women being singles, is brought about by the changes of modern society. Of course, it was all due to the woman sufferage and liberation in the 1960s. This liberation has changed the role of woman as being the person who cleans the house, give birth and look after children and doing other household chores. Of course, now, they can be financially independent and do not need to find a guy because they can look after themselves.<br><br>Of course, modern society has introduced many anomalies than before. First of all, you can think about the contemporary view of marriage. Basing it back to Singapore, marriage is a legal contract, and opens the gateway to ownership of flats and many of the other privileges like shared accounts in banks and stuff. The living standards of modern society can no longer be supported by single income but by dual income.<br><br>Because women now have choice, the original role of being a housewife and mother has been slightly modified. They can choose not to have that role. As in their own pursuit of their dreams, they decided to give up finding that someone. This is the price of liberty.<br><br>Of course, this leads to less marriages and now people are looking at cohabitation. Well, there is no longer responsibility needed. Sometimes, I wonder, the liberation of women gave a lot of good things, like having equal rights (since I believed in the equality of sexes), but it leads to social repercussions. So, it leads to a serious problem, as it is a social norm to procreate and bring about the next generation, but instead women choose "to waste their eggs".<br><br>Strangely, most of my friends are getting married recently. Heard of more and more going to ROM, and I am the only the single guy left in my class. I know that guys don't subject to social pressure, but sometimes, I envy most of my friends who are attached or married, they can have the chance to share their lives with someone. Well, this is the price of wanting to get a doctorate. I may become a Doctor so and so years later and have a good career, but I guess I don't have the joy of having an early marriage, compared to most of my friends.<br><br>Just my own 2 pennies worth....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Rinoa,<br><br>Similarly, even if a guy have the most nice gal as his gf and eventually this nice gal changed her heart. What I am trying to say here, is that it works both ways. I know one thing, I did not change when I was out there in UK last year, and my gf who was thought by many not to changed, change and committed the act of betrayal.<br><br>From the way I see it, when someone changes his or her heart, it is terrifying, and sometimes, perhaps the way our society, it is very difficult to really know whether we should trust our instincts to love or not...<br><br></div>
