But if they can genetically modify a crop such that it is self resislant against insects and could produce the essential minerals and vitamins for our survival, it is okay. Recently, Reader's Digest carried an article about genatically modified rice. It is worth reading.<br><br>Furthermore, for plants, even the rice you each was a process of cross breeding over the years.

            <div class='col-md body'>The act of DNA modification in GM is not just removal of DNA. It is not restructuring without usage of external genes.  Even removing an atom or molecue can destabilize the entire food structure.  Rather, genetic engineering comprises of gene-transfer , replacing the removed gene cell with another version from another source.  Due to that, characteristics of an original food can mutate, resulting in higher level of toxins in it.<br><br>That said, genes from animals can be transferred into plants.  Ignoring vegeterians, GM-food inherently carries the characteristics of the newly transferred gene.  Consumers allergic to milk can suddenly find themselves having allergic reactions to beef or even vegetables.  Such allergic reactions, which can cause death depending on severity, are already appearing in the US, although most consumers are not aware of it themselves since they now do not know what they are really eating(which also make causes of illnesses harder to trace).  In fact, researchers from Cornell University had reported caterpillars that ate leaves dusted with pollen from GM corn sickened and died.<br><br>Selfish reasons aside, it is also detrimental to the environment.  Crop pests feeding on GM-crops become even stronger, rendering pesticides useless.  Not to mention weeds too.  "Solution": Pesticides stronger than its current industrial strength.<br>This also means even more antibiotic-resistant bacteria, as genetically engineered crops contain genes which confer resistance to antibiotics, that can potentially infect humans.<br><br>While Science has advanced, DNA is like the human brain, not well understood in most parts.  Scientists today don't even know the functions of more than 95% of the human DNA.  The workings of a single cell are so complex, no one knows the whole of it, and who knows the long term effect of food with modified DNAs.  Even scientists in the Food and Drug administration (FDA) have raised numerous concerns.<br><br>[This message has been edited by delerium (edited 09 June 2002).]</div>
