            <div class='col-md body'>Well, since you want us to share our experiences, I'll do that. But let me just say that I prefer to hold on, not too hard, but just enough, to the things that happen to me. Whatever happens to you becomes part of you and teach you somethings, so I agree that its better to accept these and then go on.<br><br>Well, for me, I had at one period felt sad because I had to go overseas to study and leave people I know behind. Despite all the communication tools available, I grew apart from friends I had known in NS and in school. Why was I sad? Because I was unable to take part in their lives. When I go back something new might have happened and I always find that they have grown a bit different, often for the better. Especially when people start working, they get a whole new take on life. Reacting to these changes is often quite a shock, and before you know it, I have to leave to go back to my studies.<br><br>I really think physical proximity is neccessary for good relationships of any kind. Without that its just not possible to connect properly.<br><br>Perhaps its not a spectacular sadness, maybe its just a disappointment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think death of a loved one is perhaps the saddest thing possible, of all sadness.<br>Personally, 'sad' is too mild a word to describe that feeling. 'Sorrow' is more like the word to use. Like they said, when death happens, you may stop griefing &amp; move on as time goes but you never forget or get over the pain of loss.<br><br>This year marks the 5th death anniversary of my grandfather &amp; 2nd for my grandmother. I grew up with them doting on me &amp; I don't think I can ever get over their passing on. Funny how my eyes still well up whenever I think of them..... In fact, I think I'll rather be sad &amp; grieve for them than see them lie frail with sickness &amp; pain (with all those tubes sticking into them) on the hospital bed. The torment of seeing them suffer, plus your helplessness at their slipping away really wretches your heart.<br><br>Death is a fact of life &amp; I'm learning to deal with it with each passing day. What I'm really glad is I did spend time with them while they were alive...Those were happy memories which I'll give anything for again!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Jubilee (edited 28 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Somehow I've never really felt extreme sorrow. But I remember crying my lungs out at the crematorium when my grandmother's coffin was slid into the furnace.<br><br>It's always easy to hold on to sadness, and then give yourself an excuse to be unhappy, and derive pity from others, but somehow, along the way I sort of figured out that it's not going to help anyone by pitying them. We've got to take an active role in our own future, lives, and we are the masters of our own destiny. I embraced Buddhism when I was 16, accepting it as my way of life, practicing benevolence, and being kind to the best of my abilities. It's been uplifting, to look within the sadness to find a lesson, and renewed enthusiasm for life.<br><br>Hope you people out there find your own inner peace. Be it thru happiness, sadness, whatsoever.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.

But they got over fast coz they still had each other back in Singapore. They had the routiness of everything to get back to. While here I am...all alone &amp; in a totally new environment, fending for myself.<br>No doubt I'm enjoying myself &amp; having fun where I'm at, but it's still sad to hear/read from Singapore how much I'm missing out. Family get-togethers, hanging out with your buddies...etc. Esp. so during festive seasons or special occasions.<br><br>They seemed to go through change together while I feel so left behind, so isolated. But then think again....coz while u feel that left behind, they might feel you've changed while you are gone too. It's actually a two-way process. And like you said, it's often for the better, so in my humble opinion, it's nothing to feel sad or dissappointed about.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Meanwhile, have fun where you are &amp; enjoy yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading this tread until this moment, I have the sudden urge of doing a posting on the forum, 2 share my experiences.<br><br>"Sadness", what is "sadness"? Something U feel unhappiness or having negative feelings I suppose. I too have some sadness that I cannot forget bout had learned 2 accept.<br><br>When I was 10, my dad passed away in a traffic accident. It hit us with a very big wave. The whole family could not take it. His a very gd father in my eyes. He doted on me better than any of my bros.<br><br>Probably BCoz I'm the youngest but I don't think I will ever know Y. The news is something that I couldn't accept at that time. I kept telling myself that it was a mistake but when recognising him at the morgue, I realise I cannot deny this fact anymore.<br><br>The funeral lasted about a week &amp; during that time, I cried the most. He was someone that is too dear 4 me 2 lose but I've lost.<br><br>After the funeral is over, everything changed in the family. Everyone had gone quiet, no one talks. Everyone did their own things &amp; communications became minimum. Although its been more than 10 years but the emptiness &amp; silence between everyone in the family is still there.<br><br>Perhaps we did not communicate 4 so long that it bacame a habit than emptiness, but the warmth that used 2 had no longer existed. Everyone get on with their lives but the home is no longer a home but seems like a shelter that we make used of.<br><br>We don't communicate much now although we R a family, we R more like aquaintances that say "Hi" &amp; "Bye" every time we C each other, nothing much than that I supposed.<br><br>Every single of my friend that knows me well discovered &amp; realised the "coldness" in the home but I think that's it. Although pple believed that we could try 2 bring back wat its used 2 but I don't think any of us had the feeling 2 do that anymore.<br><br>Over the years, I've accepted every single bit of it &amp; realised that I bacame stronger &amp; more independent.<br><br>Just a little advice B4 I end this posting, treasure your parents, B4 U lose them. If they cannot show the type of concern U wanted, try 2 understand. They R like us, learning &amp; there R times that they expressed it in the wrong manner.<br><br>------------------<br>Life is 2 short 2 be unhappy! Play Hard! ^_^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being an eternal optimist myself, I feel the need to contribute......<br><br>To me, sadness is a facet of life.....like a face on a diamond.....sometimes when your mind is clouded with sadness.....all the faces of the diamond look the same....from the surface........<br><br>Initially your mind thinks the diamond is symmetrical.....meaning however u look at it, all u see is sadness.......<br><br>Still, I've found......by clearing your mind....and letting emotions flow....and when time passes....the cloud seems to disappear......and u start to notice that there are imperfections in the diamond....that the faces are not quite the same after all, and not all of them are sad.<br><br>That's when u start to pick up the little pieces.....start to reassemble your life again.....<br><br>I guess what I'm trying to say is....TIME is always the cure for sadness.....but accepting that sadness is a phase and not lifelong....is the most important first step.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like a number of forumites all got pretty upsetting stories... My parents too are divorced and the scenario is almost the same as Willa's. It started around Pri 4 or so for me but drag on till almost my JC days. When one is so young and hear quarrels in the family everyday, it really gets on the nerves. Being the only child in the family does not help either as there was no one to turn to. At that age, dun even have close friends to confine in. So got no choice but to bottle up all the feelings. Cried on a number of occasions as well (Who says guys cannot cry???) The respective relatives of each side all attempt to "justify" and explain the whole situation. Lots of advice came in that says " kids (me) should just concentrate on studies and not bother abt other affairs..Blah blah blah". What the heck! That is my family that is having problems and I'm expected to ignore all that? Felt real depressed especially at the beginning of that period. Learned to cope with time and grew numb of it.<br><br>Even after the official divorce, occasionally I can get really envious of all those happy families that I see around also and often the question is ask that " Why can't my family be like them? Why do I have to go through all these?" Used to avoid questions by friends about my family and all too. But now, I'm not upset anymore. I believe that I've learnt a lot through the experience. It leads to a forced maturity but it also makes me more appreciative of what I have now. No longer do I feel inferior to others cos even though my family is no longer "complete" but I'm still living happiliy and fine. I believe that things earn by my own efforts taste sweeter.<br><br>I may have little material comforts and wealth but I try to see it as a way to motivate myself. It just gives me an incentive to work hard to get whatever I want in future.<br><br>Hope that everyone out there who are experiencing any unhappiness presently or in the past can stand up and overcome the problem.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wrote this letter to a friend last year on 21st Apr 1999. I just had a maor qurrel with my dad and wrote this to confide in my friend.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Hello Jennie,<br><br>Well I am feeling rather down now....and this is why I am wrinting to you to tell you this because I feel that I have to tell someone this to relieve myself of this load. I thank you for letting me share my woes with you.<br><br>My Father have married my mother for over twenty years...but the love between them died long ago... My father earns at least 8k a month excluding profits from shares and drive a mercedes and have a factory. But we live in a 3 room flat and guess how much he give the family per month?...only $500!...of course it is not enough..I still have a younger sister in college now...my dad does not want her to go to Uni because he feels that it will be a waste of money... also he did not want me to go to poly after my 'o' levels because he felt that I can work for him and need not have more education. I decided to support myself thru my poly and I came to the agreement with him that I will work for him for free in my free time. so I somehow managed to survive my poly sleeping only about 4hrs per day. Now I intend to further my studies but he totally disagree with it. Well I tot it is ok for myself but I told him to allow my sister to study but he does not agree... also I told him that he dun have to pay for my sister studies and that I will pay for her...but he refuse..saying that he wants me to pay for the house that he is going to buy and that I will not have money to pay for my sister because of that...now it is not that he cannot pay...but it is just that he wants to fulfill his so called respondsibilty as a father as soon as possible thus not wanting my sister to study further... also wanting me to be able to support the family sooner so that he can leave us eariler. I know all this but never told my mother...but I guess she also knows since ultimately they have been married for so long though they never communicate...they should know what each other is thinking...anyway my mother is also working now to support the family...imagine that!...my mother should be enjoying her life since my dad is quite well to do...but no...my father still complain that we spent a lot of money...he will go and calculate how much I have spent from him...e.g. school fees...clothing...food...so since I am in sec 3 I decided to be independant. I do not want to be depentdant on my father anymore. But I still fulfill my promise to him...I always go and help him during my free time... even during my NS ( which is now) I also go down whenever he requested me to. I have never say no to him...at most I will tell him that I am tired and tel him to let me rest...but I will still go down later to finish the work for him....even if I have to work again on the second day... I will help him out until 3 - 4 am.m sometimes...all this I did in hope that he will understand that there is still something worthwhile to stay on for in the family...me...so I also always want to learn more...and hope that I will be a asset for him...but he never really understand.<br><br>Also I hated ppl who say one thing and do another. But my dad happens to be that type of person. I always hated it when he do something like that...once he was having a casual talk with a client and I am with him... he said this "...nowadays even $2000 is not enough to support a family...." I almost blew up when I heard that but decided to keep my cool. Imagine that he is only giving the family $500 per month and he say that..,, there are also time when he will say he will do this and that but never do..in the end I will be the one who go and do it..after which he will then claim credit for it. I find this terriblely irritating but again I decide to let it rest, since ultimatly he is my father. He had wanted me to take over his business because he wants to let go of this respondsiblilty and go and enjoy himself but my interest is never in printing. I have told him that before and express my wish to pursue my interest in computers but he made a big fuss out of it saying that it will take too long for me to be able to support the family so in the end I agree to take over the printing business to please him ...my mother stays on with my father becase of us...at that time we were still quite young so she still need my father to support the family. Though I am old enough now my sister still need him to support her to go uni(hopefully). But I guess it will never happen, at least not because of him. He is never one to admit to mistakes so whenever someone tells him that he is wrong...he will quarrel with the person and if the person does not give way he will not talk to them again.. in fact he has not talk to his sisters for over 10yrs liao because of some disagreement they had at that time.<br><br>On Monday I finally realise something. I could not believe mself when I realise that I have been living with such a person for so many years.<br><br>On monday, I work until 9 p.m. then I reach home. I was rather tired but my dad had work for me to do. So I do it for him...while he go and watch TV. As I was doing the work I realise that I have done this b4 and it is the same piece I did twodays ago... so I told him that I have done it b4 but he told me that the customer is not happy with it and that I must follow what the customer wants...well of course this is right...but I felt angry because he used to tell me that no matter what you must try to convince the customer that your work is better than what they have in mind...which I felt is worng...and now he is telling me that I have to change the very instant he thinks that he has to satifised the customer... well it might be a small incident but I told him that he is not being consistent im what he is saying. So he became angry(as usual), and denies it...I became angrier as it suddenly occur to me that all that I am doing is not worth it, as I still do not see any change in his attitude. So a small comment by me snowballed into a big quarrel I unleash all my anger and hatred for him on that night. He refused to admit that he was wrong in any way... not even the fact that $500 is not enough to support a family...he says that we dun have to repay him anything for him bring us up...but it is not necessary that he provide us with a comfortable life which he is giving us. And thus we should be grateful. When he said that I really give up on him, what type of comfort has he been giving us? Only unhappiness and truma I guess. then he continue to say alot of other unreasinable things which only made me felt worse...my mother who is there decided that it is no use to carry on like that... I went out of the house and came back to my office to spent my night.<br><br>I smoke that night. I quited smoking two years ago when my ex wants me to quit  and I did not smoke again until that day. I guess I must been feeling really down...but I did not really sleep and have a lot of thoughts...trust me that I am a logical man and think rationally not with anger. I decided that night that I cannot waste my youth and time and energy on a person who does not care anymore.. I also want to pursue my own ideals and dreams and not waste my time to please him anymore, the effort was never recipocrated in anyway. But yesterday morning when I call my mother to ask her how she felt and if everything is all right she told me to let go and not care for him anymore...she said that she is also very tired of holding on to this for so long.., she said that she wants to give up too... she told me that after I left my father said that he will leave and that he will not leave anything behind for us and see if we can survive without him. Personally I think he is just threatening us...$500 doesn't make much of a difference anyway...I can easily make that and I think I am definitely more capable than what he thinks I am and I dun mind him leaving if it will help everybody life become easier. Thus my mother also felt that too... she said that her only worry is that my sister cannot get over this...she have been the victim thoughout all this years as she can never accept the fact that my dad is going to leave anyway... for me I have thought of the worst senario of what will happen, but I also want to make the best out of it. Life ultimately is choice...a choice of whether you want to be brought down by adversity or cross over this obstacle and go on to the journey to sucess. Though I am feeling down now, I am feeling down because I felt dissapointed that I am not able to help my father become a better person and I have to give up on him. I do not fear what is going to happen but I definitely do not welome it.<br><br>I hope you can understand why I made that desicion and I really thank you for hearing me out. You have definitely made my heart feel lighter just by listening to me.<br><br>Callan Chua</span><br><br>Now, I have just began talking with my dad 2 months back, so far still good, but seriously I do not know when the next eruption will come again. But frankly speaking, I believe the basci reason he is talking to me is because I have agreed to help him expand his business regionally, I hope that I will have some say in the decision making process, as that is what he promised me, and the reason why I have agreed to help him. But I am not too hopeful about that now, his old ways are coming back, after 2 months...well, this is the sadness I have to carry with me all my life I suppose...but life goes on, and I think it makes me a stronger person after all.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my first thread goes to Willa....<br>sadness...an emotion that has been constantly reappearing in my life, clunging on to me....<br>i was sad when my parents donÂ’t understand what I really want (they still donÂ’t anyway).....suicide, i've thought of it when i was barely in my teenage years but that was childish thinking on my part....but one particular sad thing was the death of a colleague in a road accident and of my godfatherÂ’s sudden collapse due to a heart problem....death, so distant yet so near....<br>but perhaps what saddens me for a couple of years (it still saddens me now) may be nowhere near what some of u here have experienced....but i feel an impulse to state it all hereÂ…..<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>Since young, I have never felt confident about my looks. I am tanned, short, had hair that needed large doses of hair spray to keep still and spectacles to counter my myopia. I am definitely a Mr. Average, or so I would like to think.<br><br>I spent a good 16 years of my life wallowing in self-pity before finally, God seems to have answered my prayers. I met her. Never mind that she was older than me. Though not in the class of a drop dead gorgeous babe, she was definitely beautiful in her own way. By the fifth week I have known her, I was hopelessly infatuated in her. It took a lot of thinking and courage for me to make advances towards her. I couldnÂ’t believe my luck when she said she love me too.<br><br>Nothing can describe my joy then.<br><br>We had much fun during the first few months of our courtship. She would call to say she misses me every now and then and blah, blah, blahÂ….For once, I was able to experience the feeling of perhaps what they say, true love.<br><br>Life has never been that good. My work as a waiter was enjoyable, my relationship with friends was no longer platonic and best of all, there is Lydia.<br><br>But it all soon came crumbling. The lure of gambling engulfed me when I learned of my friendÂ’s self-made fortune through gambling soccer matches. At first, I betted in small amounts and I won. Gradually, my bets increased two fold, three fold and even five fold on a single soccer match. All it took were a couple of soccer matches and all my previous winnings were depleted. I lost everything that I had made and even lost what I had started out with. I was in the throes of the gambling bug, and my thinking, as you can imagine, was not quite straight. I decided to gamble big on one final match. I knew my fortunes would turn. I didnÂ’t think that I would and could, continue losing.<br><br>But I did.<br><br>Lydia was oblivious to all these. I do not have the courage to tell her the truth for fear of losing her. However, I was so engrossed in recouping my losses and working to repay my debts, I never once took the initiative to call her and she has also grown tired of me giving tons of excuses for not going out with her on weekends. Gone were the long calls throughout the night and silent strolls in the beach and the aimless walks in shopping malls. No doubt, I still love her, not a bit less as of before or maybe even more intense. Lydia seems to think likewise though.<br><br>The final straw probably came when I gave another excuse for not going out with her on ValentinesÂ’ Day. But does she really think that I do not wish to spend that day with her? Its only that I do not have money to even buy myself lunch, much less cough out a couple hundred bucks for flowers and dinner and a gift. Nonetheless, she left a voice message in my pager to ask for a clean break and wished me all the best.<br><br>I was devastated. Walled in by a will that refused to sob, I went to Pasir Ris beach to drown myself with cheap beer. Strolling by the beach, came the inevitable flashbacks in my mind. There, I thought of the times with Lydia. The times I never treasured. The more I thought of it, the more I hate myself. I hated myself for not doing what most guys will do for their girlfriend. I hated myself for neglecting her. I hated myself for personally ruining my life. First love and all, my idiocy was inexcusable.<br><br>The week that followed, I was forced to put on an artificial smile at work and the same too, at home. I do not want anyone to know of my sorrow. That always has been me. It was exactly a week after that I realized I got to get Lydia back, or at least tell her that I still love her a lot and confessed of my gambling ways which got me into the mess today.  Too late, her pager was no longer in use, she had shifted house and there was no way I could contact her as I do not have any of her friendsÂ’ contact number. She was right to leave me. I do not even know when her pager was canceled, when and where and why she had to shift house, and I never made an effort to know her friends. Thinking back, she was too good to be treated like that.<br><br>Perhaps u all may think the story ends here but how I wished it did. On my birthday later that year, I received a card and letter from her. She apologized (it shouldnÂ’t have been me really) for bringing an abrupt end to our relationship and at the same time, said that she was pregnant (donÂ’t get me wrong, me never did that thing to her but let me go onÂ….). It turned out that she somehow got raped by her cousin (she did not say anything further). Raping is tantamount to a spell in jail but then, both their parents came to an agreement to go ahead with the wedding. Not daring to go against her parentsÂ’ wishes, she has to register her marriage with her cousin. But, alas, ROM does not approve of this marriage.<br><br>Though this may not have been my fault, but I always felt guilty and sad since receiving that letter from her. Could I have prevented it? Why must this happen to her? Why??<br><br>4 years had since passed. Shattered dreams and broken hearts, it is not easy for me to mend them and go on with life as it was earlier. I have since drifted in and out of relationships but I still feel very sad as those relationships only brought back memories of Lydia (maybe thatÂ’s why they never seem to last). Sometimes I wonder if I will ever see her again. But one thing is for sure. My failed relationship with Lydia will haunt me forever.<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Well, if u r wondering if I learnt my lessonÂ….me just got back to my gambling ways and currently owe debts over a thousand dollars. Not a lot perhaps, to some of u out here. But to a guy who gets only $200 pocket money per month and is still schooling, its by no means a small amount. With my paltry savings being exhausted long ago, I wonder how I am going to repay the money within a month. IÂ’ve got only myself to blameÂ…..<br><br>P/S: IÂ’m sorry to bore u all but I guess I really need to let it outÂ…Â….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Callan and Disgusting_me:<br><br>I hope willa won't mind me posting here, as I know this is not a thread for chatting. But people do read your posts, and, speaking for myself,  I wish you guys all the best. Sometimes its good to say what you want and to hell with it. Helps with the sadness I think. Recognize the sadness, then kick its butt.</div>
