            <div class='col-md body'>Just back from the show "X-men" which i caught at Tampines Mall.Quite a nice movie,was better than i expected for a comic book adaptation.Spotted a few Easter Eggs in Ice-Man and Jubilee in the movie albeit a short while only,even that guy who created the ice rose was named Bobby,the 1st name of Ice-Man.Here are my comments on the various characters based on my serverely limited X-Men knowledge,heehe<br><br>1)<strong>Cyclops</strong> :- Looks quite similar to the comic version except for the costume,good choice to get James Marsden as he fits the Cyclops look right down to his strong chin and even brown hair.Good thing to ditch the yellow and blue costume and the old Cyclops costume where his hair was covered up,heeh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>2)<strong>Rogue</strong> :- Only similarity with the comic Rogue was the reddish brown hair with a tinge of white at the end,too bad Anna Paquin is not as well endowed as the comic Rogue and doesn't seem to share the spunkiness and gutsiness of the comic Rogue,also in the comic,Rogue was an adult and not a teenager,heeh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>3)<strong>Storm</strong> :- The only character most similar to the 1 in the comic except the 1 in the comic had longer hair and not straight white hair,her costume is also similar,lucky that Bryan Singer decided to go with a black color scheme for the costumes and thus,Storm'<br>s costume remains practically untouched,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>4)<strong>Jean Grey</strong> :- Famke looks the part except that there is something missing that keeps nagging me that she is not Jean Grey as Marsden is to Cyclops.Could be the hair style,but character wise,was quite close to the comic<br><br>5)<strong>Wolverine</strong> :- To be sure,i had my doubts as Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine as he does not seem to have the size nor the edge and  of Wolverine when i 1st saw him.My opinion was changed halfway thru the show as he showed himself to suit Wolverine's part as snug as a glove,right down to that certain berserkness and sarcastic humor of his.But Hugh seems a bit young to be playing Wolverine and his face seems to lack that certain roughness of Logan.I think Harvery Keitel will be a better choice as he has the look of Wolverine and his age also suits it.All in all,Hugh did a great job,especially in his cutting 1 liners,heeh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>6)<strong>Professor X</strong> :- Look the most similar to the comic character next to Storm,has that wise fatherly and authorative air and has the same botak head,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>7)<strong>Magneto</strong> :- Sir Ian McKellen practically shines in this role as Magneto,has that Magneto air similar to Patrick Stewart.Must be all those stage plays they been acting in,heehe.But the costume,the only thing similar was the helmet and his magneto suit looks more like a normal working suit than a suit for a super villain,would prefer if they make his suit look more in keeping with how a super villain should look like,hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one full and everyone around you is hungry.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Diablo 2 rockzzzzzz <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I can't expect too much, considering how difficult it is to play comic book charcters in real life. But the good guys were real weaklings!<br><br>Mystique, Toad and Sabertooth are all fighters. Wolverine is the only half-baked guy among the sissy good guys who can put up a fight! Storm can't fight, Jean Gray can't fight, Rogue can't fight, hell, even Cyclops can't fight!<br><br>I'm not saying that it's a bad movie. I'm just wondering how come the good guys haven't received any martial arts training or something.<br><br>I'm really disappointed with Cyclops. His laser beams were only useful when no one was actually attacking him. Sheesh, how useful can that be?<br><br>If there is a sequel, the king of the baddies should either be Mr.Sinister or maybe even Apocalypse! And I definately want to see Juggernaut! And some Sentinels too perhaps.<br><br>For the goodies, well, there are too many of them I suppose, and since they showed some of the student mutants, I think Iceman and Firestorm are in the making. They should get Gambit, and Morph to counter Mystique, ha ha! And Colossus to counter Juggernaut!<br><br>HA HA HA!!!<br></div>
