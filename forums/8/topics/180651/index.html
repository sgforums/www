''I watched 'Lagaan' and was captured by the music of the film, so I immediately knew that Rahman would be perfect choice for this project,'' he said.<br><br>The film was an official entry for the Oscars but failed to make it to the final five in the Foreign Language Film category.<br><br>'Warriors of Heaven and Earth' was screened as opening film at Sixth Mumbai Academy of Moving Images (MAMI) Film Festival and was also shown at the Second Pune International Film Festival (PIFF) last year.<br><br>The film-maker said, ''Rahman is a joy to work with. He is a man with abundant talent and creativity and yet he is virtuously humble, patient and respectful.'' Asked whether there were differences between the two, he said that there were differences of opinion while working on the score, but it was all worked out very amicably and professionally. The Indian composer had delivered one of the best original soundtracks for the film and he was happy with it, he added.<br><br>Ping said that he would love to work with Rahman again for his next venture. In fact he was looking forward to it.<br><br>About casting Indian actors in his future projects, Ping said he was not really familiar with Indian cinema and its actors so he would first visit India and then decide. He said he had not seen any Bollywood movie except 'Lagaan', but is looking forward to watch more Indian films.<br><br>He agreed that Chinese cinema has definitely got a boost after 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' but insisted that his film 'Warriors...' was very different from the former.<br><br>While denying the charge that Chinese cinema was imitating Hollywood, he said the cinema had certainly strived to bring out more of the Chinese culture.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sceptics have always wondered whether any of our composers would withstand the high quality requirements of foreign movies. After succeeding in the west, A R Rahman now has taken on the far east - China.<br><br>Warriors of Heaven and Earth is quite easily Rahman's cup of tea. The composer has always enoyed composing background scores and this Chinese film is exactly that. The reassuring factor for his Indian fans is that, unlike Bombay Dreams, this film has fresh compositions. In the Hindi version of Warriors in Peace, the very gifted Sadhana Sargam renders like never before. This seductive number also has an English version, rendered exceptionally well by Sunitha Sarathy.<br><br>Lord An's Empire is depicted with a haunting alaap and sargam in Indian classical style by Murtuza and Kadir Mustufa. Horses does not quite give the impression of a galloping horse and could have had a faster pace. The proudest moment for Rahman could easily be the track Dacoit Duel in which the percussion reaches an unprecedented crescendo; it has marked similarity to the track Night Fight from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. There are moments where the genius has referred back to his previous music as the orchestration of Lai Chi is a spin off from Chandralekha (Mani Ratnam's Thiruda Thiruda). The Czech Film Orchestra conducted by Matt Dunkley, creates the splendour of the cinema through the mammoth-scale orchestrations.<br><br>With Warriors of Heaven and Earth, A R Rahman has succeeded in coming up with a score that is distinctly Chinese with a dab of Indian music. The Score in all probability will put him on the world map as a composer with substance. Its a steal.. grab it.</div>
