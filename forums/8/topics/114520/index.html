Some things can't be helped.  But ppl are refusing help.<br>Somehow they don't see that if they can work things out themselves, they will have troubles in the first place.  They think that they are the best persons to solve their problems.  Maybe they are right (???).<br><br>But recently I had a conversation with a friend in Australia who now have problems in his marriage.  He was just out of hospital ( admitted due to severe depression) when I saw him in Sydney.  I didn't know depression will cause someone to be hospitalised.  somemore he so young.  The conversation gave me the impression that that a person may be married, but he/she is not trained in handling problems.  The doc sent him and his wife for counselling.  But he refused to go.<br><br>Dunno lah.  Just a thought.  Anyway I also not trained in handling troubles.  That's why I believe in counselling.<br><br>This friend and his spouse are now on anti depressant.  They just got married end of last year</div>

Its only Jan 2005 now!  Hrrmm...but they either need to get some counselling or somehow work it out themselves. Anti-depressants like prozac only help alleviate some of the symptons and can be harmful in the long run. The root cause of the problem has yet to be sorted out.  I've always felt that western doctors over-prescribe medication. I've been told of slightly hyperactive kids(which is quite normal and most grow out of it) being given what can only be described as mild tranquilisers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
