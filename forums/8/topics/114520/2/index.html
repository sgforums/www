But ppl are refusing help.<br>Somehow they don't see that if they can work things out themselves, they will have troubles in the first place.  They think that they are the best persons to solve their problems.  Maybe they are right (???).<br><br>But recently I had a conversation with a friend in Australia who now have problems in his marriage.  He was just out of hospital ( admitted due to severe depression) when I saw him in Sydney.  I didn't know depression will cause someone to be hospitalised.  somemore he so young.  The conversation gave me the impression that that a person may be married, but he/she is not trained in handling problems.  The doc sent him and his wife for counselling.  But he refused to go.<br><br>Dunno lah.  Just a thought.  Anyway I also not trained in handling troubles.  That's why I believe in counselling.<br><br>This friend and his spouse are now on anti depressant.  They just got married end of last year</div></blockquote>'Some things can't be helped' in the sense that people just refused to be helped... That's when you often can't just step in and make decisions for them or teach them what to do... Because refusing to accept help is also a CHOICE of their own accordance....<br><br>People like these often have a very 'personalised' point of view... They feel that they're more 'in the shoes' and hence, others cannot really comprehense or understand what they're going through... These people often see things from a VERY NARROW point of view... People often just get frustrated in trying to talk them out of it or simply can't find the point of approach... Signs would be that they keep on REPEATING the SAME THING(s) again and again...<br><br>Others (eg. those suffering from severe depression or other mental inflicts) would simply have altered view of things happening around them... Logics often don't work as they've already strong distorted beliefs about the reality they're living in.....</div>

One fine day, this lady came along and bought a nice dress from your departmental shop for her D&amp;D coming up over the weekend.<br><br>Poor lady, the buttons on her dress pop out on her D&amp;D event, giving her nothing but embarrassment.  Fuming, she returns back to you and tells you what happened.  She says to you:"You will never know how I felt at that point of time."  And you, the male sales associate reassures and sympathises with her replies:"I know how you felt.".<br><br>Now ask yourself, do you really know or think how that lady felt?  Had you been in her shoes?  Can you truly relate?<br><br>When it comes to r/s problems, you can hear all 2/3 sides of the story, but end of the day, there is still a hidden piece that would facilitate coming up with an appropriate solution.  You cannot get to the root of the problem till you've been exactly through a similar problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People nowadays are less tolerant.<br>They refuse to see that they are partly to blame for the marriage breakdown.<br>Also they give up too easily  that's why there are high divorces &amp; breakups.<br><br>In a marriage, u have to be prepared to go through the good &amp; bad times,<br>willing to compromise, be supportive of yr partner &amp; put family as top priority.<br><br>Consultants  can give advice but if they are not willing, very hard to help.</div>

One fine day, this lady came along and bought a nice dress from your departmental shop for her D&amp;D coming up over the weekend.<br><br>Poor lady, the buttons on her dress pop out on her D&amp;D event, giving her nothing but embarrassment.  Fuming, she returns back to you and tells you what happened.  She says to you:"You will never know how I felt at that point of time."  And you, the male sales associate reassures and sympathises with her replies:"I know how you felt.".<br><br>Now ask yourself, do you really know or think how that lady felt?  Had you been in her shoes?  Can you truly relate?<br><br>When it comes to r/s problems, you can hear all 2/3 sides of the story, but end of the day, there is still a hidden piece that would facilitate coming up with an appropriate solution.  You cannot get to the root of the problem till you've been exactly through a similar problem.</div></blockquote></div>
