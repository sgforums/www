But wat i think the problem does not only lies with majority of the gals. It also goes to shows that the majority of the guys r lacking behind them, cannot satisfy their needs.<br><br>Btw I am also sick of reading simliar thread comparing local and other countries gals. It just gets boring discussing the same thing over and over again.</div>
