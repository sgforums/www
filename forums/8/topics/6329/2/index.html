Again,, the righteous force and their conspiracy at work!!!<br>To me personally, i find girls who puff downright sexy and sensual....and again, why restrict the joy of puffing to males only?!?! If u find girls who smoke a turn-off, fine, go else where to find ur buaya targets then. No need to impose ur standards on the women, they have every right to smoke and be darned if they had to listen to some male chauvinist dictating to them the idea of a perfect woman  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>SMOKERS UNITE!!!!<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow everyone is so judegemental ar....<br><br>Personally i dun care if a girl smokes or not.  AS lonmg as she doesn't smoke in front of the children in the future that's fine.<br><br>It seems to me that everyone likes to pass judgenment about what type of people they like and dun like....Smoking is such an insignifigant act when you compare it to the other things that a person is capable of...good and bad.<br><br>To cross someone off ur personal list because they smoke is like saying i dun want to associate with this guy because he ahs a tattoo....or an earring....Same difference.<br><br>If people dun like the smoke make sure they dun go to the places where people smoke..like pubs, discos, bars...wherever....<br><br>I dun smoke so dun get me wrong...and I dun defend the fact that smokers can smoke with impunity.  I think that it is great that there are so many resrictions on smoking in singapore...As this leaves lots more room for people who dun smoke to enjoy public places and or buildings...<br><br>I think thatwhat a lot of people here will be fascinated to know is that many mroe girls in singaproe smoke than guy do....So uh....if your single and you know it clap ur hands...*clap clap*...because you may live in righteousness...but single all your life unless you learn to understand that people do smoke...and justa s smokers have to learn to accept the fatc that they can't just anyhow smoke anywhere they want, the non-smokers have to understand that it is their habit...most of them can't help it even if they tried.<br><br>Fatc for me is that almost all my friends and acquaintences smoke.  I can count the ones who dunt smoke on one hand..and they are all guys, maybe one or 2 girls...heh....The rest smoke.<br><br>To me, it's not important.  What is important to me is that we can get along. How comfortable do i feel with this person or these people. Finding people you can get along with is very difficult I find.  What for you make a list of things that peole should or should not possess or be or not be???  In the end you lose out more than you gain by avoiding smokers.  I can tell you that most of my friends who smoke are swell people...just the same as the fact that tatoos dun make someone a paikia instantly...<br><br>heh...Come back down to earth people....<br><br>And here's another patented firewire hint# 2:<br><br>Most(ok lah not most, but a lot of them do!!!) girls who are chio smoke!!!!<br><br>if you want a chio gf then better get used to it.  Times are changing and the women population are getting mroe open while the men seem to be cgetting more reserved....<br><br>I refuse to go down like that...hargggggg!!!!!! the day i become conservative, i'm going to go on an eating frenzy until my stomach bursts!!!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when i was young (oh alright, YOUNGER) i hated smokers.. total turnoff! had an immediate bad impression on anyone who smoked (goes to show how effective the govt's campaigns have been), and thought that they were all "paikias" and losers. but now... i think at least 1/3 of my friends smoke. and i actually find cig smoke a turnon on some guys... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>okok, i digress. the main thing is, why does double standards forever apply on this issue? it's alright for guys to smoke, but once a girl lights up... ohoh. she's "unfeminine", "uncouth", looks like an ahlian... what about the guys who smoke??!! is it fair to condemn a person, who consists of some many different "parts" and aspects of her character/personality, simply because she chooses to smoke? and worse still, it's ok to smoke if she looks "sexy" or does it "seductively" but if she looks "guai" then it's bad?? can someone pls explain the reasoning behind this statement? what are these people trying to say? that smoking's cool as long as you look good doing it? i think that'll be the worst reason ever to smoke.<br><br>i dont endorse smoking 'cos afterall, it gives you more problems than you already have. but i dont thk it's wrong either. whether smoking is right or wrong is totally up to the individual. if you think it's ok, then go ahead and light up, if you don't, just politely ask the smoker if he/she wld mind smoking a lil dist off... it's ultimately your decision, your choice. the rest of the world doesn't really matter (unless you're one of those idiots who love to blow smoke into other people's faces)<br><br>but sadly, all these doesn't matter 'cos afterall, it is the guys' preferences... how sad. wld you give up a girl simply cos she smokes?</div>
