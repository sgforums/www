If first view, they feel no market - unless you can sing damn well, if not it's probably gg.<br><br>Last time when I was working, the audition held in my Music School, all see attitude, dress sense and face first, then singing come later. Those in slippers, sloppy kind, all kicked out without even a flinch.<br><br>You magnify the number of people in SuperStar, the judge probably hear until shagged liao and would probably start to shut off. Because I can tell you, the number of people really cmi will wear the judge out. Is very normal.<br><br>P.S: Don't let them gauge you; your love for singing is pure.

If first view, they feel no market - unless you can sing damn well, if not it's probably gg.<br><br>Last time when I was working, the audition held in my Music School, all see attitude, dress sense and face first, then singing come later. Those in slippers, sloppy kind, all kicked out without even a flinch.<br><br>You magnify the number of people in SuperStar, the judge probably hear until shagged liao and would probably start to shut off. Because I can tell you, the number of people really cmi will wear the judge out. Is very normal.<br><br>P.S: Don't let them gauge you; your love for singing is pure. When commercialise singing, it becomes marketing... not art anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers  </div></blockquote>I know...
