People who are more attuned to the nuances of human reactions and confidence levels...that can be derived from reading the words written by the party being analysed.<br><br>Just as some people can tell a persons charater by the way they write, can people also tell if someone is pretty or not(should be a very basic thing to do) by reading their generically imaged text through the screen and how they present themselves through this text????<br><br>just a thought.  We discussed it and it sounded very interesting to post up.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well well, not an easy task to do, but as wad u haf mentioned above how they type and how the express themselves maybe a way to see whether they are pretty or not.

            <div class='col-md body'>Not an easy task to do. Even if pple are good at analysising the way words are type and all, still a lot of surfers could have split personalities ie they may be more confident over the net or something. Maybe a guide could be that most pretty girls will not outrightly or blantantly imply that they are goodlooking? Tough task anyway....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all u stupid dodos out there, to answer firewire question:<br>Wat the hell u think those stupid internet outings are for? Dun u think ppl organise all these outings in the hope that the so call "babes" they have been talking to are really babes? And in the end i am sure all are darn ugly. Even if got one chio one, she would be surrounded by buayas and the pics will be all focused on her.<br><br>So that only means one thing: u dun know how the "bu" at the opposite end looks like unless u go for a stupid outing..heck..wat the hell!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jack...most of the girls in the outings are really pertty...I dun know about the outings you go to, but in our group they are pretty..and we don't go out to see who is prettier or which girl we can buaya....<br><br>We gather to tok and have fun, drink together and joke around...allt his talk about being pretty and ugly has been said among ourselves a lto fo times already what..and we liek to joke about it too...so asking it here is just to see what other people think of it.<br><br>and in the final analysis, the looks dun really matter at all because we are gathering to have fun wioth each other what?..I should think that there is nothing wrong with that.<br>..and well of cos the guys crowd around the chiobu..but it's natural what...me?..i try and sit next to them but I dun make it a pioint to if I can't..kekekekeke<br><br>but yeah man...ultimately it doesn't matter becuase they ar eall great peopel to hang around with anyway.</div>

If the latter, my therapist hasn't officially diagnosed me yet.<br><br>And yeah, I prefer psycho chicks. The more unbalanced the better. Anything but bland in vacuo women.<br><br>cheers</div>
