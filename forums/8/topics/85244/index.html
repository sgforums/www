            <div class='col-md body'>Last time i also given a tamil guy $10 cos i pity him. He had asked me about his reservice date and time on a letter which he holds on his hand, he said he had no jobs at the moment cos he got retrenched recently. Then he start asking me about lending him $5 first cos he have not eaten for the whole day, then pity him, i took out my wallet. Upon seeing me checking my wallet for $5, he start asking for $5 more cos he said he also had an old mother at home, and no money to buy food for her. At that time i felt that i cant refuse him but to give it to him. He said he will return me the $10 the following next day at the same time and location where i met him (7-Eleven store). I felt cheated after i left, then i quickly run back to the place and hes gone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  The next day i returned to the location at the same time and wait for 20 minutes or so, but that guy didnt appear anymore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>So this is a lesson for me, next time i will not give my hard earned money to strangers who have hands and legs, who could work to survive...but they chose not to..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
