You are<br>ahead of 500 million people in the world.<br><br>If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment, arrest,<br>torture, or death...you are more<br>blessed than three billion people in the world.<br><br>If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof overhead<br>and a place to sleep...you are richer than 75% of this world.<br><br>If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a dish<br>someplace you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.<br><br>If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very rare<br><br>If you can read this message, you just received a double blessing in that<br>someone was thinking of you,<br>and furthermore, you are more blessed than over two billion people in the<br>world that cannot read at<br>all.<br><br>Someone once said: What goes around comes around.<br><br>Work like you don't need the money.<br>Love like you've never been hurt.<br>Dance like no-one's watching.<br>Sing like no-one's listening.<br>Live like it's Heaven on Earth.<br><br>Pass this on, and brighten someone's day. Nothing will happen if you do not decide to pass it along.<br>The only thing that will happen, if you DO pass it on, is that someone might smile because of you.<br><br></div>
