              <p>What are the signs of Oily Scalp? I think I may have it so I'm considering switching shampoo type but I'm not very sure so I'm asking just in case I get it wrong and further damage my hair.</p>
              <p>It's like I only wash my head twice a day, morning and night or before I go out and night.</p>
              <p>If I don't go out I only wash at night but the thing is that, let's say I wake up 11am, about 1pm or 2pm. My hair would be abit damp and start to curl up abit and start bunching up by itself and make my scalp visible. At this point, it would be very hard for me to wax my hair because of the curl, I have to wash my hair and use wax to set the curl nicely. And the curl is ridiculous, like those mats.. but my hair just naturally soft, straight and fine.</p>
              <p>Anyone know?</p>

              <p>from the looks of it , u have oily scalp</p>
              <p>u only wash your head twice a day? man you're over -doing it . once is enough .</p>
              <p>what do u wash with? shampoo? u should only apply shampoo once a day , dont over do it as the hair scalp will over-react. ( stick to the shampoo you're already comfortable with )</p>
              <p>do you apply conditioner everyday? if not please get one ( i use SilkPro's ) and apply once everyday</p>
              <p>how do you dry your hair? blow dry ,brushing the towel against your hair or blotting it ( just covering the towel on your hair to absorb water and let it stay on for a few minutes ) . lets say u brush the towel against your hair, u are also brushing it against your hair scalp, and it may get damaged</p>
              <p>usually blotting of the hair is recommended as it doesn't harm your hair scalp since it does not apply any high amount of pressure on it .</p>
              <p>...and do you get high amounts of dandruff?</p>

              <p>alrite, i'm using a conditioner everyday , and i massage it into my hair for 1-2 minutes, after that i let it stay on ( for it to get absorb both into the hair scalp and the hair ) . been doing this for the past few months and my scalp rarely have those small little flaky white dandruff scraping off it easily when i brush my hair with my hands . and it rarely gets oily.</p>
              <p>conditioner contains alot of vitamins and nutrients which is essential for both hair and scalp.</p>
              <p>how about u start using a conditioner ( something that is used by hair salons ) and do it on a routine basis for 1 month, after that u tell me whether got difference anot. massage it and let it stay on for 1- 2 minutes then rinse it off. </p>
