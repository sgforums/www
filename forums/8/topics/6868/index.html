            <div class='col-md body'>I think you all have forgotten one person who is most suited to take over Jacky, though his recent bad press wun do him any good. That person is none other than Ronald Cheng. Besides Jacky, his voice comes across as the most magnetic liao.<br>Actually, I feel that right now, only he and maybe Louis Khoo (Gu Tian Le) has the seh to become a Heavenly King. Sorry to all Nicholes Tse fan but somehow I feel that he just doesn't cut it...maybe still too young.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

But he wasn't crowned the moment he stepped into the scene. I think it took him about 3 albums before he was crowned.<br><br>I think Leon Lai still basically the same. Somemore his arrogant attitude sucks. But can tell that both Aaron and Andy really put in a lot of efforts to improve their singing. Of coz Jacky is the best. But I feel Ronald Cheng is very good too...esp at singing ballads. His voice got that same haunting effect as Jacky. Alas his attitude sucks big time.<br><br>Right now, I really dun think any singers are in the same class as those 4. And I maintain my stand that Nicholes Tse just doesn't cut it.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
