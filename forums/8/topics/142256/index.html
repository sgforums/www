            <div class='col-md body'>My friend is applying for new jobs these few days. As typical of traditional thinking, some companies have application forms that ask if you were dismissed from previous jobs before.<br><br>She happened to be dismissed before, but it was because she was too much of a whistle blower. If you don't know what is a whistle blower, check on the net. It is nothing sexual.<br><br>My opinion is not to. The reason being most employers and HR are not empathetic towards dismissed workers no matter what reasons. Most will read the resume, application forms with a negative view first, looking for convincing points that the candidate is a Harvard grad, with Japanese-style loyalty who is willing to die for the company, multi-lingual in 128 languages, 10 PhDs, work for "peanuts", etc etc, aka God. I always get the sense that the interviewers are looking to employ God, a perfect being.<br><br>What is your opinion? Should she disclose?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that's true.. but heck.. if i had a company, i'd hire her.. with the infrastructure intact for reports of abuse or whatever in place.. a company must have its integrity intact if they are to survive.. the name TT Durai comes to mind.. now, if everything was in the open and he was clean, none of this would have happened..<br><br>but that's wishful thinking coz i'm not cut out to be a businessman or entrepreneur <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tuatau:</div><div class="quote_body">Skeletons or not, employers generally frown upon employing "whistle-blowing "  candidates because the company's interests must always be placed before personal interests, principles or code of ethics so that the longevity of the entire organisation could be ensured. (They have auditors -- internal or otherwise -- to flush out the skeletons, so other staff should let the auditors do their jobs and not step out of line.)<br><br>Once a person has breached that trust -- even while in good faith -- on record, it'd be difficult to convince future employers that the trust would not be breached again.

            <div class='col-md body'>There's no choice - she has to disclose.  All it takes is one referral call to her previous company to find the truth.  How much and for  how long can you hide?  She'll just have to present her case in the best possible light.  Sometimes you have to put a spin on things.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cindyfeh:</div><div class="quote_body">My opinion is not to. The reason being most employers and HR are not empathetic towards dismissed workers no matter what reasons. Most will read the resume, application forms with a negative view first, looking for convincing points that the candidate is a Harvard grad, with Japanese-style loyalty who is willing to die for the company, multi-lingual in 128 languages, 10 PhDs, work for "peanuts", etc etc, aka God. I always get the sense that the interviewers are looking to employ God, a perfect being.<br><br>What is your opinion? Should she disclose?</div></blockquote></div>
