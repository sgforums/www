              <p>The Registration of Criminals Act is amended to allow the record

              <p>  <strong>Operating Hours<a id="ophours" rel="nofollow" name="ophours"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Police Records Office operates from 9 am to 5pm from Monday to
                                      Friday, excluding public holidays.</p>
              <p>  <strong>Eligibility<a id="eligibility" rel="nofollow" name="eligibility"></a></strong></p>
              <p>Under the Registration of Criminals Act, there are stipulated
                                      criteria to ensure that the need to provide a second chance to
                                      ex-offenders is balanced with the security of the rest of society.
                                      These criteria are listed in the new section 7B and 7C of the
                                      Registration of Criminals Act.</p>
              <p>First, the person must satisfy a crime-free period. This is a
                                      period of 5 years starting from either the date of sentence (for
                                      cases where no term of imprisonment is imposed) or the date of
                                      release from legal custody. During the 5 years, the person must not
                                      be convicted of another crime, or be unlawfully at large for a
                                      crime. He must not be detained or placed under police supervision
                                      under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, and he must not
                                      be subject to supervision or admitted to a drug rehabilitation
                                      centre or other centre for drug or inhalant abuse.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the person must not be disqualified from having his
                                      record spent on any of the grounds in section 7C , which are that
                                      -- </p>
              <ol>
              <li>his conviction was for any offence specified in the Third
                                      Schedule;</li>
              <li>the sentence imposed on him for that conviction included- i a
                                      term of imprisonment exceeding 3 months; or ii a fine exceeding
                                      $2000;</li>
              <li>that conviction was for a crime committed within 5 years after
                                      he had been released from-<br> i) an approved institution under the Misuse of Drugs Act; or<br> ii) an approved centre under the Intoxicating Substances Act;</li>
              <li>he has been detained or subject to police supervision under the
                                      Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act anytime before that
                                      conviction;</li>
              <li>from the time being, he has a warrant of arrest for any offence
                                      issued against him which is outstanding ;</li>
              <li>he has more than one criminal conviction in the register kept
                                      by the Police, whether or not those convictions arise from the same
                                      particular occasions; or</li>
              <li>he has had any previous record in the criminal register being
                                      rendered spent</li>

                                      (i.e. a non-registrable offence) will not be considered a criminal
                                      record. The term "criminal record" is defined as records of

                                      may lawfully not disclose the spent record for all purposes, except
                                      in the case of:<br> <br> i) any investigation by a person authorised under the law;<br> <br> ii) any prosecution against the person for any offence;<br> <br> iii) any proceedings before a court; and<br> <br> iv) any appointment to an office or employment in a profession for
                                      which the person may be disqualified under written law by reason of

                                      employment application?</strong><br>    <br> A person who has a criminal record that is rendered spent can say
                                      "no" when asked if he has a criminal record in an employment

                                      court of law in an employment application?</strong><br>    <br> A person's criminal record that is rendered spent does not change
                                      the fact that he had been convicted before. Hence the person has to
                                      answer "yes" when asked if he has ever been convicted in a court of

                                      record has been rendered spent?</strong><br>    <br> There is no need for a person to apply to the Police for his record
                                      to be rendered spent. Those who qualify will automatically have

                                      the Register of Criminals but is marked as spent. Thus, the
                                      registrable particulars collected as part of that criminal record
                                      will still remain in the Register of Criminals kept by the

                                      previous conviction being rendered spent?</strong><br>    <br> A criminal record becomes spent when a person satisfies a
                                      crime-free period of 5 years. If, during the 5-year period, the
                                      person is convicted in court of another registrable offence, or if
                                      he is unlawfully at large in respect of a registrable offence, his
                                      record will not become spent. In addition, if a person has an
                                      outstanding warrant of arrest, he will be disqualified from having
                                      his record spent as long as the warrant remains outstanding.
                                      However, if the person has satisfied the crime-free period, his
                                      record will become spent and any subsequent conviction or warrant
                                      of arrest will not revive the earlier record.<br> <br>    <br> <strong>Will a person who had previously been placed on probation

                                      of the Registration of Criminals Act can apply to the Commissioner
                                      of Police for their criminal records to be rendered spent.<br> <br>    <br> <strong>How would a person's spent criminal records affect his

                                      authorities, that is, will he be liable for committing an
                                      offence?</strong><br>    <br> The Registration of Criminals Act is a domestic law which applies
                                      within Singapore. If a person is employed by an employer in
                                      Singapore under Singapore law but posted overseas, the RCA applies,
                                      and he may lawfully not disclose a spent record when asked about
                                      his criminal record. However, if the matter is not governed by
                                      Singapore law, then the answer will depend on the law in the
                                      relevant foreign country.<br> <br>    <br> <strong>What is the Home Team doing to educate the public and
                                      employers on giving ex-offenders a second chance?</strong><br>    <br> The Home Team will engage employers to encourage them to ask about
                                      "criminal records" instead of "previous convictions" in their
                                      employment questionnaires.<br> <br>    <br> <strong>Will the public be in danger (compromise on public safety)
                                      because ex-offenders are getting their records spent, for this may
                                      mean that there is no prior knowledge of their criminal past and
                                      hence little room for taking precautions against them re-offending
                                      in future?</strong><br>    <br> While the government is committed to giving ex-offenders a second
                                      chance, public safety remains the key concern. This is why only
                                      records of less serious crimes are allowed to be rendered spent.
                                      These are very minor crimes such as shop theft where public safety
                                      would not be compromised even with the implementation of the policy
                                      to render these records spent. Criminal records of serious crimes
                                      such as culpable homicide and drug trafficking will not qualify to
                                      be rendered spent.<br>    <br> <strong>Why can't the government take a more liberal approach by
                                      expunging the criminal record of minor offences?</strong><br>    <br> There is a need to strike a balance between the interest of
                                      ex-offenders and the interest of employers and the concerns of
                                      society. As this is a new initiative, the government has decided to
                                      adopt a more cautious approach by providing for records to be spent
                                      instead of expunged. The scheme will be regularly reviewed and the
                                      expunging of criminal records can be considered in the future.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Considered "spent" - gives you a chance  at normal life with non-exposure . For society's benefit,  one would certainly hope some form of record still exist with the Registrar , just in case  the crimminal reverts back to his/her old ways many many years later.  Recidivism can happen.</div>

              <p>Spent does not mean totally erased from the records.</p>
              <p>Your records are still there. It's just been "covered".</p>
              <p>For example, under an employment situation when asked whether you have a criminal record, you can answer NO if you qualify under the amendment.</p>
              <p>However, if under an employment situation when asked whether you have ever been convicted by a court of law, you have to answer YES, eventhough u qualify under the amendment, does not change the fact that u have been convicted by the court.</p>
              <p>You must remember that the amendment only cover Singapore's jurisdiction. If u were to be asked the same questions in Australia, you have to answer YES for both.</p>
