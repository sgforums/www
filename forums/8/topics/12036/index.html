            <div class='col-md body'>A damn funny message from one of the message boards around the world =)<br><br>Extracted from <a href="http://www.mmorpgforums.com" rel="nofollow">www.mmorpgforums.com</a><br><br>Response to a woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom:<br><br>Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the time. It's rare for us guys to ever hit what we were aiming for. Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around -- just so I'll make sure I hit something.<br><br>You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall (because all the urinals are being used), take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to pee all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't be trusted.<br><br>After being married 28 years, my wife has me trained. I'm no longer allowed to pee like a man -- standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise, if she goes to the toilet one more time at night and either sits on a pee-soaked toilet seat, or falls right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she's going to kill me in my sleep.<br><br>Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm a classy guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem and you ladies need to be more understanding. It's the dreaded "morning wood."<br><br>Most mornings we guys wake up with two things: a tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it don't bend you can't aim.<br><br>Well hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to pee all over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet. And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the stupid toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to achieve that perfect aim.<br><br>Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe.<br><br>I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her, "Look, it won't bend." She said, "Sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time." OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with "morning wood."<br><br>Well, it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage to do it, I had peed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You pee all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you women keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet.<br><br>I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying superman position by simply laying over the toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee.<br><br>So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.<br><br>It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature. Now, if it was Father Nature... there wouldn't have been a problem!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the HDB should build urinals in the homes of HDB flats, that way i think it'll solve the problem mentioned above. HAHOOHOOheeehee...<br>Come let me share a toilet experience:<br>I was hanging around with my group of guy friends when 1 idiot juz had to create "chocolate cate", so being the good buddies we are. We decided to accompany him and take a leak ourselves. Wah he machan like never do it before.. He stayed in there like hours. One of my irritated friend started to hurry him. Mind you, there was this peaceful guy minding his own business peeing into the urinal. Then my sarcastic friend shouted "Whay, ni zuo da shen yi ! zuan duo shao qian le !!?" combined with his pissed off look. The stranger peeing couldn't control himself and started shaking with laughter amidst trying to contain his guffles. In his frantic attempts, his pee also shaked with him. U know like those arcade games call para para paradise where u dance to play the game. It was hilarious watching him keeping that "hose" under control. I give him full marks for keeping rythym, cos he didn't want to get his pee onto his pants or whatever. In the end our dear friend completed his hugh relief and we got out of there mocking that poor guy who accidently overheard our conversation. Man i didn't know "business" in toilets can be funny business.<br><br>hey i not pervert or what But juz wanted to share some comical experience.<br>"P</div>
