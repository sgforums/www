Those buses you wouldn't see them in one to two years later as SBS are going to sell them away.<br><br>As for Tibs, with the implementation of more NR services and the recent taking over of services from SBS, Tibs are deploying more articulated air-con buses on the roads.<br></div>

Personally I think air-con buses are cool and clean like agreed by most who posted in here, but I do have to admit that I still prefer fresh air and the feeling of the wind blowing against my face at times...

During noon period when the sun is TOO STRONG, having the bus 'air-con' is not good enough.... In fact, the fact that the bus is all 'covered up' with no window at all makes it HEATY under the strong sun.... A slightly 'off-track' and 'exaggerated' thing here...

But a problem is most SBS SCANIA buses ply the eastern part of S'pore such as service 17, service 19, service 29, service 34 etc, if u have noticed. The tibs SCANIA buses is all right but the leg-room is too short.<br><br>Currently, those SBS services which have buses air-conditioned are those plying the CDB areas and ALL services plying Changi Airport. As for tibs, the services which are all air-conditioned are those implemented after mid 1990's and those "poor frequency" services.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>But one good thing about non air-conditioned SBS buses is that they don't install any TV Mobile.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
