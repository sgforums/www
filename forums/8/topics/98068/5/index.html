            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Martin,<br><br>Have confidence in your Mum and yourself and in God. Your mum will stay alive ONLY if you believe that she will stay alive! Do not despair, technology is advanced now.<br>Pray to God (whatever religion) and show faith and sincerity in your prayers, tell God that you will be willing to sacrifice anything as long as she comes back, you will be HEARD.<br><br>And always go visit your mum, talk to her, stay by her side, feel her hands. Though she cannot say it, she can feel you! She will know that you are by her side and SHE will be strong!, if nobody is there, she will give up.<br><br>Believe me and let the WHOLE sgForum members pray for your mum's recovery.<br><br>One thing, if shes in a coma, NEVER! withdrawn the life-support system, don't believe in anyone, even doctors. History speaks for itself. If need be, I believe the forum members can even create a fund for your mum, and we can all pool some money (all donate abit will amount to much) so that you are able to sustain the medical support needed and the subsequent physiotherapy after awake.<br><br>We can ask forum chief to make known to more people from other forum to help you out financial if needed, ya?</div>

I jus log into forums coz my comp got prob.. To all u guys out there.. Wat Martin has mentioned is the truth.. I may be in the nursin line myself..  I seen alot of.. it sadden me deeply to see his mother lyin in hosp jus lik tat..<br><br>Be strong.. Things are never smooth sailing, and when somethin happens, it is a challenge. How big the challenge may be, is how u cope with the challenge. I have heard many stories about people though in a comatose stage, but they are still able to hear.<br><br>True, spending time beside ur mom when she can't respond may not be one of the easiest task in the world, and tat it only evokes more saddness. But most importantly, all of ur presence will be known to her and she will greatly need your support though she can't show it out.<br><br>I understand from u todae tat ur mom condition have worsen. If there is anythin u need my help in, feel free to call me k.. I will be there to lend u a listenin ear whenever u need it.. Stay strong.<br><br>Tis is a true story i heard from my lect. I hop i m not rubbin salt on ur wounds. Our lect's father recently was also in somewat a similar condtion.. And they stayed by his side to talk to him. He was also in a comatose stage. But they talked to him.. Tellin him to let go, to let go of all his suffering. Tat we are all very sad to see u go, but we are also very sad to see u suffer lik tis.. Tears did roll down his eyes.<br><br>The comatose also can hear. Despite wat decision u n ur family choose to mak, u gonna be strong.. tak care..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br>Tis is a true story i heard from my lect. I hop i m not rubbin salt on ur wounds. Our lect's father recently was also in somewat a similar condtion.. And they stayed by his side to talk to him. He was also in a comatose stage. But they talked to him.. Tellin him to let go, to let go of all his suffering. Tat we are all very sad to see u go, but we are also very sad to see u suffer lik tis.. Tears did roll down his eyes.<br><br>The comatose also can hear. Despite wat decision u n ur family choose to mak, u gonna be strong.. tak care..</blockquote>I dont know, but i think its not right to ask someone in comatose to let go of his life???? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  and saying sad things?? like sad to see him go?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>I think yes, the comatose can hear, but dont make pre-decisions for him, right? because he may really really want to live and be strong because he wants to fight it, but the people around him kept asking him to let go??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  that is dissappointing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
