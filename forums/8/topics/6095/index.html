            <div class='col-md body'>Ever had cases of unreasonable people??<br>Well i was out with the forum ppl one nite and it happened outside 7-11 at picturehouse<br>and there was this group of indians trying to act big walking into 7-11 with their lighted ciggies. They were confronted by the cashier inside. At first they quarreled with the cashier and they said the no smoking sign was nothing and they din bother and next they refused to pay for their cup noodles. After they called the police, those indians paid up but they started scolding vulgarities and curisng the cashier. The cashier later walked out calmly waiting for the police to arrive. While waiting outside one of the galfrens came out and tried to tok peace with the cashier saying they were from cold storage and 7-11.SO BIG FUCK LAR!!<br>They're from 7-11 and they dun understand the simple fucking rule that smoking is not allowed in such premise and they still think they're correct.Customers are always right, True but u can't take advantage of this and do whatever u want. After that i jus left b4 the police came.<br>Well ever had such cases b4 and hope u'll care to share yer views<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Such cases are quite common, tat time i was working in GV Yishun 10 when I met this fella frm China who was quite well-dressed and seemed rather educated.<br><br>He told me he wanted to watch a movie. As I was selling tickets, I couldn't juz chin-chai sell him one as I'd burn my own asshole. So I asked him wat show would he like to see.<br><br>He juz keep repeating, "I wan to see a show in the cinema."<br><br>And I was paitently asking him, "What show would you like to watch sir? There are many movies showing now."<br><br>He repeated it for abt 10minz (while a ultra-long crowd formed behind. BTW, he didn't even bothered to queue up and simply cut queue), he got impaitent, slammed the counter and left in a huff. The next customer came up and swore at him before buying his tickets.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's no end in all sorts of strange people.<br><br>I was working as a sales promoter and in sales line, service and attitude towards customer is very important. There's this 2 foreign ladies looking at the shoes. I can't guess the country they're from. Maybe Germany or wad. The two of them are FILTHY RICH judging by their appearance and DAMN FAT. One of them tried 12 pair of shoes!! Damn it. She didn't ask for one go. She ask for the shoes one by one. I was already very fed up and I ask, "Madam, what type of shoes have you in mind?" She said, "Leave me alone. I'll see." Damn it. Later she bought 1 pair and ask me to put on the shoes for her!!!!!! I was furious at that moment and I juz ignore her and swear at her at a corner. My friend took my place and serve her. That's not all. She insist that I have to throw her shoes away. Ask her to fark off laH!! I was damn furious and told her, "THE RUBBISH BIN IS JUZ IN FRONT OF YOU!!" And later I was complained for poor attitude. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
