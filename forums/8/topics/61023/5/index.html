            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys, time to cut it here man, yeah, first thing first, she says she is a music director, but calls herself reverend, and that she is not a pastor because she don't preach, plainly playing with words. well, i don;t like her or listen to her songs..........but selling albums in church is a no no(unless it is christian songs lah), church is thy body of God, not a place for commercial. but what a CHURCH is is not the building, but what a person is thinking, so if the church(not the building) don't advertise albums in main worship time. i have no prob with it.<br><br>i understand CHC is giving all of you a negative image to us christians. most people of CHC are actually new believers. so pls forgive them and forgive the image they give you. if you want to see a good church, go to FCBC(i must say. I AM NOT FROM THERE). they will give you a better perspective to a church. i also hope you all will really pls don't just project an image of us christians base on a few christians or a single church. and pls hope all who have a bad image on us. pls looks closely again. thanks</div>

She is denying God by saying she is not a pastor.That is really sad if she was chosen to be one....but guess not as sad as God who has been forgiving and compassionate.</div>

Use prophesy to make ppl give money to invest in christian project. Project fail, pastor blame members for not having faith. Not really the kind of church I would recommend. Lawrence Khong is another pastor who enjoy media attention. Same group lah! Lawrence Khong and Kong Hee are same gang. They're known as the uncle and nephew team in christian circle.<br><br>Why can't pastors concentrate on their spiritual work instead of diversifying into worldly means.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> [/b][/quote]<br><br>hey, at least the gov and less people piss with them lor, they really devoted attention the the elderlys. which is a good thing.....well, a good church to go when you are old....haha</div>
