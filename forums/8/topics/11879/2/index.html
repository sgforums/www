U din ask him to do tat. why shld u feel bad. dun u think that he purposely wan to break up u and yr bf? So u not sad or npt bad that yr ex have tis intention?

I try hard to plse him all the time, i try to be wat he wans me to be, and sumtimes it gets tiring coz i noe i m not being myself at all. Yet, i can't help it.<br><br>It has been 4 n half yrs sins i've known him, includin 3 yrs tt i've waited. If he's not the one i love, i wld hv left long ago. But my feelings for him has not decrease one bit during the yrs, so tt mz prove sumthg, dosen it???<br><br></div></blockquote>Now that u've said that, u've literally dug urself a bigger pile of shit...<br><br>Frankly, it was ur bf who asked u not to see ur ex...if u respected that and realised how he would feel, u wouldn't have done it (no matter how difficult it is to reject. To him, that kind of reason is likely to be crap)<br><br>On the other hand, if u still find it tough to say no, then u've got a very serious problem indeed...<br><br>No offence though...<br><br>[This message has been edited by BillyBong (edited 13 June 2001).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by BillyBong (edited 13 June 2001).]</div>
