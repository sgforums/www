            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for saying this, if you still love your bf, i don tnk you should do such things behind his back loh. As a guy, i will definitely get worked up~! Its a sign that you r not telling him the truth, hiding things behind him and maybe betray his trust in you?<br><br>Wat you can do now is of coz to stop seeing your ex in future, assure your bf that this will not happen again. If he still don take your word, hold his hand while saying tat, give his hand a small queeze, it has the effect that you are repent. still cannot? gif him a hug and pat him on this body or backside and act cute while doing all these... his heart will soften and hopefully things will be over ....<br><br>Personally, i reli wish to know why u still seeing your ex when you know (1) he still carry a tourch for you (2) your bf wont be happy? Pls tell me leh, coz i really don understand the mentality of gals nowadays...<br><br>sorry if i sound offensive, but i am really down lately bcoz of my gf problem...</div>

If he said yes, tell him that my next Bf will be angry! Isn't that ironic? Tell him how much you are devoted to him. you just tell him, this is the new generation sort of love, you can have your friends, and you can have your own freedom. Why are you being controlled?

            <div class='col-md body'>Sharon,<br><br>A part of me wants to console you.  The other part (mean as it is) is for you to learn a lesson from all this.<br><br>So happens, that your bf happens to be someone who is finally so resolute about the whole thing.  His reply is not bo-chup.  It's more of a pain beyond description.  Let him cool down and asked again.  If it's his final answer then... at least you have learnt something from this event.  Life goes on, you know.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sharon:<br><br>this is something no one can really give u proper advice on...each relationship is unique. Hence, u have to figure out wat is ur next best course of action.<br><br>Firstly, u urself should know it was extremely silly of u to go out with ur ex...<br>if u dunno how to tell him no, then i suggest u do some soul searching...as in do u still feel something for ur ex?<br><br>"Who really matters now?" that is the question u have to answer...why did u break up with ur ex in the first place if u find it very hard to say no? And why do u take ur current bf for granted? I know how i'd feel if i was ur bf (thankfully i'm not)<br><br>In fact, ur bf is doing exactly wat i'd be doing...making the difficult decision b4 u. Since it's obvious that he means so little to u, there's really no point in carrying on. This is wat's in his mind now; tat's probably wat u need to assure him one last time...<br><br>good luck...<br><br>[This message has been edited by BillyBong (edited 12 June 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Billybong,<br><br>he does not mean little to me. i did lots for him, i took 3 n half yrs to make him finally lik me, i learn to cook coz he luvs good food, i got all worked up when he's sick, i waited for him at his void deck overnite juz to get a glimpse of him.<br><br>i went out wif my ex coz i dunno how to reject him, he gets drunka and loiters outside my doorstep in the middle of the nite, he sends flowers and listens to my problems whenever i m down, even problems i hv wif my bf. i treat him as a gd fren, one tt at least listens when i am feeling down and try to console me (which is more than i can say for my bf, who will only say "dun think abt it and it will go away").<br><br>i noe i luv my bf and NOT my ex coz i get affected by watever he do. I try hard to plse him all the time, i try to be wat he wans me to be, and sumtimes it gets tiring coz i noe i m not being myself at all. Yet, i can't help it.<br><br>It has been 4 n half yrs sins i've known him, includin 3 yrs tt i've waited. If he's not the one i love, i wld hv left long ago. But my feelings for him has not decrease one bit during the yrs, so tt mz prove sumthg, dosen it???<br><br></div>
