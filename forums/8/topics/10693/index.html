            <div class='col-md body'>okay, first off, i'm a very possessive person. things that are mine stays mine even if i don't need it or use it.<br><br>i was given 2 bags recently, not an expensive gift. i brought them home and left them in the living hall. i may have made a remark about not ever using it as my current bag is in good condition.<br><br>the thing is, today my mom informed me that my dad gave the bags to my eldest sister on Sunday. i can't help but be a little pissed. firstly, the bags were not his to give and secondly, he didn't ask me for permission. true, i stay at home rent free and am pampered but ... ...<br><br>i like the little bag better than the bigger and joking said that maybe i can ask for the small bag back, they were embarrassed and said i can't and i shouldn't. i latched onto this and told them off that should they ever give my stuff away without asking me, i'll ask them back from the recipents. in the end, everyone wasn't too happy.<br><br>to be totally frank, the bags don't mean all that much to me but i just don't like the idea of them giving my things away and i've lots of stuff which i seldom use and thus useless in their eyes but not to me!<br><br>what would you have done?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If this happened to me, I would definitely tell my parents that they should not give away my things without informing me.<br><br>colette, how good is your relationship with your elder sister? If both of you are on good terms, I'm sure there is no harm telling your sis that those bags were yours and they were given away without your knowledge. Just tell her that if she does not mind, you'll like to have the bags back. If your relationship with your sister is not that great, I think it would not be worth it to strain the relationship further by asking for bags. In this case, just inform your parents that next time, if they intend to give away your stuff, at least inform you beforehand.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, if my eldest sister wanted the bags, i would have given them to her, i didn't really like them anyway. my relationship with her is good, with its usual ups and downs.<br><br>yeah, i just don't like it when they give away my stuff and the strange thing is that they only give away my stuff and none of their other children's, it's sometimes frustrating, perhaps because i'm still staying with them and thanks for replying.</div>
