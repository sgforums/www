            <div class='col-md body'>Hahaha..wow..there's so many different views and different version..okok..i jus did my homework yst and did some research on the net..<br><br>And wat i got is tt, Resistance training is ADVISE to do 1st..And the cardio warming up can be take over by mayb some serious warming up and stretching(For at least 30 sec for each stretch, till u feel the pinnings feeling..doing stretching fast and short will not benefits you..)<br><br>Coz now i view thru all the replies..it seems like the "cardio exercise" u all saying abt is like "Running on the treadmill for 5 mins??".. Hmm..okok..mayb everyone has their own view of the "Cardio exercise"(which my cardio exercise means like a 2.4km run for mi??)..<br><br>okok..advise from a gym instructor tt, Resistance training is ADVISED to do 1st..coz if u do ur cardio exercise 1st..coz cardio exercise will normally burn lots of fats and energy (depending on wat u do)..and IF you do ur resistance training after your cardio exercise..<br><br>It's kinda of DANGEROUS for tt gym user..Coz him/her may have no strength for those weight tt he/she is going to lift..Coz earlier on, he/she has burn most of her energy and it may takes some time to recover..so it will kinda of dangerous if he/she dun have a partner to support her and it can cause serious injuries..<br><br>But if u did some homework on net, actually it dun really have a definite ans..as everyone has their own views??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>which instructor says on the subject that cardio and resistance training can be done in a session 1 day?<br><br>he qualified? from his kampung gym is it?<br><br>like i said, warm-up stretches before resistance training will allow your body to 'heat up' first.. like you won't get cramps easily and won't to the extend train your body to the highest demand from start.<br><br>but if you talk about 'cardio' &lt;- which is fat burning, and resistance training which is muscles/strength building on the same day, this is a joke  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2nd edit: ok i just read what you said. i didn't know why some of them changed your words to '5 mins type warm up' ..<br><br>that is exactly what i interpreted from you, cardio = like 2.4km run for you.<br>now this is the point im saying, no one will do cardio + resistance training on the same day if he knows what he is doing. that's it.<br><br>lol now i pretty lazy look for the main reasons behind this. try look at bodybuilding.com . i read a lot there</div>

(must be light enough so u can get till 12 times) then stop for 1 -2 mins<br><br>c) then add some weight to your toy, not too much ,, mayb only 0.5kg or 1kg<br>At this point, mayb u can only lift till 10 times or less.. Dont worry. Then stop 1 - 2 mins<br><br>d) Then add another 0.5kg or 1kg.. then lift.. this time might be lesser than 5times. Stop 1 - 2 mins after that.<br><br>e) U add till you are not able to lift any toy till more than 3 times. Then thats your gym workout for that day.. Note: Dun let ppl support you when u play with your toy.. IF you playing for your biseps dun let your other hand support your working hand...<br><br>After a) - e) thats it.. thats the workout u need to do..<br>If this is the 1st time for you, i bet 2morw morning you will feel tremendous pain for your muscle.<br><br>Lets say your working on your biseps, dont workout for triceps that day.. plan your tricep for the nex day..and let your biseps one day rest.<br><br>But your method must b correct.. i dont really know how to tell u here cuz i need to show.. anyway, dont play gym alone . ask some1 who really experience (coached b4 and have the certificate) to teach and guide you..<br><br>Wrong method not only caused u to damage your vein but also you will feel tremendous tiresome but with so little effect...<br><br>I suggest u try to ask any fren or surt the net for more information, but my personal experience said that its the best when u have a coach around u to see what is wrong wit your method.<br><br>TO know whether your method is wrong or right, lets say ur playing with dumbell, your targeting the bisep.. if your method is right, u will feel the effect on your bisep.. if you somehow did the wrong way, u might feel so little effect on your bisep but other part of muscle like triceps feel that. so your method is wrong..<br><br>k, till here , im lazy to explain,, you do your own homework<br></div></blockquote>Pyramid training is dangerous.
