Thats why guys who are managers or CEOs have an edge over office boy or odd-job labourers..

Normally, when you go to disco, there will be a large queue outside..<br><br>The girls will tell you to go during happy hour, that's when there's no cover.. but you tell the girls no need, just go after happy hour and when there is long queue..<br><br>Reaching, you walk up to the member's entrance and tell the bouncer you will sign up as member.. hence no need to queue and girls will start to feel impressed..<br><br>Once inside, the place will be jammed packed and you will have no seat.. So you act a little tough with the waiter and tell the waiter to get you the table.. Of course, he will say all the table are reserve.. but you pull out a ten dollar note and hand it to the waiter, insisting that you want the table for your bottle of Gorden bleu..<br><br>I guarantee you, the table will come and the girls will be doubly impressed.. I am sure with this method, the chances of you bedding the girls will be much higher..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>PS: You don't have to thank me if you managed to bed the girl you like, just remember to post a field report here will do.. cheers.. and happy bonking..<br><br></div>

Thats why guys who are managers or CEOs have an edge over office boy or odd-job labourers.. And guys who drives have an edge over SMRT riders...<br><br>But fear not, as I had found out another way in which you can equally impress a girl.. Normally, when you go to disco, there will be a large queue outside..<br><br>The girls will tell you to go during happy hour, that's when there's no cover.. but you tell the girls no need, just go after happy hour and when there is long queue..<br><br>Reaching, you walk up to the member's entrance and tell the bouncer you will sign up as member.. hence no need to queue and girls will start to feel impressed..<br><br>Once inside, the place will be jammed packed and you will have no seat.. So you act a little tough with the waiter and tell the waiter to get you the table.. Of course, he will say all the table are reserve.. but you pull out a ten dollar note and hand it to the waiter, insisting that you want the table for your bottle of Gorden bleu..<br><br>I guarantee you, the table will come and the girls will be doubly impressed.. I am sure with this method, the chances of you bedding the girls will be much higher..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>PS: You don't have to thank me if you managed to bed the girl you like, just remember to post a field report here will do.. cheers.. and happy bonking..<br><br></div></blockquote>how old r u?</div>
