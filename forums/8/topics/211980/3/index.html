            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.  There's way too much generalisation going on in this thread.  As such, there are little grains of truth scattered here and there, but you're going to need to be selective about how you apply them.<br><br>To some extent, what some people have said here about it being easy to pass is true.  It's not in any univeristy's interests to have a high fail rate.  Go for your classes, do what you're supposed to do and unless you're spectacularly imcompetent, anybody can pass.<br><br>On the other hand, if you're looking at more than just scraping by with passes, it becomes a different proposition altogether.  I've seen a whole lot of Singaporean and other overseas students come in and be able to get an honours degree while waiting for their nail polish to dry.  Of course, they've been bitterly disappointed.  At the sharp end of the business, typically within the top 15%, there's no lack of competition.<br><br>The bottom line is that it's really hard to fail, and doing well's a bit of a challenge, but if all you want to do is pass, no sweat.  More likely it's this middle band that sngyze's daddy dearest has encountered in his limited experience.<br><br>As for the English requirement, trendz may be correct in a limited way.  If you're doing something that hardly uses English, you're probably not going to be too limited, although you'll still need to understand the finer points of what's required of you during the course and in assignments.  On the other hand, if you're doing a business degree or some other course that requires a significant amount of written communication, deficiencies in English would be a rather large handicap.<br><br>Bottom line: English skills may or may not be important, depending on the subject you're taking.<br><br>Rather than looking at the university's reputation (as most people here seem to have done), look at the particular department or faculty's reputation, and also make the distinction between undergrad and postgrad.  I don't have too many complaints about Melbourne Uni's postgrad programs - the university tends to focus on research rather than teaching, and as such the postgrads get decent research support.  On the other hand, having tutored enough of their undergrads, the undergrad program leaves much to be desired.<br><br>Bottom line: be specific when you're researching your options.  Don't generalise.</div>
