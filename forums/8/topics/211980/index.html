Thanks alot</div></blockquote>Assuming what An0nym0us said is true, then the answers will be:<br><br>1. If you are willing to work hard, it is not impossible. It's not that difficult if you work hard. But seeing your GPA, you might have to attend foundation school in Australia if the university accepts you. If they don't require you to attend foundation school, then you won't get the chance to skip modules aka advanced standing.<br><br>2. I'm not too sure about the teaching speeds there. But if you are really slow in learning, most likely you have to spend a lot of time reading up before lessons. This includes reading up what that module is about, borrow some books and read up about it. That is if you are accepted by the university.<br><br>3. Don't get you.</div>

Singlish is already part and parcel of most Singaporeans' lives, if not all. It doesn't mean that if one's English is bad, he/she would fare badly in Australia. Take that elitism mindset off you.

If one is truly interested in that course, then their 3 years is not wasted. Interest spurs a person to do well, even if they are not well within the top 5%.<br><br><blockquote>Many poly idiots get a sole dip but are not within the top 5%; thus no direct entry to Sg unis.</blockquote>The rules have changed.

            <div class='col-md body'>Having studied in Australia for 3 years, I think pursuing an overseas degree may be a good option for you for the following reasons :<br><br><strong>a) </strong><span style="color: blue;">Your english won't be an issue.  </span>There are some local Aussies whose standard of english can't even match yours, and many other International Students whose english is much, much worse than yours, but they can still pass because they can at least grasp the concepts and can be understood.  Even if u're officially an english-as-1st-lang student, u CAN opt to take eng-as-2nd-lang classes for free coz it's all incl in the fees.<br><br><strong>b) </strong> <span style="color: blue;">Your result shouldn't really be an issue as long as it's a reasonable pass.  Be confident, let them know u're serious abt it, get the proper referrals if required, and there's a high chance they'll let u in.  </span>Singapore's standard of education is highly regarded there coz our pre-university curriculum is much more intensive than theirs.<br><br><strong>c)</strong>  <span style="color: blue;">The more laid-back pace can mean 2 things.  </span><br><br>i) Unlike in Singapore, you will have more opportunities and time to study comfortably, explore your options, evolve as a person, and open your eyes.  In other words, you get to be yourself.<br><br>ii) You may have problems adjusting to this newfound freedom .. I've come across many Singaporeans who are too used to being told wad to do, not used to having time of their own, not much time for hobbies, not motivated enough .. Aussie shops also close early.. there are alot of distractions like gambling and drugs and MANY S'porean students fall prey to these due to lack of self control..<br><br><strong>d) </strong> <span style="color: blue;">Last but not least, it would give you a great opportunity to try and get overseas work experience..</span>  so that when you come back home, u'll have a great set of skills most companies would be glad to put to use, for (hopefully) decent pay =)<br><br>All the best 2u, whatever decision u make ^^</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Only the dumb f*cks would waste 3 yrs of their lives studying for a f*cked up diploma;</blockquote>That's a pretty c*cky comment. Looks like you have some kind of  a personal grudge against diploma holders. if no, care to explain why a diploma is f*cked up and why a diploma holder is a dumb f*ck??<br><br><blockquote>Moreoever staying in Singapore &amp; sticking by their f*cked up education system all your life; havin' no o/seas exposure at all would really sorta disgust me in; one way or another</blockquote>Once again, you are just ranting about what you like/dislike without giving any concrete reasons. Why do you feel not having overseas experience is bad? Are you telling me that all the successful people in Singapore have overseas experience??<br><br>To me it all sounds like you have some kind of an inferiority complex, probably stemming from getting rejected by the local unis here and having to run away to a far land to pursue a "oh so holy and great" overseas education.<br></div>
