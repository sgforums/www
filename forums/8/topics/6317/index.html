            <div class='col-md body'>terence,<br><br>you are right. there are many grey areas to this categorisation too.  i wouldn't say that having one SNAG trait would make one guy more err.. "SNAG-GY" than the next, nor can i specify the number of traits that a guy must 'achieve' to earn the SNAG label.  It all depends on the different perception of individuals.  for me, the keyword would probably be 'sensitivity' - be able to sense the moods of your partner &amp; try to understand them.<br><br>i'm very curious though, abt the male's perception of SNAG.  is it considered an offensive tag that hinted of femininity, or a tag that you would carry off proudly as a draw to girls?  who among you would profess to be a SNAG, and who would gladly declare his male chauvinistic nature?   :p<br><br>let's hear it from all of you!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in the attempt to flee the responsibilities of a REAL man, a man turns into a SNAG to dwell in the softer and gentler realm of touchy-feely where his failure to measure up to the rest of the GUYS will be lovingly tended to by the fairer sex. full-blooded competition, hunter instincts, confrontational bravo are qualities he lacks, thus cannot compete and so seeks refuge in women's magazines and late night agony aunt-type talks to women he wished he had the guts to fuck. previously an outcast, half a man and not a woman, he latches quickly to the label SNAG, a godsent from the 90s for he who is neither here nor there. SNAG, the 90s invention in reaction to the capital-driven MCP, was originally a cultivation of inner sensibilities and sensitivity BUT has NOW becomed hijacked by a long queue of sorry male candidates who cannot cope with the demands and taxes of being a man. boo-hoo, i feel so unloved, so misunderstood. for after all, not all men are created equal; some rise to the top and some get kicked into the sidewalk of broken egos. how many men have high-powered jobs, played rugby in elite schools and are goodlooking to boot? these men move on, they seek and conquer, those who don't wave the SNAG banner. and suddenly this latter group have moral high ground. hooray! inadequacies, excuses and insecurities can finally be swept under a PC title.<br><br>if this doesn't provoke a response i don't know what will.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 27 February 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 27 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>terence:<br>a very provoking post indeed!  you single-handedly managed to make SNAGs look like wimps in one single post!  :p<br><br>c'mon, SNAGS are not as gut-lacking as you think.  Being sensitive doesn't equal un-macho.  it doesn't conjures up pictures of weeping men at every sad movie.  &amp; it doesn't mean that SNAGs cry when they meet any obstacle in their life!  this would be more ridiculous than those taiwanese tearjerkers!<br><br>SNAGs are just like everyday-guy, with the additional 'feature' of sensitivity.  The picture you painted, Terence, reminds me of wimps and losers who can't take responsibility of their life and are hiding behind the pretense of being a SNAG.  A very sad picture indeed.<br><br>VRT: you are probably quite correct.  but its always funny how fate manages to deliever what you exactly do not want right to your doorstep.<br><br>kickme: send in your application form to your nearest SNAG society.  they just might take you in their SNAG-reeducation class.   :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>terence - so a snag issues from an inversion of values in the nietzschean sense? would your reading then not come up against the standard charge that it is a genetic fallacy to discount the value of snag-ness (and so of snagdom) on the basis of the motivations for being a snag?</div>
