            <div class='col-md body'>Ray,<br><br>You have to be more specific when you talk about Â‘Nietzschean senseÂ’ because that syphilis-wrought German varied in value definition, i.e. the Ubermensch? The Will to Power? The Eternal Recurrence? Nihilism? Etc.<br><br>However if you mean inversion of values as paralleled by the value-appropriation of the weak for moral high ground against the strong, thus inverting the value-ness in values as a stable of philosophies, then what I said about SNAGS remains relevant. By inverting specific gender traits upon recognition of unfavourable terrain for competition upon genetic (or even anthropological) flaws, SNAGS are effectively attempting to change the rules of the game. Furthermore, I did mention that this state of affairs is a result of hijacking, whether or not SNAG-dom began as inversion remains to be proven. Therefore, yes, I DO question the entire motive for SNAG-ness from this hijacking onwards.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>terence - to be fair, the illness is thought (by some at least) to have been contracted while treating soldiers in the battle front. regardless whether that was indeed the case, it no doubt contributed to his affirmation of strength and his constant theme of the overcoming of illness (variously defined).<br><br>indeed i am speaking of the slave revolt and the inversion of values which issued from it. arguably that provides the basis for the subsequent inversions you speak of - tho i believe only the ubermensch embodies directly such an inversion (from judeo-christian (or all absolutist) morality). the others do not. the will to power was his conception of the basis of all life and all the world, tho this concept remains by all accounts problematic, esp. if one sees Nietzsche as denying all forms of metaphysics. the eternal return in my opinion is a little bit of an embarrassment, unless interpreted as a psychological test to differentiate those who would seize the moment from those who would wallow in despair. nihilism was his commentary on a godless world. i do not think i would consider every disagreement or statement nietzsche made to constitute an inversion. hence only talk of the ubermensch and of self (and value) creation constitute an inversion.<br><br>but still, the charge stands. convincing as it may sound, the argument as you presented above is a genetic fallacy.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ray,<br><br>Nietzsche patronised a brothel at least once. That is documented fact; in one of his dairies actually.  Now he may have contracted syphilis treating soldiers but I donÂ’t think so.<br><br>Nice glossary of terms but you have yet to make a case against my notion of Â‘genetic fallacyÂ’. I also have to disagree with Â“the ubermensch embodies directly such an inversionÂ” since the (re)appropriation of values vis-Ã -vis inversion or (re)contextualisation goes against the grain of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, probably the most defining text on the Ubermensch. Rather a Ubermenschian containment (in the individualist sense) requires value invention, not inversion (i.e. creating), on a single entity scale hence cannot by definition resort to inversion. SNAGism relies on this inversion because it implies (re)appropriation and (re)contextualisation of gender traits Â– hence make that which was once unacceptable (traditionally) acceptable. All by very dubious means of course. The parallels I drew were anthropological and allegorical in nature, and I stand by them.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry for boring everyone else to death.<br><br>this does not make sense to me - "since the (re)appropriation of values vis-Ã -vis inversion or (re)contextualisation goes against the grain of Thus Spoke Zarathustra".<br><br>in a world of self-creation, how are the two any different? while nietzsche did not really say that he would revert to a master morality, what he did speak of was value creation. whether inversion is part of this is really up to the ubermensch concerned (whoever or whatever that may be). so when i said: "only the ubermensch embodies directly such an inversion", i meant that of the terms you mentioned, only the ubermensch is capable of such an inversion.<br><br>further to the point about not making my case. the case was made in the very first of my posts. to commit a genetic fallacy in reasoning is to equate the value or worthiness of something on the basis of its (unsavoury?) origins. it has nothing to do with our discussion of nietzsche or the terms we have been debating on. remove all the talk of value inversion or creation and your argument is still a genetic fallacy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“what he did speak of was value creation.Â”<br><br>I think we have identified the point of our contention/misunderstanding. I hold that one cannot create a value since it is nothing but a regard that something is held to deserve importance or worth. One can create a notion of value but not a value in its formal sense. What the Ubermensch resolved to do was to create new morals from which to justify the particular values he held. Even the slave-morality had concomitant with itÂ’s particular set of values.<br><br>Also, I akin SNAGism with the slave morality not based on a genealogical lineage of morality or value, rather, because it matched certain mechanisms and patterns in ideology of the slave-morality. For example, Nietzsche held that the weak co-opted religion for higher moral ground because they could not compete with the master class. As with SNAGS, they often hijack the initial ideology of SNAGism as a shelter for their weaknesses and inability to compete with other men. In SNAGdom, their ineffectuality and non-competitiveness are nurtured and tended to, and subsequently but wrongly (in the original spirit of SNAGism) used as a moral weapon against other men.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>I can resist anything but temptation.<br><br>Oscar Wilde<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 03 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes, values are certainly not something we (or perhaps anyone else can) create in a vacuum. in fact it seems to be a universal law that nothing can arise without antecedent conditions of possibility (unless of course we are speaking of god, which we are not). seen in this way, it may be only a matter of emphasis when we speak of favouring one value over another. all that is needed here however is only to qualify the sense in which value creation takes place - that is, it cannot take place ex nihilo.<br><br>at the risk of turning this into a nietzsche forum, i am interested in how you would separate the creation of new morals from the particular values held. is the former merely a set of codes of conduct (to be) accepted by society? if so, you attribute to the ubermensch the notion of social or political reform - in itself contentious becos some say the ubermensch is a concept pertaining only to self-development (in an admittedly open society). how does the latter come about? how does the ubermensch come about the particular values he holds and wishes to promote? if we are not to rule out socio-historical forces that shape the ubermensch's values, then existing morals do play a role. but if morals do play a role, then even "new" morals cannot be all that new (the way new values are not all that new). further, what sharp (and meaningful) dividing line is there now between morals on the one hand, and (particular) values on the other? they seem to collapse into one another.<br><br>turning to snagism proper, you seem to imply that there is no worth to being a snag. and u seem (or at least seemed at the start) to do this by equating the origins of snaggism with incompetence in some men. let me link this to the slave morality. nietzsche sometimes concealed an admiration for the inversion of values undertaken by the slaves. but he saw this as being based on ressentiment. can we then say that slave morality is bad becos it issued from a failure to compete? we are now far removed from the socio-historical conditions which gave rise to the slave revolt. are we battling the same battle? what is crucial for us now is the worth of (the slave) morality for us - i.e. whether values like pity or meekness or whatever have any value now. the question is not HOW these values came about. which is why i brought up the genetic fallacy. because one would commit a genetic fallacy if one discounts the worth of a value (for instance) on the basis of its origins. but nietzsche does not make this mistake. he grounds it on physiology and tells us that slave morality (when we look at our make up) is not life-affirming - it does not give full play to the active forces which lie within us, but only affirms the reactive.<br><br>nietzsche, however, realises that to convince is not the same as to give sound arguments. that is, for the vast majority of ppl, to convince them of something is only to sway their emotions in some way. which is what i presume you are trying to do by equating snagism wif their motive for adopting snag characteristics - it may be a convincing argument against snagism, without it being at the same time a sound argument against snagism. and the latter is what matters in evaluations of formal logic. to turn your argument into one that is not a genetic fallacy, i believe you have to adopt the same tactic nietzsche did. that is, you have to show that there is something inherently unmanly about being a snag ("inherently" being the key word). you have to show that being "a man" is not merely a social construction and that apart from that construction there is still a residue left behind which is non-snag in nature.<br><br>but you have brought up a point which is interesting and i will briefly elaborate on that. let us grant that snagism has some value (it may be a wrong impression, but i gather you think snaggism has no value becos there is some essentialist way in which a man should be a man). what do we say about those who adopt snag qualities because of (non-snag) motives? is appearance (of snaggy-ness) all that matters? is it okay to be a snag just to get women? is it okay to be a snag cos it seems "in"? we are talking of a complex notion of value formation and what constitutes moral worth. just food for thought.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>ray,<br><br>My sojourn into neitzscheanism was based on your initial query Â‘so a snag issues from an inversion of values in the nietzschean sense?Â’. I thought it was an interesting analogy to juxtapose SNAGism with the slave/mastery morality and my dialectic with you was based on the similar (at least I perceived it to be) moral-(re)engineering mechanisms they shared. This explains why I didnÂ’t initially understand your Â‘genetic fallacyÂ’ charge. The similarities are all I had in mind.<br><br>1. Â“turning to snagism proper, you seem to imply that there is no worth to being a snag.Â”<br>No, I implied that SNAGs (re)fashion worth.<br><br>2. Â“and u seem (or at least seemed at the start) to do this by equating the origins of snaggism with incompetence in some men.Â”<br>No I didnÂ’t. My earlier post,<br>Â“SNAG, the 90s invention in reaction to the capital-driven MCP, was originally a cultivation of inner sensibilities and sensitivity BUT has NOW become hijacked by a long queue of sorry male candidates who cannot cope with the demands and taxes of being a man.Â”<br><br>3. Â“(it may be a wrong impression, but i gather you think snaggism has no value becos there is some essentialist way in which a man should be a man).Â”<br>No I didnÂ’t. I suggested the inability to compete can be transformed into a virtuous quality in SNAGdom.<br><br>Â“is appearance (of snaggy-ness) all that matters? is it okay to be a snag just to get women? is it okay to be a snag cos it seems "in"? we are talking of a complex notion of value formation and what constitutes moral worth. just food for thought.Â”<br>Yes, that is want IÂ’m pondering over too.

            <div class='col-md body'>this is prob why socrates preferred the spoken word. it is alive while the written word is lonely and cannot fend for itself. while you have stated your position more clearly now, i detect some ambivalence in your initial post, hence accounting for my reading.<br><br>with remarks like these, it's no wonder there was confusion:<br><br>"in the attempt to flee the responsibilities of a REAL man, a man turns into a SNAG"<br><br>hence implying that a snag is not a real man, and that there is such a thing as being a real man (quite apart from anatomy). also, the assumption seems to be that ALL snags are men who flee from responsibilities.<br><br>further on, you mentioned the snag's "failure to measure up to the rest of the GUYS", the capitalisation of the word "guys" serving as a deliberate point of contrast with the words "real" and "snag" earlier on (also capitalised to achieve effect) - i.e. implying that snags are not really GUYS.<br><br>having then led us (or at least me) to believe that there was an (essential or essentialist) difference between a snag and a REAL man, i was further led to infer your disdain for the snag thus:<br><br>"full-blooded competition, hunter instincts, confrontational bravo are qualities he lacks, thus cannot compete and so seeks refuge in women's magazines and late night agony aunt-type talks to women he wished he had the guts to fuck."<br><br>throughout there is an implicit contrast between a snag and a REAL man (i.e. they have qualities which are mutually exclusive, with the latter enjoying some sort of privilege), tho i must admit it was a rather amusing sketch that you made.<br><br>prob the clearest indication of a general disdain for the snag would lie here:<br><br>"previously an outcast, half a man and not a woman, he latches quickly to the label SNAG, a godsent from the 90s for he who is neither here nor there"<br><br>almost any reader would see this as meaning that ALL snags are "neither here nor there" (and not only those who cannot compete). further, presumably the snag is an outcast because he is neither a REAL man nor a woman, but somewhere in between. and also because he cannot (or could not) find any place in society that would find his snaggyness of any worth or value.<br><br>and once more, who would interpret the snag as having any redeeming qualities under the following description:<br><br>"how many men have high-powered jobs, played rugby in elite schools and are goodlooking to boot? these men move on, they seek and conquer, those who don't wave the SNAG banner" - implying that if you are in the latter group then you cannot belong to the former and that as a result, a snag is worthless.<br><br>so of the 3 points in your latest post, only point 2 is well taken. 1 and 3, i believe, remain fair readings of your initial post.<br><br>for now, maybe we should leave the post for those who would pick up where we left off. i fear we may already have killed all interest in this post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>I haven't written in ages, so don't ask why I'm starting now=) This MCP issue has been quite amusing, since it's mostly men debating upon it. The first posting I read made snags sound like faggots. Well, they're not you know. In fact, most of you guys have the snag in you, 'cept you don't realise it. Being a snag just means being able to be in tune with your emotions and not grunting to everything we females say. It also means that you'll talk to us when you're troubled and you'll listen to us when we're troubled. I'd say most Singaporean men have become snags. I meet very few MCPs nowadays. Of course, if you don't know what an MCP means, it stands for Male Chauvinist Pig.<br>Male Chauvinist Pigs are the guys who believe that women were born to cook, clean and reproduce. A woman is HIS property and he has the right to treat her and discipline her however he wishes. Most wife beaters are MCPs.<br>About girls wanting snags, well, I would want a guy with the qualities of a snag, but I want security and some qualities from a MAN. I know you guys are gonna say, so what DO you want, not here, not there. Simple truth is, most men are a hybrid of the snag and MCP. Odd how we never bother to sit down and think about these things till now.=)<br><br>------------------<br></div>
