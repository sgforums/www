            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Lau Cheow</span><br><br>Stung by the controversy surrounding George W. Bush's record during the Vietnam War, the US will send a special team to Singapore to study how it runs an effective National Service system.<br><br>Bush Administration officials released a statement praising Singapore's White Horse system, where sons of prominent members of society are carefully nurtured during their NS days.<br><br>White House spokesman, Lyle Truteith, told reporters that if the US had Singapore's White Horse system, President Bush would have been able to serve in Vietnam instead of spending his time in the National Guard, an issue that has become an embarrassment for the President. It was widely reported that George W. Bush had allegedly been AWOL for much of his service.<br><br>"White Horses are carefully groomed and protected, and if President Bush had been in Vietnam as a White Horse, he would have been promoted to a high rank very fast and put in charge of a highly important desk job marshaling the front-line forces. This would have put him in good stead for running future wars," said Mr. Truteith.<br><br>Singapore's system of rapid promotion for sons of political leaders was held up as a point of interest. If George W. Bush had been an SAF scholar (he went to Yale and had an MBA from Harvard), he would have become a Brigadier-General before he turned 40. This would have enhanced his reputation and give him credibility as Commander-in-Chief prosecuting the War in Iraq.<br><br>"Singapore is a fully developed nation with a high standard of living. If politicians can get away with having their sons rise rapidly in rank in the military and still command a greater than 75% approval rating in the elections, then it is something the US should look up to," marveled Mr. Truteith.<br><br>There are some differences before Singapore and the US, to be sure. In Singapore, retired Army Generals go on to serve in defense-related companies or enter politics, while in the US, it is the other way around. Vice-President Dick Cheney was the CEO of defense contractor Halliburton before becoming George W. Bush's running-mate in the 2000 elections.<br><br>Other US units will also be visiting Singapore: a Special Forces team will be attending an advanced course in POW interrogation techniques to be conducted by the SAF Commando Battalion. At the same time, a US Navy contingent will learn from the RSN how to ram merchant ships suspected of holding terrorists.<br><br>White House officials are considering buffing up George W. Bush's image as a 'White Horse' during his Vietnam years, and the slogan "From White Horse to White House" has been chosen to highlight his years of service in the US military.<br><br>-from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
