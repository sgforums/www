Pardon my late reply! Slept early last night..... *GRINZ* Well, the flock of sheep I am referring to is the bond-breakers and the black sheeps will be those who already have intentions to break the bond even before signing up for the scholarship! When I say that you should not pin-point, I mean you should not deem all bond-breakers to be the same as different people has different reason and of course different aspiration upon graduation. I am sure those who have intention to break their bond right from the beginning belong to the minority group and many actually want to continue to serve the bond except that the working environment may not be suitable for them now that they have different and higer expectations maybe.<br><br>As Revelations has said, it's not a free lunch after all, those bond breakers got to pay back and in higher sum too! Is it wrong of those bond-breakers to follow their hearts and to carry on with what they really want? Don't you think that it'll be better for them to break their bond and go work in a company which they really want to and put in 100% effort than stick around due to some "moral" obligation? There will be greater productivity then since those bond-breakers are after all scholars and we will want them to contribute to society, though in a different sector now.  :p<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since a number of foxes moved to the other forest in search for greener pastures, lion had been thinking. "Had I not been paying my advisors well? Of course I hadn't. They wouldn't have left if I had"<br><br>Lion refuse to see that commitment and loyalty and moral obligations should be his concern and decides to increase fox's pay packet to keep them in. Lion held an impromptu forest meeting to announce the advisor wage raising issue. Now the forest wasn't happy (less the foxes of course, who are sniggering now). Just 2 years ago, the forest went though a drought and a famine.. life was bad, and many animals can't hunt enough to feed the family till today.<br><br>Despite the usual protest, lion went ahead to increase foxes' paypacket believing that it will keep them as his advisor. "Top salaries for my best man!" said lion.<br><br>Now, another problem had arised in the forest. To groom future leaders of the forest, lion had been sending the smartest animals to learn their tricks from Owl who lives in a faraway mountains. This is on the condition that they come back to serve the forest community with the skills they learnt from owl. Lion had made it clear that those who are sent to owl in the faraway mountains  should be morally obliged to come back to share their wisdom. They should also be committed and loyal to lion. (Notice how these same words come up again?)<br><br>But alas... many of those who learnt from Owl never came back. Many left to serve the neighbouring forests which were bigger and wealtier. "I want to maximise my potential." said one. "It looks good on my resume that it was lion who finance my trip to the mountains!" said another. "It pays more at the amazon jungle." was another respond.<br><br>"But its a problem of moral obligations! What about your commitment to your forest, and your loyalty to me!" exclaimed lion.<br><br>The rest of the forest knew the root of the problem. Do you, boys and girls?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Illegal Operation (edited 20 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am sure tat nobody here wants to make a bad career choice and suffer 5/6 years down the road cos he made the wrong choice. On taking out scholarships, one outta have already planned for his/her career ahead and not juz taking the scholarship cos it looks good on his resume.<br><br>If one complains abt the shitload of work piled upon him and says tat he shldn't have taken out this scholarship if he'd known it, then FACE THE FACTS! The work's same everywhere, newbies DEFINITELY get bullied in one form or another. U don't expect a scholar to sit there and relax while the rest of em does the work right??<br><br>Also another thing is to PLAN AHEAD. JC Students, University Students are the so-called 'cream-of-crop' of society and they outta have known the effects of 'planning later' and 'planning ahead'. Besides asking for more information abt the scholarship, they outta have asked others abt the scholarship and then come to a decision. And NOT take out the scholarship cos of it's prestige and complain abt the work later on!<br><br>My salutes to the 127 Scholarship holders who've signed the pledge tat they will serve out their bonds.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>A Billion curses on those scholarship bond-breakers who PLAN to break their bonds (wif or wifout serving a single minute).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> A Zillion curses on those MALE scholarship holders who have completed their NS and BROKE their bonds!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>It seems that National Service have not changed their way of thinking and instil the word INTEGRTY into their heads.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeap, went out with my friends and ex-tutor just now. Talking about this issue, my tutor too condemned the 11 scholars who spoke out. She shared my sentiments that the students were dumb to let go such information which should be kept to themselves, to the press. Apart from that, the very fact that they do not honour their words at the time they put their signature lessens the credibility of their words in the future. From the conversation, I agreed too that there must be a sense of responsibility in that.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, for overseas scholarships provided by the government and other stat boards, what do they provide the scholars??? In no particular order of importance:<br><br>1) Cash - over a quarter of a million big ones spread over a period of four years - which means no need to depend on your parents or bank loans for money.<br>2) Prestige - the term scholar is definitely an attractive point for many, and with the term scholar in one's CV, it is definitely the icing on the cake with the cherry on top.<br>3) Self-worth - the opportunity to prove to oneself of one's worth, the sense of fulfilment and confidence, which is important, the ability after a series of gruelling tests to say, just did it.<br>4) Job security - the insurance that after completing a degree, there will be a post, and an important one too, awaiting when you return.<br><br>Therefore, for me, any of the above is equally good a motivation to apply for a scholarship. Competition is intense, and only the best man wins. So well, irregardless of whether or not those who hanker the other three motivations rather than the first are selfish, the fact is, everyone competes on an equal footing. The system can't satisfy all. So, no selfish or not selfish lah, all these are transparent.<br><br>And err...... regarding the charisma part, if there is someone who really thinks that way, please let me know.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahaha, well, for the justifications that I put, there are definitely those who put more value in one over the others. For a needy student, it is definitely the first justification which overrules the rest, but for others, maybe one of the other three overrules the first??? All in all, I still believe that the fundamental purpose of a scholarship is not to fund the student's passageway to an overseas degree. In other countries, yes (and there is usually no bonds attached), in Singapore, I don't think so. It is simply an award given to the cream of the crop, in exchange for the six best years of their lives (used to be eight somemore). In short, it is sort of a business transaction on the government's part. They provide the money, you provide them the youth.<br><br>If my news is not incorrect, DBS bank has recently changed the system of its scholarship, since it too recognises this fact. Upon completion of the scholarship, there is now another choice open. Instead of serving out the bond, one can instead choose to repay the entire expenses over the years in the form of a bank loan. Not bad I should think.<br><br>So one question though, would it be justifiable to say that a rich kid is any less worthy of a scholarship and that a family income ceiling be imposed to all scholarship applicants??? And should the family income of an applicant be indexed as one of the chief considerations in awarding the scholarship??<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding giving chance, I tend to liken the competition amidst the scholars to maybe the competition among major firms in Singapore. Would one big firm say give chance to the small firm when faced with a business opportunity simply because it doesn't need this to survive???
