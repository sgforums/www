You make it sound like promoters are avaricious and greedy people out to sink their hands into you wallet. There are some products out there in the market which Helps people. My product ,for example, helps home owners save money. No doubt that the aim of selling a product is to earn money, but whats wrong with that? Earning money is not even my primary goal. Its the smile and compliments given to me by a satisfied consumer that makes me happy. Not the money. promoters who think of nothing but money are bound to fail in their job. this is the reason why I want to work for this company.
