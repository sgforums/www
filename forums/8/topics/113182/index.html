            <div class='col-md body'>Because some, if not most of them are scams. They trick you that you've won something and that you're going to be given free stuff, and free air tickets etc. These people are tricking you, wasting your time and eventually want your money.<br><br>Our society unfortunately has turned into one of professional con artiste. They don't claim to be con men, but their underlying motives for promoting their product con you out of their money, no matter how professionally they sell it to you.<br><br>But no matter what we say about how bad they are, there are still suckers out there who fall for it and then later regret it and bitch about it.
