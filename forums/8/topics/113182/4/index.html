            <div class='col-md body'>something to share with u shade, after reading ur post......<br><br>1. instead of putting in efford to improve ur skill, ur pitch, ur appearance so that ppl feel more comfortable when u approach them, you are wasting time to post here, this does not seem to be quite POSITIVE. As a sales person, i think you are not commission based, that's y u feel less pressured, and go the time feel 'angry", "pissed off". A real positive sales person will fully spend his time to do the most productive work to maximise his sales for te maximum possible income. obviously u r not.<br><br>2. It is great to know that you have confidence and 100% belief in your company and product. But have you purchased, used it before? How you gonna pursuade potential customer if u urself nvr used it?<br><br>3. Don't your manager teach you the way to handle rejections instead of crying out loud here? Don't you hear before that every "NO" will push you closer to a "YES"? so y fear of rejections? y frustrated? y pissed off? If u do think that your company is good, ur product is good, then it is OUR LOSS for ignoring/avoiding you and not talking to u, not your loss, and we deserved the loss. if u are frustrated by this, u got a lots to catch up in ur mindset.<br><br>4. A business, a industry is always meant for the goods fo human before it can go big, boom. It is always the ppl who doing it send out the bad image/reputation to the public, nothing wrong with the business/industry itself. Insurance is meant for ppl's good, same goes to MLM, but the ppl doing it use the wrong way.<br><br>5. Think about it, when you are on your way to mrt, after a long day work, you have in front of u a booth of AIA, a booth of PRUDENTIAL, then a booth of SINGNET BROADBAND, then PROPERTY, then credit card and on ur way out of mrt to bus interchange, also similar thing, so how many you gonna entertain? It is not liek wat u all say "spend 1 minute" will habis stuff, everyone i entertain, how long do i take to go home from work?<br><br>just my 2 cents worth<br><br>a tip to avoid roadshow ppl that i am using is, putting on my mobile earpiece, those with 2 earphones one, and nvr have eye contact with them.</div>

Telling me that I save 2000 bucks because this product used to cost more is totally bollocks.<br><br>2) <span style="color: orange;">you are a sales person. u deal with selling 'products'. what loss is there from a customer?  a customer has the right to choose a product, a right not to purchase from you.<br><br>unless you are telling me that a street person can invest $1 and get back $2 in a week. Then you can b itch 'if they reject me, it's their loss.'.<br>If your product does not earn a person any value, be it monetary or intrinsic (eg. health.)  it is a "LOSS-making" product.

But if you go with our services, you pay less than 0.5% of an agents comission. In both cases the objective is the same and as long as you sell your house, you definitely must pay money. Its a matter of how much you pay. Tts all.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Allow me to humbly correct you<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">. the word "idiot" is used as a metaphor here. If you have the opportunity to save $4000 and you decide to forgo it jus because you were somewhat unwilling to hear me out, then I think the word idiot would be a bit of an undrstatement.</span><br><span style="color: orange;"><br><br>The customers "loss" is in the sense that they lose out on a potential savings of thousands of dollars. The value of my company's products lies in the fact that we help our clients save lots of money i fthey choose to go through us instead of going through an agent.<br><br>[color=green]I do not earn a single cent if my clients sell their house. I earn when I help them save money. get that right. IM NOT a property agent. SO I DO NOT TAKE A CUT FROM MY CLIENT'S PROCEEDS!!!</span><br><br></div>

As a sales person, i think you are not commission based, that's y u feel less pressured, and go the time feel 'angry", "pissed off". A real positive sales person will fully spend his time to do the most productive work to maximise his sales for te maximum possible income. obviously u r not.<br><br>2. It is great to know that you have confidence and 100% belief in your company and product. But have you purchased, used it before? How you gonna pursuade potential customer if u urself nvr used it?<br><br>3. Don't your manager teach you the way to handle rejections instead of crying out loud here? Don't you hear before that every "NO" will push you closer to a "YES"? so y fear of rejections? y frustrated? y pissed off? If u do think that your company is good, ur product is good, then it is OUR LOSS for ignoring/avoiding you and not talking to u, not your loss, and we deserved the loss. if u are frustrated by this, u got a lots to catch up in ur mindset.<br><br>4. A business, a industry is always meant for the goods fo human before it can go big, boom. It is always the ppl who doing it send out the bad image/reputation to the public, nothing wrong with the business/industry itself. Insurance is meant for ppl's good, same goes to MLM, but the ppl doing it use the wrong way.<br><br>5. Think about it, when you are on your way to mrt, after a long day work, you have in front of u a booth of AIA, a booth of PRUDENTIAL, then a booth of SINGNET BROADBAND, then PROPERTY, then credit card and on ur way out of mrt to bus interchange, also similar thing, so how many you gonna entertain? It is not liek wat u all say "spend 1 minute" will habis stuff, everyone i entertain, how long do i take to go home from work?<br><br>just my 2 cents worth<br><br>a tip to avoid roadshow ppl that i am using is, putting on my mobile earpiece, those with 2 earphones one, and nvr have eye contact with them.</div></blockquote>1. Well...you have a point here. Im obviously not doing anything productive when I Bitch on this forum.

And we are going to send shockwaves rippling across the entire real estate market with our new concept on how to sell your property in the shortest of time and yet save loads of your money!!(Agents 2% comission)<br><br>3. LOL. yes yes. my manager trains me on that. And one day perhaps I'll be telling people under me that. Like I said, i hope to change your mindset through posting here ;D<br><br>4. Im still working on a solution how to really show people that my company's services is pure gold for them. I want people to look at me and my company's products and be able to realise that we are hear helping them. this is the reason why I dont pester people unneccessarily. Usually if they are not interested, it means they are not selling their house. But at least I want them to be aware of my company and not have the mindset that selling house=Propnex or ERA, My company offers you a NEW way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>5. If thats the case. It is YOUR LOSS.

They are so damn eager to do sales that they forget basic courtesy. haiz...I learn frm their mistakes.

We sales promoters are not scums or anything. We are just here to create an awareness of our company's existence and the benefits of using our product.
