You still think that we are so greedy? of course sales is a number game. the more products and services we sell, the more we earn. But we do it in an honest and transparent manner and there is nothing wrong with that. We do not give empty promises and we are very transparent in our approach.

But if you go with our services, you pay less than 0.5% of an agents comission. In both cases the objective is the same and as long as you sell your house, you definitely must pay money. Its a matter of how much you pay. Tts all.<br></blockquote>in your previous post, you are complaining about people who shunned you.<br>Not EVERYONE wants to sell their house.<br>I got the impression that since you are doing this line, you immediately assume that everyone HAS to sell their house to 'save'.<br><br><blockquote><br>Allow me to humbly correct you<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">. the word "idiot" is used as a metaphor here. If you have the opportunity to save $4000 and you decide to forgo it jus because you were somewhat unwilling to hear me out, then I think the word idiot would be a bit of an undrstatement.<br></blockquote>same as above. if someone is not going to sell his/her house. who is the bigger idiot?<br><br>Besides, you are working on the assumption that the agent fee is constant. Some other agents , I assure you, can offer more savings at a more competitve rate than your company. Otherwise, you won't even be standing there begging for people.<br><br>If your company is competitive, people WILL queue up and ask you to sell their house for them.<br><br>First of all, You don't even treat your potentials as potentials (but idiots). How to even get big business in the future?<br><br><blockquote><br>The customers "loss" is in the sense that they lose out on a potential savings of thousands of dollars. The value of my company's products lies in the fact that we help our clients save lots of money i fthey choose to go through us instead of going through an agent.<br><br>I do not earn a single cent if my clients sell their house. I earn when I help them save money. get that right. IM NOT a property agent. SO I DO NOT TAKE A CUT FROM MY CLIENT'S PROCEEDS!!!<br></blockquote>Sure, u can claim that you don't earn anything.<br><br>Then let me ask you. Do you get basic salary? AWS? or fixed commission per sale?<br><br>or are you doing voluntary?<br><br>is your company a registered non-profit company?<br><br>if not, then that paragraph is all bollocks.  Profits that are transparent to you and the customer doesn't mean transparent to the company. If the company is not earning anything, do you think your company will survive? Don't be naive.<br><br>In the line of sales, you are not competing just on price. I can guarrentee you that.<br><br>There are people who rather save 'less' (in your terms) by going to someone who provides better customer service. Than going to a 'cheap' agent.<br><br>Simply put. Sell a product cheap, you get cheap customers.<br><br>If you think your best sales tatic is your pricing (ie. savings). then I think you've a bloody long way to go.</div>
