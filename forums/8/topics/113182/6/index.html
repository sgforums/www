But if you go with our services, you pay less than 0.5% of an agents comission. In both cases the objective is the same and as long as you sell your house, you definitely must pay money.

Tts all.<br><br>Allow me to humbly correct you<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">. the word "idiot" is used as a metaphor here. If you have the opportunity to save $4000 and you decide to forgo it jus because you were somewhat unwilling to hear me out, then I think the word idiot would be a bit of an undrstatement.<br><br>The customers "loss" is in the sense that they lose out on a potential savings of thousands of dollars.
