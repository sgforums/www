              <p>I just did an online booking on Jetstar. There were some browser problem so I called the Singapore customer service hotline to check if my booking had gone through, just in case i would have made double booking if i re-book the tix.</p>
              <p>The guy over the phone, Anson whatsoever, was fine on the phone initially when I asked him to double check my details and ensure there were no bookings done. I asked a second time that he was sure the booking didn't go thru, and if there could be any records that he could send me to verify that there were no booking. BAsically i was asking for reassurance and I was just afraid of making a double booking and i would have 2 tix on the same flight. He then started in a condescending tone that I could check my credit card record. To my ignorance, I thought he would be able to check that for me; and to my annoyance, he started in a condescending tone (a bit hongkong accented too) that I would have to contact my own bank, and went into length abt how i could get that done. All that was fine except his tone of mockery and down right condescending. I got pissed, and I asked for his name, he told me Anson, I asked for last name, he said its a policy we dont reveal our last name. I was really irritated and I said that you guys should really watch the way you talk to your customers and your customer service level is really low. I hung up on that.</p>
              <p>I went on to search on Jetstar site for a feedback channel. None.</p>
              <p>Personally I would never travel on Jetstar again. My first experience with them was not hot either - rushing for seat and lack of ground staff support. this 2nd encounter shows them to be a company to offer cheap service but not good service. Customer Svs obviously something far from their corporate values (also evident from their recent bad press on not assisting / rejecting the so-called dependent travellers) I will be a fool to go to them for the third time.</p>

              <p>well its called budget airline for a reason...and i bet their staff would have the mentality that their customers are all cheapos seeking for cheap deals. so i guess we should keep our expectations low.</p>
              <p>i doesnt look good for us, budget seekers, to be making such a din, but im with u in this...if they gave u this kind of crap attitude, we should really kick up a fuzz and complain at every channel possible. furthermore, their reputation would suffer more than ours.</p>
              <p>that said, im flying on Tiger Airways come June, if they screw up any of my bookings...i'd be giving them hell <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"></p>
              <p>and if im not wrong...there are some travel insurance packages that covers wrong bookings due to mis-communications and all that right? if anyone has more details on that pls post it here for the benefit of all of us. thanks in adv.</p>

              <p>I am in the service industry too and I really hate cheapos making alot of noise/weird request. If you are ignorant of how your own credit card works, dont blame people for being condescending when explaining things that are not under their jobscope to you. I am sure your car mechanic will be condescending towards you also if you ask him to fix your computer for you.</p>
              <p>staff working for low budget operations have to juggle alot of work so they are typically very busy. If customer service is a thing for you, go for a major airline where their customer service staff are properly trained to handle stupid requests</p>

              <p>low budget operations expect its staff to handle alot of stuff so if you are someone using a low budget service, you need to know that the person you are talking with is overwork and has no time answering silly questions. People need to understand that you get what you pay for.</p>
              <p>The same logic applies comparing a no brand electronics with a branded electronic. with no brand electronics, there is no warrenty or if you are lucky a few weeks warrenty but branded electronics have warrenty of years. people can understand this concept when s/he is buying things but when it comes to services, they expect everything to be the best while paying peanuts.</p>

              <p>i think no matter what price you pay, you expect decent services... i worked as a waitress in the US when i studied there and we were expected to give good services no matter if we were tipped.

              <p>if the staff are overworked, they should not pass it onto the customers. they should let their boss know and work it out. common, market is pretty good. fire your boss if you think you are overworked and not compensated fairly. hint hint chibet.  </p>

              <p>US boss are more open to suggestion than Singapore ones.</p>
              <p>US boss says something, they mean it to be that way. Singapore boss says something, they do it becos government says so.</p>

              <p>I have used Jetstar three time. Here are my experiences</p>
              <p><strong>1st Time</strong></p>
              <p>Booked the flight, arrived on the dot, flew and that's it. No interactions with customer service officers.</p>
              <p><strong>2nd Time</strong></p>
              <p>Booked the flight, coup in Bangkok. Called to say that I will like to postpone my flight. Went through the customer service officer and his supervisor. Finally allowed to postpone my flight but at a price of SGD40 per person per trip. i.e. $160 to postpone the flight. But as I was unsure of when I can travel (didn't know when the coup will be over), my flight was postpone till a stipulated date. I can travel anytime before that date. Due to miscommunication, I didn't know the exact date that I have to use my tickets. My tickets were almost forfeited. After a letter of explanation (via snail mail), I managed to redeem my tickets. Took 2 weeks to settle this.</p>
              <p><strong>3rd Time</strong></p>
              <p>Had problems with their internet booking system. Called them to let them know that their site has been unstable at different times of the day. Was told by the first customer service officer that I have to keep trying. Called again and was finally entertained by another customer service officer. Managed to phone book without paying the extra phone booking fee.</p>
              <p>My personal feedback. Jetstar is generally hassle free as long as nothing abnormal occurs. Book, pay, fly and that's it. But once you hit a problem and had to speak to someone, there will be some hassle involved in getting your problem solved. The greater the problem, the greater the hassle. Is this unfair to the customer? Well, remember that we really didn't pay a lot for it. Customer service is indeed a paid service and we cannot compare a budget airline service to a premium one.</p>
              <p>Hassle aside, at the end of all the hassle, I generally do get what I want. Perhaps that's the downside of anything 'budget'.</p>
              <p>That's my take. Hope its a fair assessment of the company. </p>

              <p>TS is guilty for the declining customer service standard in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Being a customer service officer before, I know how idiotic some Singaporean customer can get. Tons of shit and ridiculous attitude.</p>
              <p>Therefore, i personally salute those who works in customer service line as it is not an easy job.</p>

              I only had a 2-way trip with them....Singapore to Phuket and back...depart a few days before 2007 end...come back after new year's day...Flight over there was OK...nothing special...come back that time I wanted to buy their Jetstar toy for my kid...so I waited some time(around 5 mins) after they ended their food selling before asking why they havent start their merchandise selling(cos that was the procedure when I went Phuket)...they told me that they have already closed their buying system and would not be able to start it again...no announcement or anything like that lor...I was quite pissed but the plane was going into descent and so LL have buckle up...after landing I decided its not worth my time arguing about it but U can guess which airline I am NOT going to take for my next flight to Phuket.
              
              I mean I dont expect full service like SIA or Silkair...but basic standard have to be there mah...I dunno about U people...I do consider letting passengers know what's happening as basic standard...

              <p>As a waitress, its your job to serve your customers. You do not cook, wash the toilet and serve the customers.</p>
              <p>Do you tip a self service food attendent/counter staff?</p>
              <p>My point is that when you are using a budget service, they do not have a dedicated customer service. Most likely,you are speaking with an admin staff who answers the service hotline on top of his usual duty. (remember this is a DIY service, the operator are not really expecting people to call them and ask them these kind of stuff.)</p>
              <p>From you comments, I am sure you had never hold a job in Singapore before.</p>
              <p>In Singapore,</p>
              <p>the employers are allowed to ask you if you have a criminal record in the job application form.</p>
              <p>the employers are allowed to ask you if you plan to get pregnant in the next 2-3 years</p>
              <p>overtime pay is a luxury not practice by all companies.</p>
              <p>there is a very large pool of 'foreign talent' who are willing to work for very low pay and for some reason, the government are encouraging employers to hire 'foreign talent' over locals.</p>
