            <div class='col-md body'>got a guy, debal. He pm-med me lots of times. telling me stories about how he got turned on by his sexy mother and was asking for opinions to support him and his mother becoming lovers. he claims he is 18 years old.<br><br>Then he often act innocent or gentlemenly by apologising first but asking very sexual questions.  Which I felt is leading to trying to say that I 'support' his obsession with sex with his mother or other more senior females.<br><br>Just now, he added me on MSN messenger, identified himself as Judy with a msn picture of a sexy mature lady with a sweet dimple.<br><br>Then after some questions, he admitted he is debal.<br><br>Thats when I got fed up. I asked for his direct contact numbers but he did not dare to reveal to me.<br><br>Instead he just keeps apologising and begging me not to report him to the authorities.<br><br>My patience finally runs dry with his constant begging and apologisiing.<br><br>To me, I felt that liers are never believable.  Especially online.  No amount of begging and apologising can mask away his original intention to cheat, lie, misrepresent and coercing of support for his obssession for sex with his mother.  Or the fact that he is getting his thrill asking personal sexual preferances questions to those females he PM.<br><br>HIS MSN ID IS ibookie@hotmail.com<br></div>
