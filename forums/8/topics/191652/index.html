He lost in the 1959 general election, but was able to win a by-election in Anson in 1961. After losing his seat again in 1963, he returned to practise law but remained active in opposition politics until 1972, when J. B. Jeyaretnam became leader of the Workers' Party.<br><br>From 1978 to 1993, Marshall served as Singapore's Ambassador to France, Portugal and Switzerland. As Singapore's ambassador, Marshall always defended his country's interests, despite his differences with Lee Kuan Yew's government. He retired from the diplomatic corps in 1993.<br><br>He died in 1995 as a result of lung cancer."</div>
