Just like whatever you're doing for her and treating her, it's the SAME as what you're doing for the others... Don't give her ANY opportunity to feel SPECIAL.... BREAK her MOOD when you're nice to her, or when she's got those 'funny look' at you.... Be a REAL TURN OFF every now and then.... &lt;- Can try digging your nose in front of her... Crack some LOUSY RIDICULOUS jokes.... FORGET about her BIRTHDAY and things she do... ESPECIALLY things she WISHED you would NOTICE or REMEMBER...<br><br><strong>When to say NO?</strong><br>Try not to spend too much time and effort on her... Don't spend too much 1-1 time on her... Show her that your other friends or things are MORE IMPORTANT than her by arranging your meet up schedules with her in such a way that she'll KNOW that you're placing her BEHIND ALOT of PEOPLE.... Direct UNNECESSARY EYE CONTACT... GET the HELL out of there when it's TOO QUIET...<br><br></blockquote></div>
