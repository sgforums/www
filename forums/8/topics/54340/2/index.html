I'm half jew, my dad is jew, my grandparents are Jew.. that statement makes u no better than a racist. They dont think they are better than anyone else, we are all born equal in God's eyes. So what if they believe they are the Chosen people? This is what their religion tells them, they are just having faith in their religion just like anyone else.<br><br>Pisses u off? Well too bad. I've heard someone go as far as to say that they deserved the holocaust. To know that there are people who can witness such horrible disasters to happen to humans and agree with it makes my hair stand. The Nazis practically single-handedly almost wiped out an entire race.<br><br>Sorry, but i just feel very strongly about this topic. You'd all be pi$sed too if someone was having a go at your race.</div>
