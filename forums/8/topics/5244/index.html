            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, going by age expectancy where women in most countries outlive men by around 3-5 years, it may make better sense for women to marry younger men so that they won't be lonely.<br><br>Then again, I still prefer older guys.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it happens everywhere cos girls naturally mature faster than guys, so they tend to seek out guys who are of their "maturity level" who tend to be older. Its a fact cos girls hit puberty before guys (hey! sec 2 science!), but a lot of pple i know are attached to pple their age... *eeew that word is sooo... binding... attached... joined...eeeew*  so maybe there is hope yet Angel of Despair!

            <div class='col-md body'>the 'maturity' case is one thing<br><br>but also, when they go for older guys,<br>the seek them because they definately have more stories to tell (experience) and know what to do when faced with a disaster<br><br>they also have more money<br>they are more probable to be driving a car<br>more probable they will take care of their gfs feelings<br><br>for us guys, we always like to try out many dumb/dangrous things especially when we're teenagers, 10000x more than girls, so we tend to screw up, make a fool of ourselves, hurt ourselves, and in turn seem like a joke to our gfs, also our gfs wouldn't want to try it with us. they would want to hear about it, but if it's something embarrasing and the whole world knows it and mocks her about it, most girls don't really know how to handle the mocking and begin the "he's not my bf" stage.<br><br>but older guys, chances are higher also that people will never find out his embarrasing moments because her friends of the same age (guys/gers) dont hang out in the same group often enough<br><br>gosh, I don't know where I'm going here... but anyway, a older guy is a definate PLUS for a sg/my/ch ger...<br><br>oh ya, all the above doesn't work with japanese/taiwan/korea/thai/aus because they are FAR may i add F**KING FAR more open minded than sg/my/ch gers... can't blame the gers! blame the oppressive country and parents for suppressing the gers so much, now they're put in an akward position where if they like a younger guy their peers will mock em "eeeirr" etc, and things dont work out etc.. dont blame gers, blame the country and their parents...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Girls might want an older person to be their partner, cos they need protection perhaps. Someone older than the girl might give them more security, and cos the guy's experienced a bit more, so the girl might want advice on her own problems, coming from someone more experienced than she is.<br><br>Girls look up to their fathers as well, and having an older guy, a man, might give her a lot of security, and remind her a bit of the protection that she used to have as a little girl. Girls are more 'manja' affectionate, and most like to be the little one that gets all the affection. I'm not saying that this is the case for every girl, just maybe most who prefer older guys as their partners.<br><br>I've seen guys going out with older girls, and there's nothing wrong, as long as they are the right one for each other.<br><br>Bottom line, sense of security is what girls look for. Someone to protect them, love them, so age doesn't really matter, if the girl thinks that the younger guy is mature enough to think, and can give her all of those.<br><br>Am I blabbering?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>has anybody considered that, in singapore at least, guys have to go through national service? that means that in university, the girls will be 2 1/2 years younger than their guy classmates. also, it's not practical for a girl to have a boyfriend who is younger than her, as she will be out working and earning $$ while he is still finishing his studies. personally, it's not so bad to me if he's abt maybe 1-2 years younger, but it's still more practical to date older guys.<br><br>at least, that's what i've reasoned. any other p.o.v.s?<br><br>Amelia Alexis</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Blur,<br><br>you're mixing up sense of security with protection lah. Doesn't mean that when we look for a sense of security, we want to be treated like a defenceless child. 'Protection' is too extreme. We just want to know that our man is reliable and won't abandon us when the going gets rough.<br><br>Personally, I have misgivings about the father complex (i.e. going out with much older men for the 'father love' they give). When I was 18, I went out with a 31 year old guy. It was HORRIBLE. He assumed he knew better about everything. I knew it was well-intentioned but it got really irritating after a while.</div>
