              <p>I live here in Singapore for the past 10 years. As you, i have also wondered why so much indians gather there on weekends. I don't know the answer until few months back. Though, i am Indian, we are creamy (call ourselves) layers who does white collar job and would hardly go to Little india except to buy our grocieries. But, the people who gathers there are blue collar workers, Supporting my friends business, i had a chance with them to interact and most of them live in the dormotories in Tuas, Jurong. Most of the week, they eat their self prepared food (though, it will be horrible, they have no choice), during weekends, they can spend few dollars on so called good food from little indian restaurants and most importantly coming there to interact with their own villagers who work here. The reason for gather is to pass on information back to village friends, family , to send electronics good and to gather information about the happening in their and neighbouring villages back in India.</p>
              <p>Though, it may seems to be a gathering, if you notice, there will be small pockets of people, most of them are from same villages and neighboring villages.</p>
              <p>It is true that it can be irritating when you want to glide through their staring eye (if you are with your wife or girl friend), but, we have no choice unless avoid weekend evenings. This is not the case in India, but, here it is different, because too many singles at a same time.</p>

                      they have no choice), during weekends, they can spend few dollars
                      on so called good food from little indian restaurants and most
                      importantly coming there to interact with their own villagers who
                      work here. The reason for gather is to pass on information back to
                      village friends, family , to send electronics good and to gather
                      information about the happening in their and neighbouring villages
                      back in India.</p>
              <p>Though, it may seems to be a gathering, if you notice, there
                      will be small pockets of people, most of them are from same
                      villages and neighboring villages.</p>
              <p>It is true that it can be irritating when you want to glide
                      through their staring eye (if you are with your wife or girl
                      friend), but, we have no choice unless avoid weekend evenings. This
                      is not the case in India, but, here it is different, because too

              <p>I apologise to u on behalf of racist singaporeans. I assume that u are also from India? U see, here in Singapore, most mountain tortoise have never left this small dot and always think narrow minded, when they see construction workers gather around in little India, they auto think all indians are like that.</p>
              <p>Some post racist remarks to stir trouble. But our govt is not tolerant of these things</p>
              <p>i know those porr indian workers are really pitiful working in the hot sun to send money back home, Most of them actually eat @ Hindu temples on weekends and they really miss their family at home.</p>
              <p>They only find company among themselves as there is no other way they could mix with locals because of cultural differences. Even so , they do not mix with Sgporean indians too . I am not  surprised that even sgporean indian shun them</p>

              </p><p>just like the whites in western countries , sgporeans have their ugly side thinking themselves so highly like they are superior beings and shunning those who are not like them. These people grew up in material comfort and will never realise what the poor man goes thru. its of no use blaming them.</p>
              <p>Now there is class divide between locals themselves because of elitism mentality. if are a teacher in local schools, u can easily identify wif this in the currrent young generation.</p>
