            <div class='col-md body'>Message: At an airport, I overheard a father and his<br>daughter in their last moments together. They had<br>announced her plane's departure and standing near<br>the door she said, "Daddy, our life together has<br>been more than enough. Your love is all I ever<br>needed. I wish you enough too, Daddy."<br><br>They kissed good-bye and she left. He walked over<br>towards the window where I was seated. Standing<br>there I could see he wanted and needed to cry. I<br>tried not to intrude on his privacy, but he<br>welcomed me in by asking, "Did you ever say good-<br>bye to someone knowing it would be forever?"<br><br>"Yes, I have," I replied. Saying that brought<br>back memories I had of expressing my love and<br>appreciation for all my Dad had done for me.<br>Recognizing that his days were limited, I took<br>the time to tell him face to face how much he<br>meant to me. So I knew what this man was<br>experiencing.<br><br>"Forgive me for asking, but why is this a forever<br>good-bye?" I asked.<br><br>"I am old and she lives much too far away. I have<br>challenges ahead and the reality is, her next<br>trip back will be for my funeral," he said.<br><br>"When you were saying good-bye I heard you<br>say, 'I wish you enough,may I ask what that<br>means?"<br><br>He began to smile. "That's a wish that has been<br>handed down from other generations. My parents<br>used to say it to everyone."<br><br>He paused for a moment and looking up as if<br>trying to remember it in detail, he smiled even<br>more. "When we said, 'I wish you enough,' we were<br>wanting the other person to have a life filled<br>with enough good things to sustain them." He<br>continued and then, turning toward me, he shared<br>the following as if he were reciting it from<br>memory:<br><br>I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude<br>bright.<br>I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun<br>more.<br>I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit<br>alive.<br>I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys<br>in life appear much bigger.<br>I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting.<br>I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you<br>possess.<br>I wish you enough "Hellos" to get you through the<br>final "Good-bye"<br>He then began to sob and walked away.<br><br>My friends and loved ones, I wish you enough.<br><br>They say, "It takes a minute to find a special<br>person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love<br>them, but an entire lifetime to forget them"<br><br>Send this phrase to the people you'll never<br>forget and also remember to send it to the person<br>who sent it to you. It's a short message to let<br>them know that you'll never forget them.<br><br>If you don't send it to anyone, it means that<br>you're in a hurry and you need to slow down to<br>enjoy what is around you, the people around<br>you...<br><br>I wish you enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
