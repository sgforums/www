            <div class='col-md body'>Love:<br><br>Extracted from a magazine.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I had been trying for ages to get this bird at my work to go out with me. Her name was Cheryl and she was a cracking redhead with a Denise Van Outen body. I knew I had to play it cool and not get carried away when we finally went out for an evening. Mind you, that wasn't easy as Cheryl was wearing an ultra-tight red dress that made the most of her superb body. She looked good enough to eat and I would have eaten her like a shot if only she'd given me the word! Anyway, after a pricey night of taking her to a restaurant, a film and then a club I finally got to drive Cheryl home in my VW Golf. Of course, when we arrived outside her parents' house in a cul-de-sac there had to be a little kiss and cuddle goodnight. That was the least after I could get after shelling out all that dosh on her! As we tickled each other's tonsils I went for a little grope of her boobs and bum and, to my astonishment, Cheryl didn't seem to mind. If anything, she was encouraging me. By now, my knob was rock-hard and when I carefully steered Cheryl's hand on it she just gave a little gasp and left her hand there, stroking it through my trousers.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">We were going well over the top and a lot further than I thought I'd get. Then Cheryl insist we get in the back seat. The thought that we were right outside her parents' house occurred to me, but I was too horny to be bothered. Besides, it was 4.00am - who was going to be around to see?</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the back, Cheryl was a right sex bomb. She wriggled out of her knickers in a blink of an eye, released my straining cock and sunk down on it. We were going nice and slow when obviously I pressed the right buttons somewhere because Cheryl went mad! She started shagging me like crazy and crying out pretty loud. The car was rocking like mad And I tried to shush her, saying that someone was bound to notice. But by now she was too far gone to care, shrieking her head off as she bounced up and down on my cock. "Yes!" she screamed, "YES!"</span><br><br><strong>Then it happened. As Cheryl came, she kicked out with her legs and her stiletto heels went right through the side window with an almighty crash as the glass hit the pavement. Of course, everyone in the cul-de-sac heard, and the street lit up like a Christmas tree as everyone looked out of their windows to see if their motor was being nicked. What they saw, of course, was my car bouncing up and down and Cheryl's lovely legs sticking out the busted window and trashing about like mad.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What made it worse was that one of them called the police. The shag was over by the time the squad car turned up, but I still had lots of explaining to do to this copper who couldn't stop pissing himself when I had to explain the whole story. I'm glad he saw the funny side, but I don't think Cheryl's parents did, though. So if my story says anything, it's that there's nothing wrong with shagging in cars. Just watch out who you do it with and where.</span><br><br>Get it?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Join the newest and chattiest channel in Galaxynet - #sgclub~! =D</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love:<br><br>Another one for your bedtime.<br><br>It was fifteen years ago when I got a job as a waiter. I was just out of college and happy for any job I could get even though the hours were crap, the pay was shite and some of the customers could be right twats. It was quite an expensive place so we'd get some snotty gits in there. There's one I'll never forget, though, and here's why.<br><br>He was this businessman, about 55-60, stinking rich and didn't he know it! The moment I greeted him and his bird to the table I knew I had a bad 'un on my hands. The good side, though, was his bird. She was much younger than him, maybe 25-30. I got the feeling straight away this was his bit on the side the missus didn't know about.<br><br>It was obvious they planned on taking their time and I soon realised that was bad news for me. The bloke moaned about everything and seemed to take a delight in giving me a hard time. His bird, though, was the exact opposite. She smiled at me warmly to let me know she thought he was out of order and what's more she didn't mind when she realised I was ogling her any chance I could. This went on all through their meal and by the time they reached coffee and liqueurs I had a perfect picture of her sexy body imprinted on my mind. I was going to wank myself stupid with that image in my mind as soon as I got home that night.<br><br>But I didn't. Why? Because as I was taking a breather in the hallway outside the dining area, this sexy sort walked through the swing doors. She saw me standing there and flashed me another one of those warm smiles. "Can you show me to the Ladies?" she asked me. I said sure and led her down the hallway to the loo. "I'm sorry about my friend," she said at the door, "I wished there was something I could do." Then she paused, looked at me and said "Maybe there is something I could do."<br><br>She grabbed my arm and pulled me into the Ladies with her. Within moments we were locked in a cubicle and she was tugging down the straps of her dress. "You've had your eyes on me all evening, haven't you?" she smiled, pressing her soft tits into my hands, as she groped for my sip. "You deserve this after the night you've had," she said, smoothing down my trousers and taking my stiff prick in her fist. Then she had me in her mouth, her wet tongue slathering up and down my cock as she deep throated me.<br><br>Then she straighted up and spun around, bracing herself with her hands on the loo. "Pull down my knickers," she said, "you know where to put it." I slid her dress over her arse and rolled down her fancy satin briefs. Her plump cunt made an inviting target and I wasted no time sliding into it. It felt so good, knobbing that bastard's sexy mistress while he was likely sat at their table wondering why she was taking so long in the bog! As I packed it to her I felt her luxurious bum ripple and quiver with each stroke. I knew she was getting off on it from the way she shook and her cunt contracted around my cock. Shagging her this fast meant it was inevitable I wasn't going to last long and she knew this too. "Don't come in me," she told me, "we wouldn't want him to know, would we?"<br><br>I pulled out and her lips were waiting to welcome my fully-primed cock. Again she swallowed me deep. With an almighty groan I unloaded in her mouth. I was astonished now, having come so hard, she managed to swallow it all and not spill a drop. I suppose she'd had lots of practice. As she wiped her mouth and straighten her clothing she said, "Come over with the bill in ten minutes. I'll tell him to tip you well or there'll be no nookie for him tonight!"<br><br>That beautiful bird was as good as her word. I think it was probably the best tip I ever got while working as a waiter. But just then I couldn't care less about the cash, that quickie shag was worth a whole year's wages and I got it for free!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Join the newest and chattiest channel in Galaxynet - #sgclub~! =D</div>
