            <div class='col-md body'>Anything closely resembling a pistol, revolver, rifle, grenade or any ordance are not allowed into Singapore without a license, toy or no toy. Customs will be looking at whether the item could be modified to work as a weapon or not. When in doubt, they'll ban.<br><br>If you're caught trying to smuggle one or more of these items into Singapore thru your person, luggage, posting to yourself/friend or any other method, you can expect to be stopped at customs. or a visit from the Police or at least a request for you to go down to the station or customs.<br><br>Display weapons (antique muskets, samuri swords, etc) like those sold in some shops here in Singapore are allowed. Please bring along your IC if you intend to make a purchase.<br><br>To join a gun club, you cannot have any criminal record. In Singapore you've the Singapore Gun Club and the Singapore Rifle Association. <strong>Live</strong> rounds are used and you'll be trained and briefed on all the safety requirements. Expenses include a one time Joining Fee, Annual Membership Fee, Range Fee, Weapon Locker Fee and don't forget you've to pay for the bullets too. Eg. 9mm Parabellum rounds costs 35-45 cents each. You'll use on average 50 to 100 rounds per session. .45 and rifle rounds will cost more.<br><br>As a registered member of either of the gun clubs you can apply to import and own a gun in Singapore. Your request will be processed by CID and the Police Ordance Unit. Be prepared to wait. More fees will be involved before you even get to see your beloved gun! My favorite is the Glock 17, the Beretta Model 92 and Colt Double Eagle. However you are <strong>NOT ALLOWED</strong> to bring the gun home. You are required to surrender your weapon to the armoury before you leave the range.<br><br>Airsoft Club and workshops. The Singapore Police treat the import of these "toys" in the same manner as real weapons. CID and Police Ordance Unit will be involved. You are required to surrender your "toy" to the licensed operator before you leave the premises. Licensed operators are required to show proof that they have a safe and secure place (eg an approved safe) to transport and store these "toys". If you possess one illegally, pray your "friends" don't sabo you when you show off to them. So better not to have one illegally.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">ORCA<br>DE OPPRESSO LIBER<br><br>I WILL ALWAYS PLACE THE MISSION FIRST.<br>I WILL NEVER ACCEPT DEFEAT.<br>I WILL NEVER QUIT.<br>I WILL NEVER LEAVE A FALLEN COMRADE.</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If u're interested in buying an air rifle, u can ask the club to buy on ur behalf.  To be stored in their premise of course, under lock n key if im not wrong.<br><br>If its real weapons, u're not allowed to own it.  However, I heard if u can justify it, or rich enuff, u can store it in Police armory and a hefty price.  So it aint worth it either.<br><br>If its airsoft, u can try to order it online thru some particular suppliers.  There are ways to get them past Singapore customs without seizure.  Of course, if do so at ur own risk, most of these suppliers dun have money back guarantees for seizures.<br><br>PosSessing an airsoft weapon is illegal in Singapore.  If u are really interested, well u can try joining some airsoft clubs in Singapore.  For me, I've gone over to archery.. haha.</div>
