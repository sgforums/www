            <div class='col-md body'>i went to cineleisure basement just last week to accompany my gf withdraw some money from the ATMs there, those who know would know that there are 2 POSB atms there.<br><br>one have a long que while the other is empty. so we decide to try the empty one wondering why no one uses the machine. only after that she realized the buttons are damaged and no responese from the ATM.<br><br>can feel the stares and snickers from the other que. while we were wondering what to do, only after tat one young man who had finished withdrawing his cash came to us and said "hey the buttons are spolit, but dun worry, just wait abit and they will return u ur card"<br><br>great guy, at least he bothers to tell us that the card will be returned, if not we walk away without knowing that our card is there<br><br>so we went to the long que and waited, and apparently some pple tried like us but those fellas in front of me simply stare at the poor fella who was wondering what the hell happend to his card.<br><br>in the end i had to walk to the front, stand at that ATM informing pple that the ATM cannot be used while waiting for my gf.<br><br>not that i'm expecting some kind of apreciation (knowing how singaporeans are), but the unfriendly stares from those que-ing in the longer que seems to suggest that "why are you stopping them?i want to see that panic look on them!"<br><br></div>

INSECURITY, esteem problem...<br><br>&gt;&gt; Some, are just plain stuck up, and selfish - couldn't care less about everyone else behind the que.<br><br>&gt;&gt; Some, will think it isn't their job to inform others - selfish again<br><br>&gt;&gt; And then some, thinks the one behind him/her should or will inform the rest<br><br>The above all boils down to how the bulk of our people in society were brought, and educated via our education system, and the very system itself; people aren't brought up to be VOCAL enough. Or communicative.<br><br>There some people who are naturally more communicative, friendly, considerate, and have better esteem based on how (where) they were educated and brought up.<br><br>Largely, life in Singapore is a Rat Race from day one of our existence.

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually I will inform others, walk off &amp; dun think so much. Sometimes the one behind may want to try, Like myself, I may wan to test if urgent to draw money.<br><br>People who dun inform, some are really 'bo chap' or selfish, some kiasi, afraid what others might think. In their mind that may think "I cannot draw, others maybe can", so they just walk off.<br><br>Once I encountered a more serious case, I saw an old man lying on the floor bleeding. For me I also dun dare to touch him, bcoz I dun know what cause the injury. But I did look around for help. I dun have a mobile wif me at that time. I saw a lady wif mobile, so I asked her to call the police. To my surprise she have more fear then me. She told me she dun dare to call the police. So I borrow her mobile &amp; called the police. Later there was another passer-by, whom I really repect coz he tended to the old man, on seeing this I left.<br><br>I think we should try our best to have an open heart to help others or at least inform other.</div>
