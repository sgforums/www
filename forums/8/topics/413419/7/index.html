              <p>I tot most local guys complain about local girls like shit </p>
              <p>That's the irony. Only local women try to help their local guys, most foreign women rather become housewife and wait for husband to take care. So when it comes to paying $, local men see local women as good. When it comes to other things, local men slam local women like dirt about all those expected "womenly" roles your mother used to do. I think we need to rethink those roles and expectations because this is the disconnect and this is where a local men, going for the short sighted solution go for foreign women thinking that's the solution. I wish them good luck.  </p>
              <p>As guys, you know work is stressful.  It even more for women because, if women fail at work, people will say, "yeah lah, because she is woman mah. Not as good and blah blah blah.... ba guy sure can do the job... blah blah blah"  isn't it true? So for some women work hard and get really stressed to help pay for the household. When she come home from work tired and worn out, still have to fulfill the other roles like cook, clean, nurture, say sweet things to the husband and listen to husband complain and sooth out his worn feelings from office. Who will take care of her...  </p>
              <p>As local guys need to see the good side of local women and appreciate them, because if you only see bad things, then you will really only see bad things. So I can understand why so many people wish to remain single. </p>

              <p>China girls are cute, their style is so girlish, some of them, I just
               think they are a class of their own, when come to dressing. Their 
              mannerism is so feminine for the younger ones. Of course, the older ones
               behaved a bit more straightforward but I guess that comes with age with
               any of us.</p>
              <p>For me, I prefers those in services line as they really worked 
              long hours and is really grace under pressure. I have many a good 
              remembrance of China girls with nary a single strand of hair out of place, in a very
               noisy and hot environment but still doing their work. I think that's 
              one of their outward unintentional charm. I sure, they are also cursing 
              their work inside but they just hang on when they think of their 
              families and the money they borrowed to come here.</p>
              <p>But their 
              temperamental are suspect. Most are born in a single child families so 
              they are shielded from a lot of difficult things in life so sometimes 
              when they meet with problems, they ran away from it instead, especially 
              so for the more well-heeled families girls.</p>
              <p>Admittedly there are also good ones around, but have to really go
               and dance with the devil to find out which is the real good one.</p>
              <p>I
               think, although I find them very attractive, but I think they should 
              still be married to their own countrymen, as their culture is closer to 
              their own characters, and if they preferred, they can still go back to 
              their country easily, if they got tired of such a small crowded country.</p>
              <p>I
               think that, instead of saying China girls are some sort of mail-order 
              bride, I think they are actually the opposite of that. To touch her 
              heart, I think that would be the most difficult thing to do and 
              sometimes, it is not about money, there's actually really a wide gap of 
              different expectations to bridge.</p>
              <p>Anyway, most of them are 
              attached to their own countrymen, if I notice correctly so there's only 
              gawkings to be made and nothing else.</p>
              <p>I guess in the end if cannot find a local girl then forget about marriage and just live a quiet life till death comes knocking.</p>
              <p>Being alone,can still do a lot of things, so it's not the end of the world. Love did not happen, so be it.</p>

              <p>That's the irony. Only local women try to help their local guys,
              most foreign women rather become housewife and wait for husband to
              take care. So when it comes to paying $, local men see local women
              as good. When it comes to other things, local men slam local women
              like dirt about all those expected "womenly" roles your mother used
              to do. I think we need to rethink those roles and expectations
              because this is the disconnect and this is where a local men, going
              for the short sighted solution go for foreign women thinking that's
              the solution. I wish them good luck.  </p>
              <p>As guys, you know work is stressful.  It even more for
              women because, if women fail at work, people will say, "yeah lah,
              because she is woman mah. Not as good and blah blah blah.... ba guy
              sure can do the job... blah blah blah"  isn't it true? So for
              some women work hard and get really stressed to help pay for the
              household. When she come home from work tired and worn out, still
              have to fulfill the other roles like cook, clean, nurture, say
              sweet things to the husband and listen to husband complain and
              sooth out his worn feelings from office. Who will take care of
              her...  </p>
              <p>As local guys need to see the good side of local women and
              appreciate them, because if you only see bad things, then you will
              really only see bad things. So I can understand why so many people
              wish to remain single. </p>
