              A PRC woman married a Singaporean man but refused to consummate the marriage.
              
              Furthermore, she took over the double bed for herself and forced her husband to sleep on the floor.
              
              [IMG]http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/20101013_km_lcn_china_bride1_img_main-248x300.jpg[/IMG]
              
              Seven years ago, a friend showed Mr Liang (hanyu pinyin, 43 years old) a photo of a PRC woman and asked if he would like to get to know her.
              
              Mr Liang said, â€œThe woman in the photo looked pleasant. As I was also of marriageable age at the time, I agreed. Subsequently, the PRC woman specially flew in from Shenyang, China to meet me. We cohabited for a week before deciding to get married.â€�
              
              â€œAfter the marriage, she had to fly back and forth between China and Singapore. One year later, she got her Long Term Visit Pass and became formally resident in Singapore.â€�
              
              But after the marriage, she slowly began to reveal her true colours: she refused to consummate the marriage, and did not get along well with his family members.
              
              â€œWhen she saw the double bed prepared for us by my father, she got furious and refused to sleep in the same bed with me. As a result, I had to sleep on the floor and give up the bed to her.â€�
              
              After the marriage, his PRC wife also refused to consummate it, saying that she was infertile.
              
              â€œI let her have her way as she seems so persistent. Anyway, I work 12 hours everyday and donâ€™t spend much time at home,â€� said Mr Liang.
              
              According to Mr Liang: I often quarrelled with her after marriage. On January 2007, she filed for a deed of separation. She look down on me because I only had primary school education and also a low monthly salary. As for her, she had a university degree. She often complained that I was a boar with fiery temper, and that I never spared a thought for her.
              
              She was also the one who suggested to him to move out of his fatherâ€™s house to start to small family. They eventually bought a 3 room flat in 2006. After 1 year, she left without a trace, and he was only informed about it when he received a lawyerâ€™s letter regarding the deed of separation.
              
              During the separation period:
              
              After 1 year of separation, his wife came to look for him and requested his help to sign an application for her citizenship. She was willing to consummate with him. That was the 1st time and probably the last time which Mr Liang had sex with his ex-wife. He initially thought that his ex-wife wanted to reconcile with him. Still harping the thought that his ex-wife would come back to him, he signed the citizenship application for her. His wife eventually became a Singapore Citizen in 2009.
              
              According to Mr Liang, she gave birth to a daughter last year, which obviously wasnâ€™t his. He suspected that she had committed adultery, which made her wanted to desperately divorce her husband. She continually refused to admit she had a lover outside.
              
              Lately, the court had approved their divorce and Mr Liang had to pay 30k sgd as matrimonial fees.
              
              Mr Liang said he loved his ex-wife, he gave her 500 dollars monthly so that she could attend English lessons. â€œAfter she got her long term visit pass, she started to work in Singapore. She got a job with over 1k monthly salary and started to rely less on me. That was also the time when we started to quarrel regularly.â€�

              So how many PRC brides are doing it to our local males on such marriage of convenience. 
              
              Once the data is out, I am sure marriages with PRC women will drop to freezing hell zero

              ICA shd take such cases for review. Its unfair to Sporeans male. The story if true or not, ICA needs to review the filed documents instead of treating it as unchangeable to encourage more Chinese women coming here to cheat the unsuspecting local males for money, divorce and time.
              
              China chinese gives up citizenship has nothing to do with local privileges, 
              what he/she needs is to keep the i/c or resident card which can get the same, like staying in state own hotel, or medical. There is no online check in China if heshe is a citizen or not.[/

              there are some interesting comments 
              
              Does the Women's Charter distinguish between matrimonial assets and pre-matrimonial assets?
              
              
              
              Ayo ... very obvious, the China girl has already married to someone before re-marrying to this Singaporean la.
              
              In China, the girls usually married very young.  Maybe 24, they already have a few children.   Beware !
              
              If you get any good deal out from something, sometimes the apple is Rotten one.  Hahaa ...
              
              Greed and evil plans. ....  Hidden agenda again la.
              
              So - please do not any how eat Free-food.

              there are some interesting comments
              
              Actually the report didn't specify what the $30k is for: the bulk of the $30k payment could be for the maintenance of their daughter (which the husband suspected not to be his own flash and blood..). Plus the husband also never specify if the ex-wife had contributed towards the payment of the 3-rm flat which is currently under his possession. If she did, then the husband would need to pay back her share for her to give up the flat.
              
              ya if the wife treats the husband like ****....why shld he pay alimony...it's a fugging stupid charter...nowadays men are tortured by women not the other way

              there are some interesting comments 
              
              If it is 1 time $30k to have a clean cut, the man shd satisfy with it and concentrate on the kid. 
              If he does not, shd appeal to sink her financially, so that she will have to pay for legal cost in appeal. Its costly affair for the man too, but it will eliminate this prc woman from having the illusion of taking advantage in Spore using local laws. It depends on how this man takes it. 
              She may have someone, xiao pai lien, teaching her from behind what to do. The husband cld make her pay and pay to learn a lesson and her xiao pai lien may give up as she no longer has money.

              there are some interesting comments
              
              after some thoughts, i think this is what happen and it fits the bill
              
              1. she had some boyfriend back in her hometown
              
              2. she was a graduate who had difficulty securing a job with prospects back at home, so the offer of marriage overseas was a window of opportunity. she could be ambitious, not contented to live her life as a perpetual factory girl
              
              3. she refused to consummate the overseas marriage because she already had a lover (or she was merely using the local guy as a bridging mechanism to get out of an impoverished town, or she never intended to consummate with him, she could be on the lookout for the next bigger boat when shes here)
              
              4. she gotten the local guy to pay for her english lessons to ease her entry into a new foreign economy 
              
              5. she already knew about woman charter that apply here and planned to maximize its affect, she suggested they move out and gotten the guy to buy a house. dont think she would fork out a cent for it if she could gotten the same fellow to pay for $500 a month english classes.
              
              6. she moved out after 1 yr and immediately filed for separation to reduce lead time. either she now joined her previous boyfriend whom she brought over from her hometown. or she met someone new outside.
              
              7. either way, she got pregnant. this gets interesting..
              
              a. if its her previous boyfriend, he might not have pr. she cant apply for him cos she herself doesnt have citizenship. neither will her child. theres a certain possibility both the mother and the child risked deportation,
              
              b. and hence separation from the real father. not only facing family breakup, she risked shame when she returned back hometown without a formal man and an extra child. lets not forget about her ambitions.
              
              c. whether they all stay together or separate, she and her boyfriend might not have the financial means to look after the child above and on top of themselves.
              
              8. before her stomach popped out, she hurriedly went back to the local guy. offer 1 time sex for citizenship. but he doesnt know its not 1 time! she already had lots of fun, even had a child. technically speaking sleeping with her 'legal husband' just one time is not prostitution is not illegal so what guilty conscience?..can all in one go elevate her woes of no citizenship, risk of deportation and no cash on hand, why not. 
              
              9. she got her citizenship. means her child gets it too. means her boyfriend gets it too. they can all stay together, they might not need to go back now. they might even choose to stay in London if they can afford it
              
              10. remembering about woman charter and her supposed stake in the matrimonial house, she turned around and went back to claim matrimonial fees from local guy because she and her new husband still need to feed their newborn child. 
              
              11. after pocketing the 30k baby fare by the local guy, she and the new husband, now both citizens, apply for subsidized public housing, wait out or rent out for 5yrs. then before the child (if its a guy) turns 18, sell off, return back home as enriched heros back from faraway foreign lands. no one knows their rotten get-to-riches details..they can spin any dynamic international love story..or student love turn fruition
              
              12. imagine the real possibility that she and her boyfriend planned this for the past 7 years.
              
              13. unanswered riddles: 
              a. why didnt the local guy ask for a paternality test or appeal the 30k, leading to..
              b. why didnt his lawyer ask for it, leading to..
              c. why didnt he get a lawyer if hes aware he might get hit with 30k judgement? leading to..
              d. is the local guy really that dumb? or that kind hearted? is he even aware of anything? leading to..
              e. are local guys actually naive above everything else??

              <p>wisdom is not an attribute everyone has. If opossition can start with they so educated members and educate our people at this level. escalating their votes with their election rally should be easier when they touch on bigger issues. this minor thingsa re what the rulling party mislook or refuses to look at. educating our people on marry only good foreigners.</p>

              <p>this may have things to do with personalioty. look at those people like that you caome across. if you look at their face you can see no charisma in them - what i tyoically call 'qianbian' face. these people has only to work on their charisma and charcter. but no one knows deep down what their heart is like. believe me some even take otehrn as as example worship their perosnliaty and eq like god. while the same sword may have different effects in different hands, some claims that having EQ means to convince and be persuasive. but they are the oone swho truely lack EQ because they don;t undertsand that differnt people has differnt receiptive levels to persuasion. you push what seems like a little to another really means  being clinky and sticky, hound and a nuisance.</p>
