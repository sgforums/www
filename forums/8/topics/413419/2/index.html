              <p>there are some interesting comments</p>
              <p>after some thoughts, i think this is what happen and it fits the bill</p>
              <p>1. she had some boyfriend back in her hometown</p>
              <p>2. she was a graduate who had difficulty securing a job with prospects back at home, so the offer of marriage overseas was a window of opportunity. she could be ambitious, not contented to live her life as a perpetual factory girl</p>
              <p>3. she refused to consummate the overseas marriage because she already had a lover (or she was merely using the local guy as a bridging mechanism to get out of an impoverished town, or she never intended to consummate with him, she could be on the lookout for the next bigger boat when shes here)</p>
              <p>4. she gotten the local guy to pay for her english lessons to ease her entry into a new foreign economy</p>
              <p>5. she already knew about woman charter that apply here and planned to maximize its affect, she suggested they move out and gotten the guy to buy a house. dont think she would fork out a cent for it if she could gotten the same fellow to pay for $500 a month english classes.</p>
              <p>6. she moved out after 1 yr and immediately filed for separation to reduce lead time. either she now joined her previous boyfriend whom she brought over from her hometown. or she met someone new outside.</p>
              <p>7. either way, she got pregnant. this gets interesting..</p>
              <p>a. if its her previous boyfriend, he might not have pr. she cant apply for him cos she herself doesnt have citizenship. neither will her child. theres a certain possibility both the mother and the child risked deportation,</p>
              <p>b. and hence separation from the real father. not only facing family breakup, she risked shame when she returned back hometown without a formal man and an extra child. lets not forget about her ambitions.</p>
              <p>c. whether they all stay together or separate, she and her boyfriend might not have the financial means to look after the child above and on top of themselves.</p>
              <p>8. before her stomach popped out, she hurriedly went back to the local guy. offer 1 time sex for citizenship. but he doesnt know its not 1 time! she already had lots of fun, even had a child. technically speaking sleeping with her ‘legal husband’ just one time is not prostitution is not illegal so what guilty conscience?..can all in one go elevate her woes of no citizenship, risk of deportation and no cash on hand, why not.</p>
              <p>9. she got her citizenship. means her child gets it too. means her boyfriend gets it too. they can all stay together, they might not need to go back now. they might even choose to stay in London if they can afford it</p>
              <p>10. remembering about woman charter and her supposed stake in the matrimonial house, she turned around and went back to claim matrimonial fees from local guy because she and her new husband still need to feed their newborn child.</p>
              <p>11. after pocketing the 30k baby fare by the local guy, she and the new husband, now both citizens, apply for subsidized public housing, wait out or rent out for 5yrs. then before the child (if its a guy) turns 18, sell off, return back home as enriched heros back from faraway foreign lands. no one knows their rotten get-to-riches details..they can spin any dynamic international love story..or student love turn fruition</p>
              <p>12. imagine the real possibility that she and her boyfriend planned this for the past 7 years.</p>
              <p>13. unanswered riddles:<br>a. why didnt the local guy ask for a paternality test or appeal the 30k, leading to..<br>b. why didnt his lawyer ask for it, leading to..<br>c. why didnt he get a lawyer if hes aware he might get hit with 30k judgement? leading to..<br>d. is the local guy really that dumb? or that kind hearted? is he even aware of anything? leading to..<br>e. are local guys actually naive above everything else??</p>

              thats good! i was hoping someone will actually start ignoring this and persist in doing things their own ways.
              
              so that everyone else will get another chance to read about YOUR sad story the next time you are hit, becos you ignored someone else story the first time!

              <p>this may have things to do with personalioty. look at those people like that you caome across. if you look at their face you can see no charisma in them - what i tyoically call 'qianbian' face. these people has only to work on their charisma and charcter. but no one knows deep down what their heart is like. believe me some even take otehrn as as example worship their perosnliaty and eq like god. while the same sword may have different effects in different hands, some claims that having EQ means to convince and be persuasive. but they are the oone swho truely lack EQ because they don;t undertsand that differnt people has differnt receiptive levels to persuasion. you push what seems like a little to another really means  being clinky and sticky, hound and a nuisance.</p>

              <p><br>There are good and bad foreign wife, same as there are good and bad local guys, the question is that why local guys go for foreign wife?? and left lots of local gals single??</p>
              <p>Men got to understand that they go for foreign wife is their own willingness, if get into trouble, they have to take full responsibility for themselves.</p>
              <p>The problem is that Men today lack the romantic part in chasing gals, so all end up going for a quick fix of just buying or paying for a foreign wife, gentlemen, relationship is nurture, not bought ya</p>
