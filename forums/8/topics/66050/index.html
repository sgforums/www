            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your speedy replies! Got talk to my neighbour.  The auntie said she called the police 3 times already and she gave up repainting her front door.  I asked her if she has any clue who the vandals are and whether she got their contact no, so I can call ah long and clarify.  But she won't divulge any info.  What to do?<br><br>The cctv idea sounds good.  Will also write up the note tonight and post on the front door. Thanks!<br><br>Can anyone recommend a DIY setup or any shop/PI that can do this at a reasonable price?  I tried googling on this--got too many links to shops selling cctv, not very informative but very confusing!</div>

Then station your children behind the sofa armed with water gun filled with urine and rotten eggs. When they get in start to attack. Make the floor wet and sloapy, when they come in they slip and fall. When they fall, ask the fatest member of the family to do a body slam on them. After that use a badminton racket and knock them out. Tied them up and call the police.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
