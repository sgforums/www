Anyway to a person who have no guts like you, even you did somwthing wrong, I doubt you got any guts to admit. HAHAHA. By the way, I don't be pal to a ball-less fool. So please don't be so think skin to call me pal.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Even if I see you, can I see the "quality" in you? No right? What do you mean by quality? In terms of character?

Tell me what you define as being of "quality".</strong></blockquote>Well, whether you can see quality in me or not is not important, simply because to a ball-less no quality person, I don't need to show off my quality. To me quality means if there is a need, a person must be able to excel the good point in himself/herself, able to have his/her own opinion in a  topic. To a person who go round talking rubbish or post a sentence HAHAHA, I don't see it is quality. I only saw the craziness in that crazy person. If you are crazy, go Hougang Ave 9. Don't come this forum. Than why not tell me your quality? Or maybe to you your so call quality is to boast that you yourself no need to have any quality here, important to have quality only when seeing in person. To a person who can't even be bother to show any quality in the net, how can I expect him to have any quality when see him in person. To me this type of people is only a uneducated barbarian who go round typing rubbish.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You seem to think that quality can be trained. Is that so? Are you then talking about physical qualities? Tell me.</strong></blockquote>To a person who have no quality, of course quality cannot be trained. What a stupid question to ask!<br><br><blockquote><strong>Oh, people who post one liners have no quality? Then those who post long stories do? You keep on talking about quality, not quantity. Doesn't that apply to the length of the post as well?

Since you are so free everyday, so free to pop into every topic and post 1 sentence. Than it already simply prove to me that you got the time but simply don't want to post longer reply. Are you trying to tell me you got plenty of quality when meeting you in person?<br><br><blockquote><strong>Sure, if you want to meet, I'll be glad to.

What a think skin coward you are! To determined a person quality need time, after this few months here, reading your 1 sentence post, no need to see you in person I can be sure to say in term of quality, you are definitely no match for me. Oh I forgot, someone already say he don't post reply to show quality in net. HAHAHA<br><br><blockquote><strong>And by the way, people with genuine quality seldom boast about it. Or rather, they never do.</strong></blockquote>Oh look who is boasting. HAHAHA. Ai yo, you boast yourself so much in your post yet saying people with genuine quality seldom boast. So are you trying to tell me after boasting yourself so much, you yourself actually got no quality. HAHAHA<br><br><blockquote>[B] Is that all? Come on, I'm still waiting for you to set a date. You're the challenger after all isn't it?[B]</blockquote>Can no problem, I am sure a free person who got nothing to do but to post a sentence in every topic got plenty of time in the world. So how about this Sat join us for the outing. I like to see how much quality you got. Got the guts to come? I wait for you.<br></div>

I think it is you who don't know what is quality and guts. Reason is simple, you got no quality and guts. You praise yourself at first you got so much of quality in person, how come so fast nothing to say liao? As for balls, even simplier, once again you prove to me you got no balls. HAHAHA.

You can mix around so well by posting so much rubbish, surely you are invited to come for the outing. Don't worry, just read the post people posted and you will know where to meet what time. I will tell Susan got a ball-less fool coming along, don't worry, just tell them mille ask yo to come one, they will know.
