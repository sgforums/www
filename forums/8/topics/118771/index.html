            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore, Mr goh said, should spot foreign talent at a young age, get young foreign students into schools and later on encourage them to take up Singapore citizenship.. In time to come, some would take on Singapore citizenship, do national service and become first generation immigrants who become Singaporeans..<br><br>Naive or plain ignorant ? During the Hongkong handover in 1997, he also harbour such hope that hongkies will settle in singapore.. Whilst the Chinese and Hongkies share the same roots as the Singaporean Chinese, there is no way that any bright, talented Chinese, Hongkie or any Chinese around the world would want to settle in a politically stifling country or one with a 147th ranked press..<br><br>The sights have become opaque and all you can see before you is a life of harassment, a jail term or a life of bankruptcy if you oppose the despotic regime.. the fragrance of freedom that had once covered Singapore in pre-colonial times and even under colonial times have decomposed rapidly into a repulsive, stinking stench of repression that have buried this once wonderful country with a blanket of fear..<br><br>Many singaporean who once love the country have chosen to migrate because of the oppressive regime and repressive rule.. FT that came here to study will enjoy discounted school fees but will leave once the bond is served.. the illusion of attracting good, quality FT is after all a dream... singapore to them is only a transit, where once they earn their dues, they will catch the first flight back to their home-land..<br><br>[TRANSLATED VERSION]<br><br>Li Jia Wei - China still my motherland!<br><br>Singapore nationality ping pong athlete Li Jia Wei goes home to celebrate new year's celebration<br>CCTV international (on February 12, 2005 22:23)<br><br>CCTV.Com news: With the day by day growing prowess of the Chinese sports, more and more many athletes already went out of the country.<br><br>They are a group of special status people because although of the same ancestry and clan homology, they hold the overseas nationality<br>actually.<br><br>But to go home for the new year's celebration is each overseas Chinese's common desire. Today, we lead you to view Singapore nationality ping pong athlete Li Jia Wei's family in Beijing and how she celebrates the new year.<br><br>In these new year festive seasons, we paid attention to locally trained national sports team's members, coach and how they entered the hall of special status.<br><br>At the same time we could not forget the overseas Chinese people with permanent residence status. Actually to these overseas Chinese people living long term outside of PRC, the motherland actually has a special meaning, therefore, at this Spring Festival, we<br>should say to them: The early spring is joyful!<br><br></div>

Its also hoped that with foreigners here, MNC may be inclined to invest here, &amp;/or the foreigners here create business.<br>Anyway when it comes to the crunch, we shld always depend on ourselves, &amp; not habour any illusion in the 1st plc.

Even if the couple is caught, they can pay to get off the hook. My friend told me that the amount is around S$6000. However, it would be important to note that the figure is at least 20 year old since my fren is around that age.<br><br>The point is, imo, the one child policy is not really enforced or enforceable.</div>

My friend told me no birth cert.  This means that the child next time cannot go to school.  No identity in the country at all.</div>
