              <p>i'm posing this as a gentle reminder to us Singaporeans; be nice to nurses during this tough period.</p>
              <p>why am i speaking up for the ladies in white? simple; my wife is a nurse... </p>
              <p>during the SARS period in 2003 - 2004, there were reports that the public were very hostile towards nurses for fear they will "pass" the deadly virus to them. some nurses were refused entry on buses, some were shunned by the general public, one was even reported spat on. yes, i would agree that there were fear and confusion as it was the nation's first ever epidemic and people were "trying" to stay alive with what they perceived as correct actions towards nurses;</p>
              <p>shun them, shame them, insult them and you shall be safe... or so they thought.</p>
              <p>well, SARS ended and the nation recovered. then we "celebrated" the brave, selfless spirit of the nightingales yet, in truth... they never really recovered. not that they still have the SARS virus in them but the hurt that we inflicted onto them during the hellish period.</p>
              <p>yes yes, we had ceremonies to commemorate the event. we even had tv drama series in conjection with the celebration... but does all these actually "heal" them? they were asked during the SARS period to change into casual clothes after work so we, the people they are trying to save everyday will not shun them like some lepers, so we will not insult them like some traitors and will not give them that "sick" eyes we so often gives to "transversites". have we forgotten who the real enemy is? do you think they do not feel sad when one of them, a fellow servant to us Singaporeans died in the line of duty trying to save us? and even so, we instead of consoling them, started the "cold war"?</p>
              <p>we constantly remind ourselves that SARS could return and we must be vigiliant... how ironic it is that now we have a new virus in town and even deadlier... i'm not gloating, how could i? for i know that my wife is out there, the front line facing a deadly, invisible enemy. she has so many colleagues that i call friends, buddies and mentors. doctors, nurses, even those admin staff sitting at the counters waiting for you to register. these men and women deserve alot more...</p>
              <p>please do not shun them like what we did during SARS. we could be forgiven for we were hit with an epidemic the first time. let's not "punish" them during this tough period but stand by them... afterall, they will be the ones that will try to save us in the event we fall to this new demon.</p>

              <p>If a pandemic really occurs, there'll only be 500,000 flu vaccines stockpiled for the entire population of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Remember guys, practice proper hygiene (e.g. cover your mouth when you cough / sneeze, no spitting, wash your hands regularly) and wear a bloody mask in the public when you are down with a flu or is feeling unwell, even if you're going to look like a bloody freak. Beats transmitting the virus to a hundred other person.</p>

              <p>I absolutely agree with you - nurses are absolute treasures and it was terrible how they were treated during SARS. They're the NCOs of the healthcare industry and essentially make sure the hospitals keep running. </p>
              <p>However, during that time I was surprised to find out that nurses go home in their work clothes (the clothes act as fomites <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite)</a>. Nobody but the nurses themselves know what kind of patients they are in close contact with every day, and many kinds of microbes can survive on clothes for a while. Things picked up in a hospital on may easily infect people on the bus/train and even the nurses' families.</p>
              <p>I think asking the nurses to change out of their work clothes (which along with doctor's labcoats, should be cleaned and disinfected inside the hospital premises) is not unreasonable. </p>

              <p><br>in the hospital setting, there are rooms for disinfection before and after they leave the hospital premises. the nurses are supposed to enter a special allocated rooms when they report for work in their usual uniform but you should notice that they are "fully armoured" for work with masks and apron which they are supposed to change in that special allocated room.</p>

              <p>after their shift are over, they are supposed to go back to that special room for disinfection before they leave the premises... so theoritically, nurses' uniform do not carry germs and virus... i know, i'm not infected with any viruses when i strip my wife when she comes home ;-)</p>

              <p>Wow! Maybe we will have a "Kindness to Nurses" Campaign next. Ha ha ha!<br><br>Seriously, do many people here REALLY shun nurses? We have Nursism in Singapore.</p>
              <p>You should ALWAYS be nice to Nurses in any hospital, because then they favour you and treat you better and give you stuff =) especially the student intern nurses. I always love getting hospitalized in Singapore, only been hospitalized thrice alas.</p>
              <p>I have never seen people being unkind to nurses here, but neither are they particularly kind or nice. So whenever you're nice to them, it makes you stand out even more, especially in a ward full of retards or very few young people who don't talk.</p>

              <p>However, I am aware that there are some people who really dislikes some nurses because these nurses is just there(work in hospital) for the money and not really commited to their job(very unprofessional).

              <p>nurses have not very high salary pay.. and their job is difficult...</p>
              <p>since it is such a "bad" job, not many ppl will work for just money...</p>
              <p>most nurses are caring and committed..</p>
              <p>however i met nurses that work for money only... and these nurses often treat ppl like their pets... these nurses tarnished the reputation of those good and caring ones..</p>
              <p>but most of them are good ones.. i hope one day those "bad" nurses should go off and we will one day salute those saviours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and i agree with u a lot...</p>
              <p>anyway i seriously respect these ppl a lot... nurses and doctors.. they are the hero<br>IA</p>

              <p>I like your answer 'both' to the question ha ha - you really have the best of both worlds but one word of caution - remember we also have male nurses!.</p>
              <p>The hospitals have no choice but to recruit 'cheap labour' because there is a perennial shortage of nurses both in Sg &amp; internationally.</p>
              <p>Currently our nurses emoluments are not too bad &amp; yet there is always a shortage.  The conclusion you can draw is that it's not the money that counts but rather the demanding &amp; challenging nature of the job.</p>

              <p>i'm posing this as a gentle reminder to us Singaporeans; be nice to nurses during this tough period.</p>
              <p>why am i speaking up for the ladies in white? simple; my wife is a nurse... </p>
              <p>during the SARS period in 2003 - 2004, there were reports that the public were very hostile towards nurses for fear they will "pass" the deadly virus to them. some nurses were refused entry on buses, some were shunned by the general public, one was even reported spat on. yes, i would agree that there were fear and confusion as it was the nation's first ever epidemic and people were "trying" to stay alive with what they perceived as correct actions towards nurses;</p>
              <p>shun them, shame them, insult them and you shall be safe... or so they thought.</p>
              <p>well, SARS ended and the nation recovered. then we "celebrated" the brave, selfless spirit of the nightingales yet, in truth... they never really recovered. not that they still have the SARS virus in them but the hurt that we inflicted onto them during the hellish period.</p>
              <p>yes yes, we had ceremonies to commemorate the event. we even had tv drama series in conjection with the celebration... but does all these actually "heal" them? they were asked during the SARS period to change into casual clothes after work so we, the people they are trying to save everyday will not shun them like some lepers, so we will not insult them like some traitors and will not give them that "sick" eyes we so often gives to "transversites". have we forgotten who the real enemy is? do you think they do not feel sad when one of them, a fellow servant to us Singaporeans died in the line of duty trying to save us? and even so, we instead of consoling them, started the "cold war"?</p>
              <p>we constantly remind ourselves that SARS could return and we must be vigiliant... how ironic it is that now we have a new virus in town and even deadlier... i'm not gloating, how could i? for i know that my wife is out there, the front line facing a deadly, invisible enemy. she has so many colleagues that i call friends, buddies and mentors. doctors, nurses, even those admin staff sitting at the counters waiting for you to register. these men and women deserve alot more...</p>
              <p>please do not shun them like what we did during SARS. we could be forgiven for we were hit with an epidemic the first time. let's not "punish" them during this tough period but stand by them... afterall, they will be the ones that will try to save us in the event we fall to this new demon.</p>
