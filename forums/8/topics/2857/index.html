            <div class='col-md body'>To all :<br><br>I don't see why we are not allowed to say anything negative about something. It is a freedom of speech. What I think is most important, whether the critic himself is objective or not, which also indicates his level of maturity. I will criticize something objectively for example, "this movie sucks because of poor scriptwriting and poor casting/acting of actors", instead of just attacking the person by lines "she looks ugly and should not even parade herself on the street".<br><br>If someone says something bad, so be it, why do you want to care about others think? The truth hurts but it only makes you stronger.</div>

Yes, stupid idiots.  someone who has a thought in his/her head knows that you can accomplish the exact same thing without having to resort to the nagative side of everything....<br><br>Constructive criticism is about making comments that have positive undertones(overtones?)...attacks are attacks. Verbal abuse is verbal abuse...they don't accomplish anything except to incite people into anger.<br><br>here is an example:<br><br>goodbookmarks...your site eats shit man...If you're a technopreneur then u eat shit and die.  My grandmotehr designs better than you and can get more content from her chapped anus. change your profession...u have no idea what the hell is happening at all.<br><br>now...this is a statement based on being negative...which goodbookmarks advocates...the same thing as parents who sexually or physically/mentally/verbally abuse their children do...<br><br>now here is another statement meaning the same thing but not negative:<br><br>goodbookmarks, i think that your site has a long way to go before you can finally say that it is an effective site in terms of design and content...There might be ways for you to find some more content...perhaps a more proactive role on your part in sourcing for the bookmarks would benefit the site.<br><br>or if ur england not powderful:<br><br>wah...why no content ah?....the design also not very good, but ok lah at least he tried ah...<br><br>I dun need to say any more than this...at this educational level or stage in your life, you should have already known the difference between negative criticism meant to offend and destroy and criticism meant to help or offer light upon a subject.<br><br></div>

I think it is really time to put a real thumbs down at Loletta.<br><br>Critics of Loletta are well encouraged to be FRANK on their comments bout Loletta. Well some can't really put in a nice way. But hey, being a negative critic Is really being cruel to one person. But i think it has to happean.<br><br>Well i can't comment much on people who just wear bit too sexy. Are they happy with their clothing taste ? Or are they trying to get more attention... in a vain way.<br><br>To cut some slack. I do notice that Loletta's intention is just to get attention. Bleak. But i just visited her NEWLY updated webpage again. What and how she describe on herself clearly puts a great distance from new comers compared to her friends &lt; maybE&gt; .

            <div class='col-md body'>Araven...actually your negative comment was quite well put....I didn't find it offensive...I instantly knew that it was a personal opinion from reafding it...but it wasn't offensive...you stated what you thought and didn't go tot he extent to put her down...more like you were making a comment based on your view of her and her decision without resorting to bashing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think comming straight to the point and being straight foward is good.<br>I think being polite and tactful is good.<br><br>I think being straight forward and forthright continously about something is bad.<br>I think being polite and tactful but yet dubious and beating around the bush is bad.<br><br>I general i think everyone has their good and bad points and well if we all would jsut learn from the good examples of others and at the same take into view the bad examples of others we would progress much faster as a society, instead of bickering about the finer points and who is right or wrong.<br>Yes there are always at least 2 ways to putting a message across but different prespectives will always cloud and prevent the same emotions and responses.</div>
