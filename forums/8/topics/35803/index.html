            <div class='col-md body'><strong>May Leong<br>After 21 years of marriage, I discovered a new way of<br>keeping alive the spark of love. A little while ago I<br>had started to go out with another woman. It was<br>really my wife's idea. "I know that you love  her," she<br>said one day, taking me by surprise. "But I love YOU,"<br>I protested. "I know, but you also love her." The<br>other woman that my wife wanted me to visit was my<br>mother, who has been a widow for 19 years, but the<br>demands of my work and my three children had made it<br>possible to visit her only occasionally.<br><br>That night I called to invite her to go out for dinner<br>and a movie. "What's wrong, are you well," she asked?<br>My mother is the type of woman who suspects that a<br>late night call or a surprise invitation is a sign<br>of bad news.<br><br>"I thought that it would be pleasant to pass some time<br>with you" I responded. "Just the two of us." She<br>thought about it for a moment then said "I would like<br>that very much." That Friday after work, as I drove<br>over to pick her up I was a bit nervous.  When I<br>arrived at her house, I noticed that she, too, seemed<br>to be nervous about our date. She waited in the door<br>with her coat on.<br><br>She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that<br>she had worn to celebrate her last wedding<br>anniversary. She smiled from a face that was as<br>radiant as an angel's. "I told my friends that I was<br>going to go out with my son, and they were impressed,"<br>she said, as she got into the car.<br><br>"They can't wait to hear about our meeting".<br><br>We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant,<br>was very nice and cozy. My mother took my arm as if<br>she were the First Lady. After we sat down, I had to<br>read the menu. Her eyes could only read large print.<br>Half way through the entree, I lifted my eyes and saw<br>Mom sitting there staring at me. A nostalgic smile was<br>on her lips. "It was I who used to have to read<br>the menu when you were small," she said. "Then it's<br>time that you relax and let me return the favor," I<br>respond. During the dinner we had an agreeable<br>conversation - nothing extraordinary but catching up<br>on recent events of each others life. We talked so<br>much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her<br>house later, she said "I'll go out with you again, but<br>only if you let me invite you". I agreed.<br><br>How was your dinner date?" asked my wife when I got<br>home. "Very nice. Much more so than I could have<br>imagined," I answered.<br><br>A few days later my mother died of a massive heart<br>attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a<br>chance to do anything for her.  Some time later I<br>received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant<br>receipt from the same place mother and I had dined. An<br>attached note said: "I paid this bill in advance. I<br>was almost sure that I couldn't be there but,<br>nevertheless, I paid for two plates - one for you and<br>the other for your wife. You will never know what that<br>night meant for me. I love you."<br><br>At that moment I understood the importance of saying,<br>in time: "I  LOVE YOU" and to give our loved ones the<br>time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more<br>important than God and your family. Give them the time<br>they deserve, because these things cannot be put off<br>to "some other time".<br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Wild-SG:<br><strong>[b]May Leong<br>After 21 years of marriage, I discovered a new way of<br>keeping alive the spark of love. A little while ago I<br>had started to go out with another woman. It was<br>really my wife's idea. "I know that you love  her," she<br>said one day, taking me by surprise. "But I love YOU,"<br>I protested. "I know, but you also love her." The<br>other woman that my wife wanted me to visit was my<br>mother, who has been a widow for 19 years, but the<br>demands of my work and my three children had made it<br>possible to visit her only occasionally.<br><br>That night I called to invite her to go out for dinner<br>and a movie. "What's wrong, are you well," she asked?<br>My mother is the type of woman who suspects that a<br>late night call or a surprise invitation is a sign<br>of bad news.<br><br>"I thought that it would be pleasant to pass some time<br>with you" I responded. "Just the two of us." She<br>thought about it for a moment then said "I would like<br>that very much." That Friday after work, as I drove<br>over to pick her up I was a bit nervous.  When I<br>arrived at her house, I noticed that she, too, seemed<br>to be nervous about our date. She waited in the door<br>with her coat on.<br><br>She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that<br>she had worn to celebrate her last wedding<br>anniversary. She smiled from a face that was as<br>radiant as an angel's. "I told my friends that I was<br>going to go out with my son, and they were impressed,"<br>she said, as she got into the car.<br><br>"They can't wait to hear about our meeting".<br><br>We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant,<br>was very nice and cozy. My mother took my arm as if<br>she were the First Lady. After we sat down, I had to<br>read the menu. Her eyes could only read large print.<br>Half way through the entree, I lifted my eyes and saw<br>Mom sitting there staring at me. A nostalgic smile was<br>on her lips. "It was I who used to have to read<br>the menu when you were small," she said. "Then it's<br>time that you relax and let me return the favor," I<br>respond. During the dinner we had an agreeable<br>conversation - nothing extraordinary but catching up<br>on recent events of each others life. We talked so<br>much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her<br>house later, she said "I'll go out with you again, but<br>only if you let me invite you". I agreed.<br><br>How was your dinner date?" asked my wife when I got<br>home. "Very nice. Much more so than I could have<br>imagined," I answered.<br><br>A few days later my mother died of a massive heart<br>attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a<br>chance to do anything for her.  Some time later I<br>received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant<br>receipt from the same place mother and I had dined. An<br>attached note said: "I paid this bill in advance. I<br>was almost sure that I couldn't be there but,<br>nevertheless, I paid for two plates - one for you and<br>the other for your wife. You will never know what that<br>night meant for me. I love you."<br><br>At that moment I understood the importance of saying,<br>in time: "I  LOVE YOU" and to give our loved ones the<br>time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more<br>important than God and your family. Give them the time<br>they deserve, because these things cannot be put off<br>to "some other time".<br></strong>[/b]</blockquote>y life b so sad..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
