            <div class='col-md body'>A lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long flight from LA to NY. The lawyer leans over to her and asks if she would like to play a fun game. The blonde just wants to take a nap, so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun. He explains "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5, and visa-versa." Again, she politely declines and tries to get some sleep.<br><br>The lawyer, now some what agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $50!" figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match. This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game.<br><br>The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches in to her purse, pulls out a $5 bill and hands it to the lawyer. Now, it's the blonde's turn. She asks the lawyer: "What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?" The lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his coworkers and friends. All to no avail.<br><br>After over an hour, he wakes the blonde and hands her $50. The blonde politely takes the $50 and turns away to get back to sleep. The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, so what IS the answer!?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5, and goes back to sleep.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The beautiful secretary of the president of a bank goes on a sight-seeing tour with a very rich African king who was a very important client. The client out of the blue asks her to marry him. Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback. However, she remembers what her boss told her, don't<br>reject the guy outright.<br><br>So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting to marry her. After a few minutes, the woman says to the man, "I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara."<br><br>The African king pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, "No problem! I have. I have."<br><br>Realizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, "I want you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France."<br><br>The African king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, "Okay, okay. I build. I build."<br><br>Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that she'd better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, "Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch *****."<br><br>The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table, all the while muttering in African dialect.<br><br>Finally, after what seemed like forever, the king shakes his head, looking really sad, and says to the woman, "Okay, okay. I cut. I cut."</div>

He spoke with a wisdom that can only come from experience, like a guy who had gone blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without using one of those boxes with the pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without using one of those boxes with a pinhole in it.<br><br>3. She grew on him, like she was a colony of E.coli and he was room-temperature prime English beef.<br><br>4. She had a deep, throaty, genuine laugh, like that sound a dog makes just before it throws up.<br><br>5. Her vocabulary was as bad as, like, whatever.<br><br>6. He was as tall as a six-foot-three-inch tree.<br><br>7. The revelation that his 30-year marriage had disintegrated because of his wife's infidelity came as a rude shock, like a bank surcharge at formerly surcharge-free ATM.<br><br>8. The little boat gently drifted across the pond, exactly the way a bowling ball wouldn't.<br><br>9. McBride fell twelve storeys, hitting the pavement like a hefty bag filled with vegetable soup.<br><br>10. The whole scene had an eerie, surreal quality, like when you're on vacation in another city and "Sex &amp; The City" comes on at 9pm instead of 9.30.<br><br>11. Her hair glistened in the rain, like nose hair after a sneeze.<br><br>12. The hailstones struck and leapt from the pavement, just like maggots when you fry them in hot oil.<br><br>13. John and Mary had never met. They were like two hummingbirds who had also never met.<br><br>14. Even in his later years, Grandad had a mind like a steel trap, only one that had been left out so long, it had rusted shut.<br><br>15. The plan was simple, like my brother-in-law Phil. But unlike Phil, this plan might just work.<br><br>16. The young fighter had a hungry look, the kind you get from not eating in a while.<br><br>17. "Oh Jason, take me!" she panted, her breasts heaving like a uni student on $1 beer night.<br><br>18. He was as lame as a duck. Not the metaphorical lame duck, either, but a real duck that was actually lame, maybe from stepping on a land-mine or something.<br><br>19. The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant.<br><br>20. He was so deeply in love with her that when she spoke he thought he heard bells, as if she were a garbage truck backing up.<br><br>21. She was as easy as the TV Guide crossword.<br><br>22. She walked into my office like a centipede that was missing 98 legs.<br><br>23. It hurt, like the way your tongue hurts after you accidentally staple it to the wall.<br><br>24. The thunder was ominous sounding, much like the sound of a thin sheet of metal being shaken backstage during the storm scene in a play.<br><br>25. His thoughts tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances like underpants in a tumble dryer.<br><br>26. Her eyes were like two brown circles with big black dots in the center.<br><br>27.The politician was gone but unnoticed, like the full stop after the Dr. on a Dr Pepper can.<br><br>28. Her artistic sense was exquisitely refined, like someone who can tell butter from "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter."<br><br>29.

            <div class='col-md body'>20 Fun Things To Do At A Drive-Thru<br><br>1. Stand close to the speaker and yell your order, using colorful expletives in ways which would embarrass the patrons inside.<br><br>2. Drive through backwards.<br><br>3. Belch your order.<br><br>4. After ordering, cover the speaker and mic with transparent tape. Watch as customers and order-takers are unable to hear each other and, thus, each raises his/her volume.<br><br>5. Barter. Offer a Whopper for a Big Mac.<br><br>6. Walk through.<br><br>7. Speak a foreign language (make one up if you have to).<br>When the manager comes to the mic, speak English and inquire as to why the order taker had such difficulty understanding you.<br><br>8. Repeat everything the order-taker says.<br><br>9. Attempt to take the order-takers order ("Hi, may I take your order?") before they get a chance to take yours.<br><br>10. Order confusing items, i.e., "Hi, I'll have a large orange Coke and a small medium fries, please".<br><br>11. In a crowded drive-thru line, place a HUGE order, then slip out of line and watch the fun as the person behind you is handed 40 bags of food.<br><br>12. When you arrive at the window to pick up your food, hand them several bags of garbage &amp; ask if they'll dispose of it for you. Make sure it smells.<br><br>13. Drive through with a carload of naked people.<br><br>14. Speak in such a garbled fashion that the order-taker will think there is a problem with the speaker and ask you to order at the window. When you arrive at the window, speak in the same garbled, incomprehensible fashion.<br><br>15. Drive through with someone on the hood to accept the food.<br><br>16. Bring along a Mr. Microphone. When the order-taker speaks, aim the mic at their speaker but do so while aiming the Mr. Microphone speaker at the mic to produce excruciating feedback of their own voice.<br><br>17. One word: Flatulence!<br><br>18. Have a friend hide in the trunk. When you approach the window to pickup your order, have him start yelling and banging his fists on the trunk.<br><br>19. If you are a male, have a female friend place the order by speaking VERY seductively and suggestively into the speaker. When she finishes, have her hide and pull up to accept your order. See how many of the order-takers fellow<br>employees have been called over to the window to<br>"check out the babe".<br><br>20. Change a flat tire in the drive-thru lane.</div>
