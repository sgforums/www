So I looked up at the pent house, "na...be." was almost out from my mouth when I realize that this girl, is the most gorgeous girl I have seen. So I smiled. She was shocked then.. I could see it. She ran down the stairs, picked up my bags of fish bones and spices and led me to her house. I thought this nice chick was going to towel me dry.<br><br>It didn't happen. Later, I learnt that it was a Batam custom to pour soapy stinky water only down the man you love. And WHAT.. I actually had to marry her.<br><br>My mind raced back to my wife's banglow immediately.. can't do that.. NOW. Then again, it was a great chance, couldn't waste that. Eventually I rejected the offer.<br><br>Saw that sign of relieve on both the girl and her mom's face. Goddammit.<br><br>part 3... heee</div>
