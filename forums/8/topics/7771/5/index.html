Personally, I have more common taste, I like O blood. Negative ones please.<br><br>2) Hm... want me as a present? Just hope that you wun regret and label me as a white elephant in the end.<br><br>3) Look at it this way.what ever wrong the person has done, coming back to you for help is considered having trust in you and knowing that you will help.
