            <div class='col-md body'>An email i received &amp; it did touched my heart, jus tot i shared it here --- &gt;<br><br>It is a shame but this message is very true. Hope you are all<br>&gt;&gt;as blessed as I was from this story. I wonder how many people will<br>&gt;&gt;delete<br>&gt;&gt;this without reading it because of the title on it? Please read on.....<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;There once was a man named George Thomas, pastor in a small New England<br>&gt;&gt;town. One Easter Sunday morning he came to the Church carrying a<br>&gt;&gt;rusty, bent, old bird cage, and set it by the pulpit. Eyebrows were<br>&gt;&gt;raised<br>&gt;&gt;and, as if in response, Pastor Thomas began to speak...<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"I was walking through town yesterday when I saw a young boy coming<br>&gt;&gt;toward me swinging<br>&gt;&gt;this bird cage. On the bottom of the cage were three little wild birds,<br>&gt;&gt;shivering with<br>&gt;&gt;cold and fright. I stopped the lad and asked, "What you got there, son?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Just some old birds," came the reply.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"What are you gonna do with them?" I asked.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Take 'em home and have fun with 'em," he answered. "I'm<br>&gt;&gt;gonna tease 'em and pull out their feathers to make 'em fight. I'm gonna<br>&gt;&gt;have a<br>&gt;&gt;real good time."<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"But you'll get tired of those birds sooner or later. What will you do?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Oh, I got some cats," said the little boy. "They like birds. I'll take<br>&gt;&gt;'em to them."<br>&gt;&gt;The pastor was silent for a moment.<br>&gt;&gt;"How much do you want for those birds, son?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Huh?? !!! Why, you don't want them birds, mister. They're<br>&gt;&gt;just plain old field birds. They don't sing. They ain't even pretty!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"How much?" the pastor asked again.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;The boy sized up the pastor as if he were crazy and said, "$10?"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;The pastor reached in his pocket and took out a ten dollar<br>&gt;&gt;bill. He placed it in the boy's hand. In a flash, the boy was gone. The<br>&gt;&gt;pastor picked up the cage and gently carried it to the end of the alley<br>&gt;&gt;where<br>&gt;&gt;there was a tree and a grassy spot. Setting the cage down, he opened the<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;door, and by softly tapping the bars persuaded the birds out, setting<br>&gt;&gt;them free.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Well, that explained the empty bird cage on the pulpit, and then the<br>&gt;&gt;pastor began to tell this story.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation...<br>&gt;&gt;Satan had just come from the Garden of Eden, and he was<br>&gt;&gt;gloating and boasting. "Yes, sir, I just caught the world full of people<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew they couldn't resist. Got<br>&gt;&gt;'em all!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun! I'm gonna teach them<br>&gt;&gt;how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other,<br>&gt;&gt;how to drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna teach them how to invent<br>&gt;&gt;guns and<br>&gt;&gt;bombs and kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"And what will you do when you get done with them?" Jesus<br>&gt;&gt;asked.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Oh, I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why,<br>&gt;&gt;you'll take them and they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse<br>&gt;&gt;you<br>&gt;&gt;and kill you. You don't want those people!!"<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;"How much? He asked again.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your blood, tears and<br>&gt;&gt;your life."<br>&gt;&gt;Jesus said, "DONE!" Then He paid the price.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;The pastor picked up the cage he opened the door and he walked from the<br>&gt;&gt;pulpit.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Note: Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then<br>&gt;&gt;wonder why the world's going to hell. Isn't it funny how someone<br>&gt;&gt;can say<br>&gt;&gt;"I believe in God" but still follow Satan (who, by the way,<br>&gt;&gt;also "believes" in God).? Isn't it funny how you can send a thousand<br>&gt;&gt;jokes<br>&gt;&gt;through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing.<br>&gt;&gt;Isn't it funny how when you go to forward this message,<br>&gt;&gt;you will not send it to many on your address list because you're not<br>&gt;&gt;sure what<br>&gt;&gt;they believe, or what they will think of you for sending it to them.<br>&gt;&gt;Isn't it funny how I can be more worried about what other<br>&gt;&gt;people think of me than what God thinks of me.<br>&gt;&gt;I pray, for everyone who sends this to their entire address<br>&gt;&gt;book, they will be blessed by God in a way special for them. And send<br>&gt;&gt;it back to the person who sent it, to let them know that indeed it was<br>&gt;&gt;sent<br>&gt;&gt;out to many more.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;*ÃƒmÃ¥Ã‘Ã�Ã¢* (original sender)<br>&gt;<br></div>
