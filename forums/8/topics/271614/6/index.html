If terrorists are compassionate, they won't kidnap people in the first place. Terrorists are desperados, willing to die for Allah and Anthing. The Israelis has a policy of not negotiating, treating every threat as a war. Its enemies know this fully well, so nobody plays prays with the Israelis! Perhaps, the foolhardy, and they are plenty of such people around.</div>

If you want to waste your life away or commit suicide, then you will be held accountable when you meet your Creator.<br><br>What concern us is whether their family members are prepared for their non-return, especially if they know the group did not take full precaution in the lion's den.<br><br>The point here is that your life is also between you and your parents. If they are not Christians, or worse antagonistic to the faith,  they will not understand the reason of you going there. I caught a glimpse of the footage showing the father of one of the dead when the coffin was flown back. I do not think the father is prepared for the death of his child.</div>

Going by your reasoning, the business of kidnapping should be promoted by every business development manager and for very negotiation between parties. </blockquote>Kidnapping is cheating, but then the chinese have this saying - bing bu yan zha.

First and foremost...kidnapping is already a sin..It dosen't matter whether they are commoners, tourist, soldiers or missionaries.<br>Secondly..killing is killing..It just couldn't be condoned..What abt the beheading? I couldn't see any excuse for that...Why are people actually showing sympathy for terrorists...Its frightening to see people actually condoning what they have done..Be it bombings, kidnapping..whatsoever..<br><br>Doing it for whatever reason..they are terrorists...thats a fact..so still..I hope something works out..If not I would support an all out military action..<br>This matter just can't drag forever and it's only a mtter of time when more hostages get killed..And the thought of taliban militants freed as exchange for the hostages are just unthinkable..What would be the message to the terrorists...just scary to think...Lets pray for the hostages....<br><br></div>
