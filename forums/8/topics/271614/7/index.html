First and foremost...kidnapping is already a sin..It dosen't matter whether they are commoners, tourist, soldiers or missionaries.<br>Secondly..killing is killing..It just couldn't be condoned..What abt the beheading? I couldn't see any excuse for that...Why are people actually showing sympathy for terrorists...Its frightening to see people actually condoning what they have done..Be it bombings, kidnapping..whatsoever..<br><br>Doing it for whatever reason..they are terrorists...thats a fact..so still..I hope something works out..If not I would support an all out military action..<br>This matter just can't drag forever and it's only a mtter of time when more hostages get killed..And the thought of taliban militants freed as exchange for the hostages are just unthinkable..What would be the message to the terrorists...just scary to think...Lets pray for the hostages....<br><br></div></blockquote>Look mate, I'm no Terrorist lover.<br><br>But lets put things into perspective ... what makes a terrorist... typically poverty and continous oppression. But as the saying goes - "One mans terrorist is another freedom fighter". If they have jetfighters, tanks, helicopters... you think they would use suicide bombing? When the French were resisting the Germans .. they were called freedom fighter by allies.. while the german calls them Terrorist. That's what's happening in Iraq.<br><br>What is the difference between dropping 2,000 lb Jdams, or line bombing by B52 in residential areas to get afew Terrorist, killing more civilians Women and children and class them "Collateral Damage".. Than say a car bomb , Targeting Iraqi/Afghan/American Police/soldiers and killing Civilians ? If you read the news carefully... that's the situation.. bit are in small short sentences at the end of the articles.<br><br>Back to Afghan... One must understand and respect religion, and culture of country. You don't just go to a Tribal Muslim Religious country and preach and convert them to Christianity... and doing it Taliban Country is really asking for it. BTW, you gets a beheading/ hanging sentence in Saudi Arabia for doing that same thing.. but it's alright they are US allies.<br><br>Kidnapping - US has been Kidnapping foriegners for decades, they might use different terms.. like "Rendition"... but its means the same thing. Israelis do it all the time. Do you know that the US and coalition are arresting whole families of suspected insurgents to force them to surrender themselves... that's to me is kidnapping. How is it different than what's the Taliban is doing? How about those so-called Inmates in Gitzmo.. how many of them were released after afew years with no charge.. None of the inmates were even given a fair trial.. to say that they are indeed Guilty. You don't get to read the news here in Singapore, but they were numerous news of "renditioned" inmates freed and dump back where they were abducted without an explaination.<br><br>Now, personally, I don't support the Iraq War.. as it was based on lies and deception. Also I reserve my opinion on the invasion of Afghan too... Because unless the US can fully explain how WTC7 Collapse, minutes after the two towers.. and includes them in their Investigation Commission, and why the three building belongs to the same person.. I will continue to be suspicious of the whole 9/11 episode... and BTW, OsamaBinLaden confession video on planning the 9/11 was proven an imposter. It was a different person, you can be fat or thin, but you can't throw a bigger nose in a year. and of course, he denies involvement a week before this video<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taliban say two South Korean hostages freed<br>Posted: 11 August 2007 2323 hrs<br><br>GHAZNI, Afghanistan - Afghanistan's Taliban said Saturday it has freed two women among 21 South Korean hostages captured more than three weeks ago by the hardline militia.<br><br>Two spokesman for the insurgents said both women were ill and had been freed unconditionally as a "gesture of goodwill," just hours after the conclusion of face-to-face talks between the Taliban and a South Korean delegation.<br><br>Neither Afghan nor South Korean officials would immediately confirm any hostage release.<br><br>"Our leadership council decided to free unconditionally and as a gesture of goodwill two women hostages who are sick," said the main Taliban spokesman, Yousuf Ahmadi.<br><br>Ahmadi said they might not yet have arrived at the point where they would be handed over to authorities "due to some transportation difficulty."<br><br>"But what I can tell you is the leadership council has said they must be freed, so they're freed," he said.<br><br>Taliban representatives and the South Koreans met in the southern town of Ghazni, 140 kilometres (90 miles) south of the capital Kabul.<br><br>The hardline rebels abducted 23 Koreans on July 19. They later shot dead two of the Christian aid workers and had threatened to murder more if demands for the release of Taliban prisoners from jail were not met.<br><br>Another Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahed, confirmed the decision to free the women, saying their release would "show that we're honest in our talks and expect the government to be honest and free our prisoners".<br><br>The police chief of Ghazni, Alishah Ahmadzai, said earlier there had been an agreement to free "some" of the hostages, but other officials would not confirm this.<br><br>The two Taliban representatives who were party to the talks said Saturday they were "optimistic" but reiterated their prisoner-swap demand, a condition the government has repeatedly rejected.<br><br>"The hostages will be freed if the government accepts our demands to free some prisoners," one of the negotiators, Qari Bashir, said outside the offices of the Afghan Red Crescent Society where the talks were held.<br><br>"If they accept our demands, maybe they'll be freed today or tomorrow," he said at what amounted to the Taliban's first press conference in several years.<br><br>The Taliban, who have been waging an insurgency since being toppled from government in 2001, usually speak to reporters through spokesmen who make telephone contact from undisclosed locations.<br><br>With talks with the Afghan government apparently deadlocked over the demand for a prisoner exchange, direct negotiations between the rebels and the South Korean team have been seen as one of the last hopes for the hostages' release.<br><br>The 23 South Korean aid workers were abducted in Ghazni province while travelling on a key highway which many foreigners consider a no-go area because of a general decline in security.<br><br>The Taliban are also linked to a militant group holding a German engineer and four Afghans captured in Wardak province near Kabul the day before the abduction of the South Koreans.<br><br>The militants have demanded a prisoner exchange for the 62-year-old engineer, who was captured with another German who was shot dead days later.<br><br>The hardliners were in government between 1996 and 2001, when they were driven out by a US-led coalition for sheltering Al-Qaeda -- blamed for the 9/11 attacks that year. - AFP/ir/ls</div>
