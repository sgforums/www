If the Afghan govt again acedes to the demands of the Taliban and exchange prisoners for hostages, whatever the ratio whether 1:1 or 1:5 or 5:1, what will happen you guess???<br><br>Thats right, Taliban will start actively kidnapping any foreigner they can lay their hands on so they can continue trading hostages for prisoners. And Afghan govt cannot promote it. So Afghan govt cannot be blamed also.<br><br>We cannot just think of these  current S. Korean hostages without seeing future reprecussions if the Afghan govt allows a trade.
