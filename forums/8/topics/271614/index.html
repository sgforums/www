The Taliban extended several previous deadlines by hours or days. However, the two captives the militants executed were killed several hours after previous deadlines.<br><br>Afghan National Army helicopters on Wednesday dropped leaflets in Ghazni province Â— where the Koreans were kidnapped and are being held Â— warning people of an upcoming military operation in the area.<br><br>"The Defense Ministry wants to launch a military operation in the area," the leaflets said. "In order for you to be safe and not be affected by the operation, we call on you to move to secure government-controlled areas."<br><br>The leaflets did not say when or where the operation would be launched. It also was not clear whether the planned operation was aimed at freeing the hostages. A Defense Ministry spokesman said he had no immediate comment.<br><br>The South Koreans were kidnapped while riding a bus July 19 on the Kabul-Kandahar highway. They are the largest group of foreign hostages taken in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that drove the Taliban from power.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Taliban say 2 hostages very sick, deadline looms<br>Yousuf Azimy<br>Wed, Aug 01, 2007<br>Reuters<br><br>GHAZNI, Afghanistan, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Two women among 21 Koreans held by the Taliban in Afghanistan are seriously ill, a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday before the insurgents' 0730 GMT deadline for Kabul to free prisoners in return for the hostages.<br><br>Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf said Afghan negotiators had not contacted the militants who have threatened to kill the hostages if the Afghan government fails to release a group of Taliban prisoners by the deadline.<br><br>"The majority of the hostages are ill, but two females are seriously ill and there is this possibility that they may die," Yousuf told Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location.<br><br>He said the pair suffered from an unknown illness and the Taliban did not have the right medicines to treat them.<br><br>The Taliban were looking after the remaining South Koreans from a group of 23 Christians kidnapped from a bus in Ghazni province two weeks ago, he added. The Islamic movement killed two of the male hostages after previous deadlines expired.<br><br>Afghan officials have said no deal will be struck with the Taliban and demand the unconditional release of the remaining captives, 18 of them women.<br><br>President Hamid Karzai came under sharp criticism after releasing a group of Taliban prisoners in March in return for the freedom of an Italian journalist.<br><br>RISING VIOLENCE<br><br>The abduction of the Koreans comes after 18 months of rising violence in Afghanistan, the bloodiest period since the Taliban were ousted from power by U.S.-led and Afghan forces in 2001.<br><br>A day before seizing the Koreans, the Taliban abducted two German aid workers and five of their Afghan colleagues in Wardak province which like Ghazni lies to the southwest of Kabul.<br><br>One of the Germans was found shot dead this week and one of the Afghans managed to escape. The other German and four Afghans were still being held.<br><br>The Taliban demand that Germany pulls its 3,000-strong force under NATO's command out of Afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the other German.<br><br>Al Jazeera showed a man against a rocky backdrop in a hilly area, a militant covering him with a rocket-propelled grenade.<br><br>The station did not play the sound of the video, but a presenter said: "The German hostage Rudolf B. ... urged Germany and the United States to pull out their forces from Afghanistan and urged his country to help save his life and secure his return to his homeland and family."<br><br>German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Berlin will not give in to the kidnappers' demands.<br><br>Separately, the Taliban have killed four Afghan judges they kidnapped in Ghazni two weeks ago, a provincial official said on Wednesday. The bodies of the four, killed on Tuesday night, were found to the south of the town of Ghazni on Wednesday, he added. </blockquote></div>

Bae Hyun-kyu, 42, on July 25 and Shim Sung-min, 29, on July 30, saying that their deaths were the result of the insincere attitude of Afghan and Korean negotiators.<br><br>But the Afghan government reiterated that it can't accept the swap deal for fear of international criticism.<br><br>Humayun Hamidzada, the spokesman of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, said that officials in Kabul were doing everything they can to secure the hostages' release but that freeing militant prisoners was not an option.<br><br>The United Stages also affirmed Tuesday its policy of not negotiating with terrorists.<br><br>``It remains U.S. policy not to make concessions to terrorists,'' said Tom Casey, deputy spokesman of the Department of State, in a daily press briefing. ``Again, the policy as written over the past 20 years or so is to not make concessions to terrorists and that remains our view.''<br><br>Baek Jong-chun, who was dispatched to Afghanistan as a special presidential envoy, will travel to Pakistan to solicit support for the release of the Koreans, presidential spokesman Cheon said.<br><br>``Pakistan is one of our allies, which could help us,'' he said. ``There is a possibility that Baek will meet with high-ranking officials there.''<br><br>Cheon also reiterated that the U.S. government has already promised that it will not take military action against the Taliban as long as there is no consent from Korea, dismissing the possibility of a rescue operation.<br><br>He made it clear that Korea will maintain dialogue and negotiations with patience.<br><br>As the 21 hostages passed a 14th day in captivity, some of them appeared to be sick. The Yonhap News Agency reported that two women are seriously ill and may die if they fail to get proper medical assistance.<br><br>Ahamdi also told the AIP that the two would be released if the Afghan government frees two Taliban prisoners.<br><br>The Korean government sent food and medical supplies to the provincial government of Ghazni where the Koreans were kidnapped and they were delivered to the hostages, officials in Seoul said.<br><br>Meanwhile, CBS said that the Taliban may stop killing the hostages, quoting a senior commander of the Taliban involved in the negotiations.<br><br>The commander said that the Afghan government is under extreme pressure and the Taliban want this crisis to continue.<br><br>However, there seems to be division among the militants on how to treat the hostages.<br><br>A supreme council of the Taliban was held Monday to decide whether to kill the hostages one by one, or collectively, or release them, and was reported to have chosed to kill them one by one. The second killing was conducted right after the meeting, according to sources in Kabul.<br><br>The remaining Korean abductees _ 18 women and three men, mostly in their 20s and 30s _ went to Afghanistan on July 13 to offer volunteer medical services. Most of them are members of the Saemmul Community Church in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province.</blockquote></div>
