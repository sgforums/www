            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...Looks like I have to clear up some misunderstandings...<br><br>For those of you who are wondering what this is all about, our discussion revolved around the theory that there is life in outer space. To be honest I cannot recall the full extent of the conversation, and I have no means to view the History records in my ICQ (through which this discussion took place) due to some technical problems with my records.<br><br>Now I would hasitate to publish this as a discussion thread because participation in it requires assumptions which not all people will readily accept.<br><br>1. There is life in outer space. This is a widely acknowledged possibility but until we can get a little green man to appear on national TV and prove to us that there are many more of his brethern out there, it will always remain a theory.<br><br>2. Life on Earth was created by organisms from space (there is scientific evidence to support this claim). This means to say that any alien lifeform will essentially have the same biological development pattern as ours. Consider them a form of "distant relatives", much like apes and humans.<br><br>Once we have accepted the two assumptions (if you don't we cannot proceed), we bring in religion and the precence of "God" (again, I'll have to define the word as not having any relations to any known religion, but rather an omipotent enigmatic force) back into the picture. Assuming that there are life on other planets, is the same "God" that created us humans the same that created the other races? Or if the 2nd assumption is true, wouldn't that discredit the presence of a "God" altogether?<br><br>You see, the first assumption expands the playing field somewhat, and reduces the influences of religion (and their respective "God"s) to our planet and its denziens only. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that no religion has approached the idea of life other than that on our planet. Thus this has the implication that religion and their "God"s have little or no relavence outside the context of Earth.<br><br>This now brings me to the topic, "We are God". I believe what Forever really meant was that a species can appear to be a "God" to other species. Now assuming the two aforementioned assumptions were true, we are now faced with two seperate and independent species. Obviously both will not evolve at the same pace and direction. What we would get is that one species will be more "advanced" than the other. Suppose now that a subject from the more advanced species were to visit the primative species. With the subject's more advance technology, abilities and knowledge, he may seem omnipotent and enigmatic to the primative species, even though he is mortal himself. Thus herein is the whole point of forever's topic (ie. the one u are reading now)- A "God" may just be a more advanced species. Hence Humans, in a way, can be "God"s also.<br><br>Anyway, I have to point out that these are just theories that are ideal for idle chat but carry little weight in arguments (and certainly will have little value in the ongoing religious war that has unfortunately sprung up). The main problem is that there are just too many "what ifs" involved. If you look at all the crap I mentioned earlier, they would mean nothing if we did not establish the 2 assumptions. Also, we do not have concrete evidence to prove them correct, other than through mathematical probabilites.<br><br>On a parting note, I personally feel that it is impossible to ignore the fact that there is life in space. True the probability of life on a distant planet is small and insignificant; yet when we consider a sample space as infinitly large as the universe, this little probability becomes a significant value; small no doubt, but we cannot ignore it.<br><br>Of course, its just a theory  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole</div>
