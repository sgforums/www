            <div class='col-md body'>My sister visited New Zealand last yr and bought back a souvenir cap which printed 'Queenstown ... Down Under',<br><br>I then checked a universal dictionary on 'Down Under' and then realised that 'Down Under' really means 'Either Australia OR New Zealand'.<br><br>Many of us hear media personnel on travel programmes or news reporter just say Down Under to directly mean only Australia, this is actually wrong as it can mean both NZ or Australia.<br><br>Remember the 80s song 'Down Under' by the Aussie group 'Men at work' which was used as the theme song of 'Finding Nemo'?<br><br>I had an old complilation CD which had lyrics, 1 line read '' I came from A land Down Under', so actually the Aussie group knew what they were singing. i.e. if ONLY Australia is DOWN UNDER, the lyrics should then BECOME  ' I came from THE land Down Under'.<br><br>see, even in song lyrics, 'Men at work' don't wish to selfishly make 'Down Under' to mean only Australia.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys,<br><br>don't take this personally but some thing u guys mentioned are not correct.  I stayed in Aust for 4 yrs and hence got the chance to know more about Aust and nz then u guys (plus the fact i m inquisitive and find out more myself) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>35mmGunner - True, as mentioned Down Under can refer both Aust and NZ.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">However, Oceania is NOT continent </span>, <strong>ONLY Australia is a Continent.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Oceania is a 'continental region' with Australia as its Continent and also PLUS surrounding island, <strong>just like Asia Continent strictly speaking don't include Japan, Indonesia </strong>but Asia 'continental region' (usually just called Asia or Asia continent) does include the islands</span>.   <strong>It is the world's only 'Continental region' that don't follow the main continent's name </strong>- most likely because Australia Continent is already used as a country's name and hence quite confusing if also means the entire region as well.<br><br>secondly <strong>Australia does not equal Australasia</strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">i.e. Australasia means 'bigger things' than Australia</span>.  Australasia is a imprecise terms that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">normally refers to Australia, NZ and nearby Pacific islands only, </span>however, it generally don't refer the entire Oceania region and it does not refer to Asia, esp Asia Continent (i.e. mainland).<br><br>dear Sillyme, New Zealand don't equal ANZAC, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anzac refers to Australia and New Zealand Corp</span> that were form for and fought together in WW1 under British overall command.  I<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> think the modern term to refer to Aust and NZ is 'ANZ', as in ANZ bank, one of the big 4 banks in Australia.</span><br>hope u guys find in interesting. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
