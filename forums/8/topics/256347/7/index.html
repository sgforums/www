Even being illegal, the penalty should not be very large.  My own feeling is it should be legalized and regulated, especially given the large number of smokers world-wide.<br><br>Singapore has many good points.  I am not really looking at the death penalty issue per se.  It is just that there are times when the 'justice' system completely fails.  I believe that is what happened with Mr. Murugesu.</div></blockquote>Marijuana is an illegal drug in many countries. And perhaps in Canada and some US states, it is a prescription medication/drug - it is regulated. In Singapore, it is prohibited. No doubt many people consider Marijuana about as 'light' as ordinary cigarettes. But the issue here is whether it would be in the best interest to the people (whom the lawmakers are responsible to) to allow marijuana to be legalised. Is that what singaporeans(not americans) want?

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyways , we i think we can all discuss about the laws. There is almost no way of ever changing it in our state. These discussions makes us see things clearer. Understanding issues clearer. And i only know of 2 ways of bringing about the change.<br><br>1) Revolution.. people power. LoL! but its gonna be bloody.. most probably i dont want that , its not like the system is corrupt to that point<br><br>or<br><br>2) Educate the people slowly open thier minds , and get into politics and change the system n laws from within n perhaps with enough people understanding the true nature of things n they will BAN cigarettes , Legalise Marijuana =P<br><br>And i assure u, the cigarette companies are NOT gonna be very happy.. so most likely ur life will be in danger.<br><br></div>

(though he didn't mean it in that context!!)<br><br>has anyone ever considered the fact that part of the reason drugs are so highly prized in singapore is due to economics? Supply and demand. The fact that people have an incentive to smuggle drugs into singapore is because no one wants to do it, and therefore the demand is very high for both drugs, and smugglers.<br><br>what if we were to legalise marijuana? That takes the edge off the glamour factor, and drugs like marijuana will become like cigarettes. Legal but harmful. Plus, the government could impose a tax on marijuana sales, and earn revenues from it.<br><br>Of course there will be the argument of people suffering from the aftermath of the legalisation of drugs. But if our government finds it economically viable, you think they won't do it? If they can bring a casino, sorry, 2 casinos into singapore, they can pretty much do anything. It's all about the money, isn't it?<br><br></div></blockquote>Hey maxtor!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Hmm maybe I'm not that clear enough cos you don't seem to get my point.<br><br>I'm glad you agree that the 3 items are all harmful. So why should there be a reason to legalise something that is harmful? Since marijuana is harmful, it is outrightly banned. And hence, the objective of this topic created by the TS wouldn't have much argument. However, it leads to a whole new issue.<br><br>If these 3 items are equally as harmful, why aren't smoking and alcohol banned? Hence all the arguments such as economical reasons, social acceptance reasons and blah blah would come in. But you see this issue and the issue raised by the TS is linked but different.<br><br>My point is, even if the laws on smoking and alcohol are suspiciously flawed, the fact that they are not banned should not be a factor for all other drugs, inclusive of marijuana to be made legalise. As mentioned, 2 wrongs do not make 2 rights. It will be a faintly fallacious argument against the notion that the guy should not be hanged for a drug that should not be ban?<br><br>Casinos and drugs are 2 different items. Usually when we mentioned drugs, it is regarding the misuse of it. For gambling, even illegal gambling is illegal. Legal gambling is controlled. Monitored. Misuse of drugs is by itself misused and not controlled and monitored. Legalise drugs? That is leading the country to suicide. The society will be more vulnerable, ineffective, and causing all sort of social problems. The government makes money directly from legalising the drugs but it will also incur more expenses through all these social problems. Have you thought of that? The casino issue wasn't a straightforward decision. There were debates and all kind of nonsense before it was approved. Obviously, all these were to discuss and weighing the pros and cons of having casinos.. Yeah..<br><br>Hope I cleared myself..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Thanks for your feedback though.. Once again, correct me if I'm wrong..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I am not really looking at the death penalty issue per se.  It is just that there are times when the 'justice' system completely fails.

If u use drug for urself, u dont get death penalty........if u trade/ traffic drugs to other people, then u get death penalty.....to me, this is an accurate and philosophically correct application....of the principle.....that the basic human rights of many other people....be held above....the human rights of 1 person....<br><br>If you use drugs for urself, u get only jail sentence and maybe rehab. So the law is taking a more sympathetic view. But once a person distribute/ sell to other people, then he is not a victim himself, but a victimizer, and he is jeopardizing the basic human rights of many other people. So to me, the distiction between a user and a trafficker, and the application of death penalty only for traffickers, is very correct, and it's philosophically and strategically, at its very roots, the right thing to do. It is not wrong at all.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div></blockquote>I am neutral to the death penalty.<br><br>To me, its just an economical way of getting rid of people with capital crimes. Instead of locking them up for decades and providing them food and lodging with taxpayers' money, our govt thinks its more cost-effective to just end their lives.<br><br>There is no moral thought to this, just a pragmatic approach to it.<br><br>Of coz the official response is that death sentence is a deterrent, but we all know that there is no statistical proof that the deterrent is effective, coz the no. of people put to death every year has no trend of declining.</div>
