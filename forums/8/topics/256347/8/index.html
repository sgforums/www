That man is dead because he try to murder 100 of others by bring drugs in to kill them !!! Why about the 100 of families that he try to kill with drugs !!! Like you say about beer and wine - he could have choose to smuggle wine or beer but he did not he smuggle drugs !!!<br><br>America has is in no position to talk about murder !! how many innocents US kill in vietnam ?<br><br>Please use you brain before you talk .... being American does not mean you got a brain !!! Anyway by the look of it nothing much of it is functional as it is already 1/2 kill by drugs !!! By the way, let hope your children are all hooked to drugs then let see what you have to say about this !!!</div>
