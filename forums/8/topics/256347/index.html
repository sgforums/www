            <div class='col-md body'>Notice that this is Singapore and Every country has its own law.<br><br>Taken from Wikipedia:<br><br>"<br><strong>Shanmugam Murugesu (c.1967 Â– 13 May 2005) was a Tamil Singaporean executed for smuggling 1.03 kg of cannabis into Singapore from Malaysia. Such offenses carry a mandatory death sentence under Singapore's Misuse of Drugs Act.<br><br>Prior to his death, Murugesu's case was publicized by campaigners against capital punishment in Singapore, which has the highest per capita rates of legalized execution in the world. He was the father of two children.</strong><br><br>"<br><br>If he smuggles, it means that he knows it's against the law. If he knows the law, he can jolly well stick to cigarettes instead of smuggling a whopping 1.03kg of cannabis into Singapore when the law states that (If i am right) if anyone is found with &gt;0.5kg of drugs will be sentence to death.<br><br>The penalty is justified.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers.<br>CK</div>

Weed actually gives out a kind of chemical that greatly relaxes the eyes therefore ur eyes become watery as the stress of ur eyes are relaxed causing ur pupils to dilate n lubricate hence cause SLIGHT distortions of views but still allowing the human brain to process distance , objects and colours .<br><br>A person dehydrate due to increase of flam as the THC if inhaled without a filter slightly solidifies in your body but absorbed into the human body easily hence requiring fluids. Simple to say , its like going thirsty after smoking a cigarette. The feeling of dryness.A person do not dehydrate to any dangerous levels unless he refuses any intake of fluid into his system even when he is thirsty.<br><br>Any more reasons? he he... thsoe 2 reasons are not enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Sad to say even if its only marijuana.. its the death penalty in that country. Instead b|tching about it , why not educate them , n change the laws when they are in a position of power. he he~</div>
