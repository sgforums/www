It will not be good for some to escape the death penalty and some hang just because the judge is softer on crime. The job of the judiciary should be limited to finding guilt in accordance to the law. For serious crimes, society decide what should be a minimum sentence. For serious crimes such as murder and drug trafficking, I say keep the mandatory death sentences.</div>

Just say what ur points are....<br><br>With regards to alcohol and tobacco....well, I think each subtance is different...thats why, even for different drugs, there are different classifications, correct? Even for medication pills, there are classifications, correct?<br><br>We cannot say....how about alcohol and tobacco.......and use it as an argument for the other different classes...such as marijuana....I think that is wrong logic....<br><br>Personally....I think tobacco should be banned in this world...alcohol could possibly be tolerated in moderation, but again, these are perhaps a separate topic for discussion, and.......it's not really related to marijuana trafficking......because they are different classes of substance....<br><br>With regards to marijuana in USA....pls, I think the TS is putting a simplified picture....I believe USA is also socially pretty divided on this issue....and as she mentioned....it's somewhat legalized for medication....well, in that case, that means it's not really legalized for casual usage, and certainly not for trading or trafficking, is it not correct, TS? Coffiegirl? Yes or no?<br><br>I mean, if we're talking about medication usage....even morphein also can be used in medicine as pain-killers, correct? But morphein is not legalized for casual usage and trade/ trafficking also?<br><br>I believe......only very few societies in this world...legalize a limited form of drug usage, very few, and with limitations. For instance Netherlands. It shows that a vast majority of humanity in this world have found that drugs have more damage than good to the society, and decided to curtail, suppress, and rid of it.<br><br>There is only variations in the manner. For instance some societies would think.....1kg of subtance A is lethal.....another think....2kg is lethal....one would think death penalty...another would think....20 years of prison.....this is normal and it happens in ALL sorts of laws in this world....no society is the same.....You will find the penalty for murder is different from country to country.....The penalty for robbery is different from country to country.....ALL kinds of laws...<br><br>These laws... are expression and manifestation... of their societal and cultural views,....and of the environment or condition they are in...<br><br>Therefore u cannot expect....one unique societal values....expressed in its laws......being changed....or just accept or follow the views of another country, especially on a major social issue such as drugs.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I may discuss about another point... about death penalty....some people, including some posters here, are against death penalty...<br><br>I would just say...<br><br>When the human rights of many people, are pit against the human rights of 1 person, ....which one would u choose?<br><br>I think this is precisely......the case of death penalty.<br><br>Sorry.. we are living in an imperfect world.....in an ideal world, we need not have police at all, there would be no crimes at all, and everyone would live happily and harmoniously.....there would be no need for death penalty....maybe this condition still exist in some places, like some tribes in Pacific....but here in major urban centres....no.<br><br>I believe death penalty should exist for the severest act of crimes which jeopardize the basic human rights of many other people, such as.....drug trafficking, terrorism, betrayal in wartime, and other serious crimes.<br><br>I mean just take a look at the drug trafficking law here in Singapore. If u use drug for urself, u dont get death penalty........if u trade/ traffic drugs to other people, then u get death penalty.....to me, this is an accurate and philosophically correct application....of the principle.....that the basic human rights of many other people....be held above....the human rights of 1 person....<br><br>If you use drugs for urself, u get only jail sentence and maybe rehab. So the law is taking a more sympathetic view. But once a person distribute/ sell to other people, then he is not a victim himself, but a victimizer, and he is jeopardizing the basic human rights of many other people. So to me, the distiction between a user and a trafficker, and the application of death penalty only for traffickers, is very correct, and it's philosophically and strategically, at its very roots, the right thing to do. It is not wrong at all.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

It has different classes. Depending on how the country views it seriousness. For isntance , taiwan  its Class B while E and K is Class C , because of rampant usages n the inability of the law to fully prosecute n rehabilitate everyone n the costs of all the proceedings.<br><br>Alchohol is a form of drug too. So is cigarettes. They are both addictive and almost have NO positive health benefits. Thast why i say do some research n<br><br>For instances , alchohol during the early 1900's was banned n illegal in the states. It was classified as a drug too.It was then proven that is harmful.But because of the losing war against illegal bootlegging and organised crimes profitting from the illegal alchohol that they decided to legalise it to stop the flow and once again politicians were involved in banning it and some have thier own agenda's in legalising it. Thats why i stress again that the understanding of the history of these drugs and the history of the laws and policies made by the countries and especially by politicians who may or may not have interests in them and the agenda's with it.<br><br>In order to explain why hemp, the most useful plant known to mankind, became illegal, we have to understand the reasons why marijuana, the drug, became illegal.  In fact, it helps to go way back to the beginning of the century and talk about two other drugs, opium (the grandfather of heroin) and cocaine.<br><br>We all know that Cocaine is harmful , and has not benefits to our health or whatsoever , K , E , Ice has been proven to be drugs that are harmful to the body and consumed , permanent damages to it. But why do we see that fight for the legalisationg of Marijuana so strong ? We dont see ppl fighting to legalise coke , K , E or Ice or Speed or wahtever kind of drugs. because it is proven that its BAD.. Why do we still smoke cigarettes knowing we will die from cancer , bad for health , harms others. Why is it not illegal ? Besides to destress , weed can destress u too! The question then remains to why countries arent able to ban it. Some countries requiring migrant labour force for thier contructions for instances , those lowly paid workers only form of destress is cigarettes. By banning them , u will have NO workers , hell they wouldnt even wanna come to work and not to mention they are already addicted. Sometimes it is just too late to ban it as the cost of rehabilitation and the entire structure of the system will collapse as ppl are already addicted. Why is it in some countries they consider Tobacco and Alchohol as Sin Tax ?<br><br>thats why we need to dwell deeper to why its illegal instead of crying out why the death penalty  taking ones life , or supporting the idea of taking ones life.<br><br>Even if Marijuana is legalised,  u may think that it will increase smuggling n criminal organisations will profit ? Well , why buy it when i grow it. N its free!I The thing why stuffs are illegal sometimes is also because we are not able to control ourselves , we are not able to moderate ourselves and we abuse. Thats why there is no true democracy , only a benevolent despotism.<br><br>Anyways these are just a fraction of the points i am trying to explain , thats why i said more research is needed to explain and understanding these facts.And why i talked in 'riddles' .. i just hope that some are able to understand what i am trying to convey and not forcefully imposing my ideas on them.<br><br>Why are things illegal ?<br><br>quote 'The official answer: Because you shouldn't use it.You can't use it because it is illegal, and it is illegal so you can't use it.  You should not use it.  It is illegal.It is illegal so you should not use it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In any case BadzMaro, your argument, from what I had read so far, would be more to why alcohol and cigarettes are not illegal? That would be a different argument in this case. Alcohol and smoking issue would be a different issue. You would agree all these including marijuana is bad. But like I had made my point, just because alcohol and smoking is not illegal, it does not justify the fact that marijuana should be approved upon by the society and the law. If anything is to be argued here, it should be regarding the laws on alcohol and smoking. Its 2 different arguments here, from what I had read so far. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Case it point was the 'prohibition' fiasco back in the 30's. Marijuana, on the other hand, was and still is, exclusive to fringe elements of society in most parts of the world; banning it can also be viewed as a way to prevent it from becoming a mainstream problem.<br><br>Another possible reason for grouping marijuana with other hard drugs is that of the source. The draconian laws are aimed at preventing drug cartels and their middlemen from getting a foothold and turning Singapore into a transit hub for international narcotics; this is a problem much different from USA, which is more of a destination for drugs. I would venture a guess that Marijuana trafficking is done by the same groups or affiliations responsible for heroin and other nasties, and therefore the laws enforced are the same. They are targetting traffickers, not the drugs itself.<br><br>I see such harsh laws as a result, albeit indirectly, of Singapore's mainly Chinese populace. Legalism, whereby penalties are disproportionately greater than the actual 'crime' has always been acceptable if they are deemed to be for the greater good.</div>
