Even if a small portion of this natural resource gets defective, its still treated with great importance. Lets say we legalize it, people get addicted to it. Wont the society crumble. If all you can think of is when is the next time u can smoke your pot, then there is something really wrong.</div></blockquote>This is obviously not what the topic starter endeavoured to achieve, but on a sidenote, then why are cigarettes and alcohol legal? Let's use cigarettes as an example. I have no empirical evidence, but if we were to think about it, cigarettes damages the body as well, but why doesn't the government ban it? Is it because of the revenue it generates? Or is it because it is '' socially acceptable'' ? In Australia, weed/grass/marijuana, whatever u call it, is legal in certain states. Does the '' socially acceptable'' mindset apply here as well?<br><br>If our government is afraid of our people becoming defective, then why did they decide to bring in the casino? For revenues? Won't it cause our people to become defective as well? Gambling, just like smoking weed/cigarettes, is addictive as well. Or, is it because a casino is ''socially acceptable'' as well.<br><br>I'm also against the death penalty btw, it really is a cruel way of solving problems. Which of us, as humans, have the right to play God? And I'm sure some politicians would agree. But unfortunately, they would never vote it into law due to some economics principle that i studied. ( If they feel that the death penalty isn't right, politicians would still not voice it out to members of the public because the public would think they are not tough enough on laws and hence, not vote them into parliament)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I have absolute zilch knowledge on drugs, law and whatsoever. But here's my 2 cents worth.<br><br>Singapore &amp; United States of America.<br>There are bound to have differences in the way these 2 countries are being governed. Simply because they are in 2 different environments. The environment and the physicality of the country determine how it is being governed. As mentioned by a fellow forumner, Singapore's greatest resource is its people.<br><br>Alcohol &amp; Smoking VS Marijuana.<br>As mentioned by fellow forumners, despite alcohol and smoking having lots of defective effects on the human body, it is not banned here, perhaps because of it is "socially acceptable". Apparently, yeah. Probably. The society decides for itself. In the current society, smoking is probably still socially acceptable. Marijuana? If the society does not approve of it, so be it. Move on to another society that does. As argued, smoking is just as bad as marijuana but hey, the society's mindset takes time to adjust.<br>Some of you are probably right. Smoking should be totally banned as well. The government are probably not banning it due to economical, policital reasons. But you see, steps are taken to reduce smoking in Singapore. The gross pictures, the no-smoking areas. Why not just implement a total ban? That will be economical suicide. Just because smoking is not ban, it is not a reason for marijuana to be un-ban. 2 wrongs definitely do not make 2 rights.\<br>You see, to legalise marijuana now is to bring MORE detrimental to the society in terms of health. To illegalise alcohol and smoking now would also bring MORE detrimental to the society in various aspects.<br><br>The Topic.<br>What exactly is the argument here?<br>1) The fact that 2 children are pleading for their dad which should lead to the law making an exception?<br>2) Or the law itself being flawed?<br>3) Or down with capital punishment?<br><br>1) No arguments for the 1st. The law is the law. Many forumners have point out this point pretty well so no repeats.<br>2) Flawed law? Can be argued.<br>3) Yeah, down with capital punishment.<br><br>Regarding that black slavery thingie, you can't really use it as a comparison. It is as though you are trying to say, banning marijuana is an injustice done to the society. And even if alcohol and smoking is not being banned, it doesn't make marijuana any lesser evil.<br><br>Eh wait, are you arguing for marijuana to be made legal here in Singapore?<br><br>Pardon my bad english.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
