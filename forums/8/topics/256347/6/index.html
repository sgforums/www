If i am incorrect, let me know.<br><br>It is true that Parliament makes law. Judges interpret law. Due to the fact that courtroom time is very precious, sometimes judges have to make assumptions about the law cos it is impossible for laws to fit every case perfectly. ( Rightfully, they can consult Parliament if they are not clear on a certain law) Therefore, it can be said that judges 'make' law as well.<br><br>In every case, there's this part called the 'ratio decidendi'. That's the part the judge has to follow. e.g. previous cases of people being convicted of smuggling drugs faced the death penalty, and that particular case was very similar to the one being heard. The judge hence, HAS to follow the previous case ruling. He is not allowed to make his own decisions UNLESS the decision came from a lower court.<br><br>However, because there are SO MANY cases heard, it is physically impossible for the judge to follow every ruling. It is therefore, the lawyer's duty to point out to the judge previous cases which bore significant rulings to support the lawyer's cause. Clearly, the judge needs to do his own research as well. But lawyers are the one who point out to the judge previous ratio decidendi decisions which support their arguments.</div>

That would be a different argument in this case. Alcohol and smoking issue would be a different issue. You would agree all these including marijuana is bad. But like I had made my point, just because alcohol and smoking is not illegal, it does not justify the fact that marijuana should be approved upon by the society and the law. If anything is to be argued here, it should be regarding the laws on alcohol and smoking. Its 2 different arguments here, from what I had read so far. Correct me if I'm wrong. I welcome friendly criticisms.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>dinky, why would the alcohol and cigarettes argument not be valid? both alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana are all harmful.  cigarettes and marijuana even have similar methods of consumption.<br><br>I think Laserlordz brought up a very good point about the legalising of drugs. (though he didn't mean it in that context!!)<br><br>has anyone ever considered the fact that part of the reason drugs are so highly prized in singapore is due to economics? Supply and demand. The fact that people have an incentive to smuggle drugs into singapore is because no one wants to do it, and therefore the demand is very high for both drugs, and smugglers.<br><br>what if we were to legalise marijuana? That takes the edge off the glamour factor, and drugs like marijuana will become like cigarettes. Legal but harmful. Plus, the government could impose a tax on marijuana sales, and earn revenues from it.<br><br>Of course there will be the argument of people suffering from the aftermath of the legalisation of drugs. But if our government finds it economically viable, you think they won't do it? If they can bring a casino, sorry, 2 casinos into singapore, they can pretty much do anything.

B was hanged.<br><br>C smuggle drugs "z" into Singapore. C was hanged.<br><br>Should Mr Shanmugam Murugesu get an exception just because he has two kids? Hey those other guys had families I bet. Is having two kids a free "get out of jail" card?<br><br>Do you want to open a gate to escaping criminal liability (tarnishing Singapore's integrity / sovereignty) that YOU and nobody else can ever close?<br><br>Heck, people would be getting away with crimes everyday if that would happen. "ooooh, I have two kids!".<br><br>It is a mitigating factor for the judge during sentencing (no doubt), but the principles of law behind it is EQUAL TREATMENT BEFORE THE LAW. And if death is a mandatory penalty, then everyone who commits the prohibited act should be equally punished in that way.<br><br>As an American you should be familiar with death being capital punishment in your own country. Here you ask, "hey, its only marijuana".<br><br>But in your drug-wracked country, you deal with countless drug related crime seemingly without end. Then consider how it is humane and legal in some states to ask doctors for "voluntary death". You look over to Singapore before considering the laws of your own country. Look how peaceful a country Singapore became, with one of the lowest crime-rate in the world. How ironic for you to point to Singapore's inhumane treatment of felons, when you can't look at your own country's demise and legal misdemeanor.<br><br>Yes, it is Marijuana.<br><br>Marijuana that represents a prohibited substance which entails capital punishment and Mr Shanmugam Murugesu knew the risk of smuggling them here. It is reasonable to believe he virtually foreseen such consequence if anything went wrong. He took that risk, and now, the house wants to claim. Guess he should have taken the law seriously BEFORE you thought of doing something illegal.<br><br>And, if you're actually one of those self-proclaimed "activist", go study basic political science and law and the reason and principles behind prohibitions in any country. Self-proclaimed activists don't actually know the substance of what they say most of the time - 80% of them (based on research statistics).<br><br>If you just feel sad about Mr Shanmugam Murugesu, don't go on talking about the very foundations of the law of this country.</div>
