            <div class='col-md body'>I just want to make a note , that alot of these policies that dictates our minds are because of politicians , some with thier own agenda. N thus bringing forward and imposing thier laws and regulations worldwide.<br><br>Both sides have thier reasons b beliefs, but maybe we should all look deeper as to WHY these laws were implemented , who and soon u will see the strings slowly connecting the littles pieces. With the internet nowadays , like i said , the information highway , by doing some research yourselves , you will see as to why. By knowing history will u truly know the cause and effect of the decisions made today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With the amount he brought into SG, I highly doubt he wanna use it himself. Most probably wanna sell it to other and make money outta it. It's always the same old story, once get caught, they will say they brougt it in for own consumption.<br><br>oh, btw, he shoulda brought it into the US of A and smoke em. Should be no problem for him though, if the impression I got here is valid.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>
