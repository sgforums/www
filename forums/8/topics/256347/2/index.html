Many states have already legalized it for medicine, and much more is to come.<br><br>This is a bloodstain on Singapore, probably based on ignorance.  Note we are not discussing opium here!  I am sure many of you drink beer and wine but think nothing about doing that.<br><br>It also seems that the fact that two young children begged for their father's life meant nothing to Singapore.  This a horror on top of a horror.<br><br>Fortunately, Mr. Murugesu and Singapore's horrific killing live on in Wikipedia:<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanmugam_Murugesu</div></blockquote>even if its a medicine or natural or non addicting.. and lets say its currently being used in singapore as medicine.. but it does not give the reason for him to possess it.<br><br>singapore laws say possession of drugs is capital punishment. if u wan to carry marijuana u jolly well have a good reason such as selling to pharmacies or u'r the distributer of this drug to distribute to the local hospitals.<br><br>if u allow such case to be an exception, many other lawyers defending future drug smugglers will abuse this case and let say they won, den we will have a veri big problem, that we might as well legalise this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
