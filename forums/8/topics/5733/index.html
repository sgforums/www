            <div class='col-md body'>The alleged girl must had a REALLY big problem with the victim to do all this. Being curious or obsessed about sex won't lead to all these atrocities unless the person has a real mental problem. 14 yr olds doing all this..I wonder what's society coming into. No, don't blame it on education or tv or books or whatever.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess one of the worst things about this case is that we realise that teenagers nowadays actually have such evil thoughts in their mind!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>As compared to those school killings in the States, personally I think this case is much worse! At least those boys committed the killings because of their idolism towards a certain individual... But this case, it's scarier to the extent that these thoughts exist in those KIDS' minds out of the blue! Even if they are curious about sex, this is no way to find out about it. What's more, it is so near us, me especially, when I live in Ang Mo Kio...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well its fu**ing sick that teenagers these days have degraded to such a moral extent. Be it irresponsible parents or magazines or tv it gives no excuse to anybody to commit a crime like this. The bloody fact is that they should be tried as adults and sentenced to prison. At most some of the kids will probably be sentenced to a girls/boys home and given a probation sentence cos of their age. In America the enaction of a new law which allows juveniles to be tried as adults in cases of serious crimes.....<br><br>I think we should be considering a law like that soon. Some people might argue that when they commit the crime, they might not have full understanding of the consequences what not and all but the fact is that kids these days grow up much earlier.<br><br>Imagine the 11 yr old was the one involved in the barbie doll leg incident.....where the hell is the logic in that? an 11 yr old?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So what else is new? If you guys have been reading the papers more or less everyday, every now and then something like that pops up.<br><br>Last year there was this case where a 14 year old was held captive by two girls and three guys. Her captors were aged between 14-16 give or take. She was raped by all three guys while the girls looked on. Later she was freed. And, you know, her assailants were caught and all that.<br><br>Similar cases like the one I have just mentioned have also occurred throughout the past few years. I cannot help noticing them because of their similarities.<br><br>Of course, we all condemn the perpetrators vehemently, but to me the real question is simply why. Why should they do such things?<br><br>Recently there was also this case about an NS man who was slashed to death in Tampines  Mall. It occured outside the E-Zone video arcade. The papers mentioned that a fight broke out because of a staring incident.<br><br>I was not there when the fight broke out, but I was there not long after it had stopped. It was closing time in E-Zone, at around 10.45pm. I and some friends were leaving and there was a big crowd milling around the entrance. In front of the two fire-fighting game machines were three big puddles of blood covering the flood, with lots of smaller drops scattered everywhere around.<br><br>And the blood was not dark red or thick; it was shiny red and liquid. I could not believed that such a thing happened just outside a few minutes ago while I and my pals were happily playing inside! There was someone with blood all over his left leg outside, and a girl had passed out as well. I did not hang around as there was very little else to see.<br><br>Security guards were there, but not the police. The thing is, damn, what the hell is going on? I walked into a clean arcade, and when I came out there was blood at the entrance.<br><br>Why are such things happening? I would like to know. Because if someone does not find out, there is going to be more of this, and such situations will grow more severe as time passes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok it is a very sad case...disgusting at the least and severely evil..if ever there were a term....<br><br>the scary thing is not that bad things happen or are commited by children...the scary thing is that you know that this situation was a thought out process.  It was planned and a prolonged process of torture and humiliation.  When you look at the things that happen overseas, many of the incidences are not preconsidered acts...while this situation was....what goes thru these childrens heads?....<br><br>I dun know...but we cannot blame societty, we cannot blame school, we cannot blaem tv or magazines or America.....<br><br>It has to do with how the children are raised and with what kind of values they were brought up with...and even still some families are very good but the children still turn out screwed up and evil as hell...<br><br>Now the present thinking is that every child is born innocent, but I believe that there are people who are born with the propensity for evil...There have been terrible incidences of children commiting gross crimes against other children and adults and they came from good family backgrounds....<br><br>the only answer is that evil does exist...dun tell me maybe they were curious or didn't know what they were doing...because the fact that they kept her there for 17 days definitely meant that they knew what they were doing...and they tortured her for those 17 days...if there was a glimpse of compasssion or goodness in them, then it would have ended a long time ago....the reason they let her go was probably becasue they were too young and stupid to realise that this girl can report them and they could be punished for it. ...and what's to say that it's strange for it to happen in Singaproe<br>????....It happens because everyone ehre is human with the same impulses as anywehere else...just because we follow a certain principal doesn't mean that some won't break these principals...<br><br>It's a sad case....they should do like in the USA,...try them as adults...and give them the punishment that is due them....25-to 50 years...and 30 strokes of the cane.<br><br>and they didn't just pour hot water on her..they poured it onto her neck and face.!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is jsut a sigh that well finally all the years of bad teaching family abuse (physical and sexual) Is comming out into the open. jsut for starters hear is some food for though where exactly do u think these abusers get these ideas that well firstly abuse is ok, secondly where do they get the ideas to perform such abuse at such a young age??? They must have learnt it somewhere? Trouble is this abuse thing be it physical or sexual is a cycle .<br>cycle starts off with child being abused by an adult or older party of which the abusers are usually their own family members. Child grows up with a wraped view of reality as basically they have ggrown up to learn thats its ok to abuse others it is ok to treat other ppl as objects as they themselves have been treated. Thus they as children never get taught what ius right and what is wrong. behaviour which is edifnately seen as wrong and immoral to society may seem like well nothing of importance just a game which tehy learnt.<br>Societies view of these abused children doesnt help either its eithe SICK or WEIRD or IMMORAL and no one wants to talk about it in the open or deal with it cos ITS TOO SICK blah bblah blah   well im jsut wondering with an attitude like this how exactly is the problem going to be solved if the abused are afraid of being ostracised by the ppl whom they so badly want to share this horrible experience with.<br>Sadely the cycle usually ends with either the abused becomming the abuser as i think is the case with the teenagers, BUT it doesnt have to be that way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The girl is from Chong Boon Secondary School and it seems that she very sia lan in skool too...i agree that this is a veri sick and extreme incident, but for it to happen, she muz haf really pissed off her assailants. Im not saying she deserved it, cos nobody deserves to be treated like that, but it alerts singaporeans to the fact that some pple will often "over-charge" you for ur punishment...so the best is not to fight over little things with people...<br><br>anyway i got the info frm a fren in Chong Boon...u all dun blif u ask pple frm there lor...the whole skool noe liao...<br><br>------------------<br>U ask y shld I trust her? She might break my heart! But isn't the person u love the onli one who has the right to break ur heart...?</div>
