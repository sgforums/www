            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes guys find themselves in the situation where they see this girl who might be their "The One", she might not be model stunning, she might not be babe-ish, but she just has that something about her. And I"m sure girls find themselves in this situation too, except it's trickier for girls since the common protocol is for the guy to do the initial advances.<br><br>Question is, how should guys go about getting to know girls they are interested in but don't know? (Say he sees this girl occasionally in school) Girls, any advice/experience? What to do, say, what NOT to do, say?<br><br>And any girls interested in how we guys would like to be approached?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, here's a girl's opinion.<br><br>Strictly no moronic pick-up lines. Would just make us laugh guys off, like when we read the Last Page of 8 Days. Besides, it reflects badly on your personality.<br><br>Also, I think you should just be yourself. Don't try to act cool or macho when you see the girl around. It may backfire &amp; make you seem superficial instead. Anyway, the girl would also discover who's the real you, when she gets to know you.<br><br>Personally, I like a straightforward approach with perhaps, a short intro of yourself to the girl, a warm smile &amp; a request to be friends.  Everything else can come later after you've got to know one another much better. This way, you can also save yourself from embarrassment or regret.<br><br>Just my POV anyway. Don't know what the other girls here think.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh yes, I would like to hear how guys like to be approached. And btw, what do you pple think about girls who make the 1st move? How widely accepted is that in today's society? Let's hear some of your personal experiences of approaching/being approached by the opp sex here too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorri, Hippoman, having only one gf myself, I am not an expert in approaching girls.  My gf actually approached me when she knew that I was interested in her.  So, I didn't have to do a lot of tremendous hard work. Not to say that I didn't have to do any work.  In fact, her "signals" gave me the encouragement to do some real work.<br><br>To Subterfuge:<br><br>I personally would strongly admire the girl who actually took the initiative in approching the guy she likes (making the 1st move).  I would not think that the girl is cheap or "no class" for being in action first.  Why?  I guess we guys hardly see a lot of girls making the 1st move.  If there is one like that, it would be a like Wow! Yahoo! for the guy - at least that's how I would feel, personally.<br><br>How widely accepted is it in today society? Hmmmm! I really don't know the answer to it. Maybe some guys would say "Wow, that's great!" "This could save us a lot blood and sweat."  Maybe some would say "Neh! I don't like this." "I like doing the challenge of doing the real hard chase"<br><br>My personal experience is that I have been going after a lot of girls before I came to know my gf.  Most of them don't give signals whether they like me or not.  So, there is really no encouragement for me to do a lot of work in going after them.  I guess I am not a real risk taker in bgr anyway.<br><br>For my gf case, before she really knew me, she gave me some signals that she is interested in me.  So I knew there is a 50% chance already.  The other 50% rests on how I do my homework in prsenting how much I like her (my sincerity) and creating a good impression (not faking or anything; just honesty) of myself when going out with her.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While I would like a girl to approach me if she likes me, I think I would prefer the indirect approach where she could drop you a hint that she is interested. Kinda like giving you the green light. That would be very helpful. I don't mind doing all the hard work of chasing, just that I don't like testing the waters  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And how to approach a girl? Ermmmmm... wouldn't know how to... otherwise I think I just may have made friends with a girl of my dreams I saw earlier at starbucks WTC  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But I think prolly the direct approach of introing yourself to her and maybe give her a namecard or number... If she's interested too, then great! If not... too bad loh!<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U know...I keep reading and hearing about never using such idiotic poick-up lines as "Have we met somewhere before?"...or "Do we know each other?".....<br><br>...but you know what?  I use them a lot...maybe that's why I crash and burn so often...But the thing is, I never mean them as pickup lines...When I ask girls that I just met thru friends or intro, I ask out of sincerity...Basically because I go out often and see a lot of people so I somehow recognise them from somewhere...Also my mind is slow to remember  faces so I ask just in case I knew them from some place else...It's really innocent, but from what I hear so often, it's probably taken as a cheap pick-up line....<br><br>By george!  CAn't a guy just ask something simple without it being some kind of pick-up line?<br><br>Would love it if a girl does the work and approaches..Don't care whether it's subtle or not, as long as I'm attracted to her.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the first thing is that whether the girl has a good impression of you. After that, you just have to be yourself when approaching her, no pick-up lines or trying to be cheeky, it's a real turn-off. I tried that once and the result is like going for a bungee jump without a cord. Don't know why, the words just came out. I was probably too excited about the whole thing and I blew it. I think composure and confidence are the keys to success.<br><br>As for going after a guy, I guess the commonly accepted view is that girls drop hints and guys will do the rest, like what ECK had mentioned. But it all depends on the person ultimately, some guys would like an aggressive girl while most would prefer a demure one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well yeah, but would a girl really take a guy seriously if he, a stranger, approached her and wanted to be frens? I would think that unless the girl herself is kinda socialble she wouldn't be so receptive to any approach.<br>I guess it's the same for guys. Or at least for me. I don't take girls who approach me seriously, esp girls who I don't know very well and come across as oh so friendly like I"m their bosom buddy. Tend to see them as buayees. But I think things could change, impressions could be altered once you know the person better.<br><br>I once was in this situation where two girls approached me and my fren at starbucks and after chatting for a while, my fren's "have I seen you somewhere b4" really worked cuz he really did see them at boat quay once and one of the girls saw him too so that was fine. But I couldn't really be bothered to keep in contact with them, simply cuz it felt more like a pick up than a sincere wanting to be frens. And they found me kinda tao... bah... girls.... anyhow, I think sometimes, if you really think you sorta know some person from somewhere, just try your luck, eh firewire?<br><br>I think meeting someone special can come about these few ways...<br><br>1) you meet someone thru your activities, like eca, school, class, lecture groups.<br><br>2) you meet someone thru frens.<br><br>3) you see someone outside and make frens.<br><br>problem is, I'm sure (1) and (2) hits a certain limit at some pt and you just know there's noone special in your immediate social circle, so it's left to (3). And that's where all the grey areas come in. Like what would have happened if ECK had made frens with the girl at starbucks WTC? would she turn out to be someone special?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>responding to the last post.<br><br>your point number 3.<br><br>very plausible.  i have known friends/couples who met that way, and are or on their way to get married.<br><br>a good friend of mine just happened to like to take photographs, took a snapshot of this girl when she was performing on stage.  he came back the next day and gave her the photo.  pen pal-ing came next, and they shld be getting married within the yr (5 yr relationship).<br><br>like the old SDU slogan...its just an introduction, the rest is up to you. : )</div>
