            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, this is in response to H20's qn, so insted of just telling only him, i hope that more people would get to know bout my views through my own meandering experience. I was once a smoker, actually i've started smoking during the days when cigarettes cost $1.90 a a pack...far cry from the $3.10 that it costs these days. Anyway there was a moment when i managed to quit, but only for the sake of my girlfriend. She thoroughly hated smokers and the smell etc...but my abstinace only lasted for bout a year before i started getting back to my old ways...even doing it behing her back, it was very bad of me and i felt guilty. It became worse when i went to the army coz most of my army mates smoked and it was even more difficult to stop.  It was not until when i was going to ORD that i really felt that it was time to stop, once and for all, not only that i "finally" realised that it is "killing" me slowly bit by bit but the price is really too steep to be considered a "relaxing" hobby. It wasnt easy i tell u, everyday i had to endure runny nose, the terrible feeling of not being able to smoke after my every meal, the torture of not feeling my beloved stick in between my fingers.....BUT it was WORTH it as i finally made it and i'm proud to announce that i've been clean for about two months now and still going on strong. This time i know that its gonna be different from the last, coz i'm doing it not for anybody else but myself...so to all the smokers who are trying real hard to quit...hang in there and u'll make it. Never do it for anyone but YOURSELF coz only U LOVE yourself most!</div>
