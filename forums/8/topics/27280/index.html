            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting.....anyone has something to say???<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is taken fr The Straits Times Interactive Chat</span><br><span style="color: red;">Fr a Lady's Pt of View <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">FINANCIAL planner Sofia Lim, 37, wants to tell the world that she is single, very available and wants to get hitched.</span><br><br>ThatÂ’s precisely what you donÂ’t do Â– scrawl it loudly on your forehead - in 'numbers too big too ignore' - like a shameless desperado. Ugh! ThatÂ’s exactly how you chase them away shuddering in cold sweat. Brazen, thick-skinned people donÂ’t get very far.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the hunt for Mr Right, she has joined the Social Development Unit (SDU), which is the Government's matchmaking agency, signed up with a commercial matchmaking agency and even consulted six fortune tellers.</span><br><br>Sorry darlinÂ’. No-one can help you if you canÂ’t figure out the Â‘desirabilityÂ’ factor for yourself - you can start by not being brazen. And it doesnÂ’t necessarily come from being 20-something, wearing Chanel or even having lots of money. You can be in your 30s or 40s or even in your 80s and still be youthful, desirable and attractive. It comes from within.<br><br>Like decent men, decent women are a rare commodity. The key to finding that elusive Â‘Mr RightÂ’ is to first BE Â‘RightÂ’ yourself. It starts with you Â– thatÂ’s something you can control. The rest will follow naturally. And you donÂ’t have to be Miss World to be found Â‘attractiveÂ’[although it sometimes helpsÂ…]. As the hackneyed saying goes, beauty is only skin deep Â– and the day you Â‘discoverÂ’ your Â‘innerÂ’ beauty is the day you stop fretting and panicking over Â‘Mr RightÂ’ and learn to relax in the knowledge that youÂ’re a complete entity - with or without a male counterpart.<br><br>If you canÂ’t even look yourself in the mirror and like what you see [just because youÂ’re over 25] how in tarnation can you expect someone else to like you Â– let alone fall in lurve? Is it fair to impose such a Â‘selfÂ’ on another? At the end of the day, finding the right mate is really a Â‘winningÂ’ game Â– and no-one with a Â‘loserÂ’ mentality should participate. Nor is it a charity business Â‘oh pleeease, Mr pleaseÂ…Â” Yuck. ItÂ’s about giving, isn't it? What have you got to give?? You single ladies should just take a step back and look at yourselves sometimes Â– and laugh! [That too, is attractive Â–having a sense of humour].<br><br>Admit it or no, the ball is in your court. So play it like a champion, or a mouse-mat - itÂ’s entirely up to you. ItÂ’s never too late to make things happen Â– donÂ’t let anyone deceive you or destroy your confidence. Not even that dastardly ST article.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Fr a Gentleman's Pt of View <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br>What about the men???<br><br>I think it is pathetic that STIC keeps featuring issues on single women in Singapore. What about the men?? Why don't just feature on singles over thirty?? Or is this the usual style of journal sensationalism to boost readership??<br><br>Aw come on, women are generally smarter than men. A Singapore woman will not marry a man for looks. But a Singapore man will marry a beauty with no brains.<br><br>And to say that they want to get married because they have sexual needs too, makes me laugh. Some of the 30+ single ladies, I know, who are enjoying their single life tremendously, say marriage will only mean that they are restricted to one toy from the toy store. They, like us men, love to have alot of toys too! </span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
