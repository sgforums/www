Those who say otherwise or would make you believe otherwise work for someone else...not God....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hihi,<br>wow... a religious topic Â¬.Â¬<br>hmm.. just wanna clear up some misconceptions.. which is about Buddhism.<br><br>"But in essence they all said the same thing - that there is one God and that we are all part of him." --&gt; this is not the concept of Buddhism. Buddhism doesn't say about this sentence at all. What Buddha has been teaching us is how to break through the misery of Samsara cycle. All are about universal Law. I guess you have some misconceptions over there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .<br><br>hmm.. a few more things that I wanna point out..<br>"People take God out of man and put him up in an imaginary heaven, where he is of no use to anyone." Well, in Buddhism (not Taoism or Confusianism).. Buddha is just a teacher who taught his students about how to break through from misery of life, how to stop Dukkha (misery) from repeating. The students "worship" Him as a teacher.. not as a "super-God".<br><br>"Yet Buddha never founded Buddhism." --&gt; true, Buddha never founded Buddhism, as what he had said that what he taught his students all the time are just dharma that he observed. All the phenomenon are around us. What he was trying to do was just to explain the phenomenons to every of the students. Or we can say that, he discovered that there are phenomenons. Not that he created them.<br><br>"where one person is led to believe he is saved and another is damned, or where it leads a person to think that true happiness will be found only in an afterlife,"<br>I dunno which religion you are referring to, but well.. in Buddhism, Buddha has never forced any of us to follow His path. What he did was as a teacher, he showed us the middle path, that is one of the available options. Which means, even if you are not a BUddhist and you do care about other people, you won't be "damned"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> . Same as even if you are a Buddhist, and you still do bad things, you won't be "saved" (just using your words). True happiness afterlife?<br>Depends. If what you do in this life are those unforgivable crimes or sins, do you think you will be happy afterwards? Well. in Buddhism, what you have done will eventually come back to you. You murder someone, one day the "karma" will come back and look for you.<br><br>Hmm.. just a few ideas from me, so that less misleading part from your words. Other stuffs seem to concern more on other religions, which is not up to me to cricitise or comment on.<br><br>Anyway.. I am a Buddhist  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (previously Catholic).. and I am happy to be one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.<br><br>------------------<br>"When you looked into my eyes, and you said goodbye, could you see my tears? Did you hear me say I'd wait for all the dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky, you promised me when you said goodbye, that you'd return when the storm was done, and now I'll wait for the sun to appear...."

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for clearing up the misunderstanding <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> . Well...  I kinda in the same boat as yours, I was in a different religion before I converted to Buddhism .. well.. every religion has its own way of doing stuffs.. You can imagine a river flowing down from top of mountain, going towards the sea.. Along the path, certainly there will be rocks and stones that will block the way, which will cause the flow to split to more than one. For me, I treat religions same as how this thingie works. Every religion may say different stuffs, but what they want from us is actually the same. Love, care and harmony in life. Same as different paths of river flow, all are heading towards the sea.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just one small comment of last idea of yours.. I dun really know why you take stuffs that you agree from one religion and takes another from other religion. Well.. maybe this is just a thought of mine.. but since if you wanna try something like that, doesn't it mean that you have your own ideas and beliefs? well.. that's maybe also the point you are trying to make from this topic. I was sorta a person who really went to question my previous religion on some ideas which don't really match on my ideas. But well.. after I converted, I realised that instead of forcing myself to look at the differences of ideas, wouldn't it better if we look at the common points? Religions may not be perfect due to the corrupted or misled followers.. but still.. the essence remains there for us to hold to.<br><br>Anyway.. just another idea from the rains. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>hope rain brings peace. (Rainboy,1999) --&gt; due to rainy days.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"When you looked into my eyes, and you said goodbye, could you see my tears?

            <div class='col-md body'>Asure : Very impressive of your forum about what people believe in.<br><br>Well indeed that No man is ever so perfect. But keep in mind that Christians aren't perfect as well. But they do try to keep their souls clean.<br><br>Alright , first , Christianity means having a relationship with God. It is not a religion because christians communicate with God via tongues and prayers. It is God's desires that he wants to have a communion with us. But probably most people don't trust God and rather in themselves.<br><br>Second, sure God doesn't want to Condemn ALL Man to Hell which is the place for Satan to be. But He is righteous and holy. He must therefore judge people. But don't get me wrong. He is against the sins that we have. And i think we aren't ready to trust God to free us from our sins &lt; as long we have no faith in him ^^&gt;<br><br>I suppose that Asure, you are talking pretty much on your belief . Well, it is very likely that there are religions set to let people to carry on with life &lt; different people have different roles &gt;. Religion or not, i call that simply a belief.<br><br>Well i m sure that Love and Peace is the thing that can lead to a prosperous life. That's for some religions i m sure some people talk about. However, God goes deeper by wanting to have a communion with you. Yes, God sets the 10 commandments and all of the ten commandments is about loving not just God, but the people around you. The first 4 are clearly to love God. The next 6 are for people.  Put to short, God loves you. and also wants you to Love him and Love his people.<br><br>That's all the small talk i have for now.  Yes i m a christian . And i want to make sure i stay one.  I do hope that God takes all Man of all generation and change them.<br>&lt; Note : Actually i'm typical of a crude person. having to silence any people of my mind. &gt;<br><br>If you don't even have hope, how can you survive ?! : AraCalypse<br></div>
