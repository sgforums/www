              <p>Thanks <a href="../../../users/148671">Evangel,</a></p>
              <p>                       Private Investigator are a Professional job. We are assigned by clients to check on their spouses, employee or children.</p>
              <p>                      Those people who say pi are just following people are they don't know what a real pi does.</p>
              <p>                     We also conduct counter surveillace, infiltration, undercover, computer forencis and many other things. However, we don't do anything that is against the laws. At times we also do email or ip address tracing on those who caused nusiance or harrassmen to other by computer.</p>
              <p>                  We only conduct surveillance does not intrude into any private property. </p>
              <p>               Some of those people who have misconception about pi cos they deal with either unlicensed investigator or they themselves have been 'caught with their pants down' .</p>
              <p>               Anyone can be a peeping tom or follow another person, but to conduct surevillance(art of following someone without letting the person know) it take professional training. Most of my guys are ex-police investigators who had undergo some profesional training when they were police force. However, unforunately there ar a few bad apples in the pi industy are just out to ern money and they get any tom, dick or harry to do the job.</p>
              <p>            There is another myth that coming to the pi will destroy a relationship or marriage after the truth is know. Howeveru will be surprised that many relationship and marriage were saved after the truth is known.</p>
              <p>         Any else?</p>

              <p>Hi smart4, working as a pi and getting a license i a totally different thing. </p>
              <p>To get a license there are many requirement involve. However, as far as I know, the person have to have at least 3 year basic investigator in the uniform group in the goverment service. However, to be a pi anyone can if they are above 16 years old with no criminal records. But not evryone succeed to be successful.</p>
              <p>I can proudly say that I have the confidence to go anywhere in the world to do investigation because of the contacts I have from my police days.</p>
              <p>Although it not a must an it a different working environment, however, ex-police officer are prefered as they know the basic laws as it's a very fine line between legal or illegal. And in term of going to court cases,  which every pi have to go through, ex-police have the edge. However, no all police officers are the same, some of them are not as street smart and don't have much experience.  There are many kind of cases that are invloved also which pi are engaged to solve, for example mischief, theft and sometime ligation services, which many a times a normal police man will come across and they will know how to collect the evidence. The last reasons why ex-police are prefered cos they know their right better and are able to get themselves out of confrontation situation better.</p>
              <p>Those are just my opinion. However, it's alway good to train someone who totaly don't have an experince. I personally have trained many who are not ex-police as it's also let me learn some new trick from them.</p>
              <p>Hi lorry, generally there are more male then female pi. However, female pi are better cos they will not be easily spotted.</p>
              <p>Hi  melbournite, maybe to correct you. It does not mean by joining civil services, they will get the chance to do what a pi do. Cos unless you are posted to some specialist unit then you will be able to do investigations and sometime it take many years to be able to be posted to the specialist unit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>hi Melbournit, it seem you are taking it very personally. Maybe u have been 'caught' by your wife who is very 'rich' with your pants down. Haha</p>
              <p> I am not yaya. I am only stating the fact. Maybe there are certain things which you don't know so just shut up. Don't act like big brother here. Everyone have their right to write what they want.</p>
              <p>You like, you can simple open your new topics.</p>
              <p>Whether i am from the civil service of not, it XXXXing not your business. So shut up.</p>
