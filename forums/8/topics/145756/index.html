Not all Indian men like chinese woman. They can only admire but to them their first choice will be an Indian girl , that is if they can get according to their preference. And the real reason why those Indian men go for chinese women is not beauty or wadver crap. it is because of money. Those women may have some advantages over indian women when it comes to connections, people or workforce. Did u ever notice that chinese women those indian men marry are most of them not good looking. Either short, fat or ugly. Do u think Indian men who that dumb? There is always a catch. There will be loads of beautiful Indian women from North India who will be willing to marry a Singapore Indian men just like how u chinese men want vietnam or china brides.<br><br>Franky speaking those Indian girls in Singapore has attitude problems. Too any of them.</div>

The stamping our of Graeco-Roman mythology by the Judeo-Christians only served to lower the status of women later on.
