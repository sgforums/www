            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa:<br><br>That's a very nice poem you wrote.  I wish I am creative enough to write poem occasionally to romaticize my future wife.  This would prevent her from complaining to me that I am unromatic.  HAHA!<br><br>Do I believce in fate?  Hmmm!  Yes or no!  I once consulted a fortune teller.  These are what he told me, and how true?  You be the judge.<br><br>He told me that I should go through three gfs before I get married.  He told me if I met all of them, they would have the following charaterictics. One of them would have bigger than average eyes feature.  The second one would have a deep scar on her arm or leg.  The third one would be a professional and very financially independece.  If I only have one gf and married without going through three gfs, a divorce would likely to happen to me when I reach my middle age.<br><br>Two years later after I consulted the fortune teller, it was true that the girl that I met (my future wife) has bigger than average eyes.  So, is this fate?<br><br>But I know that the fortunr teller is accurate as he metioned one of them would have bigger than average eyes.  No,<br>I did not deliberately went looking for large eyes looking girls to self-fulfill prophecies.  It just happened that the girl that I love has got large eyes.  She is also my first and last gf, as we are planning to get married.  She has most of the things that I want in a wife.<br><br>However, according to the fortune teller, I was supposed to go through three gfs.  But once in a while, in my mind thinking, "Yeah right! Screw that fortune teller!  I have control of own destiny"  But I am still a little nervy about what he said might come true.  If he is already accurate about what one of my gfs should be, how accurate are the rests?  This is the question that has been pondering in my mind.<br><br>My future wife and I have come this far in terms of preparing for our future; and I really hope that what he said would never ever come true.  Try imagine going trough a divorce; have to sell virtually everything to split the $$$ between the two; and kids without father and mother together.  How am I gonna start all over again if I am left with nothing in my forties?  I would be emotionally and financially devastated.<br><br>I hope fate is not everything!</div>

I have freinds who think he has loved but as the time goes by the feeling decayed. Infatuation or love?? How to tell the difference?<br><br>Infatuation is something which attracts u physically ( maybe lustfully) and I can tell u for sure , it NEVER LASTS. I know ppl always look for pretty gals but tell you the truth, once u get her, u will have nightmares that a better guy will be snatched away especially if you think u dun have the attribute to keep her.<br><br>Love is what i have described in the poem. Eternally will be our special kind of thing...It is ETERNAL..<br>It is something when u have it you know you will not want to lose it ever. It is sad to know when you found some one that u want to spend the rest of your life with, she/he did not share the same vision as u.<br><br>Fate and destiny...I am a total believer..what is yours is your. There is not need to vie, to pine, to wait...cos one day if something that is your it is always yours...<br><br>If you are able to see the unborn childeren in her eyes guys, you know you have found her..<br>Best of luck<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>
