            <div class='col-md body'>Oh my, it seems that u have regualrs at this thread Rinoa...<br><br>I know that nobody asked me, but I want to say that I don't believe in fate...  maybe I've felt at two points before that it must have been fate because it feels so right....more right than anything that I've ever felt before or after...and it's that feeling that u just know...and u wonder if u hadn't come to class on that day, would she have been there?  Or if u hadn't come in early for one in ur life to class, u wouldn't have met her....WEll, that's how I felt..and I tell u that the feeling is so pure...cannot describe what i mean by that.  It just felt pure...even my command of the engrish language cannot use the words properly to phrase it.<br><br>twice already that this has happened.  and i can still remmeber how it feels even now...*sigh*<br><br>I'm the kind of idiot that can't ever forget how I used to feel for someone...*sigh*<br><br>Suffice to say that no matter how right they felt, and how deep the connection, we broke off anyway...eventually...1 is still a good friend.  the other hates my guts...why I don't know, she's the one that hurt me...???<br><br>So yeah, I don't believe it.  When u meet someone that u feel is the right person, the whole idea of fate comes into play...how else do u explain such a wonderful thing happening to you?  You just can't explain it!!!:-)<br><br>That's what fate is...an unexplainable event when u feel that there just is no other way of explaining it...<br><br>I can't explain it.  Can anyone?  Must be fate....Goddarnitt!!!I seemed to have argued that i believe in fate....How in the world did I do that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ryuu<br>Yes this poem is actually a song composed by Taro Iwashiro ( i mean the music)...If you have seen the drama "With Love".This is actually the soundtrack.My ex-bf who is a Jap happened to know this compoase whenn he came to SG.And at that time I was actually there to see him and talk about his works. SO he just roughly told us about the Jap drama he is in charge to compose a soundtrack. At that time, when he told us about how the whole drama is about. I have the inspiration to write this poem and I showed it to him and he feel that the poem is indeed very suitable for the contents of the soundtrack...(Of cos they did change here and there to make sure the music suits the lyrics).<br>Although my name is not being shown anyway, cos it is part friend's help and "advertising" my works but it sure feels great when someone noticed it. The singer is a male tenor. Thanks!Obviously that Jap drama became my fav!And the very first place this is actually a poem.<br><br>Fire:<br>Fate is something that u feel it is, of cos u are in control of your own life. And i believe you are the predecessor of your own life,thoughts and feelings too...<br>I believe if you want to get what u want, you gotta fight for it!Lead and not lead and u will truimph...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firewire, I think I have the same fundamental idea of fate as you. Like you said, fate is just what we can't explain, and in my  view thats just about everything there is to be, so maybe its pointless to give it a quality that it doesn't deserve/ deliver.<br><br>I think everything is fated, it just depends on whether you have good or bad luck. It seems however, that when people talk about fate they refer it to a good event that has happened e.g. taking a wrong bus and getting to know someone because of that. Sure, its something not planned and a good thing came out of it. But honestly, can we really plan for anything at all?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liny,<br>Thanks for your compliments!I know ppl in SG are more commercialised and pratical and that is why I really admire ppl who really go all out to do what they want, not considering the monetary side of it.It is definately not easy to come long this way.I fight to come here to fulfil my dream.My parents was so angry but I was determined to pursue what I want cos I dun want to hace regrets when i am old.But the funny thing is I dun see myself to be a successful psychologist where ppl hold me in high regard but actually I would rather be a successful homemaker where at the same time i can be of service of ppl in maybe in a volunteering sector,using my real professional expertise.A toast to u and to ppl out there realising their dream...<br>Cheers!!<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

That would be making the thing happen.
