They're fun people. Americans are cool as long as they aren't too into the "we're better than u lot" mentality or as long as they voted democrats. French are nice people. If u try speaking in French but u obviously don't know French; they like people making the effort but some places are warm n friendly even if you don't do that.</div>

In my line of work, I meet quite a number of angmohs and Australians take the cake.<br><br>1. - Australians in Singapore:  They look down on Asians, are cunning, loud, make sarcastic remarks, rude and are basically bastards.<br>- Australians in Australia: same as above<br><br>2. - French in Singapore: polite and soft spoken<br>- French in France: jumping queue is the norm, quite snobbish<br><br>3. - English in Singapore: friendly, humourous, treats you like everyone else<br>- English in London: same as above<br>[b](my personal favourite of the lot)</strong><br><br>4. - Swiss in Singapore: Haven't met any<br>- Swiss in Switzerland: quiet, keep to themselves<br><br>5. - Spanish in Singapore: friendly, chatty<br>- Spanish in Spain: Haven't been there<br><br>But of course what I mentioned above doesn't mean all of them are like that. They're from my own experience. What about you guys? Any experiences to share?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>In mye experience, Australians are the most friendliest bunch of angmohs compared to the ones in the Western Region. When i was in australia, wherever we go, Aussies would smile and wish us good day.<br><br>I don't mean to be racist here, but when u say Australians look down on Asians, i think it is more that Australians look down to the chinese. Because i have indian and Malay close friends, but so far, they have been praising australians. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
