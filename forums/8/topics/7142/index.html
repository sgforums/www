He rested keano n stam.What do you think?Haiz thats why , its not good at all for english football when the championship was decided with 4games to go.U can only blame the lack of competition and ambition in the rest of the teams who were more interested in the battle for european league places.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> CheeriOs~<br><br>------------------<br>mAke luRvE`~ not wAR..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another one? Jeez...don't you guys ever let up a little?<br><br>kudos to devilac, no matter the result, everyone gives United stick. Ridiculous, huh?<br><br>"ManUre had to resort to [sic] unhanded means to unsettle their opponents to win the game"??? Um, as far as the reaply showed, both players had a fight, and I hardly think that getting a man sent off can be considered a tactic in any managers' eyes. Unless, of course, you're watching on a different planet.<br><br>"many will have to admit that the turning point for the match was the sending off. if not ManUre would have lost. but i am sure the bunch of brats will not want to lose and had to resort to such a tactic." --- you don't really know much about football, do you? Name-calling is a sure sign of immaturity...<br><br>*sigh* Hate to have to be so critical in my first few posts, but I think that some of you are just really anti-United because everyone else seems to be as well. IF you really want to hate United, at least have a GOOD REASON. "Arrogant looking players", by the way, is NOT a good reason.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The most honest player i have seen is Robbie Fowler who actually tried to talk the Referee from giving a penalty to the Liverpol side because he felt that the Arsenal player (i think Adams) did not touch him. That is what i call sportsmanship.<br><br>i cannot imagine any Man U brats doing that.<br><br>just to recap in case you have an ants memory<br><br>"<br>As for the players, all of them are assholes just like the fans.<br><br>I was laughing when i saw that David Beckham was doing when he was only tripped by Campo and he made a meal out of the tackle, pretending to be injure. Wah C,mon lah, just because you are a loser who got sent off play Simone play acting in the world cup doesn't mean now you must use that tactic to get your opponent players into trouble. if you want to act, brush up your skills first lah. It's not the first time since he did it. Remember he got another player sent off for Bordeaux?<br><br>As for Keane the ass, he always think he is the BIGGEST player on the pitch. He always ARGUE with referee and not even THREATEN the referee. And he is the dirtiest player on the pitch. He always make blatant fouls and expect to get away scotch free and yet the IRONICAL thing is that he lose his temper when his opponents foul him. AHAHAHAH&gt; if you can foul people still expect people to be nice to you ar? Use your big bald head to Think lah.<br><br>For Gary Neville, don't be fooled by his innonence face, he is the one who cheats most on the field. He has all kind sof tricks up his sleeve when he take on attackers like pulling their shirt, tripping them, pushing them....ugh anything you can think of he will do. But too bad, there is nothing you can hide from the TV and we all saw that.<br>"<br><br>how true but sad they are the champions.<br></div>
