            <div class='col-md body'>well , just in case u do not know , recruitment consultants are also doing sales indirectly. Whatever jobs they are offering you are jobs that they have. They are not exactly matching you to the kind of jobs you like or jobs you are suitable for.<br><br>Anyway for sales job requiring basic , you need to hit a min quota before you qualify for commission. The higher ya basic , the higher your quota..u shld noe</div>

Many people do not even dare think about it, and let alone quit what they are doing.<br><br>sales got basic + com, and pure com, pure basic (rare).<br>For beginner with zero experience and zero savings, better to get basic + com.<br><br>Previous post I read basic very low, or must hit certain quota before you'll get com.... those are just different permulations. It would be best to discuss with the company you're interested to work with.<br><br>And Sheri, you are right. In fact you are quite fortunate. 3-4% increment rate (not taking into account bonus) is actually relatively good increment liaozzz.<br><br>Generally, if you wanna earn more money, either start a business or do well in trading. For the rest of us, it will be going into sales.<br><br>My ex-collegue in a local back earns avg $12K monthly. She's doing credit facilities sales by calling. Her basic is $2.6K.<br><br>Another ex-ex-collegue in a foreign back, doing credit card sales, is getting an average of $6-7K. They're both in their mid-twenties.<br><br>However I too have a friend in recruit express, (help people find job) who is only getting $3k monthly. Her basic is $1.8K<br><br>To comment on your question on whether a big or small company, I would say depends on the company about how they value their employees. Do they send you for external courses or trainings? What is the promotional aspects like. Generally, a larger company will have better funding for this type of things.<br><br>Big ones dun necessary have super high targets. My friend in Siemens only need to do 2 sales a year. (They sell industry motors, a few millions for 1).<br><br>As for stress due to targets, I can only say a company wun set a target such that their people would not be able to hit it. If people are hitting their targets consistantly and only one is not, then the problem lies with that person.<br><br>As for stress due to teamwork, I can only say stress exists whether in teamwork or as an individual. I'm sure you understand.<br><br>2 cents.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem, is getting accepted into the recruitment agency.<br><br>Once you are in, it does not matter if its a small or big agency.<br><br>a big agency merely means you will have a wider client base, but you still need to try to maintain that base and keep satisfying your customers.<br><br>Big agency also means a bigger wider choices of candidates you can use to satisfy your customer.<br><br>With better budgets for road shows, co-ordinating events and liasing, controlling huge numbers of people.<br><br>Small agencies has the benefit of being able to focus on some customers and keeping them happy.  You might have the opportunity to go overseas to recruit as well as to train those people that you recruit for your customers.<br><br>Individual agencies has individual paying structure.  And until you are established with consistent contacts/ customers.  You are safest to acquire a job that pays a basic and then commissions when you starts to close cases.</div>
