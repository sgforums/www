            <div class='col-md body'>Ok this is the situation here...<br><br>I feel my schooling friends has no morales. They think they're right in everything. I mean they're rude to almost everyone. Be it a lecturer or anyone.<br><br>I feel they have very fuck up pride but they're the only ones in school who can talk to me cause I am normally quite a quiet guy in class.<br><br>I do have some other friends who is ok with me in school but they are in different class. It's hard for me to totally leave these classmate of mine. What should I do?<br><br>I try to further myself away from them as I really feel they are nuisance. Actually, I feel I have a different mindset from them. I do not want to have the image of being guy with no morales. I mean I don't discriminate people just because they're ugly but these friends of mine do even though they are not any nice looking themselves. They are very hypocritical too.<br><br>Should I leave them immediately or slowly drift away from them?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe this is what you find when you get friends in a group. They tend to clique together and disregard the rest of the world's existence. What you can do is maybe talk individually to each of them and see if there is any way for them to tone down their actions? Friends being friends, if a friend of mine has a fault, I would definitely tell it to him, but more often than not, in the most diplomatic and non-obvious manner. You have to consider their pride in this case, and secondly, I do mean individual approach, not group approach, approach them in a group you will more likely than not get mocked at. Correct me if I'm wrong......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

I am not here to denouce them but I wish to help "B" more than "A" as all along "B" had been a nice friend who used to have morales. Now, he's really like way too proud. I feel lost, don't really know what to do. Leave him and let him rot with "A"? Try to spend more time with "B"? (Damn, am I trying to do too much as a friend?) Don't know whether to be selfish or not but I am pretty sure "B" is going to become one stuck up jerk one day if he sticks too much with "A".<br><br>Life's confusing....<br></div>

Go up to B and have a heart to heart talk with him. Tell him how sad you feel now for him, tell him that although you are not in the position to tell him much, you really hope that he would change for the better. Open his eyes so that he can see that he has indeed changed for the worse. You owe it to yourself as a person, and owe it to him as a pal, to pour out what is in your heart to him. He might react to it receptively, he might shrug it off as pure nonsense, that will depend on how convincing you are and how receptive he is. But trust me, if you care for this friend, whatever comes out from the heart would be genuine and touch the heart of others. I don't know, I treasure friends a lot, and if someday I do indeed go haywire, I will also want a good pal of mine to come up to me and tell me what I have done wrong. Remember this, apart from people related to you by blood and people attached to you, the closest people will be those who are your friends. Do tell him and see how it goes. And remember, speak from the heart for sincerity will definitely touch the heart of others......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

And do talk to your friend one last time, make it a real heart to heart talk instead of a nagging/chiding talk.
