            <div class='col-md body'>personally, i think NS is crap. i just recently ORD and couldn't be happier. if you've been inside, or are still inside, you'll see the dark side, the ill-treatment, the exploitation and the cover ups. one thing i always said to my dad when i was in there was that we are all badly exploited. and it isn't illegal to do so because the government didn't make it illegal. now you know why we have no minimum wage act.<br><br>i always tell my friends though, you will not know what stupid is until you go into the army. guess those of you who have served will know what i mean. the saf is an orginzation of mainly losers, people who can't find a decent job on the outside and so choose to hide there. in my entire life, i've only met a handful or truly patriotic soldiers, one of whom i'm proud to have served under. can't say that for plenty of others.<br><br>as for the main topic of this thread. the answer is no. before i went in, i was still hanging on to this frail impression that out defence system could protect us. now, maybe i've seen too much, maybe not enough, but my trust in this is completely shattered. what can be done for nsfs? i have no idea...its not my problem anw...yes, that may sound selfish, but thats what u learn in the army...fend for urself first...others later....</div>

Overrun by Germany in both World Wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following year.
