It shows that crippling Singapore is very easy. Therefore, what is the need for NS? Whats the point of defending something that is undefendable? The greatest reward for Sg males will be to abolish the NS system! I even quoted the example of Luxembourg in my earlier posts in this thread. Now did I veer off from the topic?? [b]<span style="color: red;">Well you can argue that the topic is looking for a Yes No answer but if you are that shallow and a NUTS person, then perhaps you can get some world-class Sg education and then maybe there is a 0.000001% chance that you will have a deeper and broader mind.</span></strong><br><br>Anyway, it will be endless and pointless to argue with you. Don't like what I write?<br><br>Don't read loh.  Or do you need to get a PhD from Singapore's world class universities to understand your personal right? Of course, just in case you don't understand, it is also your right to choose to reply or not reply to this post.[/b]</blockquote>Cindyfeh..<br>I assure you..<br>Singaporeans are not terrorised by your plans.<br>We but amused...<br>It is intresting that you can come up with such plans..<br>But what i am argueing here is that the destruction of reservoirs is not the matter of concern here.<br>I believe that no terrorist organisation will gamble with messing with one the most advance armies in Asia<br>The SAF has attained such a reputation.<br>This is already a contribution in a way to Singapore<br><br>The need for NS is to counter the threats that may arise.<br>We do not need NS as a formality<br>We need it as a necessity..<br>The SAF in all it's glory is only 800 000 strong<br>National Service is to add to this number<br>We may not be able to prevent threats<br>But i am sure the SAF has trained our soldiers to control and contain them<br><br>As said by Charles Darwin: Survival is not determined by strength..it is determined by the speed of reaction to a change..<br><br>This is exactly what the SAF is training to be.. .<br><br>NS may not be entirely desired or favoured..<br>But it still is one more step in ensureing Singapore's security<br></div>
