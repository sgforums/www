Your initial statement did not contain any coherent argument, but was rather a personal attack in the first place. In what way did i attack you personally? In your first statement, you already made the fallacy of Straw Man, and i merely followed up based on that specfic action. However, your attack was directed without justification. Unlike you, i did not use any crude language in reference to you, your actions or your character. Use of vulgarities do not help to prove your cause, in case you are not aware. Also, In what ways have you seen the world more than me? I would like to see your counter argument.</div>
