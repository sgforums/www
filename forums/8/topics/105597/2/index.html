            <div class='col-md body'>Let me relate one story..<br><br>I attended one education seminar few days ago. The  principal of the accelerated learning school, who organised the seminar, do joint research with one nationally known professor, on the subconcious mind, education ,creativity and so on..By the way this is in Aust ,and the principal an Australian Chinese..<br><br>He said the education system in aust is no much diff from sg, whereas sg eudcation system is a pressure cooker system, but both still assess students by marks and grades and so on..<br><br>The deans of education and uni profs there are now coming up with education policies and framework to move the nation towards the creative mindset, and thought of many creative learning programs..they also discuss flaws of the education system,<br><br>I cant say exactly what they came out with, but the guy noted one lady, and experienced educator herself, after looking at all these, exclaimed during the meeting.."Sometimes, I feel we are responsible for our children's failures"<br><br>She was right to say, its the society which mould our kids of today. They have luxuries, because we worked hard and give it to them. But if they cant appreciate it, its because we didnt teach them how.<br><br>Not to mention, how to learn graciousness or appreciation or even thoughtfulness, when adults themselves fought because of some ugly Japanese cat dolls, or that a landed housing estate can go to court over minor differences..</div>

I'm sure the counsellor would have asked, "Do you know what sex is all about?" and would have gotten the correct answer.<br><br>In addition, the girl (if I remember correctly from the article..... it appeared a few months ago) was about 14 years old. Surely the girl would have taught him. Anyway, I first learnt about sex myself when I was 9 years old. I read about it in a science book for kids. I remember recoiling in horror when I grasped the full concept.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In addition, I wouldn't exactly say that kids these days are more priviledged compared to us because of technology and so on. For example, all thanks to the Internet, they spend more time in front of the CRT screen instead of fostering inter-personal relationships with their friends.<br><br>Look at playgrounds nowadays.... in our time there were a lot of playgrounds in my estate, and they were always packed on weekends. Now, even with fewer playgrounds.... you hardly see anyone using them.</div>
