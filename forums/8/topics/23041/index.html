Do we use sockets to establish connection and later use writeByte() from the DataOutputStream? [/B]<br><br>Yup that's the way to do it in Java. Passing of raw bytes across a established connection. It maybe tedious but definitely not as tedious as doing it using C++ socket <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>[B]Or is there a simpler and more effective way to do it? Like using datagram or stuff like that? [/B]<br><br>Usually the simpler way is to use classes built by others but internally they will use the same API call. They just encapsulate those low level details to make it easier for you to call them. Hunt around for 'good souls' out in the Internet who will build classes say FTPconnect, FTPsend etc and release free for public consumption? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Remember FTP, SMTP etc are just protocols but their underlying transport mechanism is still TCP/IP which is essentially 'talk' via Socket both in C++, Java.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you use just the J2SE SDK only this is the only way to do it. writeobject/writebyte will transfer an amount of data from the client to the server, but it wouldn't transfer a lot.<br><br>So say if you have something like 2 meg to transfer from the server to the client, you have to transfer several times. TCP is good for this because a connection is maintained between client and server throughout the whole transfer process. So you simply just write the program to split 2 meg to around 4 packs of 500bytes. Then have the client request for them 4 times.<br><br>At the end of the transfer, just join everything together. There is an issue here. Because 1) the packets might be lost on the way. 2)It is inefficient to transfer/request/transfer/request because half the time, the server will be sitting idle and waiting for the client to ask for something.<br><br>The issue is resolved here. http://www.ce.chalmers.se/~fcela/javis/tcp_slidwin.html<br><br>You can write the program to implement the sliding window algorithm. Actually no. Someone must have already written it elsewhere...if this isn't a school assignment u can search around the net for it.<br><br>Or if you are allowed, use the HTTP Post library from the J2EE servlet library.

The files that are transferred are normally very small (&lt;500k) and the server and client resides in the same computer (cheap skate, right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ).<br><br>I managed to do the transfer already. But I don't know how to solve the java.io.FilePermission exception. Is there any way to allow applets to write a file? Or is there any temporary location that the applet is allowed to write and read from? I tried using the applet to write a file in the same directory as the applet and also using an applet to call up an Java application to write a file but to no avail. Only way I know of is to change the applet to an application but that's out of question 'cuz applet is one of the requirements. jialat siah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </span></div>

Dunno if I'm out of point but your images are stored on the server right? If so, why done you just encapsulate youe image into an object via the server side application and call a method to display from the applets via RMI or CORBA (just as wat sohguanh said earlier)??

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, not polytechnic project. I cannot use CORBA. Must be pure Java. Don't know what's RMI. The server is not a real one. It's just a Java application and is not web-enabled. But that problem is solved already. Thankz for all the help.<br><br>Currently figuring out how to use swing. Heard from a lot of people that swing's UI is easier to implement. Or is there a way to implement tabs without using swing?? Jialat. I'm not good in Java. The Java swing is making my head 'swing'.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Silenthunter:</div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>Originally posted by amorphous:<br>[b]<span class="large"><br>My applet should be able to retrieve encoded image files from server, save to server, decode encoded image files and display them on screen.<br></span></blockquote></div></blockquote>Hi, Just came in guys.

RMI seems to be more like remote services such as terminal server, pcAnywhere or Citrix.
