              <p class="first">SINGAPORE (AFP) - - A Singaporean man on trial in Indonesia for plotting terror attacks has said he plotted to crash a plane into the island-state's Changi Airport, the Straits Times reported Wednesday.</p>
              <div id="adlrec">Mohammad Hassan bin Saynudin said he and alleged Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) member Mas Selamat bin Kastari planned to hijack a plane in Bangkok and ram it into the airport, the report said.</div>
              <p>The plan was aborted when Thai authorities became aware of it, he told the newspaper from a court lock-up in Indonesia on Tuesday.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">"We wanted to do it out of anger with Singapore for being an ally of the United States for what it did in Afghanistan</span>," said Hassan, also an alleged member of the Southeast Asia-based Islamic militant group JI.</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">What I was trying to do was to defend Islam and Muslims</span>."</p>
              <p>The Straits Times said this was the first time an alleged extremist linked to the JI has admitted planning to carry out an attack on Changi Airport, a regional aviation hub.</p>
              <p>Singaporean authorities had previously said that JI members including Mas Selamat planned to crash a plane into Changi Airport in 2001.</p>
              <p>Hassan was one of ten suspected JI members who went on trial Tuesday in Indonesia for plotting attacks against foreigners and Christian priests in the country.</p>
              <p>According to the charge sheet, he received military training in Afghanistan around 2000 and met Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.</p>
              <p>Mas Selamat, the alleged Singapore leader of JI, escaped from a tightly guarded detention facility in the city-state last year and remains at large.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a close ally of the United States in the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">war against terror</span>" and officials have said the island-state is a top target for extremists.</p>
