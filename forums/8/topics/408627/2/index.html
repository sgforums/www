              <p>i think all of you should try to go have a feel of how is it like handling people with ridiculous demand or those tot they are very educated and smart.</p>
              <p>basically what happen is that when u call in to the wrong dept you wont get an immediate answer as if they give the wrong info how? u all ask for more compensation. </p>
              <p>another thing is smart alec cust always tot they are super aware of everything including the telco system demand for something which is impossible to be rectified immediately.</p>
              <p>lastly. all people will just point at the bad svc i can assure u 9 out of 10 cust who receive bad service will threaten to complain to forums or CASE but only 1 out of 99 that receive good service do write in. </p>
              <p>get a life ppl..</p>
              <p>worst kind of ppl is they know they are at fault but try to wriggle it through and in the end got nothing.. ROFL</p>

              <p>Sharing my woes with StarHub; last 6 months wireless internet broadband is not working - frequent disconnection. so many compliants and no action and I gave up after losing patience with their repeated ordeals of remote support check list for wireless connection.</p>
              <p>Second, in the last one month, everytime I ring-up their customer service, the long wait times of the telephone, sometime stretching to 1:30 hrs and 2 hrs to get to speak to a CSO.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, i walked into StarHub customer service centre in OUB and waited in queue for 35 min before being attended by someone and then the person suddendly drops me and decides to attend to another customer!</p>
              <p>I have decided such lousy service should be taught a lesson and switiching to M1 asap.</p>
