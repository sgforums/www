            <div class='col-md body'>Erm. you know ya polling card has a number code which is secretly linked to ya name. the givt knows whu you vote for anyway. so when u vote, even if u hate the govt, beware. when you are at macs or kopitiam oso beware of what you say. there are govt agents around. My uncle used to be one of them and especially during elections, the are normally sent out to hear what ppl hav to say abt the govt.<br>Now. This is an advise for you parents out there if there are or future parents or what. If you want your child to have an ez life, the most impt exam is the PSLE. O levels and A levels are moderated according to schs that is why you see Raffles and etc always top. I have evidence of that when i checked my ans with my friends in the top schools. So beware. I guess becoz when u r a kid u dunno what is happening the results tell u ur ability while Os n As you can study hard n smart and that means u r not naturally smart. That's wat the govt thinks i guess.<br>Sporeans behavior is mainly becoz of the govt and how they trained the ppl from young, how they drill stupid stuff in our heads and dun have a freedom to think for ourselves. I would say the Hello Kitty craze is not becoz of Singaporeans but becoz of the govt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The thing abt jobs in ministries are untrue. You can still leave ministries to find greener pastures in the private sector. The thing abt the voting is true though. I had a friend who was actually involved in it and i shall not name that person. The one about the education thing, i have pure evidence to it but of coz when i say say it like that it doesnt mean anything as i cant prove it here. it's up to u to believe bullshit or not it's up to you to decide. No grudges intended though. And whether govt comes after me or not i dont really give a damn coz if you think i am badmouthing the spore govt, let it be. Trace me kill me whatever, that only prove what i said is correct. we shall see.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The govt is suppose to come up with laws to protect their own ppl not for their own enjoyment. I am sure they have their own reasons for creating laws but some seem real unfair to the citizens. Let me take a shot at this and i would like to say i have no evidence of what i am going to say next but it's just my opinion: why is lee hsien loong known to be the next pm? i would say lky is smart to give gct the seat first as it would be very autocratic to immediatle give the seat to his son. but why must he be next? Why cant it be other ministers? They arent capable enough? With regards to politics, it aint as simple as it seems on the outside. This is only my opinion and for this lky and his son i have no evidence on that so dont take it on me.<br>If you would like to say i am letting off steam, i am not. I am just stating what i know. And what i dont i just tell you that it's my opinion or i wont state at all as i believe, as a lawyer, you must have evidence to support everything you say. Peace u all! have a good day ahead.</div>

But do you think that most people are bothered?<br><br>For 20 odd years Singapore has enjoyed prosperity, peace and basically we've improved our living conditions by leaps and bounds. Technology improved by leaps and bounds, public transportation is one of the best in the region. We have an excellent infrastructure.<br><br>The government has got their masterplan for Singapore. We're riding the wave of success. So let's not complain too much.

You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.</div>
