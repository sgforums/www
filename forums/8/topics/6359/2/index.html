Nothing will happen to you just that they have your record so beware if you ever get into trouble with the law. i dont need to come up with prove coz i already have prove and as what i have said, i don't just say anything without any backing. I do respect your opinion and if any of you do not wish to believe it, i respect that. Whatever it is, politics is a complicated matter. If you doubt me, feel free to go dig up evidence for youself. If not, just leave it.<br>I wont wanna make such a big fuss over it. Just to let u all know, whether to believe it or not up to u. There's nothing i can do if u think i am blabbering nonsense.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yummers all...<br><br>In another thread, NKH remarked on the "pedestrain articles here." I concur with him on the acendancy of triteness but, call me cynical, nothing is come of it. There is no such thing as a resounding clarion call to provoke a intelligent response which is not already there in the first place.<br><br>Not that I am subscribing to the general view of a de-intellectualizing trend among SG, but that's the direct result on the promotion of the economizing of the politcal sphere. The mandate of any government in SG will now have to depend on the "bread and butter" issues, rather than social/welfare driven ... as in the US. The Bush platform vs the Bradley and McKaines is of gun control, education and inner-city projects .. . generally of the liberian/humananitarian ilk.<br><br>What PeePee has shown us in his ranting and the responses given thus far is as what Asad Latif wrote with relations to his Civil Defence ad critique ; that in fueling race relations (by this I am using it as an syncretic representation of social concerns, the emphasis is on the economic success of the different race sectors. We have an amicable race-relations right now because society is divided along economic lines. If the economy is deflated, race-relations are still at the 60s level because it had been swept under the carpet when we made the Faustian pact to trade freedom for economic leverage.<br><br>What I personally find amazing is that PeePee manages to cover a whole spectrum of urban myths and proffers it as "if you dun believe, sua lor!". Hey, alligators live in the sewers of New York and that Morlocks dwell in the abandoned tunnels of the tube.  :p The piece de resistance has to the anthormorphosizing of an entity called the Government - fully equipped with a central, rationalising brain. See, if your uncle works in such and such dept, and that your aunts in such and such top schools all offer you "secrets" of the Government, don't you see that you are contradicting yourself? That there is such a thing as a Government? People make up the Government and the individuation makes for differentiation.<br><br>Go read more. Think through what you write. I hear that Takashimaya has a spanking new library now. Make full use of it. After all, then you can subvert the Government rite?<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>No universal history leads from savagery to humanitarianism, but there is one leading from the slingshot to the megatonne bomb.<br><br>Adorno</div>
