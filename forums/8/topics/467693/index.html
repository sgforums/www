              <p>Hey morning guys...Soul here.</p>
              <p>I just read some nonsense on the internet regarding the relationship between local Singaporeans and Mainland Chinese citizens...like quarrels between them, mostly because the mainland chinese had done something wrong...</p>
              <p>I wouldn't deny the fact that it is difficult for some people from China to integrate into this society, since Singapore is a very different society compare to China where the people from these 2 countries are just...different. Some Chinese nationals from the northern part of China tend to speak in a loud volume or in a northern Chinese accent, and that might make some people think them as rude-behaving. It's not really the case...they just speak like that...(but I would not deny the fact that some people ARE annoying by talking in a loud volume where everyone else is not).</p>
              <p>As a fellow Mainland Chinese who respects Singapore and loves it, it brings me pain when reading these news about the incidents caused by Mainland Chinese people. Yes, some of their actions are unforgivable and should be punished according to Singapore law, but at the same time, I have to say that life for Chinese nationals here are very, very tough.</p>
              <p>Those ones who have a wealthy background, may have a "rather" easy life here to adapt the Singaporean society, but for those who do not have such background, they have to work or study very hard in Singapore in order to survive, and at the same time bearing the bad reputation of PRC in Singapore...</p>
              <p>There are many Mainland Chinese wives who came to Singapore, just to be with their husband together, that's it......they are 100% unharmful people, they are just people who wish to live with their loved ones...</p>
              <p>As for me, I did not have a choice but to study overseas since I studied in an international secondary school in Beijing, China. I didn't have much advantage if I try to apply for a local university or college.</p>
              <p>I came to Singapore, and I fell in love with it, and I wish I can live a peaceful life here, with fellow Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Maybe I am just being temporarily emotional that I wrote this post, but I really, really, sincerely hope that we live happily together, and respect each other. If some of us did something wrong, please do not scold them, just telling them the correct way to do things...I think most of them will understand and will respect Singapore's habits and then follow with it.</p>
              <p>Most PRC people are nice people, please do not be racist to us...we just wanted a peaceful life, that's it. Most of us do respect local culture and tries to embrace it.</p>
              <p>I will just write this much, if continue to write my mind will blow...good night guys, I have to work on my music assignments in my school before the director kills me -.-</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

                                  <p>Hey morning guys...Soul here.</p>
                  <p>I just read some nonsense on the internet regarding the
                  relationship between local Singaporeans and Mainland Chinese
                  citizens...like quarrels between them, mostly because the mainland
                  chinese had done something wrong...</p>
                  <p>I wouldn't deny the fact that it is difficult for some people
                  from China to integrate into this society, since Singapore is a
                  very different society compare to China where the people from these
                  2 countries are just...different. Some Chinese nationals from the
                  northern part of China tend to speak in a loud volume or in a
                  northern Chinese accent, and that might make some people think them
                  as rude-behaving. It's not really the case...they just speak like
                  that...(but I would not deny the fact that some people ARE annoying
                  by talking in a loud volume where everyone else is not).</p>
                  <p>As a fellow Mainland Chinese who respects Singapore and loves
                  it, it brings me pain when reading these news about the incidents
                  caused by Mainland Chinese people. Yes, some of their actions are
                  unforgivable and should be punished according to Singapore law, but
                  at the same time, I have to say that life for Chinese nationals
                  here are very, very tough.</p>
                  <p>Those ones who have a wealthy background, may have a "rather"
                  easy life here to adapt the Singaporean society, but for those who
                  do not have such background, they have to work or study very hard
                  in Singapore in order to survive, and at the same time bearing the
                  bad reputation of PRC in Singapore...</p>
                  <p>There are many Mainland Chinese wives who came to Singapore,
                  just to be with their husband together, that's it......they are
                  100% unharmful people, they are just people who wish to live with
                  their loved ones...</p>
                  <p>As for me, I did not have a choice but to study overseas since I
                  studied in an international secondary school in Beijing, China. I
                  didn't have much advantage if I try to apply for a local university
                  or college.</p>
                  <p>I came to Singapore, and I fell in love with it, and I wish I
                  can live a peaceful life here, with fellow Singaporeans.</p>
                  <p>Maybe I am just being temporarily emotional that I wrote this
                  post, but I really, really, sincerely hope that we live happily
                  together, and respect each other. If some of us did something
                  wrong, please do not scold them, just telling them the correct way
                  to do things...I think most of them will understand and will
                  respect Singapore's habits and then follow with it.</p>
                  <p>Most PRC people are nice people, please do not be racist to
                  us...we just wanted a peaceful life, that's it. Most of us do
                  respect local culture and tries to embrace it.</p>
                  <p>I will just write this much, if continue to write my mind will
                  blow...good night guys, I have to work on my music assignments in
                  my school before the director kills me -.-</p>
                  <p>Cheers.</p>

              Soul,
              
              Your first sentence already write off as non-sense, and china people did nothing wrong, it is the singapore people wrong- see that the damn attiude which china people have !!! 
              
              There is something call respect the local culture and rules. Noise pollution - is a invasion of other people privacy . 
              
              Next time you see any loud china folks - you go up to tell them to tone down - see the result then come tell us , be nice to china people . hopefully you do not get scream at and terrorised or beat up  !!! - that is how impossible china folk is.
