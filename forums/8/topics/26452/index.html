Lots of price hikes are done by the PRIVATE SECTORS and NOT the government.... Though I have to admit that the government would have much to benefit from a higher profit achieved through the private sectors... I only thought the government should be doing much about the price hikes instead of doing NOTHING much about them...? There're lots of 'PUSH' from different levels going on but STILL all FINALIZED OFFICIAL DECISIONS seems RELUCTANT... Without much proper 'valid' explanation given... EXCEPT one which I can quite AGREE with the ministers... <strong><span style="color: red;">YOU CHOSE YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT</span></strong>.... So I say FACE IT.... The government is also seen COMMERCIALISING alot of their public sectors which motive is still very much deem 'UNCLEAR'... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br>If there are only reluctance in the control of price hikes over entertainment and leisure costs I can understand... But what about things like transport??<br><br>GST increase as I know have other implications, though I can't be certain I'm right (layered objectives?)... I can also understand SOME THINGS are NOT meant to be made public.... But I simply hope that though as your plan is ongoing, you would also spare some thoughts for some of the pitiful among us... I know sometimes it's for the BIG PICTURE.... But for MANY out there... If there isn't even gonna be a 'tomorrow'... What meaning would a 'future' holds...?<br></div>

The recession is stepping into the 6th year and there are no signs of recovery yet. There is no significant advantage in productivity of the Singapore workforce as compared to our neighbouring countries or even China. As a result, the need to reduce labour cost is conceivable.<br>However, after a few years of pay freeze and even pay cuts, the competitiveness of Singapore has not been improved. Therefore the government tries their version of pay cut: reducing the value of the Singapore dollar. By increasing the prices of commodities, the true purchasing power is actually reduced and results in artificially induced inflation. The value of Singapore dollar will drop in terms of exchange rate.<br>At the end, the government achieves reduction in labour cost without actually implementing pay cuts.<br><br>The above opinion of D3athwish does not represent the opinion of sgForums.com <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>&gt;clap clap clap&lt;<br>Didn't know that our Mr 7 inch can be so good in this type of things. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore must be one of the only few countries who will accept her wage cuts willingly.. in other countries, there would already have been riots from trade unions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well, they raised GST because, indeed the govt needs her revenue from somewhere, as she has deducted the coporate taxes. As you said, we are facing a recession. It means that Singapore must generate jobs. Where do you get that? Obviously, there must be an increase in investment. In singapore, investment is very important. By cutting our coporate taxes, it would make investing in Singapore more attractive.. and in the long run, increase our productive capacity, and our economy can revive in the long run. Furthermore, the govt has been giving out subsidies to the lower-income group, as this GST will affect them most as it is regressive. Where does all these money come from? Of course from increase in indirect tax such as GST. It's only an increase on 2% to singaporeans, how much can it hurt? Moreover, a lot of companies are absorbing the GST. In my opinion, it's justifiable. The govt has to get her revenue from somewhere, and having GST seems to bring about the least adverse effect on economy.<br><br>Furthermore, when the 3% GST was implemented.. there wasn't much increase in aggregate demand. Thus, I doubt it would really bring about inflation in Singapore. Afterall, advancement in technology has increased our productive capacity.. hence, I doubt inflation will be much of a problem.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth of opinion.<br></div>
