              <p>HER credit cards, stolen without her knowledge, funded somebody's shopping spree comprising three Rolex watches worth $5,700 each. The goods and thieves are gone. All cardholder Tan Shock Ling, 39, is left with is a $17,100 bill.</p>
              <p>The banks are insisting she must pay up, because the transactions took place before she reported the loss of the cards. But the human resource administration manager asked: 'How can I be liable when this is an obvious case of theft?'</p>
              <p>If Ms Tan does not pay up, she will incur late-payment charges and interest.</p>

              <p>That's the thing.</p>
              <p>If she discovered the theft and reported it to the company five minutes later, then I may still sympathize with her.</p>
              <p>But for all you know, she may have dilly-dallied and reported it only a few hours after discovery. I don't know, you don't know; but she knows.</p>
              <p>In the first place, how was the card stolen? Did she take reasonable precautions to prevent people from stealing it?</p>

              <p>well be more careful with your own belonging. especially cards, credit cards.</p>
              <p>some people like to show off their cards until it got stolen or used by someone else.</p>
              <p>but the thief should be able to trace. the shop the theif went to should have CCTV etc.</p>
              <p>the seller should know how he/she look like.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and also the bank do not know if the lady is a part of the scam, like telling someone she know to use her card and buy rolex in the end claimed the card was stolen and then get away with nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if she don't like she can don't sign for the card. who tell her to sign for her card and then never take card of it. it's her to be blame too. the bank? they just do what it is to do, she don't sign for it, thousands of citizen will sign for it.</p>
              <p>anyway, how to prove she's "INNOCENT"?</p>
              <p>she got to prove it. like during the time the card is being used. she's at some place when people can see her.</p>
              <p>like example she's giving a speech at some place and then the card she's holding is being used by someone, and people can prove that she's not the one who used the card.</p>
              <p>and also, again, she might told someone to use the card on her behalf. so it really doesn't matter.</p>
              <p>just say she's sawy.</p>
              <p>i don't remember card limit can be up to 17K. well it is a gold card? for normal platinum card the limit is up to 5K.</p>
