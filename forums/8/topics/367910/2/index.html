              <p>well somebody has to pay for the rolexes. You expect the banks to pay it when it's not their wrongdoing?</p>
              <p>RBS called her to tell her somebody had used her CC to buy a rolex one minute ago. If RBS had not done that, who knows how long it would have taken her to realize her CCs are all gone.</p>
              <p>And wtf. she owns 5 CCs?</p>
              <p>i think she and her husband are to blame for not watching over her handbag.</p>
              <p>Anyway morale of story - Avoid credit cards. stick to debit cards. You should live within your means. Use CCs only when absolutely necessary. and be sure to put controls to the credit limit.</p>

              <p>its true that people should not be neglient...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, the banks should not sell the credit cards to people with middle income in the first place because many of them are not able to weather a fraud case....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>please the system is faulty.. it allows people who cannot afford a credit card loss to sign up  easily...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is same as structured notes saga.... only people who are well informed of the consequences of a stolen credit card or debit card should be allowed to signed up.. only people who are qualified to advise people to sign credit card should sell the cards..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>are this things happening..NO.. it means that the system is corked up.... what the heck....</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing I know for sure... I won't ever leave my handbag in an unattended car. I also know that I will not lose my credit cards like them. Cos I don't see any reason for having credit cards. Only have one. I not the type so yah yah show off that have gold card, platinum card etc. And my credit limit not so high either.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It also amazes me why some people carry all their cards with them. Going on a big shopping spree or what? Or to impress others? Or got nowhere else to keep them?</p>

              <p><br>it is not that my paid do not warrant a credit cards in fact since young, i got supplementary from my Dad and still holding on. But I know that credit cards induce spending, travelling and shopping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Spending need to be control, many people do not understand the full usage of credit cards. Mine is controlled by my dad, he told his bank to limit supplementary to only 1k, and even if i spent 1 k, i will be hearing lecture from him from morning till evening dinner...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think credit card is suitable for those more mature adults who really knows their limit, for youngster like us, you need control.</p>

              <p>Actually, on the contrary, your thinking is naive I must say. So now you want to put a control on who can apply for credit cards? Who are you to decide? Besides, how can anyone decide if someone is smart enough to understand the risks of having a credit card? Are you gonna setup an exam for everyone to pass prior to applying for a credit card?</p>
              <p>Come on, be realistic. This is the same as those stupid "I got cheated in Sim Lim Square" threads. If you don't know what you are getting yourself into and lose money, don't go around pointing fingers. Its simply because of your own fault. You should understand the risks by yourself. No one is going to SPOON FEED you over and over again..</p>
