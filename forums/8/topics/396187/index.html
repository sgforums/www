              <p>Read this article from a chinese newspaper... The writer is the 'chinese tutor' of MM Lee. Think is professor Chua. He shared this situation..</p>
              <p>A friend of his came and approached him for help to brush up his kid's chinese standard because his son is gonna to take PSLE this year and he knew that given the kid's current standard of chinese, it would be a miracle if he could passed.. There's nothing wrong with this as most Singaporean parents are very obsessive about grades and would go great lengths to ensure that their kids do well... But what is shocking in this case is that the friend (ie, father of the kid) is a Chinese teacher himself!!</p>
              <p>The writer went on to question his friend on why his son was facing so much problem in the learning of chinese when he himself has taught countless students the subject. The friend explained that because of his lack of proficiency in the english language, he has been put at a disadvantage throughout his whole life. That's why he's doing his best to ensure that the child does not follow his footstep and this resulted in his 'massive revolution' to ensure that the son has a complete mastery of the English language. The friend went on to highlight to his child constantly about the importance of the english language and that faring badly in english would affect the performance of other main subjects. He also assured the son that he would not have much problem with chinese language even if he was to put in little effort in the subject because the father was a Chinese teacher! This went on for five years until the father realised the mistake when the child reached primary 6!!</p>
              <p>Who's to be blamed for this situation? The father? Because of his excessive obsession over the importance of the english language? The education system? Which places more emphasis on the english language rather than the mother tongue or the overall environment? One that does not provide a conducive environment for the learning of mother tongue..</p>

              <p>What's so complex about this thread? Haha... It was only meant for discussion.. Don't think too much..</p>
              <p>Actually the reason for the demise of the chinese language (in my opinion) has a lot got to do with our PAP's fighting against communist and BS in the 1960's. A systematic dismantling and destruction of Chinese language and culture was carried out to prevent growth and propagation of communism in the nation and also to ensure that future generations of Singaporean youths would not be enticed by communism to become another Lim Chin Siong...  </p>
              <p>Of course, given the 'pragmatic' nature of our government, I foresee that the government will soon 'encourage' us to engage PRC China and of course, there might come a day where the chinese language might raise it's head and become the dominant language in SIngapore just as China replace US and Europe as major superpower..</p>
              <p>However, would it spell troube for Singapore? Remember, LKY mentioned that one of the reasons why English should be made 1st language was to ensure fairness and equality so that the 3 major races in SIngapore need not be 'forced' to take up another language from the other race...</p>
