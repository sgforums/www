Under 'race' in my IC it says 'Jew' so how can u say that it is not a race? By saying that I'm a Christian by religion, I mean that I do not follow their practices, like I do not fast, go to the synagogue(however u spell it), etc, although my father does.<br><br>I think those black people in africa whom u are referring to merely choose to take Judaism as a religion, and follow their practices.
