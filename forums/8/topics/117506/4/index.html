            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wudimax:</div><div class="quote_body">i am not trying to frame anyone, But pay attention to local(malaysia) news, how often do u see chinese gers raped by muslim?<br><br>How sure are u that malays in malaysia not endure a place in u? Please, there are tons of fact which u can find easily, and just ask around any chinese in malaysia how hard they need to fight to get into u. top 2%? 3? </div></blockquote>Come on lah! I am born in Malaysia and I am 38 years old now, everyday I read news paper, both Chinese &amp; English one. I just don't read chinese girl rape by muslim often here, in fact so far I can only remember one case which is happened 2 or 3 years ago. Check with more Malaysian if you don't believe me, I have no reason to tell lie here.<br><br>Most of my chinese friends able to get a place in local uni and they are certainly not the top 2% to 3% students. Many malays classmate of mine can't get into local uni as well, same like me... the Bahasa Malaysia subject not pass with credit which is the minimum requirement by local U.</div>
