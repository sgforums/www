There are 2 continuous assessments and 2 examinations to take. All these are cumulative and affect the grades at the end of the year.<br><br>At Sec 2, students will be streamed into the different courses, depending on how well they did. Students who did well will go to a Science class, doing one, two or three Pure Science subjects. They will also do Additional Mathematics.<br><br>Those who didn't really fare well will be doing some other subjects, such as Food and Nutrition. They may do an additional Accounting subject as well, if the school offers it.<br><br>At Sec 4 (for those who are doing 4 years of sec education), they will have to take GCE O Levels, an exam prepared by Cambridge and Singapore together. Results will be released the next year, after which they will progress to the next level of education (GCE A Levels, ITE or polytechnic, MI or other institutions).<br><br>For those taking the 5-year course, they will take N Level at Sec 4. If results permit, they will take O Levels at Sec 5.<br><br>A recent change in the education policy also allow these students to take some O Levels subject at N Level, thus not wasting time and allow them to focus more time on their weaker subjects.<br><br>2. Textbooks approved by MOE are used. Others, such as study notes, are not regulated. Most, if not all, will have study notes of their own.<br><br>3.
