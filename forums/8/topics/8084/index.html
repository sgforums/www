            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Dear forumites,<br>It is such a joyous occasion that i have no choice but to post it in and share my joys. As you guys have notice, i have been chasing after Tet ever since i entered into the forum. She just captivates me with her personality and looks and i was mesmerized by her. I began to harass her in the forums, hoping to attract her attention but i realized that was the wrong way to go. I slowed down my approach and slowly, she began to accept me and lower her defense mechanism.<br>From emails to icq, we came a long way. Yet, we never meet face to face. Not that she was unwilling, the problem lies with me. More than several times she invited me to the forum outing and everytime i rejected her offer. Guess i just dun feel comfortable coming out in such a large group. For her, she doesn't want to give the wrong impression to me, thus no single dates from her. I understand, it's always far safer to meet stangers in a big group. Things hover there for a few months as i know her more and more...<br><br>Finally, she agreed to come out with me last Saturday. To say it was the happiest day of my life is an understatement. i was like a child given a free pass to toys'rus...that's how happy i was.<br><br>On that day itself, i ran to my nearest bank and draw out a substantial amount of money to tide me thru this hot date. My wildest dream is coming true and damm if i let insufficient cash ruin the evening! Later on, i dolled up myself...put on my best clothes, sprayed some perfume and put on my lucky charm. Off i went, to meet the gorgeous Tet.<br><br>We agreed to meet at Orchard MRT station and i arrive early. Clutching a bunch of lovely lilies, i was feeling pretty uncomfortable in the midst of the crowd. The station was pretty packed and i was worried that i can't see her from my standing place. I need not worry thou...<br><br>for she appear right in my eyes. From the streaming crowd of people rushing to clear the counter, i spot a slim and tall girl in black walking coolly thru it. I knew at that moment it was her...it must be her! She was wearing a black sexy short dress and she just blew my mind away. I actually stuttered when she approached me..." ermmm, hi....ermm tet right...ermmm niiiiceee to mmmmetttt u..."<br>"So i finally meet my persistent stalker" she smile mischievously.<br><br>We proceed to catch a show, Shanghai Noon. Yeah, damm right it was a crappy show but we enjoyed a few good laughs. Halfway thru the show,i believed she was feeling cold and she seems to bunch up even tighter in her seat. At that moment, i wanted so much to hold her and give her warmth. She looked so vulnerable and as the images of the screen flicker across her cold face, i thought to myself, lucky is that guy who can hold her and hug her warm. The temptation to hug her is over but i would steal a glance at her every now and then. I didn't even remember what the show was all about, so engross in her.<br><br>I told her after the show how i feel and she ask me not to do any naughty things with her, flashing me another one of her naughty smile. God, i wish this moment will never end.<br><br>We headed for dinner at a Jap restaurant as we both enjoyed it. We ordered quite abit of food and the people around us was looking at us with amazement. We ignored them and we eat and tok..and eat and tok. We shared ourt food as she tucked into my sushi while i eat her cold noodles.<br><br>After dinner, we headed to a pub where she made heads turn. We took to a quiet corner and we had a fun time playing the guessing game and drinking the beer. Golly, she sure was sporting!<br><br>Sadly, the day has to come to an end. I send her back home and told her what a fantastic date it has been and how gorgeous she looks today. She laugh back in return and said that i give compliments so easily that it's becoming numb on her. Lastly, she told me that she finds me very comfortable...to be with and to tok to. To me, that is all i can ever ask for.<br><br>Dear Tet, thanks for the Sat date. You really make my day.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 27 June 2000).]</div>
