              To me they are still legal next of kin and I think in the eyes of secular government they are still legal too. However, in the eyes of Shariah Law, the basic fundamental Islamic law....maybe not because they are considered as Kafir which means to say as Non-Muslims or Non-Believers of Islamic Religion. Is best you check with MUIS to answer this question of yours.

              I give you an example. If a Muslim married to a Non-Muslim in a Civil Marriage, the Muslims in Singapore and in other part of the world will not recognize and acknowledge that civil marriage as legal. Its outside Islamic precept teachings. Only marriages according to Islamic  Teaching is considered legal to Muslims all over the world.

              Singapore is a secular state...so secular state will see former family as legal next of kin. However, if he prefers to follow the Shariah Law then the state will not be totally involved in legal matters of the Shariah Law. But I think the former family can contest to that Shariah Law junction. In the event of death for example....its difficult for me to explain here...I think the best way is to tell you a story of my own experience. My family is like an International family. My eldest brother is a Christian and my third eldest sister is a Hindu. To make the story short, after my biological mother passed away in 1994, my late father remarried in 1995. Upon my father's death in 2007, all his estates were divided equally among his children....7 of us. But my step mother got the most of my late father's wealth distribution. We siblings did not protest or contest to that decision because in the Islamic way the wife will get more than the children and the male children will get more than the female children. Besides we siblings agreed since that our step mother had taken care of our father so it was only fair for her to get more than us. So in another word....it was like applying secular law and shariah law for this instance. Another example will be like in the divorce cases. The Muslims of Singapore will follow the Shariah Law in the shariah court.  The decision and verdict will be decided by the shariah court in accordance to Islamic code of law. So if the shariah court verdict that HDB flat should be sold and the wife gets more than the husband and the husband must provide monthly maintenance fee for his children until the age of 21 if I'm not mistaken...then it will be. The state will have no say in this matter. So if your uncle for instance....I have no idea...what legal matters apply for his former family who are Non-Muslims in the event of his death and wealth distribution. The link that I have referred for you will be able to answer you if you write to them or the other way is that you can approach the Muslim religious preachers at the mosque...they will be able to answer you better than me. What is the reason you asked this question may I know?
