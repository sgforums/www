            <div class='col-md body'>no rinoa dear, i would never pick on you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>its just very dangerous to make such sweeping assumptions even if they are from personal experience. personal experience after all is just a minute experience against the wider scope of things. what you said cannot be justified by your experience alone. i'm not worried for people like you; you seem reasonably intelligent and well-adjusted, rather, i fear (well not fear, prefer it not) that your opinions be taken as the gospel truth or wholesale by the impressionable kids here. lets face it, most prefer to hear easy-to-digest non-problematic 'truths' that do not require much mental activity.<br><br>secondly, if the cases you mentioned are from personal experience, i would like to apologise on behalf of my gender for showing you such poor specimens of ourselves.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> trust me, there are some (plenty actually)guys out there who demonstrate and articulate their emotions more constructively and eloquently.<br><br>thirdly, you don't mind me sharing my experience with you? don't mind? thanks but it sounds terribly condescending. i prefer to share with someone who is interested, and not someone who 'doesn't mind'.<br><br>cheers<br><br></div>

Like office, or in public.  The place where u won't be able to cry out are home.. The more comfortable u r the more your tears won't flow..<br><br>Why don't u read thru' the letter, emails, or anything tht person has sent u and keep bringing back sad memories..i knoe it hurts but somehoe somewhere u need to let your emotional release themselves... Crying is a good way. Most important u don't let pples see it :-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>io<br><br>i agree, crying is very therapeutic.  after a good cry you'll feel so useless for moaning and groaning that you'll start your life in the morrow with a jump =)<br><br>well.  if you are not used to crying.  i dunno, i am used to crying =).  usually things that make me cry are some stories that eerily remind me of the problem i'm having and just sentimental thoughts about the person/s invloved.<br><br>if you dun wanna cry anyway doing something that leads to success is good, take your mind off the problem<br><br>or talk to someone you can fully trust about it, just talk, no need advice or anything...it really works</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IO, not too sure if this helps but this is what I do when I feel real depressed...<br><br>Generally , I would spend a certain amount of time in solitude to deal with my depression alone. Take some aimless busrides, wander around some housing estates, catch a few movies alone or go to an arcade to play some games.<br><br>Do some thinking and sort out your emotions and feelings. Then focus on what u have now and what u are going to do for the future.<br><br>For u, esp at the start of ur UNi its very dangerous for u to sink into deeper depression and throw your education away. That happened to me before. A little planning goes a long way man... Besides there are many other girls around too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br><strong>Tell me why?<br>I want the meaning of my life....<br>Do I try to live?
