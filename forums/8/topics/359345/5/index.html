              <p>you are seeing it differently because you have an emotional stake in it. like i pointed out,  all he did was give the due respect that he has the guts to make his choice, when it's going to be very very difficult.</p>
              <p>we all know that he might be treated very badly for his choice and respect  him for it. it's got nothing to do with mocking islam or whatever. you are the only one who thinks that comment has anything to do with islam.</p>
              <p>so quit playing the victim la. especially when you started the name calling. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>if singaporeans don't really care, then why are you so worked up when you thought people were attacking islam? the very fact that you got offended, means you care about what other people think about islam (even when nobody's attacking islam, that's the best part).</p>
              <p>i think my position is even clearer than yours, because i'm not a big fan of catholics either. you can ask those who know me here.</p>
              <p>and i definitely respect TS's courage to make a difficult decision (yes yes, i'm sure you can continue to rant about how nobody in his family would care if he renounces his religion for another religion, but you're not in his position, you don't know his family, you don't know his struggles)</p>
              <p>and i'm sure whoever that fella who made that comment, his sentiments are the same. it's not about islam. it's about TS's decisiveness. And you're the only one who can't see that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>and for the record, i have no issue with you being offended, only if you have a reason to.</p>
              <p>you don't have a reason to be offended because that person didn't attack islam. you yourself misinterpreted it, and when i told you what that fella probably meant, you decided to take it out on me first.</p>
              <p>like wtf?</p>

              <p>i nv say his family don't care. it shows how dumb you are. are you him? so how do you know he's struggling? he's just having dillema whether to tell his parents or not..so? he's probably enjoying life right now while you DUMBDUMB feeling sorry for him.</p>
              <p>well whoever that person is, you don't know how he sees it. are you him? nope. he should be the one explaining what was he implying and i don't think you should be making so much noise when you are not that person. how would you know?</p>
              <p>you asked a stupid question "why would you(me) be offended" that's really dumb? if u no issue then why bother asking me that question?</p>

              <p>Your language please do watch it. I never use a single vulgarity on you so do NOT! use a single one on me. You lack the respect to be given for the TS. Everyone here is supporting his decision, standing by him when as we all know, many muslims discriminate those who convert out of Islam. Many people here agree that we are not attacking your religion. We are merely supporting him. The TS's decision. Kudos? Do you even understand what other people meant before ranting away and flaming everyone else here especially dumbdumb? And for you to call him dumb does that make you clever? NO! i believe he is intelligent to a certain extent but not dumb. Because if he is, he would be as insensitive as you are. Im lazy to quote the previous posts that you wrote but i will just tell those who have the spare time to go it through one by one that it is extremely obvious that your theories and pleas of self wallow are totally and i seriously mean totally contradicting and simply pointless.</p>
              <p>AND ARE YOU TRYING TO START A WAR HERE!?</p>
              <p>Whats with the indians and the other races? What "if his indian nobody would judge?" So now your implying that only malays will be judge by Islam and those indian muslims are not of equality againts malays( Muslims)? This is the reason why i said your arguments are pointless, selfish and totally incorrigible. Stop being that hypocrite behind the screen. This thread is to show TS support! Not allowing you here to hurl your stupid and senseless vulgarites at people. You prolly broke a TON of forum rules already. Here is a gentle reminder before you scold other people's mum female dog, remember that we are all the same. So that makes your mum one too if you ever scold someone else. before you say people, remember to judge your ownself.</p>
              <p>To TS, If you need strong support pm those who have shown you support. Its about time an admin or someone of rank comes and lock this thread before our princess here flames the whole of singapore.</p>
              <p>Oh and just in case you do not know~ OSAMA~ is Islamic. Read real hard and understand throughly before you start to fire your bazookas.</p>
