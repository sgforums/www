              <p>actually,</p>
              <p>muslim families can rear dogs actually except you can't touch them when they're wet.</p>
              <p>so it's advisable to not own a dog for this reason.</p>

              <p>Dear Friends,</p>
              <p>Good afternoon. This is Nikar from the Holy Church of our Lady of FireIce, located at 25 Loyang Drive, Singapore.</p>
              <p>Me and my fellow members will be holding a games session where we invite everyone of all races and religion to come and celebrate our 6th Holy Anniversary with us.</p>
              <p>There will be free food and drinks, and adults are welcomed to our mass orgy sessions held in the backyard. We are also organizing free gaming competitions (incl. WoW and CounterStrike) for the kids in the main hall.</p>
              <p>Please note that there is NO obligation to join our church. Joining is ABSOLUTELY voluntery. Those who decide to join us on that day as formal members will have to first be baptized by our Lady herself. This including walking on fire and then bathing in ice.</p>
              <p>Event is held starting from 25 May 2009, daily from 8 AM to 10:30 PM.</p>
              <p>Condoms are sold at the entrance for those who intend to participate in our much raved-about mass orgies.</p>

              <p>so i asked why is she offended, because logically (if you don't want to use religion as a reason), all he did was make a difficult choice, which not many people are able to make.</p>
              <p>and i get to see antics which i haven't seen since i was in primary school. LOL</p>

              <p>I know it takes a lot of courage to make such decision.   It is something very serious for a muslim to give up his faith.     He will have to face persecution, isolation from his own people.   I know it because I heard of stories of a couple gave up islam to become christians.</p>
              <p>Sigh!   There are also difference in opinion.   After all it is the choice of TS, let's just respect him.    Even if he is  christian and wanna convert to Islam i will also respect him.</p>

                  anwy, your parents gonna be disappointed. i think it's better you

              <p>He did already made his decision and your not helping at all. Everyone, regardless of race or religion should be giving the freedom to choose in what they believe in. How sure are you that your Allah is the one true God? If that is the case i would be worshipping Egyptian Gods right now. Oldest what. No offense but im making a statement here. He deserves some support for having the courage to do what very little almost minute amount of muslims would do. Which is to believe out of tradition.. There is no one true God in this world and as long as all of us live on this Earth so will the Gods.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, we are miscommunicated on some point. To the brat who is unhappy when we congratulate him on the account of him converting bear in mind this, it took a hell lot of courage for him to stand up againts something that he was raised from. Now you ask is he indian? What if he told you his malay? Your butt will flip is it? Why care about his race? Its his life. The way your fussing over him is making you sound like an islam fanatic. Hell like Osama Bin Laden like that.</p>
              <p>I have many friends who are malays who became catholics christians got two even bcame buddhist. Come on la, sooner or later the God Fad will die out. Youngsters nowadays do not care much about religion. Or at least not at conservative as the past generations. Read the newspaper! Islam allows killings to go forgiven because of the name of Jihad!? Ridiculous right? I believe what really matters is a person's character, not his religion. Cause god is so omipotent that he is non existant physically. Only in our hearts and faith. People who uses God as an excuse for their actions are only a disgrace to the society. This age we live in is about science. Get the right science and one day creating life will be sold at Toy's R Us. Sea monkeys anyone?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come on ppl show him some support. Kudos to him for having such courage.</p>
              <p>You deserve some respect bro and im giving it to you =)</p>
              <p> </p>
