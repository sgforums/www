              <p>I am a born Muslim and now in the journey of getting myself
                              baptized in the Catholic faith. I went through many years of hesitations and
                              I've finally find myself at peace with the catholic faith. I'm hoping that
                              everyone around would assist me in this journey towards the path of god. I've
                              received my calling and I've felt god in ways I'm unable to describe. I want to
                              build a relationship with god and not fear him. But as I go more in depth in
                              the catholic faith, I realize that the transition from being a Muslim to a
                              Catholic is not easy. I've receive my share of challenges.</p>
              <p>My dear
                              brothers/sisters, are you able to assist me with the following queries:</p>
              <p>How discreet would me as a convert be between my
                              family and me? I do not want to disclose any information regarding my faith to
                              my family yet as I do not wish to jeopardize my close knit relationship with my
                              mother. I understand that its not easy for any Muslim parent to be able to
                              receive the news but I'm head strong with my decision in my faith. I believe
                              I'm past the legal age to make my own decision and I do have my legal rights to
                              keep this matter from them. I love my family but I'm loving god more. I've read from many other threads saying that its wise to inform the parents about the change of faith, but i want you to understand unlike any other religion, converstion from the muslim faith to any other religion is different. Muslim parents and tremendously strict and its somehow impossible to bring them to understand. I either loose a family or loose my faith.</p>
              <p>How do I go about this journey legally? I've heard from past converts that MUIS will want to meet me personally for a few counseling sessions is this true?</p>
              <p>Anyone was a muslim and convert out of the religion?</p>

              <p>I believe that having a strong faith is a good thing and im more then willing to help you out here. I understand what Deino meant by feeling in a cult. I presume you were with a Church called City Harvest? If that is so i pretty understand why you meant that way but to correct you, they are Christians. Not Catholics.</p>
              <p>Being a Catholic is no different from being a Muslim if you have to compare. Just minus the eating of halal food. Come to understand that converting is your own choice and it is within your own power. If you deemed you are of age to make your own decision as an adult then i urge your to talk to your parents about it. Let them understand where your faith lies. Religion and Family ties must never be interwined together. I have seen my friends who were disowned by their parents due to them converting but it only proves that the parents do not have the interest of their child at heart. Placing themselves as the absolute religion in the family is disheartening.</p>
              <p>Deeming that you have seriously think about it hard enough then here is what you can do.</p>
              <p>Talk to your family, start it off with a hint and tread lightly among their words. Look at their emotions and check if there is any agression in their tones. If things are calm talk to them and make them understand you have found your footing in faith. And persuade them that nothing is wrong with the muslim religion, it just happened that you prefer to believe in another religion. A religion that you found your faith in. Let them understand why and how you found it. Make them realize that if they were to let religion and family ties come together as one tell them with a serious tone that it is not right. You are the flesh and blood of them thus no matter what they say your still their child.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope i helped a little.</p>
              <p>Good luck and Godspeed my friend.</p>

              <p>Issac, if you want to convert to Catholic, be very strong, courageous and hope you get lots of support from your church people.    There was this muslim couple converted to Christians and they were ostricized by the muslims.   </p>
