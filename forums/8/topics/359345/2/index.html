              <p>If he is so compelled, then it is the right one for him. Coolgal probably went through the same journey as she hinted there that she's also a convert. Don't get too worked up.</p>
              <p>If your safety is threatened or you constantly get harassed, the usual legal means apply. However, the law can't force your family to accept your decision. They will be disappointed when they eventually learn why you aren't fasting, going to prayers and so on, given what Islam dictates happens to converts. You will need to pray for strength as well as find support within the parish community that you choose. A happy outcome for your family ties is not certain, but showing (1) some solidarity with your family during festive occasions and fasting and (2) that your decision doesn't lead to decadence may help.</p>

              i find ppls are very sensitive to wat other think, wrote or said when religion is concern. Why even bother correcting or convincing one thinking to that of yours. Most are too set in their ways to even allow themselves to see the beyond.
              
              Eye might have evolve to see colours and what ever that effect of lights, but human mind have on the other hand, degenerate to choosing only to see what they wish rather then that was presented by it very own eyes.
              
              Oh wait, some might have pointed out that we never evolve for we were made.....
              
              anyway, one meat might be another one poison. Which ever or what ever that rock/ row ur boat, then that alone is good enough.

              <p>that's why i said subconsciously.</p>
              <p>just that the busy-ness of life distracts you since every one of
              us thinks that we have plenty of tomorrows.</p>
              <p>until when out of the blue, someone close to us dies, or
              contracts cancer or something, then we realise that we are all
              mortal, and that life is very short, then we start thinking about
              what happens after we die, and if there is a God.</p>

              <p>Other than the verbal abuse, why not elaborate why people who
              had chosen a religion automatically means he felt the other
              religions r not wrong ? They all tell how the world is created and
              mentioned the practices to a superstitious happiness and these
              methods differs greatly. If u believe believing in christ goes to
              heaven, doesn't tat autoimatically means burning joss sticks etc

              <p>It's not as simplistic as you put it. Religion is not just about morals; it's also about rituals, questions about one's transient existence, social order and one's place in the universe in relation to other beings. These are personal choices shaped by one's own values. If you define beliefs in absolute terms, take quotes about truth at face value and force them on other people, conflicts will arise.</p>

              <p>Well if u took the stand of one religion, obviously u do not believe wat the other religion said right ? All the thing u state above completely differs from one religion to another. I am not inciting religious conflict etc... I thought tis is common sense...</p>
              <p>About the TS, frankly speaking my recommendation for u is to keep it as a secret possibly forever to your family. Then u can have the best of both worlds. If u state it out, not only do u have peer pressure, so does your whole family. U just treat the actions done in a mosque as a fillial act for your family.</p>

              <p>Nope, it does not work that way. Like cooking recipes, each set of religious beliefs has its merits and emphases. Favouring one does not mean you reject others outright.</p>

              <p>Religion is like history or science. They state historical events and explain world events. Tat is why there r stories like adam and eve or panggu or shiva etc. If u believe the world is created from an egg and nuwa made humans, obviously u cannot believe god create the world in 7 days because they completely contradicts one another.</p>
              <p>I am not inciting religious hatred here but tis is really wat religion is all about isn't it ? Doesn't the church etc also forbid their member from doing other religion rituals such as offering joss stick or going to other places of worships ?</p>

              <p>and that's how it is actually. we all f*cked up, we all pay.</p>
              <p>and it's all good you know, as long as we live a reasonably moral life.. as long as your conscience don't prick too much until you can't brush it aside.</p>
              <p>but one day you may make a really horrible mistake (maybe not you, but definitely someone), you wish you didn't do it, and the guilt and shame is eating you up inside.. and you wish you had the peace which comes when you know you are forgiven, not cheap grace, but forgiven because justice is also served.</p>
              <p>that's when you realise that what you just said is just cheap tough talk.</p>
              <p>come to me with that speech when you've felt that kind of guilt and shame, then i will call you a real man.</p>
