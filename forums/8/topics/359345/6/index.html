              <p>Being a muslim, I have seen my fair share of discrimination and hatred to the converts, to muslims etc. I can say the TS has a very hard choice to make. I say follow your heart. God made you that way, and that way shall it be. Each one of us has our future planned for us. If you are afraid about your parents, just try and talk to them. Make them understand why. But don't make it seems like you are dragging them in as well.

              <p>I'm not going to hate anyone for changing religions. I don't see the point. I regularly discuss religion with some of my friends, comparing and sharing. Christians, Muslims and Jews are all very similar, religion wise. The core moral values should stay even as you switch. As long as you don't join one of those racist groups, pro-extremist cells (not all extremists are muslims).</p>

              <p>Your language please do watch it. I never use a single vulgarity
                      on you so do NOT! use a single one on me. You lack the respect to
                      be given for the TS. Everyone here is supporting his decision,
                      standing by him when as we all know, many muslims discriminate
                      those who convert out of Islam. Many people here agree that we are
                      not attacking your religion. We are merely supporting him. The TS's
                      decision. Kudos? Do you even understand what other people meant
                      before ranting away and flaming everyone else here especially
                      dumbdumb? And for you to call him dumb does that make you clever?
                      NO! i believe he is intelligent to a certain extent but not dumb.
                      Because if he is, he would be as insensitive as you are. Im lazy to
                      quote the previous posts that you wrote but i will just tell those
                      who have the spare time to go it through one by one that it is
                      extremely obvious that your theories and pleas of self wallow are
                      totally and i seriously mean totally contradicting and simply
                      pointless.</p>
              <p>AND ARE YOU TRYING TO START A WAR HERE!?</p>
              <p>Whats with the indians and the other races? What "if his indian
                      nobody would judge?" So now your implying that only malays will be
                      judge by Islam and those indian muslims are not of equality againts
                      malays( Muslims)? This is the reason why i said your arguments are
                      pointless, selfish and totally incorrigible. Stop being that
                      hypocrite behind the screen. This thread is to show TS support! Not
                      allowing you here to hurl your stupid and senseless vulgarites at
                      people. You prolly broke a TON of forum rules already. Here is a
                      gentle reminder before you scold other people's mum female dog,
                      remember that we are all the same. So that makes your mum one too
                      if you ever scold someone else. before you say people, remember to
                      judge your ownself.</p>
              <p>To TS, If you need strong support pm those who have shown you
                      support. Its about time an admin or someone of rank comes and lock
                      this thread before our princess here flames the whole of
                      singapore.</p>
              <p>Oh and just in case you do not know~ OSAMA~ is Islamic. Read
                      real hard and understand throughly before you start to fire your

              <p>Being a muslim, I have seen my fair share of discrimination and

              hard choice to make. I say follow your heart. God made you that
              way, and that way shall it be. Each one of us has our future
              planned for us. If you are afraid about your parents, just try and
              talk to them. Make them understand why. But don't make it seems
              like you are dragging them in as well. People get <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>VERY</strong></span> touchy
              when you try to change their beliefs (ahem).</p>
              <p>I'm not going to hate anyone for changing religions. I don't see
              the point. I regularly discuss religion with some of my friends,
              comparing and sharing. Christians, Muslims and Jews are all very

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">It is strange. What is the difference whether you are a Catholic or Muslim? They are just beliefs. You can believe anything you want. There is no proof, no evidence, no nothing whether Roman Catholism is right or Islam is right.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you tell me that you want to give up your beliefs and live in reality, that might be significant. Since Islam and RC are both mainstream (I choose to believe and if I don't nothing changes) religions, why bother to switch?</span></p>

              <p>Hi Isaac yes in the end you might have to risk between your family or your relationship with God as a Catholic. But there's nothing impossible with God if you trust Him. I'm a Catholic myself, from your writings it seems you love God so much. When in doubt I suggest you pray and called God father in your prayer. It always brings me peace to greet God with the word father so I think it will do that to you too.</p>
              <p>May God bless you, keep you and turn and shine His face upon you.</p>

              <p>Air Wudhu is ablution prior to the 5 daily prayers or special prayers by which every Muslim needs to take. Sequential from rinsing your mouth, your face, your arms, your forehead upwards, your ears and your legs.</p>

              <p>I believed tat some people who state tat catholic and muslim r almost the same religion to be misleading. They r not the same and the believers, including the family of the TS, probably do not believe so.</p>
              <p>1) If u chose to be public about your real belief, prepare for a backlash. All those friends who have the same religion as u will probably shunned u and have nothing to do with u. The ties of friendship or relation cannot overcome zealous religious convictions. Unless your family is not deeply convicted in your religion, u r going to see arguments, probably disowning and fights. Your new religion gonna offer little practical help except praying for u. Of course things may turn out to be fine in the end if they convert to your religion.

              <p>I believed tat some people who state tat catholic and muslim r almost the same religion to be misleading. They r not the same and the believers, including the family of the TS, probably do not believe so.</p>
              <p>1) If u chose to be public about your real belief, prepare for a backlash. All those friends who have the same religion as u will probably shunned u and have nothing to do with u.

              <p>well.. i think stupidissmart is just being rather upfront and honest about it.</p>
              <p>like you said.. everyone must be allowed a voice. =)</p>
              <p>and i agree with him - islam and christianity, even though both are considered abrahamic religions, aren't the same.</p>
              <p>and this fact is reflected by the reactions of either parties when someone converts</p>
