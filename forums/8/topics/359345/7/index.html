                                 As for believers:
                                                                                                                                <br><br>            
              You know how does an ordinary Singapore citizen know that they have a government who runs things supposedly on their behalf since it claims to be a republic.
                                                                                                                                  <br><br>
              It's because when they want to go out they know there's a well managed public transportation that they can take. They know not the persons who are in charge to control how a bus lane gets designated or at what interval the bus should pass at the terminal.
              They may not know who was the person who ordered the mrt to be built.
              They know not who put the quota on the number of taxi in Singapore. They know not who the man responsible to make their night sleep a safe one.
                                                                                                                                                              <br><br>
              But know what, they know that they have a running government. They put their faith in their government because they don't know exactly how the country is run.
              The government call these kind of people, <b>its people</b>
                                                                                                                          <br><br>
              As for followers,
                                                                                                                          <br><br>
              Mr Tan works for the government. He saw his boss, a state minister and even sometimes get to meet the head of government. So he knows that the government is running the country because Mr Tan is part of that government. he witnesses his boss leadership and where it took them and the people of Singapore exactly. He doesn't only believe that the government is well running but he knows it's run and even how it is run.
              The government call people like Mr Tan <b>its friend</b>
                                                                    <br><br>
               As for atheist,
                                                                    <br><br>
              Try bringing a man from an isolated island who since birth never saw anybody else aside from his own family to Singapore.
              He doesn't believe that there's so called government that runs Singapore. He believes so because he wants to be able to do just about anything he wants just like in his little isolated island. He never saw the world as we see it and is so convinced that whatever is happening in Singapore is because it is so and not because there is a government body running the country. No matter how Mr Tan is trying to tell him.
              The government call these kind of people<b> a rebel.</b>

              <p>The story u say is pretty unimpressive because all three of them experience different scenarios on a real thing such as governance. There is no real thing such as "god"... at least in the terms of science. Furthermore a person who is isolated from young and see properity and science will believe everything tat is told to them. They r not gonna go crazy and rebel because he see it himself tat the system is working. It is not like religion where everything is really just... reinterpreting reality and everything cannot be verified</p>
              <p>How about the below story</p>
              <p>3 people drifted to different isolated islands. One is a believer, one a follower ( wat is the diff between the 2 ?) and the last is an atheist. The believer, believe god will provide for him as long as he believe. He did not go and find food, or find water or find lodgings and just pray for god to deliver him out of this probem. He got his wish. He died soon due to lack of food. Now the follower also believe someone out there will provide for him and following god will give him ungodly advantage over others. Well if god is fair, then life is fair and no special advantages r given to him. He soon die as well. The atheist reach the island, and already knew tat his survival depends on himself solely. He find a steady food supply, find water and find ways and means to survive without hoping for supernatural intervention. After surviving for a long period of time, he manage to find help and survive.</p>

              <p>if you're going word for word, i think so. a muslim should be able to confirm. but in singapore, obviously stoning is out, so usually the family outcast the convert. but some muslims think a convert's life is all flowers and rainbows, with no impact.</p>
              <p>heck, i was a convert, and already had such a hard time - and i'm not a muslim, so i very much find it difficult to believe that muslim converts have no problems at all.</p>
              <p>there are all kinds of alternating views out there.</p>

              <p>Well but if the religion's scripture says so, and you belong to that religion, how are you to deny that? i.e. its your insignificant sense of human morality VS the word of a frightening God.</p>
              <p>I believe violent and inhumane scriptures in religion should be weeded out and censored, and religion should be modified and upgraded to comply with modern-day ethics so that even those literalists who want to do 100% what their religion tells them too wouldn't have to bomb anybody by following their religion like sheeps.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, should religious teachings be forced to be compliant with international human-rights laws, and local laws, or otherwise they'd be banned from their "religion" status? That religious leades have the role to ensure that inhumane teachings/scriptures should be openly denounced and detered to their sheeps, instead of guiding them towards hatred.</p>
