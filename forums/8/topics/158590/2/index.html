Agree?<br><br>What i'm trying to say is. It's one thing to experience exposure of life hence developing maturity and intelligence, it's another to fully express the [maturity and intelligence] - preferably in words(?)<br><br>A very brief example (this might seem bias, but the contrast is neccessary to make my personal point valid)<br><br>Girl 1<br>- Low Educated<br>- worked in This Fashion, Macdonalds, Cards and Such and other service industry(Misc industry)....etc<br>- Exposure of people and life : Plenty<br>- Communication : Life, work, home, love, music(9.33fm - not my preferance)<br>- No common interest and topic<br><br>Girl 2<br>- Higher educated (Dip)<br>- Workes in a company as a executive<br>- Exposure of people and life : Not as much as Girl 1<br>- Communication : Like girl 1, + theatre, music, holidays, history, pyschology, sociology, people, future.<br>- Common interest and topic + expressive<br><br>Personal Conclusion:<br><br>Girl 2, though she may not be more streetwise and intelligent as Girl 1.<br>But i can see that there are chances of growing in the relationship together.<br>Being able to express feelings and thoughts are very important to me.
