"(my name).. something something" they call out my name but still speak mandarin!!!</div></blockquote>Same here. My situation is very similar to a forumite here. I was very pro china when I was young. When anyone attacks China, I will defend for China. However, my opinion changed drastically this year. Why? I mingled with some PRCs in my class this year. Most (not all) of their character and attitude just irk me. Just to share with you guys one example out of the numerous stories i have,<br><br>It was an A Maths Logarthims Test. The fellar that sat beside me did not bring EVERYTHING. Pen, Correction Tape, Foolscap Paper, Calculator, Rubber. At first i felt that they could not adapt well to Singapore environment so I was rather friendly to them. So I lent him all those stationery. Now what happeneed furing the test greatly piss me off, even till now.<br><br>Anyone that took/is taking A Maths should know that its a must to use a calculator to solve most of the questions. So what that fellar did was that he just took my calculator and happily press and use. When I want to USE MY calculator, I cant. In the end, that snob fiinished the paper and was happily checking when i was furiously doing my sums. Very ludicrous indeed. Of course, a lesson learnt, never be too nice to anybody and speak up for my own rights.<br><br>Then most unfortunately I was in the same group with him in a physics project. His role in the group is like "Have you done this? Have you done that?" , when he himself did not do a single thing at all. We complained to the teacher. He denied everything and display that arrogant looks. Obviosly shrugging off all his responsibilities.<br><br>The same guy again. Everyone shd know that they can ace any subjects in Singapore (except English and maybe Biology) even if they sleep in class as they've learnt the concepts in China. This inconsiderate partner of mine, is always holding an English book and reading in class. Obviously nothing wrong with that. What I feel is wrong is that, he BUGS me every now and then for words and phrases in the book which he doesnt understand. Hallo, you dont need to listen in the chemistry lesson or whatever maths lesson but i need to ! I need to learn, dont you find that you are hindering my learning?<br><br>What is this? This is going too far!<br><br>Yes, yes. Ultimately it boils down to the fact that i am not bold enough to tell him off. For me, what i feel is the important lesson learnt is<br><br>1: More or less i got a better insight of the PRCs<br>2: Speak up for my own rights<br><br>Of course I just cant change omy perception of them just like that. The other PRCs in my class have serious atittude problem. Really makes me ponder why they want to come to Singapore and get 200 bucks per month from MOE if they are not here to learn.<br><br>Ultimately, I must say that i dont hate ALL the china people. Of course there msut be some that are kind. Sadly, I havent met them yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, all that I can say; it is apparent that a lot of "them", have not learned MANNERS.<br><br>You can go ask ten Joes and ten Janes on the street what they think of "them", and 9 out of 10 Joes or Janes will also have very negative impressions of "them".<br><br>To date, in Singapore, China's people have made themselves into a sort of Universal Disgust, with their following trademarks; Loud, Rude, Selfish, Inconsiderate, Thoughtless, Uncouth, Greedy, Manipulative, and Snobbish.<br><br>I agree, some Singaporeans have all of these traits too. But the ratio of meeting a local like that, is thankfully LOW. We have our blacksheeps yes, and at least we are aware of these ill character traits and are making conscious efforts to not be that way. But in the case of China's people, when you apprehend them like in the case of flash-photography in Night Safari, they react as if it is their Given Rights to be that way!<br><br>So there's the difference!<br><br>Even back in China, authorities constantly remind and "educate" their own people to "BEHAVE PROPERLY" when abroad.<br><br>Need I say more???<br><br>China in my opinion is a large piece of beautiful land. So much space, so steep in history and arts. But damn SAD, much of their people are like that!<br><br></div>
