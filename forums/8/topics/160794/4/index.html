Hint : not just singapore<br><br>BTW, I am a singaporean and i will always be a singaporean. And i am proud to be one. I think my way of showing that I am a proud singaporean is proper and justified. Well, you have your ways of showing that you are a proud singaporean, but....haiz....better refine yourself before you start blabbing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be fair, I've met a few good Chinese citizens, which is not the majority unfortunately. The majority of those who I've come across can be the kind to blame you when their mistakes are the cause of the trouble in the first place. Some of them unreasonably expect to be catered to like kings and queens. This culture I believe was developed as a result of the extreme speed in which China acquired its recent wealth without re-educating their citizens. Just like it would be difficult to have Bill Gates go down to the normal Singaporean level of a 5 room HDB flat with a 2 liter/1.6 liter car, it can be difficult for a poor farmer or contractor to get used to the niceties of Morton's Restaurant.<br><br>One scenario in Night Safari some Chinese tourists were told specifically not to use flash photography in English and Mandarin but still kept snapping away, until a Caucasian stepped up and said "Hey stop the flashes!" The Chinese tourists just glared at him like it was their godgiven right to flash away. Do you have any idea how a flash can freak out animals not socialized to it? My guess was that the incident months ago where a cat attached itself to a tourist's leg might have been caused by aggravating behavior on part of the tourist or someone else's. Most animals are smart enough to go for the one that pisses them off.<br><br>You must remember, having a one child policy not only ensures that two sets of grandparents and one set of parents dote on one child, which can lead to spoilt brats.<br><br>I know a Chinese businessman from Xiamen who actually detests doing business with them because they do not stick to their words and contracts. Imagine many years ago China had much stronger, better morals than many countries. They were whacked by Western countries who wanted parts of their territory, Britain and Portugal anyone?<br><br>I'm not promoting them and I don't really condone their occasional rogish behavior, having had much more worse experiences than good ones. Besides Eric07 I do not think that challenging someone to tell the Chinese people to their face you do not like them is very wise, instead of questioning someone's courage, you give me the impression you like to use numbers to intimidate people who disagree with you.<br><br>The odd thing here is, I've yet to read anything that says China has started wars of aggression like in the two world wars, however everyone is concerned about their rising power even though they've got no history of wanting to be like Nazi Germany. Why? We may see China proclaiming to be peaceful and only interested in economic power, organizations like the EU doing trade with them on goods that would normally be frowned upon like weapons, but we must also remember that politics is occasionally about treating your worst enemy like your best friend sometimes.</div>

I think the main issue here is not of descent and race but more of nationalities. I doubt racial issues were in the minds of HongKongers who left before 1997. It was more of nationalities.<br><br>Most Singaporeans are mutts and I'm part Singaporean too. My make up is Chinese and Malay with a tiny bit of Japanese and Portuguese. I'm proud to be a mutt racially.<br><br>There is no racial argument here, it has always been nationalities and it will never end. It's just a matter of how far it goes and how much humor is used to ease the tension. In my life I've lived with Singaporeans, Chinese Chinese, Malaysians, Vietnamese, Cambodians, Hongkongers, Americans, Swedish, Japanese and Koreans and we always have something to say about each other. We've never gotten into a fight of any kind because we usually poke fun at each other.<br><br>The key point here is, relak one korner la brudder!</div>
