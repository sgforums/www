Then again what does her reply tells us about the behaviour of Singaporeans north of the causeway?<br><br>The number of cases of maid abuse in Singapore is frightening. Every now and then I can hear and read such stories of maid abuse all the time!<br><br>The most disturbing thing is that a majority of maid abusers in S'pore are well educated professionals like lawyers, teachers etc.  At least hundreds of maids<br>have lost their lives working here in the past five years!!<br><br>It is really a shame that Singapore started modernising a few decades earlier than China but yet the mindset of so many Singaporeans are still so third world.<br><br>If anybody wants to hear, I still got lots of stories to tell.<br><br></div>

There are basically two groups of china man. Educated/cultured and Uneducated/uncultured I have come across these two types and frankly, those educated ones behave just like us singaporeans. Honest to god!<br><br>Those china tourist, construction workers, prostitutes etc that you experience in singapore is not the entire picture. If you wanna see the real china, come to china, free tour guide waiting  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>On the point of Singaporeans who travel abroad and being ugly, I have to defend that point too. I have come across a few groups of Singaporeans here in China. Seen them shopping, chatting at cafes (after shopping &amp; sight seeing), and just taking pictures. I could tell they were from Singapore the moment they started talking. Frankly, they don't shout or make a fool of themselves. I should say they behaved very graciously in a foreign country. I give those groups of Singaporeans two tumbs up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

In fact I have also seen Singaporeans fighting for taxis.<br>I have even seen Singaporeans quarrelling and coming to blows in a cinema bcos one party was chatting loudly with a friend or using a handphone.

Even for Singapore a small nation with only a 3.something miliion population, there are so many cases of uncivilised and barbaric behavior.<br><br>One of our common traits which I've personally seen once TOO MANY of local tourists... kapo whatever can kapo from the hotel room they stay... if they can bring the furniture home, they will cos they think that they have paid for it just from paying a few nights' stay... are we that glamorous then?<br><br>when our compatriots are overseas in restaurants, especially when in groups... they'll talk and laugh so bloody loud it can be heard almost the whole restautants... when you tell them to mellow down, they'll give you the kind of look like they own the damn restaurants... so here again, are we that gracious...<br><br>I remember I once had a conversation with a malaysian colleague when I just asked her casually why is there a rise in the number of cases of Singaporeans getting robbed in Johore and other parts of Malaysia? She looked at me coldly and said "If your people can stop behaving like village upstarts, they will not attract so much unwanted attention and will not be robbed so often".<br><br>I was really taken aback by her reply. Then again what does her reply tells us about the behaviour of Singaporeans north of the causeway?<br><br>The number of cases of maid abuse in Singapore is frightening. Every now and then I can hear and read such stories of maid abuse all the time!<br><br>The most disturbing thing is that a majority of maid abusers in S'pore are well educated professionals like lawyers, teachers etc.  At least hundreds of maids<br>have lost their lives working here in the past five years!!<br><br>It is really a shame that Singapore started modernising a few decades earlier than China but yet the mindset of so many Singaporeans are still so third world.<br><br>If anybody wants to hear, I still got lots of stories to tell.<br></div></blockquote>Hundreds of maids in past 5 years died in Singapore?! Are you sure that number's correct?<br><br>If you got stories to tell I think people also have la..relax. Anyway Singapore hires the most maids what so higher number can mean higher occurence right? I've yet to meet a Singaporean maid in another country.<br><br>Piracy's also a theft problem occuring often in Singapore true, but most people know where the original ones are sold, ALL, and I kid you not, ALL the Chinese friends of mine say in China, no one knows where the hell the original disks are sold. Want to buy also can't buy.<br><br>How about stealing nuclear technology from the United States?<br><br>Covering up the amount of SARS related deaths?<br><br>Driving tanks over unarmed citizens in a certain square?<br><br>Irrelevant right? They're not tourists what. So why bring the maid issue here?<br><br>Restaurants are meant to be quiet? Sure those high class ones are. I was at Melt last night, been to Mortons before. I still didn't hear anyone making a racket, Singaporean or Chinese.<br><br>You don't have to attract attention in order to be robbed in Malaysia. I'm a Malaysian who's a PR in Singapore. Who would rob the poor? If you're desperate and you see a guy wearing normal local clothing but stepping out of a Singapore car, the famous ones you've heard so much about due to their high prices, would you rob the guy driving a Singapore Wira or the one driving a Malaysian Wira? Who'd know the local situation to be able to hinder your robbery attempt better? The Malaysian or Singaporean?<br><br>I do agree Singapore has its fair share of ugly tourists, but so does Malaysia. I believe it's a mix of culture and upbringing though. My theory is that the reason why you hear about so much bad Singaporean trivial stuff is because there's a lack of any sensational matters to report. I doubt the Detroit local paper covers ugly tourists who steal cutlery, when during one year which I forgot, a murder occured in that city every 7 seconds.<br><br>Well educated doesn't mean you're always behaving properly you know. NKF case? Nike's alleged child labor employment? Enron?<br><br>Blueray I can understand what you say though, I do agree sometimes Singaporeans also push a bit of limit..want free things, everything must argue/bargain, but who doesn't want free stuff and bargains? It's just a matter of how much effort you put into it, but generally they do behave overseas.
