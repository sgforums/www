            <div class='col-md body'>So what they are all what you guys say what they are? They are what they are and we just have to accept what they are. Who are we to go insult their way of life? What right do we have to go insult them? Let them be, they have their own culture, we have our own. Bottom line, please don't go disgrace our nation by insulting and acting like holigans. On a contrary some of you guys seem to behave like THEM.<br><br></div>

They have given you that impression because they are capable to do so. Point is, why go aggravate a big bully? The insults you guys throw at them will make their cause stronger when they start to attack (very low chance). Would you snatch a candy away from a boy two times larger than you? Or throw stones at him?<br><br>BTW, your skin colour is the very basic of your existance here on earth, you think of the present and future, but never looked/considered of your pass.
