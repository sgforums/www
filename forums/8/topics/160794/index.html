            <div class='col-md body'>The Chinese used to be the most civilised people on the planet. It's sad that the 1911 revolution and the civil war that ensued, in addition to the Cultural Revolution of the Mao era, have combined to destroy much of the excellent cultural and moral heritage of imperial China. The current generation of Chinese grew up under the pernicious influence of the old Communist system, which rewarded mendacious, cheating and dishonest behaviour. Also, they are exposed to the worst of Western consumerism due to the rapid liberalisation of their economy. These are the underlying factors for the uncouth and unruly behaviour of Chinese tourists these days.<br><br>However, before we apply too harsh criticisms on Chinese tourists, have we looked at ourselves first? I'm sure the ugly Singaporean tourist is just as bad as the Chinese one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Movies, films, drama serials constantly potray chinese people from China as money-grubbers, as people out to cheat others. How many times we hear this year about someone from China coming to our country to do bad things? And personal encounters with them make me disgusted with them at times. I once saw a few of them  spitting on the floor inside  Wisma Atrium! Why are they bringing their bad habits into our country?<br><br>I am not saying singaporeans are the perfect tourists. I admit we go to other countries and disgrace ourselves, by always filling our plates with food as if there is no tomorrow, we constantly ask for cheaper prices, but at least we don't go someone's country and just spit! that's the way of uncivilsed people!</div>
