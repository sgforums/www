            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ppl!<br>What criteria do you look for when looking for a good gf/wife to be?<br><br>Mine are...<br><br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>1. Other guy's girlfriend or wife/wife-to-be. Period.<br>2. Girls who has a bad family background. There will be a high chance that if the girl's siblings or parents are the unfaithful type... that girl will be the same too. It runs in the family.<br>3. Girls who can co-habit easily are out too.<br>4. Girls who frequent nightspots too many times a month or those who work in nightspot line.<br>5. Girls whose friends are mostly male. Girls who friendly to every male. There must be a strange reason why the same gender boycott her.<br>6. Girls who have more than 5 boyfriends in her life. 5 tries and none worked? Unlucky? I doubt so.<br>7. Girls who are jobless for a long time with no aspiration for life..aka lazy bum.<br>8.Girls who are constantly fed a diet of trashy female magazines, watch crap such as Desperate Housewives and like them are no-no either. You have been warned.<br>9.Girls who turn their nose up and get indignant at the mentioning of cooking and cleaning, thinking they're chores for 'lower class' people like maids - beware of the spoilt princess. It is the litmus test - mentioning cooking. It's not the ability to cook, it's her reaction and her attitude towards such things. The girl who can't cook but is willing to make an effort to give a try and treat her guy a nice homemade meal gets major points too. The girl who flys into a rage and automatically assumes you're going to make her your personal domestic slave deserves a bitchslap. Dining out is great too, but sniff out the princesses and cut them out from your life.<br><br>I'm not trying to be a sexist here... but good girls are really... really hard to find nowadays.<br><br>Cheers to all! Happy V-day advance!</div>

I think what he doesnt realise is... if the girl loves you, she will try to be the best gf/wife she can be for you.<br><br>And... if the girl doesn't love you, she can fulfill all of the above, but simply not wish to do so for you.<br><br>It will be difficult though, to find someone who will love you for who you are, given that you are already so critical and judgemental before you enter the relationship.<br><br></div>

You can love her/him to begin with only because the imperfections visible to you were bearable - i.e. you were already attracted to her looks, her character, her personality. However, relationships break up when they discover sometimes some other imperfections that they simply cannot tolerate. As for lasting relationships, I think people stay happiest longest with the person whose faults they can tolerate the most. It's all kind of selfish really. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

Girls who friendly to every male. There must be a strange reason why the same gender boycott her.<br>6. Girls who have more than 5 boyfriends in her life. 5 tries and none worked? Unlucky? I doubt so.<br>7. Girls who are jobless for a long time with no aspiration for life..aka lazy bum.<br>8.Girls who are constantly fed a diet of trashy female magazines, watch crap such as Desperate Housewives and like them are no-no either. You have been warned.<br>9.Girls who turn their nose up and get indignant at the mentioning of cooking and cleaning, thinking they're chores for 'lower class' people like maids - beware of the spoilt princess. It is the litmus test - mentioning cooking. It's not the ability to cook, it's her reaction and her attitude towards such things. The girl who can't cook but is willing to make an effort to give a try and treat her guy a nice homemade meal gets major points too. The girl who flys into a rage and automatically assumes you're going to make her your personal domestic slave deserves a bitchslap. Dining out is great too, but sniff out the princesses and cut them out from your life.<br><br>I'm not trying to be a sexist here... but good girls are really... really hard to find nowadays.<br><br>Cheers to all! Happy V-day advance!</div></blockquote>Fully agree with u,man! Look is not a very important criteria..It's yr character that shines!! I encounter a girl whose BG is not very gd and has a previous 10 r/s... Turn out to be a horrible experience for me! Another I know,hardly has any female friend but many male friend.Cos she is super arrogant and piss off many of female gender.While other criteria I think is widely supported one.</div>
