Other guy's girlfriend or wife/wife-to-be. Period.<br>2. Girls who has a bad family background. There will be a high chance that if the girl's siblings or parents are the unfaithful type... that girl will be the same too. It runs in the family.<br>3. Girls who can co-habit easily are out too.<br>4. Girls who frequent nightspots too many times a month or those who work in nightspot line.<br>5. Girls whose friends are mostly male. Girls who friendly to every male. There must be a strange reason why the same gender boycott her.<br>6. Girls who have more than 5 boyfriends in her life. 5 tries and none worked? Unlucky? I doubt so.<br>7. Girls who are jobless for a long time with no aspiration for life..aka lazy bum.<br>8.Girls who are constantly fed a diet of trashy female magazines, watch crap such as Desperate Housewives and like them are no-no either. You have been warned.<br>9.Girls who turn their nose up and get indignant at the mentioning of cooking and cleaning, thinking they're chores for 'lower class' people like maids - beware of the spoilt princess. It is the litmus test - mentioning cooking. It's not the ability to cook, it's her reaction and her attitude towards such things. The girl who can't cook but is willing to make an effort to give a try and treat her guy a nice homemade meal gets major points too. The girl who flys into a rage and automatically assumes you're going to make her your personal domestic slave deserves a bitchslap. Dining out is great too, but sniff out the princesses and cut them out from your life.<br><br>I'm not trying to be a sexist here... but good girls are really... really hard to find nowadays.<br><br>Cheers to all! Happy V-day advance!</div></blockquote>Wow, such many requirements you have!!! While most of us do have requirements in looking for our life partner/soulmate, most of the requirements are in our subconcious. While you have listed your requirements, we would like to know if the any of the female population view you as a potential partner. No use if you want this and that, but the other side does not give a hoot about you. You may try looking for that special person throughout your life to only realise that you have wasted life with such requirements that most probably does not exist. You are looking for someone perfect. But are you perfect??? Get down from your high horse. Cherish your loved one for who he or she is. No one is ever perfect!!!</div>
