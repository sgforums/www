            <div class='col-md body'>Essay celebrating my mother's return<br>====================================<br><br>The development of ideas and meta-creations goes together with the development of diseases and epidemics. The german philosopher GWF. Hegel developed his phenemenology of mind fully - he died of cholera outbreak. The lesson learnt is that development in one area corresponds to the lack of awareness in another area. Had Hegel be more interested in cleanliness than God, he would have made an excellent medical student and could have prevented or escape his fate.<br><br>The important point is that eash of us must deal with dirt and dispose and handle them personally. It is the most basic concept, that cleanliness is the idea of forgetting self-deterioration. The study of GOD is as good as the study of animals. It is a sidestep to the understanding of how we can distance ourselves from animals. The study of cleanliness distances ourselves from bacteria and harmful viruses.<br><br>False names are like the container to the things that we really want. People who display themselves with false descriptive names represent the form of arousal that we want, the cumulation of its ideas, the most important idea is offspring and descendents.<br><br>Since people have names whether real or not, they best represent discrete ideas that our brains are so used to sensing from the environment. For eg. a female with a name (Ding Ching Ching) reminds me of the idea of cleanliness and the sound that comes from the clash of eating utensils after i have cleaned them.<br><br>Everything that we do or sense can be described, and these descriptions can be found among the names of people. This study may not be a scientific one, if it is true merely because of a coincidence of concepts and soundings then it helps in situational immersiveness.<br><br>We often take for granted everything we sense yet our names can describe these. For eg. a name with the character HUA this character has the element of HUman and LADLE. The cross may represent a counter or a table. The character describes the art of serving foods with a ladle or being served by a ladle. It describes most interactive situations: the exchange of money for service or product, eating, serving customers, my parents both have the HUA character. This means its meaning is no stranger to me. It is the base of all my experiences<br><br>Their parents names describes more older concepts which i interpret: Gathering of fruits, replenishment, water and tree, control manage and punish. What this means is that I am no stranger to these concepts. They are broad ideas on one hand, and they are a reference to my grandparents on the other hand.<br><br>Broad ideas can be derived into discrete specific ones. My uncles' and aunties names for eg. obviously are derivative in meaning from my grandparents. Even though they are named after, I am only assuming the ideas in the name are derived. Their children's names and meanings are my relatives and relative ideas as well.<br><br>Relatives are closer to me than strangers. The meanings in the names that refer to my relatives, are more familiar to me than a one held by a stranger. On the other hand, my name is a concept that is not readily familiar to the stranger. Eg. My Sir's name means Will to knowledge. My name means Build up Certification. Perhaps some concepts that are stranger to me otherwise I would have been exhausted if they are familiar.<br><br>-Zapped by 9V battery<br></div>
