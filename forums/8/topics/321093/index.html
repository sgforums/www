              <p>While it has been more than a year since that incident which shocked the world happened. It was commited by a south korean student who was a bully victim himself and it resulted in 32 tragic deaths. For more info, go to</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_massacre</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Ok what i was wondering is this, will such killing spree happen in singapore schools? I had just read a recent report which shows that more than 90% of our students here had experienced bullying before and up to 30% of em are still being constantly bullied. This report appeared on the newspaper some time ago too. As a student myself, I had had experiences with bullies and i find that this report is more or less the truth ( u ppl out there should know ). Although we are unable to purchase guns, i think that it is fairly easy to obtain a knife or some sort of sharp object and smuggle it into school. If such a thing would one day happen, wouldn't it be too late to regret? Will such an incident be the second " Mas Selamat" case whereby everything boils down to the problem of complacency? Whereby we have not learnt a lesson from our American friends who had experienced such a "disaster"? With the ever-increasing stress in which students have and with the problem of bullying, such a case becomes more of a threat as days past. Who know? It may not be long before such devastation happens.</p>

              <p>While enough of my irritating babblering, i just wanna know what are all of your views on this? Discuss :)</p>

              <p>Without a gun, a assailant can be overpowered by many people if he's not in his guard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For instance, if the assailant is in the carpark, a teacher can use his car to run down the guy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Lol your point sure is funny. But imagine if there is even one person dying because of this incident, wouldn't it be tragic? And besides, nowadays student all so hum, i think they would rather save their asses than try to overpower the assailant. While from my POV, the creep could easily claim 2~3 lives before anything happens. Yeah btw the police doesn't come as fast as they should nowadays too. So the result i guess you should understand....</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>While most sg schools now have sercurity guards stationed to ensure the safety of the students. However i find that they seldom patrol around the school and tend to just stick themselves near the gate. Also, like what you said they are retirees, so i kindda doubt their physical ability to actually prevent such an incident if it were to happen ( sry to the sercurity aunty and uncle down there ). And one more thing, they are not armed :)</p></div>

              <p>While such thing don't have a high chance of happening, i do think moe shuld take a more serious stance. Cause i really don't want anybody injured or killed just because we didn't take this problem seriously. Also with the trend of following whatever the western folks do at their motherland, such a violent culture surely one day emerge in SG.</p>

              <p>Jeopardy--possibility of massacre happeing in sg?</p>
              <p>Ability--what ability does the assailant have to commit such act?</p>
              <p>Opportunity--does the prospective assailant have the opportunity to commit such act?</p>
              <p>to get guns in sg is actually quite high. though many do not know it. but still the possibility for a prospective assailant to get a gun here is still pretty low ard 50% rate.</p>
              <p>most likely, s/he will be armed with a melee weapon. even if the students ran away to save their own sorry ass like everyone else..the school stuff cannot do anything like that. and such crimes will result in police coming in 15 mins or less.</p>
              <p>with a strict arm act in here, it greatly removes the chances of such incidents in sg. as for the possibility for maybe 1 or 2 students loss..if can save much more then really bobian..students die by the dozens anyway.</p>
              <p>so similiar incidents in sg very hard to acheive such good results like elsewhere.</p>

              <p>There are some points you said that i agree.</p>
              <p>- Strict arms act reduces the damage a assailant can cause</p>
              <p>- Reduces no of death involve</p>
              <p>However regarding ability and opportunity, i believe that a suicidal person who has only revenge on his/her mind will be strong enough to cause harm and death.</p>
              <p>No matter how weak a person is, as long as he/she is armed with a weapon, that person IS dangerous.</p>
              <p>There are plenty of opportunity to commit such a crime, i think you would have the knowledge of how easy it is to just bring a pen knife in and say its for a school project, or perhaps hide a chopper in the bag and bring it into school. No one is gonna know unless u screw up.</p>
              <p>If u r suggesting that the random bag checks that is used to prevent such a incident, i don't think it is that effecient. Firstly, schools nowadays actually warn the students when the bag checks are coming. If i was the assailant i would just wait another day. Secondly, we have to take into consideration that the assailant could hide the weapon in the school just before the bag check. Thats what most student do to their hp btw to prevent them from being confiscated.</p>
              <p>Lastly. 15 mins could = 15 deaths , a complete massacre.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">nice points being brought up. a pen knife is hardly suffice to do much dmg xcept to oneself. one reason being range of wep. 2nd being the durability of the wep. a conventional pen knife(not pocket knife or folding knife) is hardly hardy and brekas pretty easily.</div>
              <div class="quote_body">however,if other melee weps are  taken into consideration, will have to depend if its full tang for it to last longer. but melee weps dont really deal that much dmg.</div>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_body">random bag checks does not prevent shit if announced. but again..melle weps sucks at such situation to do dmg.</div>
              <div class="quote_body">its quite impossible to kill 1 person per min using a melee wep.</div>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_body">what u should be concerned is how easy it is to make IEDs and other home made bombs to use in sch.<br></div>
