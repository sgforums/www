              <p>Btw our culture is already not original, with all those western influence and stuff. Like for example the goth trend. And with every change our environment gets a little more violent.</p>
              <p>Regarding the herd mentality, i think it'll do more damage as more people are involve. A sucidal person really don't need to be that creative also -.-''''</p>

              <p>Not true, one can easily kill more then 1 person per min with a melee weapon if he knows what he's doing and trains for it.</p>
              <p>We just had the recent case of Tomohiro Kato which killed 7 people mainly with his knife in a very short period of time.</p>
              <p>As opposed to random frenzied stabbing, if the person goes for vital targets like the neck and slit the throat or stabs the side of the neck, a lot of people will die if they don't know how to defend themselves. All it takes is one slash and the person's fate is sealed, he'll just bleed out.</p>
              <p>Given sufficent acess to a large number of victims (like trapped in a pre locked classroom with nowhere to run), the element of surprise and proper, premeditated training and knowledge of anatomy, a maniac on a slashing/stabbing spree can cause a lot of damage. The best option then would be to fight back and swarm the attacker, and not to cower in fear and run away.</p>

              <p>And BTW, it's very easy to kill a person with a paper cutter if you know what you are doing... and sometimes you don't even need any weapons at all, off the bat I can think of several techniques that allow me to end a life with bare hands in very short order.</p>
              <p>The solution is not to try to remove all possible danger by removing every possible weapon, it is to teach our kids how to protect themselves and remove themselves from danger or act to defend their own lives.</p>

              <p>you are saying that fast kill can happen if the assailant is trained in some ways.</p>
              <p>in a classroom scenario. the most body count will be around 3 before anyone can run out of the class.at this point, some "heroes" would be confronting the assailant.</p>
              <p>unless the assailant is pretty accurate with his wep, the body count will be pretty low. of cuz all this are just conjecture. we just need some specimens to run this experiment to gain more informative data.</p>

              <p>domonkassy ~ I think can make one using fertiliser and hydrogen peroxide right?  But considering the mixture to be so unstable and approx measurement of every ingredient is essential, i guess they would either hurt themselves while making it or go back to the conventional way.</p>
              <p>SIngaporeTrex ~ Yes! Finally someone who agrees to my view :D</p>
              <p>Its really possible for a person to kill many others in a short period of time, especially female students who are physically weaker. 2~3 could easily go down before anything happens and with the chaos from all the running around, the casaulties will increase.</p>
