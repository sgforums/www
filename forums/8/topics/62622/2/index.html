They will get their contacts from their agents and check if the contacts fulfills their target audience selection criteria. Those surveys you do on the road are not by professional survey companies.<br><br>And oh yes, please refrain from making statements that has the "You are ignorant, let me correct you" message within.

It's your choice. However, it's forumites' choice then to decide if they want to have their destiny analyzed by you if you collect a fee. So there's a give and take situation here.. which is healthy.<br><br>However, the street surveys, there's no fair give and take. It's always the buskers who are taking the info and the innocent passerbys giving information. Hence, I'm only asking for my fair share of taking.. i.e. to be paid for my info.<br><br>Personal info, likes and dislikes and demographics are very valuable and should not be given out so easily. Even online when websites ask for personal particulars, I NEVER give my true personal info, even my preference. If I need to do a survey so that I can get access to info, it would always be the first option, regardless of what qn they ask. E-mail addy would be a junk account that I've set up for this kinda purpose and phone numbers are always fake.<br><br>Many times, I had those street pests thrusting their surveys right in my face when I'm waiting for the traffic lights to change to cross the road. They figured since I had time to waste waiting for the lights to change, I can do their survey. Even then, I wouldn't give out my info, unless I get paid.<br><br>So, I always decline them in a manner that they realize their stupidity for asking me in the best polite manner that I know. I don't care if I appear bad to them in their opinion. It doesn't bother me as they dunno who I am coz they didn't pay for that info. haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>None of my family members answers any surveys anymore. All trained by me to make those street leeches appear stupid. hahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>They can very well make a living somewhere else if they find folks like me tough to handle!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>
