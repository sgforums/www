            <div class='col-md body'>Tuesday August 29, 10:17 PM<br>Priests, helpers at Novena Church sued over alleged exorcism<br><br>SINGAPORE : The Novena Church, two priests and seven helpers are being sued for an alleged act of exorcism, in an incident believed to have taken place two years ago.<br><br>Fifty-year old Amutha Valli Krishnan, an athlete in the 1980s, claimed that attempts to exorcise her later led to chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.<br><br>A writ of summons was served last Thursday.<br><br>In the writ, Amutha Valli claimed that on 10 August 2004, she went to Novena Church to pray with her son, daughter and a close friend.<br><br>But she fainted.<br><br>She is alleging that two priests from the church, Father Simon Tan and Father Jacob Ong, claimed she had been possessed by a spirit, and then performed an act of exorcism, helped by seven others.<br><br>The ritual is said to have lasted two-and-a-half hours, during which time Amutha claimed she had resisted furiously.<br><br>She claimed she was strangled, pinned down and verbally abused.<br><br>When contacted, Father Tan claimed Amutha Valli did not faint in church.<br><br>In fact, he said, she had walked in asking for help, saying she was possessed.<br><br>Father Tan also denied any act of exorcism.<br><br>He said he, Father Ong and another seven helpers only performed prayers over her.<br><br>Amutha Valli's claims against the defendants include trespass, assault, false imprisonment and negligence.<br><br>She is also asking for damages for loss of income and injuries.<br><br>Her husband, Suppiah Jeyabal, said, "Before, she was an athlete and ... a very tough person, you know, who (liked) to exercise; she must run, exercise. She also used to coach children - a very tough and active person. But now she's more like a vegetable."<br><br>A medical report by Changi General Hospital psychiatrist states Amutha Valli's symptoms are a direct result of the traumatic incident she experienced at the church.<br><br>It says currently her symptoms are persistent, severe and extremely disabling.<br><br>According to the report, this has affected her ability to cope with self-care, demands at home and relationships with family.<br><br>The doctor added she would require long-term treatment and follow-up, and is unlikely to fully recover from her symptoms.<br><br>Amutha Valli's lawyer said it is still too early to comment, but he believed this is the first such case in Singapore.<br><br>The lawyer for the defendants says his clients deny liability and will file their defence by September 16.<br><br>The civil suit is estimated to cost at least a million dollars. - CNA /ct <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
