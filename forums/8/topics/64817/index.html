I don't expect her to be a good cook or capable at housework. Those things can be handled by a maid. All I ask for is her understanding, support, care and love. And in return, I'll do the same for her.<br><br>No clear distinction of a man's role and a woman's role for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

They are becoming more career minded and will be financially stable thus the past concept of woman needing the man to provide for the family is gone. Although physically they will still lose out but who need strength when u know how to use your beauty, brain and $$$.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
