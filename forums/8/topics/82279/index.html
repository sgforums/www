            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">by Pak Cham Kai (with contributions from Nyonya Kway, Ayam Panggang and DJ Jeff)</span><br><br>Upset that their prospective Prime Minister has been foisted upon them by a series of closed door Â‘kaki-langÂ’ meetings, Singaporeans are demanding Â‘Singapore IdolÂ’ style voting for their future leaders.<br><br>Â“Wah lan eh,Â” said Bukit Gorblok GRC resident Mrs. Fann Tay-Seah, Â“We can vote who we think is the best Singaporean singer following televised auditions, an open performance contest and finally, a direct one-phone one vote system. But our prime minister, leh?Â”<br><br>Mrs Tay-Seah was referring to the feeling that Deputy Prime Minister Barry Lee was effectively handed the prime ministership by having a group of ministers nominate him, then having a caucus of MPs (not) suggest an alternative, then finally having the Central Executive Committee endorse him.<br><br>Â“Did any MP or Minister consult their constituents to see if they were really representing the peopleÂ’s choice?Â” asked Mrs. Tay-Seah. Â“How can like that?Â”<br><br>The PAPÂ’s Electioneering Steering Committee Chairman, Mr. Gerry Mandhir, refuted this. Â“Look, such complaints are a nonsense. If the people want someone else to be Prime Minister, then they can easily vote one in during the next General Election. ItÂ’s not like weÂ’ll put any obstacles in their way or what. Right?Â”<br><br>However, many voters conceded that electoral transparency was not actually a high priority in demanding an Â‘IdolÂ’ process.<br><br>Â“Acherly,Â” said Tampenis resident Diana Lee Gah Mo, Â“I think a Â‘Minister IdolÂ’ contest would be a great way for our MPs to show what theyÂ’re made of. Often, we donÂ’ch really know what our MP is like. Often, we boh pian kena stuck with whoever the Gahmen sticks us with, and then walkover some more and next thing you know, theyÂ’re in charge and kissing our babies. This way, we actually get to hear and see the song and dance theyÂ’re peddling.Â”<br><br>Â“Betul,Â” agreed Hong Kan GRC resident Paula binte Abdul, Â“We know that the Men in White all can talk cock, but with a Minister Idol contest, we can also find out if they can sing song.Â”<br><br>Â“Anyway,Â” said Mrs Fann Tay-Seah. Â“Why should the Gahmen object to subjecting themselves to an Â‘IdolÂ’ contest? They already want us to idol worship their candidate, so fairÂ’s fair, whaaaat.Â”<br><br>The Gahmen may, indeed, be listening. Mr. Mandhir said that they are taking the peopleÂ’s feedback on board and have elicited the help of MediaCock, the GahmenÂ’s mouthpiece.<br><br>Plans are now being put in place to hold Â‘Minister IdolÂ’ auditions at community centres in all government-held constituencies.<br><br>Said MediaCock spokesman Quah Kao Hsian, Â“A show trying to find prospective Ministers should actually be called Â‘Who Wants to be a Millionaire?Â’ but that title was already taken.Â”<br><br>MediaCock has also flown in the American Idol judges, Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell to offer criticisms of the contestants. Said Mr. Quah, Â“This is only right. After all, foreign talents are much more able to tell us what kind of leadership is needed than we ourselves.Â”<br><br>Mr. Quah continued, Â“This will be a very rigourous exercise that will put contestants through every conceivable test to see if they have what it takes to be a Minister Idol.Â”<br><br>The contestants will be tested on:<br><br>- Their appearance. Contestants will be judged on how well they look in all-white, and also in windcheaters;<br><br>- Their sensitivity. Contestants must have good skin, meaning thin enough such that when pricked, they must quickly put on a defamation suit.<br><br>- Their performance. How well can they dance to the partyÂ’s tune?<br><br>- Their vocal strength. Can they sing the same old song?<br><br>There will even be a FearFactor segment, where contestants will be asked to shake hands with a pork butcher and tested on how long they can stand it before they feel compelled to wash their hands.<br><br>In a test run of the process, this reporter went before the 3 foreign judges and performed the classic tune, Â“This Old ManÂ”.<br><br>Here were their reactions:<br><br>Randy Jackson: WhatÂ’s up, dawg? WhatÂ’s happeninÂ’ yÂ’all? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You did your thing. It was aiiight, know what IÂ’m sayinÂ’? IÂ’m down with it.<br><br>Paula Abdul: I could really feel that you really poured out your heart and soul, which is great, because to be a Minister Idol, you shouldnÂ’t have any heart or soul. Excellent, excellent work.<br><br>Simon Cowell: I hate to say this, but that was awful. Sorry, but we need people of the absolutely top level, not just enough to run some backwater constituency with no MRT station. This is Minister Idol, not Potong Pasir Idol. Not good enough.<br><br>Although notices of the auditions have been circulating for a week now, MediaCock says that response is slow. Said Mr. Quah, Â“WeÂ’re not sure why.Â”<br><br>An informal poll on the street, however, revealed the reason.<br><br>Said pedestrian Chin Lay See, Â“Eh, money good bur not easy, leh. They say to be Minister Idol requires a lot of work, but then like that, how can call it Â‘idleÂ’? How can be hardworking and idle at the same time? Very the confousing.Â”<br><br>Others feel that even the Minister Idol process is insufficiently transparent.<br><br>Â“In American Idol, we got Fantasia,Â” said Idol fan Quah Tee Vee. Â“Hoping that the Minister Idol process will actually improve voter legitimacy is pure fantasy.Â”<br><br>from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">www.talkingcock.com</a></div>
