Not sure if this is a hoax, but it's better be safe than sorry.  Note that this email was forwarded twice, therefore, there are two messages below.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br>Ladies , FYI - no harm taking precaution.... warn yr daughters/girlfriends too if u have any.... men.., you may want to pass this info to your wife.<br><br>Ladies who are driving, be aware/alert too, okay ?<br><br>ya, i experienced it before.. but mine happened around 9++pm. The cab which i was in, stopped at the traffic stop line while waiting for it to turn green.. then suddenly 2 indians cross over the road and wanted to open the door, although they saw me inside the cab. luckily the taxi driver was alert and he quickly locked the door... cant imagine if they got into my cab..<br><br>&gt;====================================================<br><br>Dear ladies,<br><br>Please be careful....<br><br>Forwarded message...<br><br>Hi everyone,<br>Just a word of caution to everyone travelling at night .... I was on my<br>way home on Saturday (23rd March) night at around 2:30 am after dropping off Jenn, from Areza's party when my taxi was slowed down by a group of what looked like either Thai or mainland Chinese workers. There was bunch of them though I can't remember how many to be exact.<br><br>They kind of walked towards us in the middle of the road... as he was slowing down, my taxi driver did an auto lock of the cab from his seat. However, in the state of panick I actually unlocked my door thinking that I was locking it even though I know the driver already locked it. What happened next was really shocking as one of the guys, looking straight into my face, pulled my door open.<br><br>Luckily, before he could do anything, (as the taxi was still moving though slowly), I pulled the cab door shut back and locked myself... By then the road ahead was clear and the taxi drove off.<br><br>I was shocked that I didn't even look back, but I guess they didn't chase after us.That was really a narrow escape. Even though nothing happened to me, I just cannot stopped imagining if the guys actually got hold of me and drag me out of the moving cab. Would the taxi driver come out and rescue me from the guys or would he have sped off to get help by which time help arrive, it would probably be too late??<br><br>It is creepy thinking how our safe country is getting more and more<br>dangerous now. The message here, is please be careful everyone especially girls travelling on your own at night. Make sure you lock all the taxi/car doors and if possible don't seat too near the door, making it more difficult for anyone reach you from outside.<br><br>Better be safe than sorry!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><img src="http://dgl.microsoft.com/thumbnails/j028/j0282186(t).gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah that's why I always lock the car doors...even in day time. And when I need to leave the car for a minute and my sister or girlfriend is inside...I always tell them to lock all doors and unlock for no one except me.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sohguanh:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmmm.... seems our foreign talent is getting bolder and daring. Locals be careful.</div></blockquote>These are not foreign talents... They're just FOREIGN WORKERs.... And that's not the WORSE... Talk about ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  This was already FORESEEN...<br><br>With the current REGRESSION, CRIME RATE goes up... The 'stopper' (Not stop completely but slow down process somehow) would be the fact that people usually would have a sense of belonging naturally and a subconscious not to do harm to their own homeland and environment... Taking into consideration of the welfare of their relatives and friends... Also, it would not be easy for them to get away as they're REGISTERED citizens of Singapore... Singapore's not that big to capture them either...<br><br>But with FOREIGN WORKERS.... They naturally more BOLD (Due to background environment...) One tends to get BOLDER (not all, due to circumstances I deem inappropriate to discuss here) when aboard.... If they're ILLEGAL, they're NOT REGISTERED. It's DIFFICULT to track them down for the crimes they commit here... MOST of them can go into a state of 'no after worries' which is a SEVERE pre-crimminal state... 1. Foreign workers with no family have no 'after worries', situation might be much WORSE back in their homeland, so they might decide to strike here instead... 2. Foreign workers  with or without family, original intention is to earn $ here... After they fail their objective, going back would be meaningless for them... Lost of direction in life, hence go into 'no after worries' state.... 3. They're usually less educated, hence do not think of consequences... When they lose their jobs or meet with problems in living in a foreign country, they might not have someone reliable to turn to... Hence, easier for them to drift apart...<br><br>Please note also that accumulated foreign population within a native country could pose serious problems on the long run when not under good administrative control... That has HAPPENED before in history... That's why governments are usually relunctant to take in illegal immigrants escaping from their country (People in DESPERATE STATE).....</div>
