              <p>Im a fresh grad from NP, well i have to say, i've witness some chicks in my cohort trying to be close with our lect, but to no avail, the lect are stern and firm in their stand, those girls still get F while im getting the A *laughs*. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes there's this lect that clubs tgt. But nth much, jus a usual hang out for us tgt as a class (well club mean not the whole class).  He's jus making sure we do our best for our sems we benefit for our futre = he benefits as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just my personal opinion you may or may not agree, but some shyts do happen and poly girls are old enough to think for themselves how they're going to be in the future, it's a major milestone (3 years) for all of them. If they're loose enough to open up to lect, well, they'll be loose enough to open up to the rest of the world, their boss in future, any big-CEOs willing to sign contract with her.... Sluts in the making what to say? we blame the lect for being what they're made of?</p>
              <p>If any of u guys here were given a free meal to devour, would u blindly reject it and tell me no regrets? Hardly convincing seriously... However I'm not totally siding the lect, as they have a important role to play in this too, they're supposed to set example and not sink them deeper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've got this teacher in my secondary school days, he's a gay, and he hangs out with students very too often, joke around too much, we love him (as a teacher and nth more). He shared he's personal stuffs with us, but he never get physical with any of us. well it worked well, our grades went up, however words got to the principle (from some reded-eye nerdy girls) and he's fired after.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most girls nowadays are quite loose, and had to say very very naive, they are like lost sheeps trying to cling onto the flow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Girl A : "Seee my photo shots, nice?"</p>
              <p>Girl B: "WOW"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Few days later ...</p>
              <p>Girl B: "See i've done photo shots at bla bla bla"</p>
              <p>This i can say is 1 of the most typical behaviour girls in singapore has. Let's not talk about branded bags here... we know how many started carrying brands like a sheep flock...</p>

              <p>So your conclusion is that the girl here is to be blamed ?</p>
              <p>No.. it's the lecturer who is at fault because he is abusing his position as a teacher to play with this girl for his personal pleasure.   </p>

              <p>I am a fresh SP student. Just joined Engineering school only. </p>
              <p>Already my lecturer shared his MSN &amp; Facebook account details with classmates. When he talks female students, I realise he's a bit nicer than to guys. Tone is nicer and smiles. To guys, it's like "heck" attitude. </p>
              <p>Why is it that SP lecturer seem to be giving out MSN to students? Actually, I don't think it's right for them to do this as it's not fair to those who don't want to use. Come to school, got questions to ask, just ask or send email.</p>
              <p>Also, why must lecturer <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>act nice</strong></span> to students ? I find it so artificial and forced and the girls in groups just giggle and laugh at their silly jokes.</p>
              <p>If there is a motive to this behaviour, I don't approve of it.</p>

              <p>There's nothing wrong in chit chatting casually. But subjects on sex are way beyond the boundaries of decency between a lecturer/teacher and students. It is most unprofessional of that teacher.</p>
