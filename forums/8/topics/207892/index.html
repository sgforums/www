            <div class='col-md body'>Ok life was pretty bored for a IT analyst like me as I pretty much struggle my life thru many monotonous moment at work. I love my job... perhaps not that much as I used to believe. My life consist of nothing more than just work, games, Occasional pubbing and some sports. That's how I managed to get to know Kacey or rather to know Kacey again. Kacey was in the same lecture as I am while back then in Poly. She wasn't those type which you'll immediately gotten to like at first sight, but you'll graduately fell in love with her. I wasn't  really much fantasizing her in anyway but just thinking she is one of those better looking girls among the few available in the IT faculty. I didn't know her much though in the past. Needless to say I didn't fell in love then but if given a choice, she'll be the top few choices I would have choosen. That's left of my memories of Kacey back then. Perhaps now is the time which God had so given upon I could get to know her well. I met her at the pub thru a friend of mine. Had a couple of conversation, met a couple of times more... took the number and at long last managed to get her to join me for a soothing Jazz concert. She agreed. So here I am waiting for her at the carpark. In a mommentary leaspes of anxiety she appeared. In a rather apporiate black dress. Not too short and not too long. What does attract my attention is her demurity which seems to auora a fragrance of sweetness accompanying a taste of playfulness as she hid something behind her back.. I smiled at her... she smiled back... She revealed the object which she had so blatantly hidden before my sight. It was a stalk of rose.  I guess it wasn't long before my ego set in in protest. I guess man should be the one giving the rose rather than the girl. She replied, "it's ok there are 60 more roses".<br><br>Hmmmm Do you guys like my story? if not then I shall not continue.</div>
