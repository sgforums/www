            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by alleggerita:<br><strong>Here's what I think about people, regardless of whether is it male or female, who cheat on their partner or has a sudden change of heart. Firstly, I have to say I'm <span class="large">[b]NOT</span></strong> condoning such acts. I'm just here to try to give my own opinion on why I think this happens and why maybe we shouldn't be putting all the blame on the other party.<br><br>Okay, let's go. Here's what I think, my own personal opinion. You can agree, you can also disagree.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REASON FOR HAVING MORE THAN ONE BOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND AT ANY ONE TIME:</span><br>Reason being, we are human beings and we are animals too after all. What's the purpose of an animal's life? Isn't it to reproduce? Now let me make it clear first, I'm saying we are animals, but we are extremely CLEVER animals.<br><br>So why some people have more than one boyfriend/girlfriend at the same time? Reason is simple. It's all in our genes, nothing can change that. We simply want to reproduce. Just look at other animals in the wild. Take lions for example. A male lion is, most of the time, surrounded by a few females. Of course, I'm not saying humans are comparable to lions. I'm just saying when someone has the urge to have more than one boyfriend/girlfriend, you can't say he/she is unfaithful. Like I've said, I think this is all in the genes. It just depends on whether can you suppress this feeling or not.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REASON FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE OF HEART AND FALLING IN LOVE FOR SOMEONE ELSE:</span><br>What makes humans fall in love? Pheromones is to be blamed I would believe. Once again, this feeling of falling in love with someone else when you are already attached can still be controlled. Some people simply succumb to it while some can resist the temptation of it.<br><br>So why is "I will love you till the day I die" untrue? Because when you meet someone else who produces pheromones that attracts you, you are highly likely to fall in love with him/her if you are not careful.<br><br>So once again, if your partner decides to dump you for someone else, it is perfectly understandable. You may feel sad and utterly useless, but there isn't a choice. We have our genes and ancestors <strong>and Pheromones</strong> to thank for. Just move on in life and find another partner and hopefully you'll find one that truly loves you and he/she is able to control his/her feeling so that he/she won't fall in love with someone else.<br><br>Once again let me make myself clear. I'm not writing all these to help the unfaithful people out there. I'm just trying to provide a plausible explanantion to why this may happen. Whether or not one goes astray is all up to his/her level of self-discipline.<br><br>I'm just trying to say those two scenarios mentioned above will definitely have a chance to occur if the partner doesn't have enough self-discipline.<br><br>Don't move to Aunt Agony please, I'm not in any agony. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And don't flame me. I'm just saying out my own opinion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Edit: In bold.[/b]</blockquote>your post is nothing wrong also, but you can actually post this in AA, to let the idiots who have self-claimed "lovesick"themselves to take a look<br><br>maybe that will reduce the spamming rate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is an interesting topic and a topic worth to invest much of the needed time in it. And it is also one topic which can say to be quite sensitive in a way. Actually I do entirelly agree with what TS mentioned about 'them' behaving in this manner because they are like animals? But I do condon this ACT. Though it's right to say we can also considered to be animals because as you know men are beast haha and yea we just have to accept that. But what seperate us is the values that we carry on us. You don't any <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saint</span> human being walking down town topless?<br><br>And in regard to that, Ive seen it with my own eyes, housewife having affairs outside of their family life and even bringing in the guy into the house. But sometimes it may not neccesarily be of the strong desire that is in her to do such an act, sometimes we as a human being failed to think of why isit happening and understand why it happened instead of merely just sterotyping. Not saying Im someone who doesn prejudice people but I have come to understand it is the lack of love that 'TRIGGERED' the whole thing. Lack of communication, lack of time together, As I just gone deeper alil bit into the difference of women and men, we understand that most women are dependent and need the emotional support. So what happens when the husband is not offering that to her, she found new love eslewhere. Though she is guilty of it but the husband never care, and on one hand women just want to be loved.<br><br>Deino quoted "Those who you refer to i think are people who gave up in controlling their desires<br>and/or just chose to do so" I do agree with you but I must emphasized that it is really not easy being in control of ownself espeically if u lack of faith and support, there is hardly anyway u can succeed in that.<br><br>What TS mentioned about genes, ancestors and pheromones are true. I have to agree on that. Those who really can withstand the desired of it, I really have to give the thumbs up to them but people, like us are not at all mentally strong unless we come to an understanding which not much of us has attained to that stage. (Unfortunately).<br><br>As myself, to be honest, Im going through this process of mentally challenging myself right now which I must admit it is extremely very difficult. Only when we really are in that situation then we will realized the difficulty of it. Don't get me wrong guys, Im single.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with ts to a small extent.<br><br>it's true that we as humans are still largely governed by our natural instincts: to reproduce and ensure survival of our kind. however i dont feel that its right to lay the blame of infidelity upon this very thinking. like someone who mentioned earlier, where's the self-discipline?<br><br>also, the thing about pheromones is that these hormones are meant to attract which then brings out the desire to mate- or lust for that matter. why is this then correlated to love? if personalities fail to click and such pheromones do little to establish a loving relationship or in other words, 'make me fall in love with you'.<br><br>but anyway, props to ts for creating such an interesting topic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
