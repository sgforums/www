The whole economic market is driven by consumers choice, supply and demand, and if everybody takes responsibility into their own hands and choose to buy more eco-friendly products that attribute to help combat global warming, then do you think industries will still produce products that nobody buys? It's time we need to be more responsible for our actions and to take control. It's extremely easy to say that we can do nothing, so that someone else has to take over your responsibility of doing something, doubly hard, to help save the Earth.<br></blockquote></div>

In scientific language, this means they are at least 90 per cent certain of the cause.<br><br>In their previous report in 2001, they had said a link between human activity and global warming was only 'likely' - a 66 per cent possibility.<br><br>In fact, some scientists had wanted the phrase 'virtually certain' to be used, implying 99 per cent certainty. But this was toned down after objections from some countries which rely on fossil fuels to power economic growth, including China.<br><br>Nevertheless, the report has sounded a dire warning over the impact of greenhouse gases pouring into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels - they are already at their highest levels in 650,000 years.<br><br>Temperatures also rose by 0.7 degC in the 20th century, and the 10 hottest years on record have happened since 1994.<br><br>UN Environment Programme head Achim Steiner urged governments to revitalise stalled talks on long-term emissions cuts. 'Feb 2, 2007, may be remembered as the day the question mark was removed from whether (people) are to blame for climate change,' he told a news conference.<br><br>Leaders, scientists and environmental groups have urged governments and corporations to reduce emissions.<br><br>Said French President Jacques Chirac: 'Faced with this emergency, now is not the time for half measures. It is the time for a revolution, in the true sense of the term.'<br><br>The Kyoto Protocol - a plan for cutting emissions of greenhouse gases by 2012 - has been severely weakened since the US - the top source of greenhouse gases, pulled out in 2001.<br><br>The report is the first of four this year. The next one - due in April - will discuss in depth the effects of global warming.<br><br>Responding to the report, Singapore's National Environment Agency said last night that it is commissioning studies to look at the impact of climate change on Singapore.<br><br>These studies, on rainfall patterns and the effects of extreme weather, among other things, will help in planning measures to deal with the impact of the changing climate.<br><br>Meanwhile, National Institute of Education geography lecturer Chang Chew Hung said the greatest disruptions here from climate changes would come from freak weather conditions such as flash floods - similar to those that have drenched the country over the last two months.<br><br>He added, though, that Singapore would not be submerged.<br><br>Singapore Environment Council executive director Howard Shaw said: 'Enough has been done as far as legislation can do, but not enough is done by the people. You need a lifestyle change by the people themselves.'<br><br>ailien@sph.com.sg<br><br>wycin@sph.com,sg</div>
