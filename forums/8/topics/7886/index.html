            <div class='col-md body'>I have to disagree with the view that guys and girls do it for different reasons. Maybe its because I'm hoping for something. I still think sex should be consensual, no matter you view it as a sign of love or not, so long as both parties have the same understanding of what they are up to.<br><br>I also think that we CAN change attitudes. Its not easy, but the fact that not all men are born like that shows that its not all due to genetics, and so there has to be a way to change how people think.<br><br></div>

Although I do not seek this kind of pleasure but to me having sex with a girl and not having any emotion would be highly possible.  Maybe due to the high amount of testerone as just mention, which I think is quite true.  What affects us, what we do and how we do things are all chemical reaction in our brains.  So I think that's how man and women are made differently...so there is nothing as fair or not fair.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Nothing can't be done, unless you don't want to<br><br>[This message has been edited by Vulcan (edited 16 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fact 1:<br>-------<br>Not all guys treat sex and love as separate things.<br><br>Fact 2:<br>-------<br>Most guys treat sex and love as separate things.<br><br>Possible reason 1:<br>------------------<br>We are biologically coded to spread our genes, so, it is difficult to get a grip.<br><br>Supporting fact 1 for reason 1:<br>-------------------------------<br>In the ape kingdom, there usually is a male leader among a group of apes. The rest of the group are usually female. The leader will mate with all the other female members.<br><br>Supporting fact 2 for reason 1:<br>-------------------------------<br>Usually, there is one rooster or cock to many hens. The cock will guard the hens and try to fend off any other cocks who come and join the group.<br><br>Contradicting fact 1 for reason 1:<br>----------------------------------<br>In the some insect kingdom, you can see that there are a lot of female creatures that would mate around. Take the ants and bees, the queen would mate with many drones and then leave the drones to die, after they are spent. There is no love involved. The widow spiders bite off the male's head after mating. Again, I do not think there's love.<br><br>Conclusion from reason 1:<br>-------------------------<br>We human are closer to the apes genetically. I wonder why they call rooster, cock.<br><br>Fact 3:<br>-------<br>Some girls would bed men for money. Think prostitutes. There is no love involved.<br><br>Fact 4:<br>-------<br>Likewise, some men would do so to gain money, pleasure and/or ego-boosting(when they brag abt the number of women whom they have laid).<br><br>My opinion:<br>-----------<br>Well, I think that generally, guys think differently from girls. Most guys would be more analytical, hence, they will separate things up and treat each thing as separate entity. Most girls, on the other hand, are more likely to lump things up.<br><br>Lumping things up sometimes create problem because everything is all "lumped-up". On the contrary, separating things up may not cause us to miss out certain issues. That's why most guys are accused of not being considerate enough or not listening. It is hard to tell what are the things that should be separated and which need to be consider as a whole.<br><br>Back to the specific question on why guys treat love and sex differently. If you have been reading up to here, then you would already know the answer - different genetic patterns and ways of thinking.</div>
