There was an oversupply plus competition from graduates from India and china ...<br><br>On the other hand, business, service and health related courses which became hugely popular after 2000...<br>when the Sars and avian flu epidemics appeared.<br><br>Before u do sumthing pls do not listen to others. Becos it is gonna take a few years to graduate and get a cert and by then market conditions may change drastically...<br><br>BTw courses like hospitality and service line related are becoming popular now becos of the Sentosa IR thing.

            <div class='col-md body'>Btw after 2002, i think polytechnics have started to diversify their thinking and offering more courses which comprise of 2 fields in one like eg. Business informatics...<br><br>If u r smart try to take up these kind of courses...<br><br>Another one on the safe side are health courses like nursing.<br>Once i did remember in the late 1990s, nursring was like "looked down" THose from the media , It and engineering courses always say nursing is a course which academically poor students or "borderline" O level cases go...WHich was in fact true at that time... 30 + points can get u into one at NYP in the late 1990s period , IMO..at that time Nanyang polytechnic was the one of the only campus to offer nursing on a large scale and enrolment was  low.

            <div class='col-md body'>the "limited places" thing is a way for polytechnics and unis to gauge response or even to increase intake,,so that the following year they can increase places.
