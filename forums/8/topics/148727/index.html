            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">LEO MAN</span></strong><br><br>He likes to comb his hair backward, opens his forehead showing a dignified facial _expression. His eyes sparkle, but show some slight laziness. He walks firmly &amp; slowly like a lion - confident &amp; ego proud. Outside, u may think he is a kind &amp; gentle person, but inside he is a strong &amp; secure person. If he is frightened, he will react &amp; respond right away. His words always seem normal but mostly imply "order &amp; demand". He will not talk fast, or cannot talk fast, neither walk fast. In a crowd or at work he will act normally, but not for long u will see him standing out of the crowd &amp; be the center of attention with his words, or his action. U might think he is a shy guy, but deep down inside he wants power over his family &amp; friends. He just waits for that right moment. Do not take what's his, &amp; do not order him, or else u will see a fierce lion. He respects elderly &amp; senior, but will never bow down &amp; accept being like a loser for he will rather die than lose his dignity. He talks bluntly even on an occasion that he should not say such things. He is a compassionate guy &amp; always looks at other people on a bright side. He likes people to listen to him. Though he has such a blunt &amp; bold personality, he could easily reach his goal without making any enemy. Once u disagree with him on something, he can be very upset like a rainy storm on a summer day. It will only last a short time, then he will be back as a cheery, merry person again. He is a bright &amp; witty guy, &amp; he will not put any efforts on something that he thinks will not work &amp; waste his energy. He is a good planner &amp; can manage his job assigned well. When he gives order, he expects them to be carried out exactly. He is the leader type that the followers love. He can give other people advice &amp; solve problems for other people well, except his own mess. He can be easily hurt by other people especially if u don't trust or respect his ability. U could compliment him sometimes &amp; make this lion be your kitty with no difficulty. He is not a good judge for he listens to many people &amp; tends to believe all sides. U can hardly see a Leo man with no woman by his side. If u see him alone, he could already have a loved one in his heart, or just broken up with one. Because he is very proud, he can change many girlfriends. He will do many things for the woman he loves, but losing face is not one of them. Leo man cannot live without love, because for him Love is a ray of Light. He likes people to rely on him, it makes him feels "in power". He may complain if he is asked for favor, but deep down inside he is happy that u asked him. If u offered to help him, he will refuse u right away. When he's broke, he can still find money. He is not careful with his way of spending for he has fun spending money &amp; is happy to buy what he likes. He lets other people borrow money from him easily even if he has no money, he will run to his friend to borrow money for u. He likes first class, first quality of everything. He can work hard like a mad dog, &amp; sometimes can be lazy like a lazy sleepy cat. When he works, he is very serious. When he parties, he can be a party animal. If he asks u out, u will sure to have a fun &amp; jolly time. He will take chance with his love life, so if u know how to handle him, u will win. If he is your loved one, it won't be a romance novel. U have to be ready to calm him down when he over-reacts to small matters because your cool stability will control &amp; ease his mood. If u can't handle or understand him, your relationship will be like a demolition zone, a on &amp; off relationship till all your friends grow tired to hear about your breaking up &amp; making up. Beauty is always in the eyes of the lion. U have to be dignified to walk with the lion king. Your looks is part of his image &amp; ego &amp; he is very proud about it too. If u want his attention on the first time u meet, u better be astoundingly attractive. If u have a first conversation with him, u have to show him how much u adore his thinking. He likes to talk &amp; not knowing that he likes to talk about himself.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">LEO WOMAN</span></strong><br><br>She will stand out of the crowd on the street. Leo woman is normally tall or rather tall. U will hardly see her as a short woman. When she walks, she walks like a queen, confident &amp; does not look around, as though there is no one around her. She will dress in her own style not according to fashion. She is confident in what she choose to wear. Do not buy cheap clothes which are sold in dozen for her as a gift, she will hate it. Also do not buy clothes that do not reflect her confident personality. She likes unique &amp; strange clothes &amp; accessories. Being different is what she loves. If u want to know her, take time &amp; be patient because she is selective with the people she mingles with. She's open-minded, but yet she is not letting people to get too close to her easily. She likes sweet words &amp; compliments, but not too much. She smiles to anyone, but inside she thinks she is borne to be a leader. She likes to be in control because it is in her nature instinct. She is a graceful woman, &amp; has a magnetic charisma, so expect tough competition. She is a very proud person, so don't do anything to challenge her confidence. She can be mad &amp; act like a hurricane &amp; later can be like an innocent kitten, but do not fall for her trick ok. She remembers everything &amp; likes to cherish her sweet memory, so if u find her old photo albums with her ex-boyfriend or love letters that will make u puke, take it easy. She is keeping her sweet memory which doesn't mean that she's still in love with the old fool, so u do not have to panic. She will have many guys after her, so if u have the advantage of a good background family, or a famous last name, a successful career then it's a plus. She hates to be poor &amp; she thinks love will not pay bills. She's sporty &amp; love sports. If u want to date her, prepare to spend big bucks, for your first dinner with her - definitely not by a hot-dog stand, better to be the best place in town. She is a generous person, so do not be surprised if she gives u a gift more expensive than what u gave her. She likes extravaganza, no cheap gift, no cheap dinner please. Being poor or broke makes her depressed. If u do not have lots of money, be creative &amp; make your own gift for her. It's unique quality &amp; the time spent making it for her is a big deal. U can think economical, but do not be cheap.<br></div>
