              <p>Sentosa is generally a tourist attraction. You may wish to have a look here to see what Sentosa has to offer:</p>

              <p>8000 SGD is way more than enough for 5 days in Singapore unless you wish to eat lobsters everyday. In fact, I think 3000SGD will be sufficient.</p>
              <p>Singapore is very safe compared to other countries; and with its MRT (trains), travelling Singapore on your own is definitely not an issue. If you do not know where to go, you can also pick up a few brochures from Changi airport or your hotel to point you to the few key attractions in Singapore. And guess what? All attractions can be reached and completed within a day, and this means that you do not even have to pre-plan it in advance.</p>
              <p>Touring Singapore is super easy.</p>

              <p><br>$8000 is enough and you don't really need 5 days to tour around in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Make sure you pop by Orchard Road and drop by Raffles Hotel for Singapore Sling.</p>

              The starter of this thread, Shaahs84, claimed earlier in a different thread that he had visited Singapore more than 20 times since 1992. Yet, this naive person doesn't even know the travel expenses, hotels and places of interests in Singapore. It is vey much the case that this boastful midget may not have even seen 8000 SGD in his entire life, let alone spending it on a holiday in Singapore.
              Moreover, this daft and stupid person had the audacity to remark that Dubai is far better than Singapore in terms of progress. Only an ignorant person like him can draw a paralell between the robust economy of Singapore and a bubble-economy of Dubai.

              <p>Dont want to start a fight here but want to raise a few points for Anil passion4 as a reply to his incredibly emotional comment. Grow up mate! Who has seen money in life and who hasnt i cant prove here but the points i can talk about are Dubai and Singapore. Well listen brother bubble econimies dont build tallest skyscrappers, underwater hotels, man made islands and so much which you as being an indian can just dream about.</p>
              <p>Yeah i know you will come up with another emotional comment saying that you are  a PR or a Singaporean. Anyway a simple F word for that if you claim to be what i mentioned above.</p>
              <p>Secondly if Dubai aint a firm place to work there wont be millions of indians like you lining up here to find work...and working here for as low as USD 300 a month.</p>
              <p>Things are never the same when you travelling after a long a gap. And i dont think asking about that is such a huge crime that you start running over me here.</p>
              <p>And another F word for you if you are thinking to raise some other points after reading this. Cuz you ignorant indian (co*k succerz) dont know anything else in this world than to bark like dogs and try to degrade other people when there is still slavery in your Shi* country.</p>
              <p>Now go back home and find a job for $10 a day and then talk about money.</p>

              The vulgar language used by Shaahs84 in his message dated 17th January 2010 speaks volume about his upbringing. His verbal diarrhea will not get him any laurels; it will only expose him further.
              He has mentioned his age as 24 and place of residence as Dubai in his profile at Sgforums. He also wrote in his post dated 17/11/2009 the following: 
              â€œIve been visiting Singapore since 1992...till 2009 ive probably visited there more than 20 times...the figure will probably turn to 21 in march 2010...â€�
              This joker by the name Shaahs84, therefore, claims to have been visiting Singapore since the age of 6 or 7. He claims that his last visit to Singapore had been in 2009, yet this clown is inquiring like an idiot from the Sgforums members whether 8,000 SGD for 7 days is sufficient for a visit to Singapore. It is evident that Shaahs84 has inconsistencies in his declarations. No wonders liars have short-lived memories.
              This ignorant person uses the example of the tallest skyscraper in Dubai as a yardstick for a robust economy. Well, the idiot Shaahs84 doesnâ€™t even know that Dubai is now totally at the mercy of Abu Dhabi to bail it out from its debts. Does this stupid person by the nick Shaahs84 know the reason why Burj Dubai, the tallest skyscraper in the world, had to be renamed as Burj Khalifa at the last moment? If the idiot Shaahs84 had any clue, he would have refrained from citing the tallest skyscraper as an indicator in support of his claim for robustness of Dubaiâ€™s economy.
              This idiot also had the audacity of mentioning the man-made Islands in Dubai. Does this joker Shaahs84 know anything about the debacle of Palm Deira, Palm Jebel Ali and The World? Does this ignorant Shaahs84 have any slightest of the idea that Nakheel, the developer of these man-made Islands, doesnâ€™t even have the money to settle the outstanding amount of the land-reclaiming contractor. Stupidity of Shaahs84 has no bounds as he doesnâ€™t know that most of the real estate developers including Nakheel and Emaar in Dubai are merely cheaters, fraudsters and gangsters.
              Does this joker Shaahs84 really live in Dubai as claimed by him in his profile?
              Well, the liars like Shaahs84 not only have a short memory but also a potty-mouth that oozes filth each time it is opened. So shut your potty-mouth and stop talking in thin air.
