            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the three crowning threads presently started by Ng on economics, christianity and also the one by Dork on Ngkaihoe, I find it really amusing to write down my opinions here about the way people discuss things here :<br><br>1)Some people like to resort to personal attacks without substantiating themselves on their opposition to the argument raised by the other party. I wonder whether it is an optical illusion that both sides are resorting to calling each other morons and stupid. I was pretty amused by the sudden spring of individuals Dork, Kaiser, Stupitt and etc, who seems to purport the same arguments against Ng. It is perhaps a mere coincidence or maybe it is my paranoia that I feel that they originate from the same person. Their personal attacks are highly entertaining, but from an outsider, are also entirely senseless as well, because they utter a lot of rubbish which are basically senseless ad-hominems.<br><br>2)The other thing which I am amused about is in the thread of Christianity. I acknowledged the argument purported by Ng that it is a social ill, and he sought to justify it by a few reasons given. The Christians who got drawn into the conflict, tried to put their side of the story. Everytime, they put forward one argument against him, he would denounce them as not understanding his mentality, which I thought is a fallacy of argument, because he did not point out their mistakes or even if he did, it did not seem clear to me at all from a person who is reading the arguments put forward by both sides of the house. Suppose, Ng will to denounce me here later as not understanding his mentality, I don't see the need for refuting him anymore because it is either he is an ivory tower with crowning intelligence that no one can understand him or a bigot with a inflated ego who is fixed on his own opinion.  Similarly, when people put up some constructive points, it is fired down onto issues that Christians being close-minded, which I thought should be opened to debate, for example the issue of Christianity supports Capitalism (that is highly debatable). The pogenitor of the thread pointed out to someone for not sticking to the original thread, and in the process, violate the same rule just as well as the people who are in the discussion.<br><br>3)Being open-minded is also about being tolerant about other people's point of view. You may not agree with the way some people think but that does not make it wrong either, because people are entitled to their own views and I don't see that accomodation of views here.<br><br>If a forum is up for discussion, we should not see so much name-calling, but if the forum is set up for flaming, then by all means, continue your insults on one another because the people are here to see people hitting each other with verbal insults.<br><br>The final thing I will like to say is that I am very much entertained by the flames (particularly the proclaimed sexy idol with his big fan club) here, and it is like watching an American comedy here. Just wonder how much the drama would continue...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
