            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, whatever he's done, I feel he's better off doing nothing.<br><br>I can't be bothered also if fans out there think that this pork-forbidden idol is cute and they all bear the flaming desire to marry him.<br><br>To tell you the truth, I find the entire Singapore Idol idea a joke. So what if it stimulates growth in the media sector, make some people with so-called talents hopeful and give some immature gals out there someone to crave for? It doesn't concern me at all.<br><br>I personally feel that for every 5 Singapore Idol episodes, the quality is somewhat equal to that of 1 American Idol show. The ratio is that shocking. But that's the truth. And truth hurts to all the idol fans out there. When viewing Singapore Idol, I kept fidgeting and couldn't concentrate on what's shown. In short, I find no passion and absolutely zero purpose in watching people finding talents and recognising them in fellow people. Furthermore, I feel shortchanged. So what if they are spending the big bucks in making SI possible? I rather they do something more constructive. Having idols out there seemed to spread the message to the masses that there's an easier way to quick wealth.<br><br>The answer is to put up a good show and appeal to the masses. Perhaps deceive them and make them all long for you like sexual beasts. Throw in some who will marry you on the spot, not forgetting being some !&amp;*&amp; ambassadors of some commercial stuff out there. Maybe then, you will have the fame, fortune, fans and a better sex life.<br><br>So much for being an idol...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I feel very happy and excited, can't wait for people to actually buy the album and hear the album. You know I've put in a whole lot of effort. The whole team has been working close together and we work really hard to come up with a good album that can be sold commercially. So I hope people will be happy with the album as well cause I am very happy with the album."</span> - Taufik.<br><br>Okay, first, read what he says. Then, let us analyse his speech and observe the implications, shall we?<br><br><strong>"...can't wait for people to actually buy the album..."</strong> Â» He means that he doesn't expect people to go purchase his album. Notice the word "actually". So, does he really want them to resort to illegitimate means to get his tracks, like Kazaa or some magical underground MP3 portal (read previous entry)?<br><br><strong>"...and hear the album..." </strong>Â» I listen to music and people. But I do hear the dogs bark and kids yell because I have no choice. Listening versus hearing. Each have their varying degrees of intensity. As for Taufik's songs, we can hear it, definitely - its an ability we all have since young. But when listening and appreciation is concerned, its still far from being conceptualised.<br><br><strong>"...You know I've put in a whole lot of effort..." </strong>Â» To tell you the truth, I don't know and I don't want to know. Frankly, its also because I don't focking care. If he thinks that he did put in his heart, mind, soul, blood, etc into this thing, then I should be running to the nearest music store to grab it. But I'm not. I'm never convinced and forever skeptical. Don't try to persuade me. It won't work.<br><br><strong>"...So I hope people will be happy with the album as well cause I am very happy with the album." </strong>Â» Of course he's happy with the album. He got his face on it and his voice in it. Soon, the big bucks will flow in and gullible girls will fall for him once more. As usual, the ones dying to marry him will appear like pop-up ads and people all around will say he's so cute. But the point is that he being happy doesn't mean I have to be obliged to feel the same way. And what makes him so bloody sure that I'm happy with his tunes in the first place?<br><br>Anyway, I'm not buying it. To me, its oblivious. Its nothing. I see others getting it as an act of sympathy.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Hey...come on lah, this Taufik put in a lot of effort to get his album up leh. Support him, he's our Singapore Idol."<br>"Err...okay lah, okay lah. Buy lah, buy lah."<br>"Yah...told you, must give local talent some chance one..."<br>"Yah horh..." </span><br><br>The above paragraphs are extracted from journal entries from <a href="http://tsbuzz.yoll.net/journal/j_january_2005.htm" rel="nofollow">http://tsbuzz.yoll.net/journal/j_january_2005.htm</a><br><br>Whatever you wish to comment or say doesn't really matter to me. You can flame or chide me for defaming your favourite idol. True. But what I'm doing here is just providing frank opinion on how I feel about him. And the feeling's not very nice.</div>
