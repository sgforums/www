            <div class='col-md body'>Based on statistics, normal reactions will be:<br><br>a)Abort the baby: if really have no choice. Parents dunno anything abt it, bf/lover/man run away, dun want to have a baby.<br><br>b)Get married immediately: If really like the guy. Dun mind making such a decision. Cannot bear to kill a life. Parents' approval.<br><br>c)Give up the baby 4 adoption: if feel that life is too short to waste, dun wanna marry, dun wanna abort.<br><br>d)Other solutions: Kill self and baby coz no frens to help.

            <div class='col-md body'>to lee:<br>oh please, it's always the guys fault. Do not generalise by saying REAL man takes care of the unborn babe and that boys ask for abortion.<br>I know of a REAL MAN who asks his girlfriend to give birth to their child and guess what, the child was to prove a big albatross around the couples' neck!!! They can't afford the child and yet they still forge ahead...That sort of REAL man does not elict any sympathy from a BOY like me.<br>Look at circumstances and act. Never let ur emotions get the better of u. Think...do u want ur child...and ur family to suffer???<br>That, should be the rationale behind the question of whether couples should abort or not.<br>As for pre-marital couples (the underage grp especially)...the logical choice is abortion. They still have their whole lives ahead of them, no point suffering forever due to their youthful indiscretion.<br>And please spare me the argument of all those catholic and pro-life arguments...ultimately, it's ur life versus ur UNBORN child and the prudent choice should always prevail.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 14 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I actually agree with Mr Hata-san....<br>Sometimes itz not fair 2 say that guys who does not marry the girl r not responsible.<br>Imagine an 18 yr-old boy marrying her gf, say, 16 yrs old. Wat happiness would they hv in future? Letz say the boy hv 2 stop schooling, he has 2 go thru NS first then start working only after NS. That meanz the girl has 2 work 2 support the family. To top of with that both parties' families r not supportive...then how r the couple gonna survive?<br>Thatz way sometimes I feel adoption is the best solution 4 young people...even 4 married couples who cannot afford 2 hv a baby...the foster parents might be able 2 provide more 4 the baby.<br>Thatz juz how I feel anyway...<br><br>------------------<br>Nothing is so strong as gentleness, and nothing so gentle as real strength.<br>~Francis De Sales</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when does a foetus start to have life?  From fertilization? One month later, Two months?  As for suffering, maybe it does feel pain, but pregnant women feel pain, too for the next few months, no one ever say anything about that.  Can you say for certain that the pain of a woman giving birth is lesser than that of a 3 month old foetus being aborted?<br><br>If thinking that abortion is so selfish, think about the baby, too.  It needs a lot of money for its milk and diapers and stuff, look at diaper's price, the cost to have a baby in the hospitals here in singapore, the baby food, medicine, ... Aren't you being cruel if you don't provide your child with the basic necessities in life?<br>As for adoption, ...that really depends on the kind of parents the baby will end up with.  Some I admit turn up to be happy children.<br><br>Pro-life.  If you take the catholic stance on life, even CONTRACEPTION is a no no because it prevents the works of nature or some other pious reasons.<br><br>If I can honestly say I can take care of the child financially, I'll just go through with it, with or without a husband.  But if I suspect we may have to eat grass, then it's time to be cruel to be kind.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I would not agree on abortion since as Maya has mentioned, the little life of the foetus actually begin a few weeks after conceiving. The parents have no rights to deny the child a place in this world.<br><br>Abortion is very dangerous to the woman since the tools that are used in abortion are sharp and there are cases of woman getting injured in the womb after the operation. Abortion increases the risk of inability to conceive again. The "mother" has to go through the agony of "killing" her own child for the rest of her life.<br><br>Abortion should be the last resort in this case if the parents are not married. As mentioned earlier by the others, the couple is not psychologically and financially  prepared for the child. Since they can't provide the perfect environment for the nurturing of the child, it will definately be unfair for the child to grow up in this sort of environment.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you don't want to be drawn into a choice as to whether to keep the baby, then don't do it in the first place.<br><br>If even contraception is against nature's law, then stop doing it go be a monk for fuck sake. Don't come and waste our time by telling us you cannot bear the responsibility.<br><br>You dare to do the deed, then you better take care of the child. It's your baby, and the right thing to do it to provide the best for the baby, even if it means giving it up.<br><br>And since you were the one who gave it the chance to life, you shouldn't take away the chance.

            <div class='col-md body'>I say straight up that I support abortion.<br><br>I think its a valid solution to an otherwise very difficult problem. Its not totally harm free, and everyone suffers, but it seems to me that in certain circumstances its the least damaging way to go. Its not a pleasant experience for anyone. Even when people go do make a decision to abort their babies, it still leaves deep scars.<br><br>I see the potential suffering that an unwanted child will go through as much more cruel than abortion.<br><br>Perhaps I view the quality of life of a person than life per se. I would rather see someone live a happy live than force that person to live.<br><br>So, in answer to the original post, it depends. On so many things. Whether the couple are ready for committment. Whether they want a child. Whether the can handle the responsibility. etc.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scarlett dear, I believe that abortion will be the last choice 4 me, ie if no choice, wrong gal, financially not stable, .....<br><br>I think Singapore shd start something like Germany.  Set up a "home" where "mothers" can go n give their child away.  The "mother" remain anoymous.  The "home" will look for people who 1 2 adopt them.  This way, more life will be save.<br><br>Maybe we shd start "shooting" this idea up to the goverment n save more lifes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are also people who think that this way of letting mothers remain anoymous will lead people to think that it's OK to have sex outside marriage and then dump the babies to the authorities....then Singapore will have a lot of unwanted babies around....<br><br>So...it's which side of the coin we want....<br><br>------------------<br>"Have you ever noticed?
