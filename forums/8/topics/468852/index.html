              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Women have been allowed utmost freedom in choice of attire not just at play but at work too. And by work I mean including reputable offices too. It’s obvious they have worn sleeveless tops of all shapes and patterns, some of which even opens a hole at their back, a few unpleasant looking, yet still allowed. Skirts of all kinds are allowed, with length not being an issue, and some which when looked from afar or in a seated position look no different from shorts. Even denim skirts are allowed on certain days, wshich look no different from denim shorts when looked at seated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Herein lies the irony, that men are still mandated ‘to wear sleeves’, though it has not been wholly unfair in this aspect as short sleeves are allowed, and even t shirts on certain days. However there is one region where men still face harsh judgment and lack of freedom-the lower region, ie the pants. We are still not allowed anything less than full length, and I really wonder why! As I mentioned, women are allowed all sorts of short skirts, with some looking like an item of its own, some looking like short pants of similar length and tailoring. Hence, how would allowing men the right kind of shorts affect the company’s image if u already are allowing women skirts which look just like that?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When certain policies, arguments on modesty or restrictions are imposed, I always see thrown around the phrase “let women wear what they want”, whether they be in context or out, whether the advocacy is reasonable or not. Yes, let them wear as they please, even in the office it is so, yet why have we not seen “let men what they want”, when the specific area of restriction is imposed upon men? And most workplaces bear such discrepancy. Why the keenness on women “revealing inches of their skin” as a mark of freedom, when u don’t allow men to reveal any inch of theirs? Do not say ‘women aren’t allowed shorts too’ as an excuse to claim it’s still fair, because they are just not allowed to wear ‘male clothes’ that men aren’t allowed to, but in the region of their own ‘female clothes’, they are still allowed total freedom, and it is a known fact and unwritten rule that men cannot wear ‘female clothes’, hence absolute comparison is impossible. Rather we should focus on relative and equivalence, and as I said, many of those short skirts resemble shorts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I would recommend that shorts of a neat and smart disposition be allowed for the men, with specific exclusion on those sloppy kinds that have been circulating the market. Women would still have more clothing choices after this, but at least the men would have the necessary leeway to customize their preference. If allowed at work, restaurants and clubs which forbid men in shorts while allowing women in miniskirts would have to amend their biased rulings or lose business from a portion of working men.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As a sidenote, at casual moments, I encourage young men not to shun the shorter kinds of shorts and let the clothing industry just presume we men only dare ‘reveal’ the parts of our legs after knee length. Pants are supposed to be male clothes traditionally, so why do women get to alter and wear questionably shorter versions of it while intimidating us not to? Please don’t resort to the sexist remark of ‘women having nicer legs’, cos even women with terrible legs also wear hotpants and short skirts(those with marks here and there, or plain obese that u can see lines on their upper thigh), while men with nice legs still don’t dare to reveal more. It’s clearly not a matter of appearance, what u can show for and compatibility now, so really, any man without any major disfigurement shouldn’t be aversive to revealing. I’ve seen men in full jeans walking with mates in extremely short or torn hotpants, and I wonder if they really enjoy totting around full jean material in our hot weather. Why torture yourself while your girlfriends enjoy the exposure? Go as short as u please! Sports shorts, fbt shorts, bike shorts, sports trunks,compression shorts just wear em, and I’m sure with so many fashion conscious males u can make this work without me saying more.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;  "><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Traditionally, skirts have been the standard wear for women. No longer now, as their demands for 'equality' get them the right to wear pants, and along with it, shorts. Now they seem so obsessed with shortpants that a large majority, but not all, of them refuse to put on a skirt unless every single article of skirt get recognised as a work attire and allowed in the office, even the most casual and unpresentable ones. Hence we see the evolution of miniskirts and denim hotskirts in the office, which are probably relaxed enough for them to be wearing them to the void decks of their own home, that seriously i doubt they need to change their clothes between shopping/strolling and working. Many of their 'dresses' look little better than oversized shirts rather than a bona fide full body wear.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;  "><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">But then, where does this leave us men? Lets see, we have not received our rights to wear kilts or tunics as a mass option worldwide, let alone to hope that they be accepted into formality at work. Our only viable option, shortpants, which are the only articles on par with their miniskirts, has been slammed down again and again on grounds of 'not being formal/presentable'. What a joke, considering how corporations let women wear unsightly holey tanks and faded patchy denim miniskirts,which could really resemble hotpants, abeit the less perverted kinds. Even major corporations in the CBD district, which you'd have guessed should be image conscious, have only imposed their image requirements on men, leaving the women to 'tarnish the image' of such companies, while getting paid exactly the same. Justifications? None.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;  "><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You'd have thought, because the men have served 2 years of grit and shit, we'd be given due recognition and respect. But no, we still have to endure less rights than the other half of the populations who've served not a single minute, and why? Because the fight for 'equality' essentially 'downgrades' the importance of male attire while elevating those of women's to an exclusive status? Because women wearing pants are seen as perfectly normal while men wearing skirts are seen as perverse. Now I'm not promoting the culture of crossdress, I'm just seeking to find out why the overglorifying of a woman's skirt to the extend of an extremely short and casual beyond casual one can merit equal weightage as a full length pants, the only thing we men are allowed at work. Ask yourselves this and see if you can answer without any resorting to prejudice reasons. Why does every single man of this generation endure the provocative of their opposite gender while not trying to exert the same provocativeness back? Why does every man submit to full formal and can still stand women going so casual before them without an utterance of protest? Do we have less rights than them, and are we second rate citizens? Is the age of racism over, only to be replaced by sexism, and in a totally opposite way the feminists always talk about?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;  "><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Unless men can be given regulated short pants as an option to a smart casual attire paired with a shirt, or unless women's attire can be more strictly regulated to ensure no equivalence of a singlet or shorts,ie their tanks and miniskirts, be allowed to enter the workplace with them, all equality rants will amount to naught. And all claims of workplace harassment due to provocative wear statistics will be grossly skewed and totally unreliable.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;  "><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Totally ludicrous too, is the assumption that women have more rights to hotpants than we do. Letting women wear pants is a sharing of our rights, not a total relinquishing of it to the other party(after all,what did we get in return?nothing). Girls already have their miniskirts, but once again, trying to elevate the status of their casual skirts to formal status, they purposely wear something even more outrageous, to make their minis even more 'exclusive'. All the while indulging in stereotypes against men wearing any shorts just as short; and thus now its perfectly fine to ditch the equality arguments once they no longer need it, only to bring it up at their convenience. Just like crossing the bridge and then destroying it before your ally can cross it.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;  "><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In fact, if equality is taken at its purest sense, and women want equal shorts and pants rights as we do, well, they should just ditch their dresses and skirts, since we have no equivalence of it for the men. And of course we wear the same of everything, no the girls getting 'hotter' than the guys. Then again women have worked on men's desire to see women 'feminine' while still weak enough to hand them their skewed equality, hence the elevation of skirt-casuals into formal settings. I for one DON'T CARE for women looking feminine, if it's equality they want, I say give em, and they can wear the same suitpants-tie the way men do, without resorting to their 'old clothes' as a backup to undercut standards. There are women who have every single day worn short skirt, be it denim or not, and never once in long pants or full jeans, let alone a proper knee length skirt, to work.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;  "><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">One more fact of contention is fashion. How low the workplaces have sunk, to be manipulated by the whims of fashion, even bad ones, and just because fashion focuses on women more, does it mean they get to get more options? Nothing about this is right; fashion is meant to be a casual and at-your-own-time indulgence, not something your bosses should give you unconditiionally.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span lang="EN">The only place which is capable of challenging workplace dresscode discrepancy are devout places of worship. I bet you less than half the working women will make it past the main gate without being asked to put on a robe, for the benefit of those who don't come in dressed adeqquately modest but still intend to visit; while every single working man will be allowed in no questions. Places of religion are one of the diminishing few places to recognise and honour equality as it really is. One of the most striking customer service jobs is the concierge, where I can see both male and female concierges dressed equally formal and professional. Not once have i seen a job where men get away with being less formal than women; its always the women who gets away with less. Even classy eateries practice that on their patrons, influenced by mainstream workplaces. It is up to us to make a stand to speak against it, in the hopes of putting a stop to this sexism</span>. You can start by signing the petition I have drafted:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><a href="http://www.petitionbuzz.com/petitions/menattire"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #800080;">http://www.petitionbuzz.com/petitions/menattire</span></span></a></p>
              <p><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 11pt;         '>a small step, but all significant changes start with baby steps, have to start somewhere. The right kind of short pants and corresponding matching top could be introduced first into casual Fridays, before finding more use on other days as well. It should be by choice that men wear long pants, not by force, just like how women have been given a myriad of choices of what to wear be it at work or play. On top of ease of moving around, having shorter bottoms give the added advantage of ventilation and comfort around the legs. No matter how strong the aircon is, it hit mainly the upper body and less on the lower portion, which is usually hidden under the table or desk.</span></p>

              <p>From long dress pants... to midlength pants.... to short pants...  and the future is here.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">What a joke. Women are protesting over what, rights of wearing miniskirts in the workplace potentially taken away? Should it even be a right? Then why is it I hardly find any articles attacking the utilitarian regulation of not allowing men in shorts to work?</span></p>

              <p><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 11pt;         '>Miniskirts a women’s right? I thought such rights are supposed to pertain towards necessities which one cannot live without, and rights which allow one a reasonable amount of dignity as a human being. Do miniskirts achieve either of the two? If not, are women rights going in the direction of pure indulgence, and does not merit anymore credibility? Would dressing in a slightly longer skirt(but still before knee length) or berms not be enough comfort for women in any weather, hot or cold? If so, shouldn’t the men be petitioning for clothing manufacturers to make us more microshorts(since as you have noticed, the trend of shorts for men is getting uncomfortably long)? I really can’t see why if men can do without excessive exposure, anyone could even say such same exposure is a “woman’s right”.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I tell u where we’d be heading if more and more styles and undercuts of female fashion are allowed for women at work while keeping men’s at a standstill. First now is that tank tops and miniskirts and their equivalent dress combinations are allowed. As dresses get shorter and more swimsuit-like, they’d eventually do a fakeout by wearing some shorts underneath the dress, claiming that it’s for modesty. By claiming that their true bottom is a dress rather than shorts, and that such dress without shorts are already allowed inside, they’d badger for it to be let past. Next step, they’d do away with the short dress and just wear a long casual blouse/tank with shorts, saying it looks “roughly the same”. Once this is accepted, then all hell breaks loose, they’d just come in to work in tank tops and shorts; they’d have absolute freedom to choose if they want miniskirt or shorts if they feel like exposing; while the men would be left high and dry without an inch of their rights to wear something more comfortable and exposed being achieved at all. Despite what societal figures and media keeps hawking at their lips, society is inherently sexist and wouldn’t care much for integrating the rights of one gender on the other, making sure they’re consistent. If men don’t speak out for their freedom to wear what they like, of course while still keeping in mind to look nice, at least on the basis of equality via comparisons with the opposite gender, we’d really lose all our freedom rights and hence our pride along with it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Just keep in mind that initially, besides a suit attire which resembles what men wear, only proper formal skirts and blouses, and skirts which trail beyond knee length to embody a holistic lady look, were allowed at work. There were no such things as tanks and minis in the office, unless that be a job in the red light district or massage parlors. If people and bosses can open up to women being in such attire, surely men in shorts is no biggie? Surely looking like a crisp schoolboy isn’t anywhere as image tarnishing as looking like a bargirl? And formal shirt and shorts pairing if done right need not look like school uniform attire, but present a whole new style in corporate outlook. I’ve seen a few examples in public and in magazines which look really office worthy and better than what women in tanks and miniskirt on normal days, and casual tees and denim fade short skirts on Fridays. I occasionally even see women pair a blouse top with shorts on Friday, claiming that those shorts give off the same look as a skirt of same length, or lack thereof.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I’ve seen such inappropriately dressed women staff in many impressive corporate buildings in the CBD, including the UOB Plaza. It is now time to act for the men, to present that there is nothing wrong with themselves in shorts in a respectable environment if they want to partake in this new-age freedom. Shorts are after all just a shortened version of long pants; much the same way short skirts are a shortened version of long skirts. </span></p>
