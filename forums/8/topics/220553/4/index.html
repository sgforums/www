I see he work hard for her.. and yet, she dumped him but now he is single but still his heart hurt so deep.. can you imagine he already gave out the wedding invitation cards to all his relative.. he felt he is the most luckiest guy at that moment but then, he lost not only his love, his money for the marriage and his dignity... he tried to avoid his relative and family because they will starts to ask him abt the marriage.. i feels sad for him so who dun want a happy family, a lovely wife?</div></blockquote>What a b.i.t.c.h...but hey, like my friends say,don't give up an entire forest for a rotted tree. They woke up the side of me which I didn't know I had. Now I can go out with whichever girl I wish and the thing is no commitments! And I realised how much I've missed out, because there's a real distinction of a girl and a woman.<br><br>The girl like my ex., is someone whom wants the materials of life and wants to feel loved but doesn't want to return it, and she feels that its perfectly to have many guys at the same time.In short, commitment is not in their dictionary.<br><br>But hey...a woman is different, she looks at things in the long run, things like whether the guy has drive, the motivation the responsibility and how much he cherishes her. Its definitely above and beyond the 5Cs. So yeah, I've discovered that the 6 girls I've went out on solo dates after she left me for that 22yr old drop-out guy, 2 of them though younger, are already behaving and thinking like women, while the other 3 being a year or 2 older, have shown that "womenly" appeal of someone whom will back their guy all the way through thick and thin...the remaining...haha, lets just say she's still haven't grown out of being a girl.<br><br>So yeah...I mean call me a player or whatever, but now I'm still in the recovering stage and I don't wish to rush to commitments because it will be like replacing the ex with someone else. So yeah...its a free world!</div>

However, how true is it? Does it apply to all companies or only government organisations?<br><br>From what I see, most companies do not care about whether you served NS or not... they give the same starting pay to all new employees with the same qualifications applying for the same position... I think only government organisations give a little more to guys.. This little more to guys will never make up for the income that our female counterparts made over the years (not to forget all their promotions over the 2 years)...<br><br>At this point of the argument, many of you will immediately say that in long term, guys will still overtake their female counterparts because they have better chances of promotion... But is this true in today's society when girls are fighting so much for their rights? Girls these days are much more educated than the past and the society no longer is biased against them anymore... So my point is: the saying that guys have better chances of promotion may not be so true anymore...<br><br>**Ultimately, we may not be able to catch up with our female counterparts of the same age and same qualifications after all...
