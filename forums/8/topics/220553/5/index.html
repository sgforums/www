            <div class='col-md body'>Simple guys! Just take the plane to the Mainland and there are millions of very nice, beautiful, hungry, co-operative and sexy girls waiting for you. Don't look down on them, after all they and us are from the same origin, same grounds, only we are o/seas born Chinese. I have come across a few of these ladies and they beat locals hands down for being ok for most things, no taboos, no khiasu attitudes. Sometimes we get some who have ulterior motives, but even locals do to. So fellas, take a trip and go see for yourselves whats on offer. First thing they'll ask is are you married? Keep your eyes opened and take care. None of them will worry about your zero CPF. Just have some money and a job is ok, no need to have a Merc/BM/condo/credit card/high profile job. At least they really want you for what you are. If your female classmates have surpassed you on the corporate ladder, don't worry, get a substitute and show them you are still going strong.</div>

Even my granny , let alone a guy, has an issue with me and postgraduate education - she told me not to study more or else it will be hard to marry me off. I was like screw that .<br><br>Credit Card and Car issue: If a guy starts showing off his credit cards and car to me when he has to borrow money to buy it , I will get abit worried ...it means DEBT .

Hey golddiggers can be either a guy or a girl.<br></div></blockquote>This will be a never-ending argument. Each side will say things that make them seem like the victim.<br><br>However for your post:<br><br>1)Pregnancy: I do agree with your post. You don't compare with NS. Totally irrelavant.<br><br>2)Children: This is a matter of the husband and wife working together as a team and compromising who should do what at home, making it 50-50 as much as possible. Guys, when you look for a wife, look for someone who is not stubborn and always has her way. Look for a team player, not a solo player. Girls, let the man take the lead. Someone has to take the lead in the direction of the family.<br><br>3)Culture issue- I do support the traditional issues. However, this is more of a personal preference pertaining to individuals. As I have said, we are all looking for team players in a married life.<br><br>4)Credit card and cars- Guys should know how to plan their finances properly short term and long term wise. Women should help as well. Do what's good for the family and not for self-interests. Don't marry a guy for his wallet. When the inevitable divorce ever happens, the Women's Charter is not fair towards the guy.<br><br>5)Natural Female Instinct- I salute you for telling the truth. However, do marry someone you really love.<br><br>6)Golddiggers- I have to tell you this. There are more female gold-diggers than male versions, simply because it is expected from the male to provide for the female from the day humans evolved. Even till this modern age, the female gold-diggers still expect the man to provide for them. This is really unrealistic thinking, when the GST is going to be 7%? That is only when the man is rich or at least decently rich. It is all a team effort. If the female is doing what is good for herself not what is good for the family, Guys, you just dump her. Sad to say, you cannot do it during marriage.<br><br>It is because of this responsibility there are a certain percentage of females who will exploit this. This group of female gold-diggers do not really love the men and worse, marry them because they can provide a comfortable tai-tai lyfestyle. If the marriage ever crumbles, half the man's assets will be split to the female, according to the Women's Charter?<br><br>It is precisely these female gold-diggers that irritate so many men, causing a bad name to the females. Not all women are bad of course.<br><br>doko</div>
