            <div class='col-md body'>so you've hunted me down to this thread, p|gGyPeN - i am most impressed...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (no irony involved here ok).<br><br>i shall answer ur questions and then that's it liao. As domyoji33 (let's just call him/her 'dom' for short..) has already said, i hope all this can end as well.<br><br>Some pp might want to carry on talking about it (i'm just saying generally - not pointing fingers ok...) - but big deal. Just let it be lor. But there's really no point in filling the forum with this stuff.<br><br>ok to answer ur question, you are on the wrong track.<br><br>i was amicable bec. i realized that dom was genuinely only wanting to chat about the show wat - and not as i initially challenged, trying to 'promote' the show with a commercial interest. So why challenge some more? i have already gotten a response. Besides, it's as dom has already said - i dont need dom to come and show me proof also that dom's not working for anybody.<br><br>Do i see a challenge as good intentions? yah well, i did have good intentions ah - just that they were mistaken. And oso badly taken.<br><br>But given that the challenge was indeed worded a bit too bluntly, i should not have been too surprised. So you can say that i failed then at my communication. But i learnt something new from this. To word myself more carefully in the future...<br><br>What do u want me to do, start a flame war? nah... that was not my purpose...<br><br>Beyond belief is just a tv show - you are correct. But that wasnt my point lah - i already know that dom is just a genuine person liao..</div>
