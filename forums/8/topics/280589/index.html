            <div class='col-md body'>Study locally first and get a good honours from NUS. Then it will be easier for you to get a scholarship to pursue your masters overseas. You still get that once in a lifetime experience to study overseas. IMO, you should only study overseas IF you are going to a university better than our local ones, or to universities that offer what our unis dont offer. Most Aussie unis are just thrash. You still got time to think bout what you wanna do in future. Keep your options open to other careers.</div>

Going to and Ivy League Uni or to Oxbridge doesn't guarantee you success. Likewise, graduating from a crap uni doesn't necessarily hinder you. It's up to the individual.<br><br>One thing you have to realise when you study overseas is that you have to fend for yourself a lot more. You need to be careful regarding the friends you make and you must be clear and firm on what you want. It's easy to lose sight of the fact that you're there to study, not play. Also, you will feel lonely from time to time, you must learn how to cook, do the laundry, clean and do grocery shopping pretty much on your own, not to mention budgeting. It might sound daunting, but if you think about it, you have to do that sometime, so might as well learn it soon.<br><br>If you're planning to study overseas, it's best to choose one where you have friends already ther to advise you. Else, choose a place that's familiar. Also, try to have the language on instruction to be one that you're very familiar with. Psychology requires tons of reading, don't expect yourself to get through it all if you can't understand most of it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>if you wanna study overseas, first thing first is to check whether you have enough $$$ to support your uni and other fees. If your family can support you, that's good enough. You must also decide carefully what you're going to study before choosing your uni. That way, it's easier to find which uni offers programs that you're keen on learning. Don't think too much about discriminations in other country. Don't let this small things prevent you from fulfilling yr desire to study overseas.<br><br>So TS, what's your decision so far?<br><br></div>
