            <div class='col-md body'>Well, my fellow god of war, bishamon,<br><br>You can always go for ballroom dancing classes in Singapore. I am sure that there is such a course in YMCA or even in SDU/SDS, or even in community centres. It is quite a fun thing to do... Well, if you want to wait 3 years later, I can't stop you.. But it is really really fun, besides, you are always close to the lady, so I don't see what is so horrible about this. I have danced with so many Asians and ang-moh chiobus, that I hardly have the feeling that I have taking advantage of them at all...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi RaYcHel,<br><br>No, if the guy is good enough, he can really lead even if you know nothing. The rule to ballroom dancing is that the guys must lead and I have seen the guys in the dancing group that just pick gals with no idea how to dance, and just waltz them around... I must reach that stage... No problem, you can learn it, it takes some time to get used to the steps, but in the end, you will love it..<br><br>I am taking up dancing lessons because I always hoped that there will be a dancing ball in my wedding dinner, so that I can waltz my wife across.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well intimate dancing dosen't mean slow dancing, take fer example dances to songs like Santana's smooth or I need to know by Marc anthony's: they're all fast music but it's meant fer intimate dancing due to the tune of it. What about spanish dancing like salsa? Those are very fast music and the movement are quick and the music are so steamy u would really wanna make love while dancing to it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi prodigal&gt;&gt;<br><br>Erm.... okay. Just as long the guys lead right? How long does it usually take one to learn a certain dance? My parents used to tape down those programmes... on TV (long time ago) that show you like how to dance Cha Cha Cha, Foxtrot, etc. But they gave up on learning anyway.<br><br>For your wedding? Isn't that like a bit far away? Never knew that men would plan so much in advance for their weddings. It's a good idea though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*Sigh* I just realise that I have no one to dance to on Valentine's. (Is that a plead out to the gals out there? *smiles*)<br><br>3 Valentine's ago, I was dancing with someone, together in the serenity of the night, we moved to our imaginative song, in the centre of the fountain, we danced, there were no splashes, for the fountain is closed, but we were there, in the center of the fountain we danced.<br><br>That was one of my most romantic dance to date. Haven't experience anything, to match that for a long long time. For your information it is the Bugis Junction Fountain. You got to go there at night, around 1.00 a.m. or the guards will just shoo you away if they see you there, but just understand that it could be anywhere, all it takes is a hint of romantism, and imagination.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 08 February 2000).]</div>
