            <div class='col-md body'>Bengboy:<br><br>I dunno what gave you the idea but to slow dance is not about groping and rubbing. That's so .... I dunno what to say.<br><br>To slow dance, now that's and art form. Feel the sychronise movement of the 2 body in motion to the music. Feel the closness and proximity of the soul of your partner. Feel his/her soft breath brushing against your face. Listen to his/her heartbeat getting faster and faster, heavier and heavier and heavier.<br><br>While all these is happening, for the guys, gently hold her by the waist and dun apply pressure least she feels any discomfort, if the 2 of you are pretty close, hold her close, hold her near your body, use thy body to support and provide a sense of security. One thing, NEVER grab the Butt! Not only does shows your lusty side, it also shows how much respect you have for your partner.<br><br>For the gals, put your arms around his neck, slowly pull him closer, just resting your arms around his neck, no need to grab, if you feel tired, rest your head on his chest, listen to the sweet nothings that he is whispering to you, enjoy the peace, enjoy his heartbeat, enjoy the warmth from his body. enjoy the moment.<br><br>*snap fingers*<br>Ok so much for that. anyway, I never thought of slow dancing as anything obsence, in fact it is a very romantic experience. Anyone have similiar thoughts?<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 05 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree... slow dancing is more of a chance to be close (physically) to a guy. Moving to the music... etc. Never done it before myself. I think it should not be said as a chance to grope your partner.<br><br>But sometimes... I think it's whether both parties are willing or not. I mean, I can't imagining asking a guy to slow dance with me in a club?? Unless of course, it comes naturally for both people...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Raychel:<br><br>Wellz sometimes it doesn't need a lot u know? The times I did it in a club were when the gal and I really had good eye contact....and just happened to be close together when the slow track started.<br><br>I look into her eyes.......she looks back.....she smiles this shy smile.....I smile back knowingly........and I just hold up my hands to the height of her hands.....bingo.<br><br>Anyway the one I liked best was when a gal had this fat guy dancing beside her.....and I'd already had quite a few good looks from her already.......she pulled me by the shirt and there it goes.....mutual attraction I guess.<br><br>So Raychel if u really dig a guy(if only for his looks) the secret is in the eyes.....if the guy is receptive he'll know what to do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Raychel girl,<br><br>well I personally like the eye gazing thing better....it feels much more precious that way. If the gal doesn't mind I'd lend her my shoulder, but that still ranks second(good for whispering stuff to each other though).<br><br>As I said this takes experience.....for both guys and gals.....to know what to do(no groping) and just enjoy the space.<br><br>Hmm as for places that play slow music....don't u know that even with dance music you can dance slow? It all depends on the individuals....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like Callan's description of how to do a slow dance......spot on.<br><br>Just add: Most of the time guyz we have to lead her into it....and not act nervous or anything....cuz most guys are kinda nervous when they're so close to gals.<br><br>Not being nervous conveys a sense of security and leadership, which in turn will make her feel comfortable.......<br><br>Helps if the gal is at least a little shorter than the guy...so that his neck is easier to grab.<br><br>Wow better not write so much leh....sounds like a jioying galz manual liao.....better not tell all my secrets!</div>
