Or in the Malay language it would be "apa khabar"<br><br><strong>Business Etiquette:</strong> Depends on wad type of biz u r talking about....i would say it shld be the same as Canada. We are a democratic country...wad do u think?<br><br><strong>Cities:</strong> Due to the small size of country, it has no city. SIngapore is a city itself. But i can tell u that this City is sub-divided into many many estates, each with their own purpose. We have the business estates (known as the Central Business District or CBD) which is located at the heart of our island. We have housing estates such as Tampines Toa Payoh, SengKang, Punggol etc and industrial districts as well i.e Kallang Industrial Park, Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park, Senoko Industrial Park, Jurong Industrial Park and many more. We even have an offshore island which is dedicated soley to the super heavy industries (mainly oil refineries) called the Jurong Island. This island is link to mainland Singapore by a man-made causeway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
