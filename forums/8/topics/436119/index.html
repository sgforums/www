Cos this last straw has officiated my decision to migrate to Singnet. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><strong>STRIKE 1 </strong><br>I had an appointment arranged by the customer service for a technical to visit during the 10am to 12pm window on 10/08/11 (wed). <br><br>Because I needed to head off to work, I asked the technician to come at 10am sharp or earlier at 930am. However, operator could not promise me that the technical can be punctual to arrive at 10am because he explained that they need to report to office first at 9am – 930am to draw their equipment. <br><br>OK… FINE. Then commit to a 1030am to 12pm slot instead. <br><br>On 10/08/11 6AM, I gave StarHub a call and make a request that the technical try his/her best to arrive on time<span>  </span>at 10am as it is important that I leave for work early. <br><br>930am passed (expected) … 10am passed … 1015am passed … I called and asked for an explanation. TO MY HORROR, I was informed that the appointment had been changed to 2pm to 4pm without my prior knowledge and consent! I was livid and demand an explanation for my wasted time. Apparently, they said the technician had gave a missed call to update me. <br><br>I HAD NO MISSED CALLS ON MY HP OR HOME TELEPHONE (verified by my mum). <br><br>In short, I was fuming but agreed to have another appointment the next morning, 11/08/11. Again, I requested for the technician to arrive on time. <br></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria;"><strong><br><br><br>STRIKE 2</strong><br>On 11/08/11 … 1015am passed … I made a call. And UNBELIEVABLY, I was asked if it’s possible to wait for another technician to come because the one who was supposed to come had reported sick and is on MC. <br><br>I was of course pissed. But never mind that … the technician came and I had to rush off for work. I asked him kindly to call me back and report the situation since I’m not around and my mum is not tech-savvy to understand much. He said he would … HE NEVER CALLED BACK ON MY HP even when I was considerate enough to ask him to call me from his office instead of divulging his personal mobile no. <br><br>So anyway, he connected a cable from outside to my modem to test the bandwidth. Later at night when I was home, we realized we had a new problem. If we watch TV, we cannot surf the Internet. VICE VERSA <br><br>I called the customer service again to verify the situation – I damn hell wished I took that technician’s mobile no. So this time, they fixed another appointment for me on 13/08/11 Sat. 4 to 6pm slot. <br><br><br><strong><br>STRIKE 3</strong><br>On 13/08/11, 730pm passed … and no sign of any technician or calls to update me. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? This time, I volcano-ed. I called up the customer service again to demand for another explanation. They had called the technician desk and verified that there was supposed to be an appointment but said they could not locate or contact the MIA technician. <br><br>Why is it that I the customer had to help nanny them to service me for a problem they are responsible for? Rather than they attending to my problem and offering me a solution, they seem to compound mine with more problems and UNNECESSARY AGGRAVATION! Are they going to compensate me for the time delayed for my work and wasted over a weekend? <br><br>The above has clearly illustrated StarHub’s pathetic support service for technical problems pertaining to MaxOnline accounts. StarHub has arranged for a technician to come tomorrow again to fix the inconvenience that’s ironically caused by the earlier technician. <br><br>FINGERS AND BROWS CROSSED! </span></p>

              <p>Many thks for the feedback. I feel like I luggi suay sia... </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well... I honestly think I have had enough. My circle of friends seem to have lesser problems with Singnet so yeah... next yr. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, this has prompted me to later write and contribute an article to the press. Mainly to point out customer service standards here ... I think a big part plays down to our society's culture. What we lack is attentiveness to the customers' needs. You get that right, I'll be easily pacified into a compromise... many others too. </p>
              <p>I went to Melbourne... 3 weeks over there and I'm impressed by the locals fronting the service industry. Whether it's over the counter, a tour guide or retail store, their sincerity comes off as natural. So rare here lor... I only felt this once at a taka handbag store while with my friends. That girl was a "killer" (not looks at all okay, service!)... confirm make you wanna buy from her, lol   she was really really nice </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway about today, another miscom. It was supposed to be 4 - 6pm slot, but the technician's work order stated 2 - 4pm (what's wrong with their scheduling?). But small issue settled over sms. </p>
              <p>The duo pair that visited me were great. It's so easy to takeaway teh to thank them when I stepped out to buy dinner.  They were PROFICIENT and HONEST when going about how to resolve my technical problems and queries. </p>
              <p>They retified the mistake done by the previous technician... couldn't figure out the rationale behind that original setup. So I guess there's a serious inconsistency across their technicians' skills. And that communications between customer service and the technical desk is terrible. </p>
              <p>Oh yeah, they also fixed my starhub TV issue. Turns out my TV speakers are blown ... so there's distortion whenever there's a strong bass  :D </p>
