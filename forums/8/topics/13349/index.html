            <div class='col-md body'>I tend to go with blur on this one. Have been reading most of the threads. Feel there are times you are over-doing it. Dun think it is coming across to people, in fact generating more flames and really unnecessary. Let the Holy Spirit do it. Maybe it might be more helpful to reply the threads with wanting to "clarify misunderstandings" in mind. Just my thoughts.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HitSquad:</div><div class="quote_body">to blurblop,<br>it was noah and the flood.<br>moses has to do with the exodus from egypt.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

I have learnt that it is not enough to quote from the Bible. Why do you quote from the Bible when they are not convinced that the Bible is worth believing in the first place.<br><br>I always feel that Christianity lends itself to harsher criticism and mockery because of our teaching on the need for propagation and the fact that salvation only could be found when there is individual conviction of original sin. So, it does you no good really to work yourself up in a frenzy over personal insults and mudslinging. Don't personalize the negative remarks.<br><br>And sohguanh(hmm..funny nick), you have cited the israel-palestine conflict as a supposed example to how defending one's faith has led to the cycle of bloodshed. I thought that wars are all about power struggles, only under the facade of achieving a more noble goal.
