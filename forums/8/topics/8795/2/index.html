            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...... seems like Minister's pay is a popular topic in this thread. So would just like to add to that. One thing about parliamentary debates is that although there are always two sides to an argument, most inevitably the side favoured will tend to be amplified while the other side reduced to nothing. Just because it was exclaimed that yes, we should peg ministers' pays to the four top professions in Singapore as we fear losing them to the private sector, yes, during the economic crisis, while the rest of Singaporeans are being retrenched or have to suffer pay cuts the pays of ministers are simply frozen, that means, no rise, and yes, immediately when the economy shows signs of recovery, up goes those wages. Hmmm......very nice, the fact that Ministers' wages follow a bullish trend and show no signs of taking the opposite turn. Hmm...... and Singapore is such a special country whereby only from Singapore are the ministers talents most easily tapped in the world that really such high pay is justifiable. The fact that Chiam See Tong mentioned that ministers don't really require such high pays being slammed back onto his face...... and what's that about the recent ruling??? Ministers are not allowed to take part in any advisory role or directorship of companies UNLESS it is for the benefit of the country. Clauses and clauses, how accomodating. Rats, shouldn't blabber too much, too bloody high already, hehehe...... signing off.<br><br>P.S. Regarding Ministerial pay, using the point about being attracted to private sector is not enough. When we talk about pay, we talk about economic worth. Anyone can specifically point out the roles and responsibilities of a minister, and revalue whether the justifications hold true?? Remember, we are not suppose to liken the pool of talents for this government sector as a monopolistic market.<br><br>P.P.S.: Did my memory serve me wrong, or did our DPM Mr. Tony Tan actually give up his job as CEO of OCBC to join the government even before the pay rise hoo huhs??<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
