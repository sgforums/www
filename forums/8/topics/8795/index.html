            <div class='col-md body'>After some chit-chat with some friends I found an alarming trend among our generation. What I saw is a generation of self-enouncing bunch of people who couldnÂ’t care less about the happenings around them. They take things for granted and only care about their lifestyle<br><br>As the general election is coming up soon, many of our generation will be first time voters. When asked whom would they vote for, the answer they gave was either opposition or PAP. I was just wondering what is going through their mind; the answer I got is pretty disappointing. Some just want opposition in the parliament and they donÂ’t care who he is, while the rest just trust on PAP to continue to do the good job they have done over the years.<br><br>While I applaud at PAPÂ’s work over the year, I donÂ’t feel safe people have this assurance then government will take care of everything and leave all the decision to them. One example will be the president case. Our former president raise the view that the government should use our reserve to help the citizen pass the tide but the government decided that the people should take CPF cut instead. I am not faulting the government for not taking up the presidentÂ’s idea but how swiftly they remove the opposition after the decision was made. Which bring me to the question whether we have a choice? Was that the best course of action? In the next president election they quickly replace a president, which seem so supportive of PAP. And all he did so far is to appear on NDP and some soccer match showing the support for local soccer. If I am not wrong his job scope includes keeping the government clean. He should remain neutral but he seems to echo what the government says and wants so does he serve his purpose here?<br><br>Another thing it the pay increment for civil service, long overdue but how timely too when the ministers themselves would like to have the paycheck increased. I think in such a way they will face less opposition from the public. But lets see the fact; they are 3 times better paid then the American president. And can you imagine one with such a huge role and have so much more responsibility getting less pay then our senior minister. Ok maybe some might say look at our reserves and compare that with the states, ok they are in the red but they have made healthy progress under Clinton and he have to oversea so many peace process like Korean and middle east. I think he had done a great deal too donÂ’t you think if anyone deserve a pay rise it is him. Lets face it how long has Singapore since we have face major crisis? I admit the government under SM lee had done well in the 70s to make Singapore what it is today but what gives the current government the credentials that SM Lee earns. Like does if your dad is a doctor does that means you instantly becomes you doctor. Many have base their support on PAP past but I just wonder can the present PAP be able to handle crisis.<br><br>I question the ability if the government when they introduced the incentive to encourage citizens to have more babies. Look at it this way 20 yrs ago they think we are having a population over growth so the try to limit the popular. Now they find out about our aging population they want us to have more children. The change in policy is to correct the mistake they create years ago. Lets just say that the campaign is effective in getting the population rate up but the couple is not ready, which lead to irresponsible parenting and astray children. Even if everything turns well can the economy support the population? Already have face with tough competition and people are migrating overseas which doesnÂ’t do good to the population either.<br><br>I not trying to influence you and I hope you are one who does not gets influence easily. I not asking you to vote for anyone or any party just want you to know the importance of voting. Vote for the best candidate and some 1 you think will do well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In this ever more materialistic society where we have a limited population base,values like patriotism and willing to serve the country for little pay is being swept under the carpet by the broom of materialism and general apathy of singaporeans.It's is no wonder our ministers need a pay raise as although their pay is a lot more than the president of the united states.If our ministers were to join the civil or public sector,they could be earning more,therefore the pay raise is pegged to the top few earners in Singapore to entice them to stay.I would rather pay good $$$ for a good minister than to pay average $$$ for a minister who although is patriotic enough to serve his country,but just doesn't have the qualities becoming of a minister,although some ministers i see don't deserve the pay increase,heeheheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.
