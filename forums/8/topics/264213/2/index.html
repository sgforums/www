            <div class='col-md body'>ok. im racist yes, towards the malay. every race has his bad problems. we talk logic and fairness.<br><br>chinese, wan say bad points also can. chinese not angels. we talk sg. chinese also got useless people. what the malays do, the chinese have done also. some chinese also like to por old people lampa. maybe u never see, only see malay. but sure got chinese por 1. but 1 thing i dont like about the malays are, they get subsidised fees for their schooling, free education from pri to sec, subsidised in tertiary education. but where do they go? u guys have to admit, that most malays go to ite. its like i treat u to a bowl of sharks fin, but u wan to eat chicken rice. malays are united yes, but u dont notice like malays make more trouble than chinese? i say more, i dont mean chinese dont make trouble, chinese do too. why malays so many young pregnancy rates? i just heard from my friend that she got a cousin, 16 yo. got baby ready. this links to family. family did not teach properly.<br><br>see the effect? previous malays are not educated properly, so grandparents did not teach parents properly, parents did not teach children properly, children did not teach great grandchildren properly. this is a cycle. seriously, im not trying to be funny or what, but everytime i see a malay from jc, i will feel shocked and 'lucky', its not everyday u see a malay in jc. malays need to be educated properly, dont talk msia, sg 1 also got so many problems, msia sure very hard to educate them properly. there are many other things to say, but i will just stop here.<br><br>no offence to u akubodo.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>eh any Indians here? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Perhaps I can give an unbiased stand?<br>I will just say one thing. Malays are way more friendlier while Chinese tend to be more selfish. Please note that I am referring to how it is when I meet a stranger. Of course my own Chinese friends are not selfish because I've known them for so long and they are real nice friends of mine..<br><br>Again, as always the case, not everyone is like that. There is always majority and minority..<br><br>I am an Indian and almost ALL my friends are Chinese. I have like no Indian friends or Malay friends. Just 1 or 2.. Mainly because from secondary school to university, I only had Chinese around me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
