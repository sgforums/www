            <div class='col-md body'>Ayah.... there's the good and the bad lah!  I got a few Malay friends, they're not like that.<br><br>But I can fairly say that some malays don't like chinese due to bad experience.. it's usually the other way round, chinese looking down on malays, dismissing their laidback style of life as "laziness", making them the butt of jokes ("relak one korner")... these sorts of things happen everyday in workplaces, NS, etc... it's the cultural difference.  Sometimes we chinese can be real nitpicky tightarses too, ganging up and ostracising the minorities.  I think we either don't realise how we treat different races differently, or are in denial.<br><br>All in all, both chinese and malays are guilty of "grouping" together.  It's up to the individual to break down these barriers.  Any hostility usually disappears once your body language / words assures them that u respect them as an equal.  If anyone's really concerned about racial harmony, they'd look into this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I get along with my Malay classmates in Singapore.<br><br>Overseas wise ,I can tell you that I have nothing against Malaysian Malays. In fact I have 2 malaysian malay friends and we come out each time I fly down to Melbourne.<br><br>I also remembered the bunch of foreign delegates ( Russia and some other countries) and  in particular the Malaysian consul representative came to the overseas university for the scholarship ceremony where I was studying.<br><br>That year, the number of Singaporeans and Malaysians were about the same for the top scores in their cohort. Very few aussies in that ceremony for every single faculty in that year.<br><br>Now most of the Singaporeans stuck with the Singaporeans . I was one of the two who were grouped with the Malaysian contingent because most of them were my friends and they saw past my nationality.<br><br>The dean announced that the majority of scholarship winners were from Singapore .....the Singaporean contingent clapped loudly and made alot of noise. The Malaysian contingent also clapped. After the noise died down, the dean added "and Malaysia too". Guess what? I remember a couple of Singaporeans booing while the rest just kept quiet.<br><br>To tell you the truth, never once have I felt so ashamed of being Singaporean. Big f**k. Clap along for the malaysians as well, no need to boo- what is so difficult ?<br><br>After the ceremony, the Malaysian consul representative came up to my malaysian friends - chinese and malay , and told them how proud she was of them. I was the only Singaporean there and she thought I was malaysian until I said I am Singaporean. She went and actually gave me a hug, and said she was happy for me since we are "all neighbours and would look after each other". She also mentioned that  the Singaporean consul is tied up in some issue and could not manage to make it like he did the previous year.<br><br>Can you imagine the grace shown by this representative?<br><br>Now I don't want people from Singapore or Malaysia to bash each other. Both are neighbours and both are semi- dependent on each other for security in the region.<br><br>As for the topic on Malays, this topic has been overdone to death. Get a life people - everyone is human , we may look different but that doesn't mean anything. We are all unique. Treat a person as you would want others to treat you.<br><br>A better person will always show some social grace, even to those they deem as adversaries.<br><br></div>

I think so, their attitude towards chinese is so different from their own race, for example, they will speak rudely to the chinese. This is a fact. They don't speak rudely to caucasians or indians, but only to chinese, and yellow skin. Why is it so? In fact, they treat people with bushy eye brows and prominent cheek bones better than chinese looking people. They like people with prominent facial features. Malays prefer people who look 'fierce' and 'confident' than the 'humble and quiet', like the chinese people, who re conservative.<br><br>Is this a trend from old Singapore, where gangsterism still exist? But I feel it is a psychological preference. They are more from a primitive type of tribal race before the colonisation of Singapura. In fact Malays are from a tribe of Javanese boatmen in ancient times who wander about the old Indonesian regions. Whereas Chinese came from highly cultured civilisation, even in the past.<br><br>Another fact is that 'fierce looking' Malay guys speak very rudely to old Chinese ladies, I am sure you all have observed it before. They will say things like useless, and so on. What is the reason?<br><br>The moment a Malay sees another Malay, they will suddenly smile and joke together, as though there is some kind of bond, though no bond really exist. He will please the elder so the elder will 'protect' him with his power of authority. This exists in the work place...<br><br>Please comment.</div></blockquote>that was definitely a biased comment.....it was as good as saying from an american's point of view of a middle eastern man......<br><br>its actually a fact that chinese speaks louder than malays......examples are PRCs the only locals who do are those aunties still living since world war two.....i dunno bout me maybe its in my blood as a mixed but i prefer jap girls to malays.....not all malays are neutral to other malays....malays were from malaya not java.....malays come from the malay archipelago.....some may originate from sumatra or the nearby riau islands.....though there are few from java as its not as near as jb or something.....about bushy eyebrows i dun like eyebrows that are too bushy nor do i like drawn fake eyebrows like those chinese tai tais so goddamn fake wan......<br><br>the comment was definitely biased and trying to compare how civilised china was compare to the malay empires.....actually i think china is one of the most uncivilised countries in the world, (refering to loud mouthed PRCs).....they are dumb to have bowed down do the manchurians........<br><br>malays during the kampong times respect neighbours like their own families.....their doors were always open.....unlike those nowadays they know a certain word called shame....meaning they wake up early in the morning and keep their house tidy and stuffs becoz they knew how shameful it is how others would've thinked if you are like a heavy slacker......</div>
