            <div class='col-md body'>This is not a racist thread whatsoever, I hope we can discuss in order to know more.<br><br><blockquote>Are all Malays like that? I think so, their attitude towards chinese is so different from their own race, for example, they will speak rudely to the chinese. This is a fact. They don't speak rudely to caucasians or indians, but only to chinese, and yellow skin. Why is it so? In fact, they treat people with bushy eye brows and prominent cheek bones better than chinese looking people. They like people with prominent facial features. Malays prefer people who look 'fierce' and 'confident' than the 'humble and quiet', like the chinese people, who re conservative.<br><br>Is this a trend from old Singapore, where gangsterism still exist? But I feel it is a psychological preference. They are more from a primitive type of tribal race before the colonisation of Singapura. In fact Malays are from a tribe of Javanese boatmen in ancient times who wander about the old Indonesian regions. Whereas Chinese came from highly cultured civilisation, even in the past.<br><br>Another fact is that 'fierce looking' Malay guys speak very rudely to old Chinese ladies, I am sure you all have observed it before. They will say things like useless, and so on. What is the reason?<br><br>The moment a Malay sees another Malay, they will suddenly smile and joke together, as though there is some kind of bond, though no bond really exist. He will please the elder so the elder will 'protect' him with his power of authority. This exists in the work place...</blockquote>Please comment.</div>
