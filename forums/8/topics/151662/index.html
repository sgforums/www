The bank discloses to the customer the fees and charges, and terms and conditions associated with the additional card.<br><br>2. The customer is not liable for any amount charged to the card until he has accepted the additional card.<br><br>3. No additional credit limit is granted to the additional card.<br><br>In Mr Leong's case, it is possible the card sent to him is a renewal or replacement card. He should check with his bank whether this is the case.<br><br>Ong-Ang Ai Boon (Mrs)<br>Director<br>Association of Banks in Singapore"<br><br>It is clear that they are using this loophole...they 'make' it a replacement card not because I have lost my previous card or that it has expired, but by withdrawing it unilaterally.<br><br>I have paid first and then complain to CASE and MAS. If not, they will continue to charge me another $420 per month whilst my appeal is ongoing. Now you know why banks are so rich.....$420 a month for oustanding bill of less than $6000...I might as well borrow from Ah Long.<br></div>
