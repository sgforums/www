            <div class='col-md body'>Ponders:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>According to the consitution of Singapore. There is no Manslaugter charge in Singapore. There is however a equipvalent charge in the Penal code call culpable Homicide. The definations are as follows:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><span style="font-style: italic;">Penal Code Cap 224 Section 299</span></div><div class="quote_body">Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death committs the offence of culpable homicide.</div></blockquote>In this sense, the suspect/s would have already committed culpable homicide, or as you said, manslaugter. But the police is putting him/them up for murder, that is because of the section to define culpable homicide as murder states:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><span style="font-style: italic;">Penal Code Cap 224 Sec 300</span></div><div class="quote_body">Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder -<br><br>(a) If the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death;<br><br>(b) If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused.<br><br>(c) If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or<br><br>(d) If the person commiting the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death, or such injury as aforesaid.</div></blockquote>Thus in this case, the suspect/s should know the consequenes of his/their attack on the woman, and have exception (b) is violated, thus he/they is/are charge for murder. Also since he/they has/have yet been caught, he/they is/are not able to offer an excuse for incurring the risk of causing the death, thus they have also violated exception (d). That is why they are charge for Murder and not Culpable Homicide. The police will always charge the suspect/s with the highest possible charge initially, and he/they will later appeal for a lower charge if found guilty, it is then up to the judge to decide whether they are guilty of that particular charge or not. In this case, murder is higher than Culpable Homicide, and that is another reason why the police are charging him/them for it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>Singapore is a nice place to live in, it just that the occasonal ripples caused in our quiet pond will cause an uproar, comparitively, Singapore is still a safe place to livei ncompared to other countries in Asia. But nonetheless, such acts of inhumanity cannot be tolerated, and must be brought to justice. Sad to say, a life has to be taken to bring the culprit/s to justice, may they be brought to justices soon, and be a frim and strict example to the rest.<br><br>Hereby I offer my deepest condolences to the family, and may the light of her life shine to guide others.<br><br>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 worth</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 15 February 2000).]</div>
