Firstly, my interests lies in econs/biz and i'm quite apt in maths and econs. My a's grades are aabc (result for math, econ, chem, phy), b4.

[/b]</blockquote>Just being frank here.<br><br>First of all - if you cannot afford the fees in uk , you have to see if you can get  a scholarship. Always good to go on scholarship ( preferably without bond).<br><br>Second of all - I won't be in a hurry to obtain bank loans - do you really want to be stuck with 300k SGD with the current job market in Singapore? That is already a bad investment decision if you are thinking of taking out a 300k loan and frankly no bank will back you unless your parents can guarantee with their assets or your assets which must be = 300k.<br><br>Try for Singaporean Unis if you have difficulty coughing up the dough. NUS and NTU are not too bad.<br><br>Third - London - it's freaking expensive to live there - at least 20k pounds is the amount that you need to comfortably survive there- Cambridge/Oxford  at least 16k pounds to survive since they are way out of london. No point in worrying about money when you are studying there - you get financially stressed out and it will impact somewhat on your studies.<br><br>Fourth - I am not sure about working as a student in UK because I never studied in UK but each country comes with its rules on student visas. There is some difficulty with finding jobs there especially if they have visa restrictions on  international students. Free internships yes - paid work - very very hard unless it is under the table and that is when you get into trouble with immigration who has the power to kick you out of the country.<br><br></div>

U can work in uk but oni as a part-imers, but believe me, u wun have much time for working...i would advise u to concentrate on ur studies.<br><br>As for the choices of institution, u can look for top 100 uni in uk.
