            <div class='col-md body'>The Traffic Police is cracking down on motorists and passengers who don't buckle up while on the roads.<br><br>From May 7, drivers who don't put on their seat belt will be fined $120, and given 3 demerit points.<br><br>It's the same penalty, if their passengers, including those in the back seat, don't buckle up, or if the drivers don't use child restraints for children in the vehicle.<br><br>These rules were introduced in 1993. Just last week, the Traffic Police warned close to 600 motorists and passengers who didn't buckle up. Some 40 drivers were also warned for not using child restraint seats.<br><br>To drive home the message, the Traffic Police and Automobile Association are conducting a month-long campaign about using rear seat belts and child seats.<br><br>*********COMMENT PLEASE*********</div>

I asked a couple of them during my rides and their answers seems to be a valid one.<br><br>Recalling those rob-and-kill cases involving night shift taxi drivers? The taxi drivers told me that if they do fastens their seat belts, all the robber have to do is just to pull their seat belt from behind and they will be pinned down, dead ducks at the mercies of those robbers. Especially in this gloomy economy, crime rates are going up and I guess it will be a hard choice for the taxi drivers.<br><br>------------------<br>If you could have told me everything<br>You would have found what love is<br>If you could have told me what was on your mind<br>I would have shown you the way<br>Tomorrow i am going live without your love<br>I've never thought beyond that time<br>I've never imagined the pictures of that life<br>For now I will try to live for you and for me<br>I will try, try to live with love,<br>With dreams and forever with tears</div>

This is generally important but it fails to consider the maturity of the population.<br><br>We're old enuff to know that belting up is the passenger's onus. This need not be a law. Buses dun even have safety belts. To enforce it is difficult. Just knowing that such a law exists is laughable.<br><br>So many laws and so many restrictions. It's a shame that we need all this. Some things like road accidents happen all the time. If someone was unconcerned abt his/her own safety, then that person lands in a hospital or worse...<br><br>Sometimes this law just offers TPs investigating an accident involving a passenger who did not belt up a chance to snipe: see i told u so?"<br><br>Just another way of washing their hands of the incident.</div>
