No need shell the meat all plucked out put in styrofoam box wrapped in plastic. Cold Storage got sell. Getting late it is $1 one box if that guy going to knock off soon else should be ard $2 one box. Like tat no need scared buy durian take home open inside is rotten or watery one also. No such stuff as weigh how many kg etc etc. And also eat finish no need fret over how to dispose of the durian shell. How times has changed since my youth times  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>I think the traditional way is still better lah. The joy of eating durian is not just eating durian. The fun here is to drag the whole bag of durians home, be careful not to hold the bag to close to your leg otherwise the thorns will bruise the leg. Then get a knife or screwdriver to pry open the durians. Sometimes you try to pry even the smallest portion and discover a tiny durian flesh inside. Sometimes you can see worms inside oso! Then you use your fingers to scrap all the durian flesh from every corner in the shell. At the end of a satisfying feast, you see all the durian shells and throw them down the chute. Wah. Shiok man!</div>
