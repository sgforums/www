            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>It is another of those long posts that I have spent some time thinking and decide to write about it. Now, this time, it is slightly different, I am going to talk about it from a photographer's point of view, a wedding photographer's point of view. For those who liked photography, I would just say that I have a Nikon FA601 lens which accompany me to all kinds of trips for the past 6 years. I would not mind if we can talk about cameras in another thread.<br><br>I have been asked to do wedding photographs 4 times in my life back in SG. Since the first couple got married, in order to save the costs other than taking studio photographs, they got me a camera from another friend who is a professional, and it started this lineage of taking wedding photographs. Basically, imagine me, carrying a large camera with more better lens and filters and with a couple ready with their wedding gear, and we are out with a car. Of course, I would bring them to Botanical Gardens and some other nice places to do shots. As years go by, I become more and more experienced and as a result, more and more of my friends got married.. I actually enjoyed doing it, even though I have decided to decline any requests.<br><br>Recently I came back to Singapore, I did it for the 4th time, and this time, perhaps I am no longer familiar with Singaporean geography or being bored since I have been using the same route for 3 times, I changed the venue and the order of the places where the 4th couple would be featured. It was not a nice thing to reject your friends when they need a favour. What strikes me, is the conception of marriage that comes to my mind, because my friend made a very interesting comment to me, while we are taking a rest and drinking bottles of mineral water, thanks to the hot and humid weather of Singapore. He said something along the lines,"U know, you are always the photographer, and u have no idea how difficult is to prepare a wedding, the marriage gown, the studio photographs, the wedding dinner, and the Registry of Marriage, the flat and etc., besides if after married, we don't work out, we would get divorced." As usual, I would reply to him,"My friend, the pasture is always greener on the other side. And don't think about divorce."<br><br>What does my camera lens tell me? A couple in Singapore get married, is more like a legal contract. To fulfil this legal contract, one must start with the conditions. I label these conditions as a flat, a ROM certificate, a wedding dinner, a glorious wedding ceremony and such and such.<br><br>Perhaps, the burden which has come along with marriage had been added exponentially, so as to the point that people has forgotten, what the meaning of marriage is all about? No doubt, part of a marriage is about bread and butter (I am also being realistic as well), but people has think of it so much that the bread and butter issues has become a dogma to what a marriage is. Marriage is about two people getting together, loved each other and decided to live together, then to have kids and then till death do we part. It does not mean that it is the "graveyard for all men".<br><br>What is the problem now? People just get divorced easily and do not really bother to rescue the marriage. The couples who divorced mostly have forgotten why they have decided to live with each other in the first place. Why is it that in the church, the priest need to ask questions like "will u love this person forever?"? Of course, it is not a question of simple triviality that we witnessed in all movies and TV. No, it is about the bond which binds u and her together. Why do you want to get married if you already conceived a divorce? People have forgotten the sacred nature of marriage, sadly to what I have seen. People who should be getting married are not married and people who should not are married. Of course, there are the in-between who fit 80% of the statistical interval.<br><br>Before I end, I will tell you the story of a recent HK TVB drama serial entitled "Da Xi Zi Jia", which I have not seen but heard from my friend, Shadeofgrey when we are discussing about marriage life. The lead hero of the story is a marriage gown maker and the father of a family, and the whole family are into marriage business, for example the daughter is an officer in ROM and the wife does something related. What happened, is that his fellow classmate wanted to commercialise the skill of making a traditional wedding gown and seek legal means to de-throw this honest marriage gown maker's business. The unfortunate thing was the lawyer used underhand means to deal with him, and in the last episode, he made a moving speech (of course it illustrate the quality of scriptwriting compared to TCS), which is narrated thru my friend, and I find it really touching before I even see it. Basically, by that time, his wife has died and his daughter had no choice but to divorce. He started talking about how he learned the art of making wedding gown as an apprentice. Unfortunately, when he got married with his wife, he did not have the money to buy the material to make her one, and till he had the wealth and powerful skill to do one for her, she died. Then, he made the wedding gown for his daughter and yet she end up divorced. So, he asked, what is the reason why he felt the technique of making the gown should be done by hand instead of by commercialization makes so much difference. The difference is that the sacred meaning of marriage has been forgotten just as the sincerity of making a sacred wedding gown by hand diluted by the commercialization of marriage  using factory production. In the same light, marriage has degraded into a legal piece of contract. As for the ending, I will leave it to you to watch the show or someday when TCS would screen the dubbed version.<br><br>Perhaps, in that light, I still believe in the value of marriage and its sacredness contrary to some of my peers. It is a serious matter of reflection and please reply with some opinions and thoughts.<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"The way I see it, people are either meant to be together or they are not."<br>- Kira in Star Trek DS9<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) Yes. Cohabitation is easier to implement, and much much cheaper. There is an emotional burden of course, but if it does not work out, then both parties are able to sort things out a LOT easier, compared to couples who are stuck in a bond of marriage.<br><br>And if it does, its just a matter of time before everyone sort of accepts the fact that the said couple is "married". This has become a more and more commonly seen situation. The guy moves in with the gal or vice versa, the parents whine and moan, but will probably adapt to it in the long run. And after a situable period of time, its just.... "accepted". Sort of.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>2) Can't answer that, since I'm not as old as the peers.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But marriage really shouldn't be an age thing. If you're happy, content, madly in love with each other, and think that the other person's the one, then heck, get married. But of course, the institution of age involves the obvious mental aspect of such a serious matter.<br><br>I need not mention the scarcity of land, and ancient beliefs etc etc.<br><br>3) That is due to society. They have placed too much emphasis on material wealth with marriage and children. Look at the number of incentives the government has thrown into the fray. Get Married, have incentives for getting your home. Have kids, get tax rebates, Maternity leave, etc etc.<br><br>While it can be said that it is fitting compensation, even attraction, it has severly diswrought the tradition mindsets of what the commitments in matrimony mean.<br><br>4)The norm is that most people are madly in love with each other for the first coupla years. As time passes by, Familiarity breeds Contempt. People are bored with the normal things, especially things (rather, the spouse) that they are totally familiar with.<br><br>Think back on conversations. There are many families here, that when they return home, grumble about school, work, colleagues, gripes EVERYDAY, with very little variation. They watch TV, listen to the radio, and there is little interaction between people.<br><br>Thus being content (figuratively speaking), they search for something that they do NOT or can not immediately have. Say, I have a preference for hot, sporty athletic looking women, but I also have a preference for studious looking ones. Its obvious that I would have married one, but would like to "try" the other type in such a situation. There, an example of adultery.<br><br>The forbidden fruit has always been a temptation, such is the way of humans. Much like dangling a carrot in front of a donkey.<br><br>Lets not even talk about the considerations of the spouse who was cheated upon bearing with the discovery, because of the children, the division of financial wealth, and not to mention the extreme costs of hiring a lawyer just to handle custody and division. Surprising that people can consider monetary wealth of more importance than one's own dignity.<br><br>5) The "quickie" churchs or Las Vegas has perhaps the general mindset of being a place where simple, quick, none hassle and naturally, unserious marriages take place.<br><br>Though the story isn't totally so, but that is indeed the mindset given by the various medias. (Movies, TV dramas, Games...) Let's look at it this way. You pay for the priest, you pay for the use of the pseudo church by the hour, AND your NOT the only person in line.<br><br>And naturally, Singaporeans want face. The old, doddering relatives want the great big wedding bash so that its official. The bigger the wedding dinner, the more percieved "prestige". The parents want no scandal involved in the wedding, or the viperous tongues of said relatives will ramble for years to come (as they already will, from the choice of food, to the wedding dinner location, etc etc).<br><br>You can imagine how it will be if such weddings ever take place in the "quickie" churches.<br><br>Here you go.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Rulakir (edited 11 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Shadeofgrey,<br><br>I am more lucky than u, by being in overseas so that I skipped all these wedding dinners which will take place in the next 3 months before December. By then, I have to dine with 9 couples all in one go, if I have to meet them for a gathering. Whereas in UK, when I attended a wedding, we just give small gifts and don't need to pay the market rates for the wedding. By the time, I finished my studies, most of my peers would have been married and I would not pay as much as you. Hence a "Dinner Fund" is not requried of me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Since the state is now trying to help the people getting married, maybe u should give that a try. As my Indian student was asking me over in Calcutta, he actually suggested to me in a jokingly manner,"P, why don't u ask your parents to get u an arranged marriage? U know, the gal might be nice and sweet..." and I just replied,"Over my dead body." How I envy Indian couples who can get married early and the guy can concentrate on his career. Guess for a Singaporean guy, it is the other way around.<br><br>Have a good time with your dinners.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Shadeofgrey,<br><br>U have not been to a British wedding, where the bridegroom was literally being made fun of by the best man during the speech time, some thing which they are fond of doing. But the atmosphere is more lighthearted compared to the eastern weddings which I have attended. Most western couples I know have very simple weddings, the most formal would just extend to a church and a small garden party where u start to booze immediately after the ceremony is over. I have seen both kinds of wedding. Actually, I know of friends in SG, who did not hold a grand wedding dinner and just have a simple family dinner plus some friends.<br><br>So any one have other interesting encounters for example, an Indian wedding or so. I will see one next year, when I see one of my Indian students getting married at the age of 23 with his finace.<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"Man is incomplete until he is married, by then he is really finished."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally i think if you feel that you are mature enough to know what you are doing, you can get married any time.<br><br>I always thought that a marriage is the most wonderful thing in the world. It is a day when you and your partner belongs to each other completely.<br><br>but we have to face the reality..there are more to consider besides just you and your partner, marriage is a commitment to your partner, you have to consider can you take care of her, can you bring her happiness,are you ready to take up this responsibility?<br>i personality thinks that this are the most important factors, ROM cert is a security to us girls, as for wedding dinner...i believe that ,marriage is not about how grand you make it to be, guess we watched too much fairy tales when we were young, princes and princess always have a grand wedding..people misunderstood that by having a grand wedding, its means you have married the right person and you will live happily ever after ..i am very touched by what prodigal wrote about the wedding dress maker...marriage is about 2 hearts joining together as one... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Find time to realise that there is one person who mean so much to you, for you might wake up one morning losing that person who you thought meant nothing to you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Tet, Rulakir, Moose and Ashley,<br><br>I will try to write a more concise reply to the various issues raised in the post.<br><br>1)On cohabitation, I don't mind doing it, and I can do it. It all depends on my lover whether she is willing to accept a non-legal marriage. Even if we ever break up, I guess I would take care of her, instead of leaving her like that. I think that it would not happen.<br><br>2)Today's marriages in Singapore requires dual income. The roles have changed. Men are no long breadwinners, and they have become hybrids of being both househusbands and breadwinners and the same goes for woman. Even that is the case, I think that some modern Singaporeans treat the marriage as some security and companionship. They did not know why they got married. There are others who do and they end up being happy and have kids.<br><br>3)Well, kids has been an issue now in modern marriages. It is not like in the old days, where my grandmother can have 9 kids. That is because they get married very young and it is usually arranged marriages. Arranged marriages are no longer common in Singaporean culture, but still happening in India and Mainland China. Sometimes, I wonder whether arranged marriages are ever good idea to find a companion. I myself can't take it, because it is like going to take a bet what u are going to get, besides I don't trust my parents' taste, granted the generation gap. In SG, u have the state to worry about your marriage, that is quite rare, consider I threw away the extension to SDU form when I came back to SG recently.<br><br>4)I have nothing against Las Vegas marriages. Perhaps, like Tet, she is "blissfully married". Well, chemistry can make two people go together. Just as one case works does not mean the other nine cases work. A lot of fast marriages ended in failure because the people did not start to understand each other. It is like the gal accept the guy and not understand the guy, till they got married, she decided to leave the guy because they are incompatible. When a friend tell me that he is getting married in a month's time, after meeting this gal for less than 2 months, I just ask him,"Are u sure?". At least, he better know what he is doing. Marriage is a committment, and not to be taken lightly.<br><br>I guess I am not absolutely against Las Vegas, but I think that prudence should be exercised when such marriages are concerned.<br><br>5) I think that modern couples no longer adhere to the traditional Chinese weddings because it is too costly. I know of some couples these days just have a small dinner with family, relatives and a group of friends. I used to remember that the first couple got the gang of guys to help them in their wedding dinner. Put the guy's family in one corner and the gal's family in another corner and the centre would be occupied by the friends. Well, not to mention the wedding invitations.. As more and more of them getting married (the other 8 guys of my clique), the ceremony becomes less and less strenous. Think the trends are changing...<br><br>6)Have u ever attended another kind of wedding? Well, I have seen a few from different cultures. Perhaps, some of you can share your experiences here...<br><br>There is faith to believe in marriage, because it is a lifetime committment. I think that if the government is ever sincere in making more people getting married, they should make sure that the people are educated properly, instead of turning it into some trend as to get fringe incentives. We can urge people to get married, but not let them turn marriage into some incentive acquiring tool.<br><br>Do take care.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>"Men is incomplete until he is married, by then he is really finished."<br></div>

The wife and mother-in-law problem has been slight modified because most of the wives all liked to go out to work outside. Still, the poor guy still need to be squeezed in between. Of course, there are also other problems, whether your wife can live with the family or not. I guess that communication is one of the essential ingredients in making a marriage work. Someone told me that in these days, some guys lived with their wives' families instead. Perhaps, times have changed. The roles of the husband and wife are no longer so well-defined.<br><br>I suppose that when I am marrying someone, I hope that I am not marrying the whole family as well. I would be happy to have her family and my family living together.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br></div>
