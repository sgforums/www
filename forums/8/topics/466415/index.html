The sinkeh, comprising the majority of the city-state's population, were the recent immigrants from China, or whose parents were born in China. They spoke Chinese, lived like Chinese and considered themselves overseas Chinese. In Indonesia, such Chinese were called the totok.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The babas, on the other hand, also known as Straits Chinese, were Chinese more in name than practice. </span></strong>They were the descendants of the very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian province) to the straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore and Malacca). They assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom they especially admired. The babas developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #333333;">The sinkeh were the traders, the coolies and the shophouse owners. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The babas became the lawyers, the civil servants and the politicians; they attended the local English-language schools run in the tradition of the UK's public schools, and Oxford and Cambridge. </span></strong>If the sinkeh received an overseas education at all, it was in Nanking or another university in China. Although the sinkeh dominated Singapore's population, it was <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the babas who dominated public decision-making.</span></strong> In effect, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a baba minority captured sinkeh Singapore, and that minority's attitudes were more those of Victorian England than China.</span></span></p>

Many of Singapore's most prominent Chinese have had baba backgrounds.</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Lee Kuan Yew</span><span style="color: #333333;">, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example. He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</span></span></strong></p>

He was not brought up as a Chinese with a focus on China, but as a baba who looked to England. He followed the conventional career path of a baba and went to London to study law. And so Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore became Harry Lee of Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. His father had given him and two of his brothers English, as well as Chinese, names</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">. Did Lee run Singapore as a piece of Asia mired in Chinese ways? No. He ran it in a manner to which a British colonial administrator would have aspired.</span></span></strong></p>

Goh was born in 1918 in Malacca, the epicentre of baba culture, into a baba family. His parents were English-oriented Chinese Methodists.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 10px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 1.2em; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent; line-height: 1.3em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The baba influence is now more subtle, but still there. Singapore's current prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has the strongest baba pedigree of any of the country's leaders.</p>

              <p>In the PAP propaganda, foreigners are somehow depicted as so called "talents" while Singaporeans are despised.</p>
              <p>In the PAP propaganda, the story they tell is that Singapore somehow cannot survive without these foreign "talents".</p>

              <p>advertisment, like propanganda,  commonly use assertion.<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> An assertion is an enthusiastic or energetic statement presented as a fact, although it is not necessarily true. They often imply that the statement requires no explanation or back up, but that it should merely be accepted without question.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> </span></p>
