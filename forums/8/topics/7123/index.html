            <div class='col-md body'>What may look like Â“hard to getÂ” to a person may be some other forces at work.  Relationships are confusing and even dangerous, and most people need some clear, LOUD signals before they go the next step.<br><br>Usually girls do not dare assume that a guy is interested in them, because guys themselves play games.  One day they pay attention to you, the next they chat up another girl.  Today they ask you out, tomorrow they prefer to hang with their pals.  The meaning behind an action has so many interpretations.  Is he just being nice?  Was he joking?  Maybe he treats everyone that way.  Maybe heÂ’s just having fun.  I bet every girl has been thru such confusing times.  As I said, loud and clear signals are needed before girls believe that a guy is interested.  We donÂ’t want any misunderstanding that will result in us being called a thick-skinned-why-donÂ’t-u-look-at-urself-in-the-mirror-first girl.<br><br>As such, it is logical for a girl to be wary and cautious.  How to tell if he really likes us, or heÂ’s just being a good buddy?  ThatÂ’s why we have a round of rigorous testing to force out the true intentions from a guy.  This is also a chance to get to know each other better.  We donÂ’t want to waste time on something that weÂ’re not interested in.<br><br>So guys, if you think the girlÂ’s playing hard to get, first examine your actions before calling her a stuck up bitc*.  If you are interested in a girl, donÂ’t pray pray, just be yourself, do your homework (background checks on her and probability of success) be daring, be forthcoming, donÂ’t b afraid of getting closer bcos we donÂ’t bite (not much anyway).  If you think u might get rejected, well, a really nice girl will be equally honest and gentle with you even if she rejects u.<br><br>Secondly, donÂ’t let ur ego or face get in the way. I know many guys out there are worried that their buddies will laugh at them, or are judging his performance of getting the girl.  This all puts undue pressure on the guy, n he hates to be seen as hard-up or desperate.  This all leads to erratic behavior, of saying one thing and meaning the other, and blowing hot and cold, all of which adds up to lots of misunderstanding.  I recommend u donÂ’t announce that ur going hunting except to a few close pals and show off the prize after u succeed.<br><br>Taa.<br><br>- joelle<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I'd rather prefer a girl play hard-to-get rather than how big a diamond he can buy for her to test how much a guy loves her.<br><br>It may be one of the way to protect themselves from those who just want to play play. Also, it boosts the guy's ego if he manage to get the girl in the end. Victory is sweet, defeat is bitter. Even if you don't win the girl's heart, you learn something out of it. So, either way you win. (I think I'm slightly out of point here.)<br><br>Anyway, if the girl is too easy, then it implies easy come, easy go. But I guess this thing is relative. What you see as impossible maybe a challenge to someone else. So, if you like the girl, go for it, else that someone will win her over.</div>

If its so confusing, why do it?<br><br>Reading what the guys have said, it just goes to show even more how differently we react to this because of how things are.<br><br>Maybe I have a different concept of playing hard to get. I see it as not allowing us to get close, while teasing us guys when we seem to back off a little. I think thats different from not wanting to enter into a relationship because of uncertainty of their part- something quite sensible I might add.<br><br>Throw us a line will ya? If its 3 and 4, show at least a LITTLE reaction so that we will actually go and try to prove our affection. By all means, test all you want. For the darlings whose hearts we are trying to win because we feel that we have a chance, no problem. For those who want to play with our feelings, we will catch on sooner or later.<br><br>We are not all young, enthusiastic, rich or gutsy enough to go through dramatic displays of our love to someone only to get rejected.

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope that i'm not sounding snobbish........what i gathered so far from experience ( so far 3 times ) is that the only way to so called successfully woo a girl is by touching her heart.........cos a girl usually will check her feelings more that and than start to rationalise.......i tried wooing a girl in my jc (which i like alot) by asking her out...trying to organise more opportunites to study together but such tricks doesn't work unless.....<br>1)she feels comfortable with you<br>2)tall and well built<br>3)reasonably pleasant looking<br>4)pleasant personality<br>5)good "chemistry"<br>6)she likes you also<br><br>all or most of the above criteria need to be satisfied<br><br>than i realise that for a realtionship to happen I'll have to work hard to<br>"""TOUCH"" her heart<br><br>this was what i did to woo my present g/f in uni<br>1 )for her up coming exams ....i bought a lovely bottle about the size of a" BIG milo can"<br>2)made paper stars about the size of "thumb tack"<br>3)fill the bottle up with paper stars that i've made<br>......<br>the whole bottle took me about 4 weeks  to finish,tried counting the number of stars but gave up cos it was too much ....i think should be about 3000-4000 stars and all of them hand-made...it was really siong man.<br>anyway my g/f was very touched when she received it......<br><br>.....i continue to strive to touch her heart by writing cards and sending her flowers to encourage her in her studies....<br>i also ask her out and express my feelings for her and ask her for her response....she took about 1 week plus to consider which i was very sincere and persistence in my feelings towards towards her....finally she agrees to be my g/f<br><br>anyway...i hope that for the guys out there who's really sincere about the girls they're wooing that they'll be successful in their quest....maybe they can try my method<br><br>remember have to "TOUCH THE GIRL'S HEART" if not probably nothing will happen unless.......<br>1)she feels comfortable with you<br>2)tall and well built<br>3)reasonably pleasant looking<br>4)pleasant personality<br>5)good "chemistry"<br>6)she likes you also<br>........which my g/f doesn't feels towards me initially<br></div>
