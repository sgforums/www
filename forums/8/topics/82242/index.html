            <div class='col-md body'>1.<br><br>One day a father and his rich family took his young son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose to show him how poor people can be.  They  spent a day and a night in the farm of a very poor family.  When they got back from their trip the father asked his son, "How was the trip?"<br><br>Very good, Dad!"<br><br>"Did you see how poor people can be?" the father asked.<br><br>"Yeah!"  "And what did you learn?"<br><br>The son answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four.  We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden, they have a creek that has no end.  We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars.  Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon.<br><br>When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.<br><br>His son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!" Isn't it true that it all depends on the way you look at things?  If you have love, friends, family, health, good humor and a positive attitude toward life, you've got everything!<br><br>Moral of story:<br><br>You can't buy any of these things.  You can have all the material possessions you can imagine, provisions for the future, etc., but if you are poor of spirit, you have nothing!<br><br>2.<br><br>Two men, both seriously ill, occupied the same hospital room.One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room's only window.The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back.The men talked for hours on end.They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their jobs,their involvement in the military service, where they had been on vacation.Every afternoon when the man in the bed by the window could sit up,he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window.The man in the other bed began to live for those one-hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and color of the world outside.The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake.Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats.Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite detail,the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine the picturesque scene.One warm afternoon the man by the window described a parade passing by.Although the other man couldn't hear the band - he could see it.In his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. Days and weeks passed.One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away.As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window.The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside.He strained to slowly turn to look out the window beside the bed.It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window.The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall.She said, "Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you."<br><br>Moral of story:<br><br>There is tremendous happiness in making others happy, despite our own situations.Shared grief is half the sorrow, but happiness when shared, is doubled.If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money can't buy.Today is a gift, that's why it is called the present<br><br></div>
