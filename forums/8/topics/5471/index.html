A FORUM?!?!? it's pretty sad dont you thk? what's the pt in posting this here? you came accross as being extremely bitter and whiny, eager to vent your fustrations somewhere convenient.. namely us, where most of us prolly dont even know this place you're talking abt. you repeatedly emphasised the fact tt you didnt get anythg for your "kindness"; was a reward your motivation for being a "nice guy"? if you were truly trying to help, then who cares what they do. if they dont appreciate it it's their prob. but if you offer your services and expect everyone to be soooo grateful, it's no wonder you got on ppl's nerves.<br><br>exterminator was merely explaining to you why you were so "hated" (albeit in a pretty harsh manner) but... "you suck"? when someone resorts to insults, it only serves to show how he has nothg else to say. if kintaro goes to another forum flaming sggirls cos of our posts "against" him, and one of us see tt post, i thk most of us wld do what exterminator has done and... flamed tt ass!!!<br><br>you're definitely coming accross as a childish immature jerk. if tt's too blunt, too bad. i may not know the exact details behind this whole "misunderstanding" but have you ever even considered tt this world doesnt revolve ard you only? blaming other ppl when thgs go wrong in your life is a mark of a coward.<br><br>you're going to let an incident on the INTERNET affect your behaviour. do you know how this reflects on you? honestly, you come accross as being a wimp with no life. you're making a mountain out of a molehill. if this HWZ is really such a "heartless" place then hell, dont go there anymore lah!<br><br>i'm pretty much very disgusted by you now spy.....<br><br>PS. hmm, come accross as being very harsh here but... was pretty worked up over what you said spy. i'm not insulting you, cos i honestly dont know you at all, just tt, frm your posts, this is the image you "portray". maybe you shld really thk abt this whole issue?<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 20-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firstly, i want to emphasise tt this was the IMPRESSION i got frm his posts. spy may be a totally dif guy in real life for all i know, and care.<br><br>"ataraxia, have nothign against u<br>just a reminder<br>its hard to be a ppl's champion<br>to be wanted in a crowd etcetc<br>u forget to keep this in mind, that is ur trouble<br>no matter what anyone did so badly, selfishly u cant post this up<br>maybe one of these days the tides will turn against u..."<br><br>unfortunately, i dont understand what you're trying to say at all. are you implying tt i thk i'm really popular so i feel i have the right to flame spy? if you really thk so then... it's up to you lor. i really cannot be bothered with what people on the NET thk of me. this is who i am, this is how i behave. this is not a case of simple unpopularity. if spy did NOTHING to cause such dislike then i'll be the first to admit tt i'm wrong and apologize. but IMHO, i thk he really has nothg to whine abt.<br><br>i'm extremely pissed off abt this topic because i absolutely hate ppl like tt. i had a classmate, who used to come to class in the morning, slump on her desk and bawl her eyes out. naturally, there'll be a huge commotion with everyone trying to console her. then she'll start whining abt how A dislike her, how B doesnt appreciate her, etc. frankly, everyone knew why. she wld volunteer her services all the time, whether it's needed or not. tt isnt too bad; afterall she's just being helpful rite? but, the catch is, you're spposed to be eternally grateful. you're indebted to her. FOREVER. it doesnt matter tt she cocks up everythg she does. it doesnt matter tt she'll ditch you for anyone else.<br><br>had to go off for awhile here...<br><br>basically, i hate whiners. but whether spy is truly a whiner is somethg i'll prolly nv find out. our net personalities can be vastly dif frm how we are in real life, and i hope this is applicable to spy. you dont have to apologize to me.. what the hell for? there's nthg to apologize for. if this is how you are, it's how you are, why are you apologizing for yourself? i'm basically very pissed off by this kind of behaviour, but if you thk yours was justified then... fine by me. whether others find me harsh, or they thk i'm getting ego, tt's their problem. i know who i am, i know why i'm doing thgs, so why bother with what they say? of course, if they make sense then i'll take their advice. if not, thanks but no thanks.<br><br>[This message has been edited by ataraxia (edited 21-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SPY:<br>if you really HATE that place so much, so SHUT AND LEAVE! Why even bother to keep complaining and complaining till here. I believe many here dun frequent HWZ.<br><br>Why even bother to bring the hatred here? If you hate the place, just leave. Come here to complain so much?? What for??? O levels? If O level is enough to drives you nuts, then you better dun take your As. I know of friends who score straight As for Os and can ended up failing or done badly for their As!!<br><br>If you can't even take this stress, dun think you can survive out in the real world? Have you ever be chase after by loanshark? Do you encountered someone accusing and swearing at you just becoz you are related to the person who had done the wronged? What is O level? Relax and take it calm.<br><br>What this whinning and crying really makes you sound like a 16 YEAR OLD LITTLE BRAT. Everyone gone through the age of 16. Who don't whine? But do u have to bring it from HWZ to SGGIRLS?!?!!??! Whatever for? For the people here to feels sorry and pity for you? This is something you have to learn. It's all part of life.<br><br>I'm not against you or out to flame you but just to let you know. GROW UP!!! Do you have to BRING out that you had 700+++++ postings? What are you trying to show?? No point in saying that. It is not uncommon for people to take advantages of your "kindness". Just forget it. For me, I help customers with some problems and they take it as I OWED THEM! So what do you want me to do?? Come here and complain???<br><br>You should understand that you got fired is due to the reasons of some unwanted postings at the wrong place. So just forget it. Who don't make mistake? There are times when I send the posting at the wrong area. So just forget it. Why even bother to make an issue out of it?????<br><br>Atarixia:<br>I see that you are taking your Os easy. So why don't you try to teach him how to do it.<br>You fluck your chinese? Then how are you going to JC?!?!?!?!<br><br>For me, I take it easy too. I can even play mahjong during my Os period!!! But I didn't do as well as I expect myself to do but still good enough for me to get to anywhere. Though I screw up the later part of my studying life!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>------------------<br>why, bishamon? why bish?<br>coz he's God of War!!<br>But I'm a peacelover! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
