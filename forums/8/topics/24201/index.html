            <div class='col-md body'>Those who are big and bulky may not have the strength of those lean and full of definition ones but that's not always the case. The issue of strength and stamina is with the type of training you take up.<br><br>I personally feel that body building makes you feel more healthy, gives you more self-esteem. It also makes you look good. Once you look good, you'll feel good. And I dare say that gym is one of the only places that you can train almost all the major muscle groups. It's just that some people are overly obsessed with it and spurge money on protein supplements, creatine, testosterone and steriods.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alex, I agree with u! It is difficult to get a muscular body.  I train and I have a muscular body, I wear tight-fitting shirts because I look macho wearing that. This is the same as women who wear skimpy low-cut dresses to show off their figure.<br>By the way, when do u weightlift at MacPherson CC?<br>Andy</div>
