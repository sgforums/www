            <div class='col-md body'>My friend recommand me to SecondLife, an online game in which you have virtual life and also business. I created a charater for myself, but haven't figure out how to play it.<br>Is there anybody can teach me how to use it?<br>Quesion:<br>1. Is it necessary for me to buy a new land, so that i can build something new, such as shop, home? Or i can build things anywhere?<br>2. When i find some interesting places, it's very difficult for me to get there by running or flying, especially when it's very far from my current position. Is there any better way to get there?<br>3. I supposed i could meet many charater there on the land, but actually i didn't see anyone after i met a guy at the starting point. Where are they? Are they in any gathering places?<br>4. Anyway, it's very complicated for me, coz i never played any video games!!!!</div>

The SL money can be converted to real money. Its like e-commerce. It really depends on how well you sell your product.</div>

In real world we have streets, blocks, residential area and CBD. In second life there are too many strange buildings, some are only objects in stead of buildings.<br>Yesterday, I tried to build something in the area which belongs to someone else. I just began to practice while someone threw my building into "lost and found".</div>
