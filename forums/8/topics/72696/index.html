            <div class='col-md body'>Ha today in class ME was about BGR, the class were all hounding our teacher about his love life and all that stuff. They kept hounding/flaming him about not proposing properly. Properly = Suddenly out of the blue "WILL U MARRY ME". THey critiscised him for doing it the boring way.... "planning months and months before", and actually realising the marriage was going to happen without the "sweeping off the feet part". THey also kept hounding him over why didn't he do all the Valentine's day stuff. Also they stuck with this idea that a couple must be the same in everything etc<br><br>But i stuck on the teacher's side for this one. I believe the students are very narrow to simply rely on the fluttering feeling of being swept off feet. Sure that's important, but that is not the only thing a BGR is part of. Also, is a BGR special if the relationship is only enjoyable on days like V-day only? I believe 2 different people can get along fine as long as communication is present, they need not be in the same category of characteristics all the time.<br></div>
