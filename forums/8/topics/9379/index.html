            <div class='col-md body'>It's true that on a forum such as this, one can post up almost anything (esp. since the topic of this forum is "Anything under the sun").<br><br>But the content of one's post does reflect somewhat on one's character, no matter how much you protest to the contrary.<br><br>It's apparent from Colette's post that she at least does do some thinking, and manages to articulate her thoughts well. Hello Kitty's post reflects a certain lack of consideration for others.<br><br>But by far the most telling posts are those put up by lamers like this C++logic. It literally screams "character defect".<br><br>You can pretend all you like that the Internet is anonymous, and you can run amok and post however you like, but whenever you type in a post and hit that submit button, that decision will show some facet of your character.<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br><br>[This message has been edited by Arbiter (edited 04 October 2000).]</div>
