There is no dispute over its harmful effects but to generalise that it spoils girls' personality and all is taking it to the extreme. why the focus of girls? Aren't guys doing the same thing? Why is it "macho" for guys and "yucky" for girls? I don't think this post is meant to "prove" that guys dislike girls who smoke. In fact from some of the postings, there are guys who have no problem with it.<br>Personally I'm a non smoker and I will not like my other half to be a smoker, for health reasons. However I do not see the need to ostrazice (think wrong spelling here) the fairer sex just cos they choose to smoke. It is just another choice. If I cannot tolerate it, I will either tell the girl not to smoke in my presence or to move away when she smokes. IMHO, it is alright to give advice to persuade them to quit but not to overwhelm them and impose sexist opinions.</div>

My "sexist" part is refering to guys feeling that smoking for girls is "yucky" and spoils all image &amp; impression but conversely thinks that it is alright or even "macho" for guys to smoke.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>certainly its some reason(s) to why  they r smoking,rite? but i think 80% is due to peer presure..its kinda hard to resist leh.<br><br>but from what i read from the others comments, it was sure kinda sad to noe what the others r thinking bout.<br><br>shouldn't we try to help those in need?<br>since we noe smoking is bad , we should at least pressure them to smoke less what.. even if we can't stop them from smoking rite?<br><br>even if they r not our gers or friends or whatever, since they r our friends , i think we should ask them to be 'more pollution free' isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>anyway, Js hope that others will be more health concious lor, dun say never mind or what lah, nor say its their problem.<br>if thats the case, then whats the use of being  friends since thats what u all think.<br>AIN'T i correct?????<br><br>------------------<br>VIVA......

            <div class='col-md body'>smoking is one's own personal right. be it for da male or female. generalising females who smoke as being cheap or unlady like sux. guys who have themselves smoke like chimneys who have this mentality should be stuffed with a carton of ciggys up their u know where.  :p<br><br>smoking is for free, smoking is for u and me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br><strong><br>::</strong> eat your cereal with a fork, do your homework in the dark<br><a href="http://occy.skynode.com" rel="nofollow">occyzine</a></div>
