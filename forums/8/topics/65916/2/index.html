Boss should be MEGA right?</div></blockquote>Lucemon is a very strong Rookie Level Digimon. If you remember in episode 3 ( Kumamon Baby Light My Fire ), Bokomon explained to the Digidestined that Human type Digimon and Beast type Digimon used to always have conflicts between them. Then one day a brave Digimon Lucemon came and solved their conflicts and governed the Digital World. Then one day he became evil, so The Ten Legendary Warriors came and fought bravely to defeat him. He was defeated and three angel Digimon took over and governed the Digital World. Cherubimon, Orphanimon and Seraphimon. ( Its still unknown and might never be known whether Lucemon was Rookie Level at that time. )<br><br>However, Lucemon was never defeated only sealed in the core of the Digital World or in more specific terms Dark Area. He first appeared in the anime trapped in the Dark Area after Cherubimon is defeated. He cannot escape because he needs to collect digicode for more power. He first appearance physically was in episode 47 where his 2 loyal henchmen collecting digicode for him was defeated by Takuya and Koji. He absorbed the Digicode of his henchman and digivolved straight in Ultimate Level and kicked Takuya and Koji's butt. ( Don't ask me why not the others if you don't want spoilers. )<br><br>As for Seraphimon toy, I don't know. I only collect those 1.5 inch figures as there are lots of variety.<br><br></div>

Which means everything has been destroyed except for the Dark Area where Lucemon stays and some pieces of land floating in space.<br><br>In episode 48, one of the Digidestined who I might as well say who Koichi, Koji's brother is killed by Lucemon ( Chaos Mode ). First time death of a Digidestined.<br><br>Btw, Digimon Frontier is the last season for the time being. Phew, my computer hanged 3 times while I was typing this.</div>
