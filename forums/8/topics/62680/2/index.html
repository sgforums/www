"behind every successful man is a woman" what's wrong with wanting to build a strong family rather than climbing the career ladder?<br><br>equality should be in terms of opportunities.. in terms of education, promotion, etc.. but man and woman have always played different roles.. can the man take the role of the woman or the woman the role of the man? would u prefer a very independent gf who is successful in everything she does and nv sa jiao to u?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>my ex say i too independent.. he no need coax me or wat wan.. and i no need to meet him very very often wan.. i dunno how to teh him.. den he dun like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>oh yes... coaxing is fun.. but NOT when it's always one sided. i'm sorry if ur bf doesn't, but dun tell me u dunno that the GENERAL consensus is that girls need to be "hong" and guys don't. in ur case, and possibly others, ur bf doesn't hong you, but i'm sure u still maintain that girls "need" to be hong. and again GENERALLY, the converse isn't really heard alot, that guys need to be hong too. it's not wat actually happens, it's the mentality of wat SHOULD happen. hope u know wat i mean. i can't stress enuff that i'm speaking generally. u may of course be a different type of woman, special.<br><br>i'm with you when there is an instinct for man to protect, and women to be protected. that is my no 1 reason for believing that there will be no equality between the sexes. however being protected is different from not having a character. RELYING on ur man is not being protected by him. how about this for a long shot: marrying a rich husband is certainly not being protected. again, of course i'm not saying that all women are like that lar, but ask yourself, in the conversations with ur girlfriends utter these statements? when a "joke" is told too often, don't be surprised that it's not really a joke after all. of course, i'm referring to the "joke" that girls use: "i'll find a rich guy and marry him!"<br><br>now we move on to corporate opportunities. wat gives disgruntled women the idea that they have less opportunities? it's a sexisit world out there, but many women know how to play the game. particularly good looking ones. ok so some women aren't so good looking. is that a MAN's fault? how about when a man is disgruntled when a woman sleeps her way to the top? by "sleep" i don't necessarily mean having sex, but using her attractiveness, charm as a stepping stone. in this world, use watever u have wisely, i have no problems with that. she will rise using her body (and with brains if not she's gonna fall) i will rise using something else.<br><br>the present company i'm in, most of the senior management are women. in fact, i like it like that. i've heard that the males get better treatment in there becos the top is female, as for why, i think no need to explain. so that benefits me.<br><br>regarding ur last sentence, well i suppose every couple has a way of "doing things". i mean u both have come this far, sometimes talking things out might not help, but that's the first step. beyond that, besides love for each other, there has to be a certain understanding of each other that need not be spoken about. for example, if u tell him that girls need to be coaxed, or YOU need to be coaxed, even if u are independant, and he does so becos you told him to, also no point rite? my as well get a robot as a bf, everything u want just input the command. that's why in an argument when someone asks me, "so wat u want me to do?" i will sometimes reply with, if i told u my as well get a robot to command better. i rather they ask their own heart, but aiyah i digress....<br></div>
