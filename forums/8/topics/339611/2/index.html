              <p>Its easy to say what another person should or
                            should not do until that person is you. You don't know what it
                            would be like unless you are in the situation yourself so don't
                            judge another person's actions unless you've been there.</p>

              <p>Hi Guys and Gals, I just got this.</p>
              <p>Some one just email me.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva; color: #ff0000; font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a name="10_Essential_Health_Tips">10 Essential Health 
              		Tips</a></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva; color: #000080; font-size: small;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080;"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Move More</strong><br> Make it a daily challenge to find ways to move your body. Climb stairs 
              		if given a choice between that and escalators or elevators. Walk your 
              		dog; chase your kids; toss balls with friends, mow the lawn. Anything 
              		that moves your limbs is not only a fitness tool, it's a stress buster. 
              		Think 'move' in small increments of time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080;"> <strong>2.</strong> <strong>Cut Fat</strong><br> Avoid the obvious such as fried foods, burgers and other fatty 
              meats (i.e. pork, bacon, ham, salami, ribs and sausage). Dairy products such as 
              cheese, cottage cheese, milk and cream should be eaten in low fat versions. Nuts 
              and sandwich meats, mayonnaise, margarine, butter and sauces should be eaten in 
              limited amounts. Most are available in lower fat versions such as substitute 
              butter, fat free cheeses and mayonnaise.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080;"> <strong>3.</strong> <strong>Quit Smoking</strong> <br> The jury is definitely in on this verdict. Ever since 1960 when 
              the Surgeon General announced that smoking was harmful to your health, Americans 
              have been reducing their use of tobacco products that kill. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080;"> <br> <strong>4</strong>. <strong>Reduce Stress</strong> <br> Easier said than done, stress busters come in many forms. Some 
              				techniques recommended by experts are to think positive 
              				thoughts. Spend 30 minutes a day doing something you like. (i.e.,Soak 
              in a hot tub; walk on the beach or in a park; read a good book; visit a friend; 
              play with your dog; listen to soothing music; watch a funny movie. Get a 
              massage, a facial or a haircut. Meditate. Count to ten before losing your temper 
              or getting aggravated. Avoid difficult people when possible. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080;"> <br> <strong>5</strong>. <strong>Protect Yourself from Pollution </strong><br> If you can't live in a smog-free environment, at least avoid 
              smoke-filled rooms, high traffic areas, breathing in highway fumes and 
              exercising near busy thoroughfares. Exercise outside when the smog rating is 
              low. Exercise indoors in air conditioning when air quality is good. Plant lots 
              of shrubbery in your yard. It's a good pollution and dirt from the street 
              deterrent. <br> <br> <strong>6.</strong> <strong>Wear Your Seat Belt</strong><br> Statistics show that seat belts add to longevity and help 
              alleviate potential injuries in car crashes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000080;"> <br> <strong>7.</strong> <strong>Floss Your Teeth</strong><br> Recent studies make a direct connection between longevity and 
              teeth flossing. Nobody knows exactly why. Perhaps it's because people who floss 
              tend to be more health conscious than people who don't? <br> <br> <strong>8.</strong> <strong>Avoid Excessive Drinking</strong> <br> While recent studies show a glass of wine or one drink a day 
              (two for men) can help protect against heart disease, more than that can cause 
              other health problems such as liver and kidney disease and cancer. <br> <br> <strong>9.</strong> <strong>Keep a Positive Mental Outlook </strong><br> There's a definitive connection between living well and 
              healthfully and having a cheerful outlook on life. <br> <br> <strong>10.</strong> <strong>Choose Your Parents Well </strong><br> The link between genetics and health is a powerful one. But just 
              because one or both of your parents died young in ill health doesn't mean you 
              cannot counteract the genetic pool handed you. Thought for the day: Follow these 
              basic tips for healthy living and you can better control your own destiny</span></p>
