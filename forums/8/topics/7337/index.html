            <div class='col-md body'>The relation between the 3 we all know, yet someone can say that we leave it to the banks themselves to handle. If that is so, why bother to divert part of CPF into the DBS/ POSB. So if you tries to shift the CPF into them this is not called interfering, if this goes on I really think my vote in the forecoming election should go to the opposition. Support them too much and now the result is every thing also increase but not the pay. Too much of an coincident that all company in singapore faces a "SUDDEN" increase in costs........ So Fed UP now,,, with all the policies.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By allowing funds to transfer from the CPF to top up the $2, essentially it means that now DBS has rights to the money in OUR CPF account.. wise move.<br><br>More hands on our money with little interest. Wise move. &lt;clap clap&gt;<br><br>...then again, if this implementation is to be allowed for all the banks, then at least its fair.

            <div class='col-md body'>A best solution is to form 'union banks' which provide low interest, limited banking facilities.. but caters to the heartlanders who has little money in their account.<br><br>But then, by doing this, it will be similar to creating another POSB.

            <div class='col-md body'>Wierd that the Govt actually says that merging DBS and POSB will result in better synergy , better efficiency and all this leads to HIGHER COSTS now, if DBS cannot even manage it's own costs and wanst to pass this cost to All accounts holder, doesn't it shows how "Efficient" and "competitive" Singapore banking industry is !!!!<br><br>Efficient in raising charges, competitive in seeing who raise the most charges.<br><br>Given such mentality of banking industry that higher costs of operations, pass on to cosumer instead of streamlining operations, is it making our banks more competitive in the global arena..... Singapore banks  are really big LOSERS......<br><br>Ask singaporeans not to forget our roots, now the banks in singapore also forgot the support given to its, so much for moral eduaction.
