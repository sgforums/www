Its a basic respect for other races.<br><br>To the PRC, Taiwanese and HK people, they feel very strange how come Singaporean Chinese talk to each other in English. They feel that we look snorbish and not respectful and the most important Wang4 Ben2.<br><br>I was a so called Chinese Helicopter and English Submarine before. Luckily english submerged only and never sink all the way to the bottom. Today a lot of SG Banana man/woman have their Chinese sink all the way to the bottom and still very proud of it. The Ang Moh arent happy with the way they speak English either. They r just neither here nor there. Only have themself to blame.<br><br>For those that is learning chinese,<br>Start learning Chinese today, its never too late. Start writting chinese with a writting pad also if u can. PRC can never automate everything as they need to create jobs, so somehwere, somehow, u still need to write chinese if u want to do business with PRC*. Forget about the keyboard hanyupingyin, the chinese characters are just like a painting, u need to draw(write) in order to remember the character. I only use  hanyupingyin when I really cannot remeber the character Im writting. Forget about what the old men tells you  by typing hanyupingyin on the keyboard is enough to learn chinese. Thanks to his help, most youngsters now cant even speak their own dialects. Their chinese also never improved even without the influence of dialects for the pass decades. Killed and chopped everything. Sigh. Im proud to speak to my grand uncle in China in Cantonese.<br><br>*And also, u learn a language not just because u want to do business with that country, it should not be started like this. U learnt a language because u want to know what the other party(the language u are learning) is thinking, for the same issue written in several languages in diffferent countries, and most importantly u want to know their culture, values n etc.<br><br>If I offended anybody here, say sorry first.<br><br>To mod: BTW, I cant post chinese in this forum? Hope its not too troublesome for u. Thanks.</div></blockquote>My lect said accordin to our dna, scientist have found out that we all came from AFRICA!! Yeah!!!
