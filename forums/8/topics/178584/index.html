            <div class='col-md body'>At least this church still care to say "Other religon are good, but our is better"..<br><br>I still remember during my 3mth in a missonary JC (about many many moons) located in southern Singapore near to World Trade Centre, we were forced to go for the church session. Initially, no problem everything were quite nice and we were quite impressed. Then one day, there was this new pastor in the session with us.<br><br>This pastor, around his early 40s, went up to the stage and give us a talk. But as the talk went on, the pastor seemed to loose his cool head and started to fan religion hatres. Upon, hearing that he openly declared "All religions, other than Chrsitianity, are satanic!", there was a uproar in the students crowds. A lot of the students stood up and walked out of the hall - included me.<br><br>Later, that afternoon, I had a talk with my senior from my Secondary. She told me that it was a common practice here to brainwash the new students. I could not tahan, and moved on to my poly education in the following Jun joint admission.<br><br>To be fair, living in singapore - multi-racial society, we should treasure the goodwill build-up with our fellow singaporean from different faiths and races. We should not jeapordise and take this good peaceful living environment in Sg for granted! We should respect other fellow singaporeans' faith.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a Christian though but this message isn't from my church but I think i can interpret abit...<br><br>1) "only through us (christianity) will only Heaven opens its gates for you"<br>Every religion believes that they are the really one true religion, and the rest if just beliefs.... Sames as Christianity that people believed only thru Jesus you'll get grace redeem by the Father.<br><br>2) "other religions are good, our's better"<br>I wouldn't agree with this though.... Just as I personally think Christanity is not a religion. Simply religion is nothing more than like a duties and action where people perform to achieve something or believes... Christian always believe Christianity is a relationship though.<br><br>3) "there are so many tragedies around the world, it is a sign for these people to accept Christ or these tragedies will always befall on them"<br>Christian life is definitely not a bed of roses and bad things happened to good people too.<br><br>4) "look around this world, most of the developed countries has a christian majority population"<br>Well this I got to agree... 6 out of the 8 G nations are Christian predominated. 2 Out of the 20 most riches country in the world are Christian predominated or a substaintial number of Christianity presense. And the poorest nation of the world is right in the opposite.<br><br>5) when he asked new members of congregation to accept christ... he said, "don't hesitate, for those who are scared that parents will object, don't worry, Jesus will sort it out for you"<br>You salvation is more important than anything else and of course honouring the parents is what Christian must do.

My only comment is that this speaker's assessment of the Catholic faith is extremely stereotyped.<br><br>Having said all that, I have heard many good speakers who do not feed on the emotions, fears, insecurities and aspirations of the worshippers. These speakers go straight to the doctrinal teachings of the Bible and teach practical lessons.</div>

Many people would find it offensive.<br><br>I can see that he's trying very hard not to make one-sided comments, but it is obviously not working. For example, he admitted that other religions are good, but claims that Christianity is better. Whether which religion is better is subjective. But I don't people will see it this way. They will find it offensive.<br><br>For point 5, how can he force people to join?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Typically these speakers are not the standard Sunday speaker type. They are more charismatic (in the behavioural sense) and gregarious. Some of these are itnerant speakers engaged for short projects. Something like motivational speakers.<br><br>I have seen some of these engaged by my church to do camps and retreats (normally during June and December). Some concepts that these speakers preach is bordering on being stupid. One time, my own church's head pastor had to step in to fight some "fire" because of some doctrinal differences.</div>
