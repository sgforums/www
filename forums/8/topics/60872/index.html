Learn to read the signals and go from 'normal friends' to love birds.<br><br>Girls have always been wondering how to tell when a guy is interested in her.

Do take note that one indicator alone may not be enough and often is the combination of a few such indicators that really tells you that you have an admirer that wants to share lifeÂ’s best moments with you.<br><br>He Cares<br><br>If you can feel that he really cares about you and he is not doing this to everyone else, then chances are very high that he is interested in you. If you are sick and he takes the trouble to buy medicine for you or send you home, then you are in for a serious romance, he wants you!<br><br>He Compliments You<br><br>If a guy keeps telling you good things about yourself like you look great in a dress, you are pretty, you are one of a kind and so on more than once, take it as a definite sign that he is interested in you.<br><br>He is Curious<br><br>He does not just ask about your job, hobbies and lifestyle. A guy that is genuinely interested in you will want to know much more. He'll want to know about your childhood, your first boy friend, your thoughts in life and your plan for future and so on.<br><br>He Keep Asking You Out<br><br>If he keeps asking you out for a movie, a drink, a walk by the beach, chances are he is interested. Better still, if he make effort to come to your house to pick you. But if he does not ask too regularly, don't take it as low interest. He may be waiting for your response to see if you feel the same.<br><br>He Gets Affectionate<br><br>When he talks to you, he is gentle and lower his tone. You can sense that he do not talk this way to all his female friends. You realize that he may try to touch your hand or your shoulder and yet do not make you feel he is cheeky. Yes, if a guy really likes a girl, he would want to touch her (like hands and shoulders but not private parts) to test her response.<br><br>He Buys You A Present<br><br>If it is not your birthday or Christmas, if he buys you a gift all of a sudden and just because he thinks you would look nice with it, then it is a sure sign that he is interested in you big time.
