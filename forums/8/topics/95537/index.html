            <div class='col-md body'>The evil continues...<br><br><img src="http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/953/posters/poster3.jpg"><br><br>A deadly virus has been unleashed on the population of Raccoon City. "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is a terrifying adventure in survival horror. Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, one of only two survivors of the contained biochemical disaster in the first "Resident Evil," the $100 million hit that serves as a prologue to the all-out action and horror of "Resident Evil: Apocalypse". The film begins where the first film left off, with Alice in the heart of the ravaged and deadly Raccoon City. She has been subjected to biogenetic experimentation by the vast Umbrella Corporation and become genetically altered, with super-human strengths, senses and dexterity. These skills, and more, will be needed if anyone is to remain alive. Alice is joined by Jill Valentine (Guillory), a recently demoted member of Umbrella Corp?s elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.), Terri Morales (Holt), Carlos Oliviera (Fehr), L.J. (Epps), and Nicholai (Ward) who must survive and escape what is quickly becoming a City of the Dead. To reach their goal, they will need to battle their way through the relentless onslaught of the ravenous undead, as well as Umbrella forces and terrifying bioengineered weapons, the most deadly of which is the colossal, heavily armed assassin, Nemesis.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I saw it already. The movie SUCKS coz:<br><br>1. Milla fights nemesis hand to hand.. and WINS wtf!?!?!<br><br>2. Jill doesn't get chased.. in fact. Jill is errr marginalised compared to milla, which sucks. Milla gets chased by nemesis.. sian<br><br>3. Dunno wat the heck is goin on sometimes, like WHY the heck did the Umbrella guy want milla to fight nemesis for.<br><br>4. Nemesis is supposed to be a mindless MONSTER, not a freakin robot that follows orders and has a personality that doesn't want to kill a girl in the end...<br><br>5. Nemesis doesn't use tentacle weapons, only some minigun and a rucket luncher.<br><br>6. Milla and Jill kill zombies in the graveyard using kungfu.<br><br>7. Jill and the black dude can't shoot a licker when its in front O them.<br><br>8. Jill keeps irrtatingly walking in that stupid small side step stance.<br><br>9. Jill is hot, but almost too thin <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>10. Storyline ruined coz of the fact that a WHOLE city seems under control of Umbrella corp.. i.e. no normal government soldiers or mention of the federal gahmen... no fbi... just umbrella... umbrella.<br><br>11. After saving jill from a dog One of the professional soldiers intros himself to jill with a salute and then gets bitten by the dog again ROFL<br><br>wad else.. hmmmm, that's abt it lol. Seriously save your money.. Fellow fans of RE series will be ultra disappointed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well here is some triva for anyone who is interested to find out how it relate to the original game that spark off this movie.<br><br>Trivia for<br>Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004)<br><br>Natasha Henstridge was asked to play the role of Jill Valentine, but could not accept due to other work commitments.<br><br>"Nemesis" is the subtitle of the third game in the Resident Evil videogame series.<br><br>The film contains many visual and thematic references to the games:<br><br>The sequence in which RPD members are surrounded by zombies at an intersection is taken almost shot for shot from an FMV in Resident Evil 3 (the most noticeably similar shot is the slow zoom in on the police helmet).<br><br>The sequence in which Alice runs down a hallway while a helicopter shoots out the windows is identical to the opening cinema in Resident Evil: Code Veronica.<br><br>Jill also uses gas stoves to create an explosion in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis<br><br>Alice's visit to the gun shop may be a slight reference to Resident Evil 2, in which Kendo's Gun Shop is one of the first locations a player visits.<br><br>Angela Ashford plays a character similar to Shirey Birkin from Resident Evil 2.<br><br>Ashford is the name of the family that created Umbrella, as told in Resident Evil: Code Veronica.<br><br>The helicopter that delivers Nemesis' weapons is similar in look to the helicopter that delivered Mr. X in Resident Evil 2.<br><br>Alice's superhuman abilities are similar to those exhibited by Albert Wesker in Resident Evil: Code Veronica.<br><br>The idea of Dr. Ashford pulling strings to save people inside a zombie ridden area contains shades of Trent, a character from the Resident Evil books, written by S.D. Perry. Another similarity is that Trent's parents, like Dr. Ashford, created the T-Virus for benevolent purposes before it was hijacked by Umbrella.<br><br>In the opening scene with the weather map and the ending, both mention the Arklay Mountains. This is where the mansion in the original game was located<br>There is a shot near the end of the film of Alice's eye close up. This is a reference to the first game in the series - the close up eye shot is the logo/title screen of the game.<br><br>When the Umbrella agents pull up to the first house of the people they're sent to evacuate (the female scientist) the commercial playing on the TV screen in her home is a scene from the Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse trailer featuring the "Regenerate" product.<br><br>The commercial for the skin renewal product that was used as the advertisement for this film can be seen on the older woman's television set as the Umbrella Corp. agents go around the city collecting the scientists. The shot seen on the tv is of the woman sitting next to the Doberman.<br><br>During the commentary on the first Resident Evil (2002) movie, Milla Jovovich refers to her nipple appearing on screen, saying that this proves her dedication to the film. The director says that had she been really committed, she would have shown both nipples. In this sequel, she does show both nipples, towards the end while she's in the tank.<br><br>Milla Jovovich's move in which she drops her handgun and grabs it just before hitting the ground was lifted directly from Resident Evil: Code Veronica in which Claire Redfield pulls this in the opening movie and takes out a room full of guards.<br><br>Like the first movie, the word "zombie" is never used in the film.<br><br>The character of Jill Valentine wears the same outfit she wore in the third "Resident Evil" game.<br><br>Sienna Guillory based her movements of Jill by watching the way Jill moved in the game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.<br><br>Was originally entitled "Resident Evil: Nemesis" after the third game in the Resident Evil videogame series of the same name, which also had a similar plot.
