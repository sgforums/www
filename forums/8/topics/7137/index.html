            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Middlesbrough have lodged an appeal to the FA over the charge of<br>failing to control their players in the 4-3 defeat against Manchester<br>United.<br>Boro have acted because, once again, they are being penalised by TV<br>evidence and not through the more normal channels of a referee's report.<br>Referee Paul Durkin was in the thick of the Boro players' protests when<br>they appealed against United's fourth goal, but decided it wasn't<br>appropriate to include it in his report. However, the FA have since<br>brought the charge to Boro after studying the incident on video.<br>Bryan Robson was also furious at the decision because United players<br>were not punished over their similar hounding of referee Andy D'Urso in<br>the corresponding fixture at Old Trafford when he rightly awarded Boro a<br>penalty when Jaap Stam brought down Juninho in the area.<br>However, an FA spokesman has hit-back at claims that they are not<br>dishing out punishments on a fair and even basis.<br>He said: "We accept that Middlesbrough are not happy because<br>Manchester United have not been charged.<br>"But we sent a letter to every club after the Old Trafford incident pointing<br>out that action would be taken from that point, including Middlesbrough."<br>Boro could quite rightly hit-back by asking why Manchester United<br>weren't punished and therefore used as an example to the rest of the<br>Premiership not to copy their antics, instead of being let-off the hook while every other<br>team takes the rap.</strong><br><br>Its yet again another case of biasness for Man United from the FA  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>------------------<br>Masturbated once and fucked twice - Story of Man United against Real Madrid</div>

This is due to them wanting to postpone the match due to shortage of players because of injuries, but were rejected by the FA.

Geez i din't realise he's that good at it.Well, from my point as a football player, gaining a penalty is as good as scoring a goal. You cant blame players from celebrating that , right?

            <div class='col-md body'>True.Diving is cheating and cheating mars the already screwed-up beautiful game of football.We don't pay to watch theatrics of jokers who seek victories in these manners.<br><br>However, i do not believe this habit of diving is prevalent amongst ManutD players. I trust that they play to entertain and win by their skills and class which they undoubtedly possess.<br><br>Your views are definitely partisan and extremely biased.Certainly Manutd players are not the main antagonists.You are just plain biased and unfair in your remarks.Maybe you should change the way you view matters.How about using your dried-up brain instead of your ass, may i suggest?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>u'll never CRAWL aLONe..<br>cos the FOOLS r there 2~~</div>
