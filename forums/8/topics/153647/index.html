These is the animal instinct present in all humans. The basic instinct. The message is clear. Macho men rule. Weak men lose. Nerds are out<br><br>Because in developed society, our basic necessities, food water and finance need to worry about because of human politics. So the women rather get empowered by these issues and fall prey to unconventional patterns of courtship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No love lost actually.<br><br>Singapore girls are some of the most regressive species in the history of humankind, especially those executives who work around the financial district.<br><br>How do you explain the blatant and antisocial practice of reserving seats in food courts with tissue paper and umbrellas?  It's a national shame!!  I once had a foreign friend who visited and was amazed at the sight of tissue paper and empty tables all over the foodcourt.  He said, "You mean you people actually allow this?"<br><br>And that's not all, I take the NEL to DG every day to change to the NS line. And every time when the train before the train even arrives at DG, these women would get up and crowd at the door like they are ready to make the 100m dash to the escalator.  And hell, they do! I once saw this well-dressed exec woman run to the lift the moment the train door opened!!  Can you believe it!<br><br></div>

Russell crowe type fighter just makes a bigger target. Bill gates might not even need to lift a finger if he wants you died. Maybe you could build a time machine to go back. But wait a min, you need the nerds to build it for you cos all your body mass is in your dick instead of your brains.</div>

But why do they still want to go out with those macho hunters??<br><br>What i reckon will be, a macho guy, with brain, with assets and know when to please the lady is the type of desirable guy in the 20th century. Don't all the guys and gers agree?? who care abt a shit of goin back to the million yrs of staying in cave?? mayb u wish to...Gd luck on finding one...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hahhaa....this is the most funniest topic I have seen so far.  Man, which planet you are from?<br><br>You know what, I really believe u are an Ah Beng, you lack of knowledge in the nature law and eco system really "impress" me.<br><br>1st: All species here whether plant or animal need to achieve one very very basic thing, survival.  what you need to survive? Food and security. In the past a man need to be strong and macho to able to provide food and security to the female party.  But now it is a different world we live in.  We live in a world where someone without a handphone sound weird to us.  See even you have to use the internet and forums to complain about ur lack of female attention.  So now strong and macho doesnt guarantee survival, then of course women wont consider them a main factor.  Therefore if a "nerd" can provide better food and security option, why not?<br><br>2nd: Darwin law, survival of the fittest.  This law doesnt mean the ability to be strong and macho.  But the ability to survival in the social.  The female counterpart will like to produce offsprings whom can survive in this social.  that is the natural law in order for a specie to survive.<br><br>From the above two law, if you do not have any women attracted to you, you know why.</div>
