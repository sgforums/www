            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure there are a whole range of guys: from those that just don't give a shit about who their gf sees or hangs out with, to those that need to know her every movement every 5 seconds.... and i was just wondering where the guys in this forum lie on the spectrum.<br><br>maybe these few points might help u come up with a well thought out answer (please feel free to add more points):<br><br><ul>1. When she doesn't call for the whole day/nite do you think she's purposely trying to avoid you? If her not calling get's you honestly worried then that's ok. But dig deep, are you sure you're not suspicious?<br><br>2. When you are out with her and you notice a guy seriously checking her out, or if she meets a guy that she knows and this fren, being the charming, handsome and charismatic type, flirts with her without giving two hoots about your presense, how do u feel?<br><br>3. Does she talk about her male colleagues/classmates to you? If she does, do you feel irritated and uncomfortable? If she doesn't do you think it's becos she's got something to hide, or becos she knows or thinks that if she told you, you'd be suspicious of her when she's at work/school?<br><br>4. When she stays over at a chalet with her friends and for some reason you aren't there, do you believe her when she says it's all girls only? What if there are guys there too? What if her very single and eligible ex-bf was there too?</ul><br><br>Many more points that can be added to think over. If you could share your views with REAL experiences, rather than a this-is-what-i-think-i'll-feel-or-do attitude it'll be better!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so i'd say u both belong to the non-jealous catagory?<br><br>btw... of course gals can answer too, either change the words around to reflect ur attitudes to a bf, or even describe how u'd feel when your bf is jealous or even when he's not...<br><br>some gals are upset that her bf isn't jealous when she's happening with another guy!! that's pretty simple, if a guy isn't a little jealous it could mean he doesn't love her..

If she doesn't call me all day or all nite i'd be ok. i guess i don't want her to call me just becos it's her duty, but rather becos she wants to hear my voice or complain about something or just call for no reason! and by the same token that's what i'd do also. have to remember that if i dun call her or she dun call me it doesn't mean we're not thinking about one another.<br><br>2. If a stranger were to "beo" her i'd probably tell her! "eh ger ar, that guy looking at u leh..!" i feel there is no way a stranger that is giving her dubious looks can even be a threat to me, a person that's been putting in effort and love and someone that knows her and that she knows. and it doesn't help to boost her ego that someone thinks she's pretty!<br>As for this charming fren coming up to her and flirting with her outrageously, i guess i'll stand there and look pretty (if i got nothing to contribute to the conversation) until he's gone, and ask the usual, like who is he and blah blah. it won't affect me that much. to be honest, from experience, my gf would probably start complaining to me wat a sleeze he is!<br><br>3. talking about her male frens is a good thing. and i definitely welcome it. i'd rather she tell me and WANT to tell me becos i'm her bf and good fren and soul mate all in one so she just wants me to know and i'd give comments where necessary. i'd be a little worried if she never mentioned her guy frens tho, but ALWAYS mentions her gal frens. while i can't force her to tell me anything, i'd wanna make sure that she not telling me about her guy frens is not becos she thinks i'll be jealous. if that is sorted out, and she still refuses to talk about them i'd ask her why.<br><br>4. staying overnight anywhere anyplace with whoever USED to be fine with me. i'd even let her go on a holiday with her ex-bf (they are "good frens" and went with other pple of course). i had a gf that used to stay over at her galfren's place every now and then. and she spoke the truth. but after a while, since she knew i was cool about her staying over, she'd use that fren as an excuse whenever she wasn't coming home. and... well the rest is history, since i found out it wasn't that fren's house that she was at.</div>
