He gets paid only when there's a job.<br><br>'And that's why we try to save on renovation too. My sister-in-law recommended this interior designer. They seemed quite professional and quoted us about $16,000 for the renovation work.'<br><br>The interior design company, HomeTech Design &amp; Innovate, undertook the renovation, which including making kitchen and bedroom cabinets, wall tiling and electrical wiring for the whole house.<br><br>Madam Nazara said work started last December, and continued till the kitchen tiles were almost completed when the owners of the company asked for the rest of the payment in February this year.<br><br>STOPPED WORK MIDWAY<br><br>'They said they needed the money to pay the contractor for building the cabinets first. That's why I paid almost 90 per cent of the full sum,' said Madam Nazara.<br><br>But the contractor stopped work a few weeks into the project.<br><br>Madam Nazara said the company kept postponing the completion, with excuses that the contractor was busy with other jobs.<br><br>Then all of a sudden, the work stopped for good last month.<br><br>'I tried calling them but no-one answered the phone. I went to their office but their neighbours said they've not been seen for a while. I didn't know what to do, so I made a police report,' she said.<br><br>She also made a complaint to HBay, which lists accredited contractors.<br><br>The firm was listed with HBay then.<br><br>When contacted, HBay said they've received a number of complaints about the company over the past two months.<br><br>HBay added that the firm has been around for about six years with a pretty good track record, that's why they approved the accreditation then.<br><br>But they have since terminated the firm's membership.<br><br>HBay has about 40 members, who have to undergo three to six months' observation by HBay before approval is given.<br><br>Said an HBay spokesman: 'We're very careful and stringent about our membership but we can't stop these things from happening. We suspended the firm immediately after the complaints came and terminated them two months ago.<br><br>'We spoke to the boss who said that he had financial problems. But he has since disappeared.'<br><br>We tried to reach the company but were unable to reach the owners - a husband-and-wife team - on their handphones or office numbers.<br><br>Even their home at Joo Chiat looked like it has been vacated for a while, with old newspapers strewn around the porch and unread mail in the letter-box.<br><br>HBay said they've recommended a lawyer to the various home-owners who's looking into the case now.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Don't pay in full, HBay advises<br><br>PAY in instalments as the work is being done, said HBay. It recommends what it calls 'progressive payment'.<br><br>Explained an HBay spokesman: 'This means you pay when a certain portion of the job is done.'<br><br>With the progressive payment method, the home-owner pays a 10 per cent deposit of the agreed renovation fee at the start, and another 40 per cent when the materials are delivered to the house.<br><br>And only when the wet-works (plastering and concreting) is done should you pay another 40 per cent to the contractor, said HBay.<br><br>Added the HBay spokesman: 'The home-owner can pay the remaining 10 per cent when the rest is done. It's best to have everything in black and white, to protect yourself.'<br><br>Copyright Â© 2004 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. All rights reserved.<br></div>
