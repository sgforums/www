Do you know that some patients might need the amount to survive.... And now they can last 30 years... I rather hope help can be channel to other organisations which spent higher percentage of donation received to real cause..... We got aunties who dun work but donates their hard-earned money, wishing to relieve some pain/worries in these patient... And this is what we get from this 'non-profit charity organisation'???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> .... There r hundreds of charity organisations that need help too... They r so money-tight that they cant event advertise to raise fund....</div>
