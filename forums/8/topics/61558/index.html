            <div class='col-md body'>it's about eating right, exercising right, and most importantly.... cannot give up even you have achieved your ideal weight... It has been researched that if you go into dieting for just a few weeks, to lose off some kg, you may get to the point, but it will rebound back to it's original weight once you take off the diet. This is why all the TV advertisments claim to ensure you lose several kg within weeks, or even just the first week. Your body will bounce back because it need to return to it's homeostatic level, which is the one determining how much fat you will store. This level is hard to reduce especially in crash course dieting, because the fats that you burn off during your diet period would be quickly replenished shortly when you're off the diet, by converting all the food into fats.<br><br>If you want an extreme 10 ways of dieting, I can teach you, but it's not really feasible.<br>1) Don't look at the clock, or any one else, because we have been conditioned to hungry when it's meal time, so getting rid of clocks and watches and all in the office will ensure we do not know when it time to eat.<br>2) When you feel hungry, insert a balloon down your throat, and pump it up slightly. It had been done and people claimed to feel less hungry when the stomach is inflated.<br>3) Eat alone, because a reseacher has found that the size of a meal directly correlates with the number of people present.<br>4) Eat only Wheatgerm, because color and flavor of the food would only increase the pleasantness of the food, and increase consumption.<br>5) Stay away from food places and people who are eating, as the sight, smell, and taste would create a craving for the food.<br>6) Always think that you're in danger, and remain vigilant, as people never feel hungry when they are ready for a fight or flight response<br>7)Try new food all the time, because food that are familiar to us would increase our eating, except wheat germ.. hehe~<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> After eating something, always take a glass of dirty water, that would make you feel sick.<br>9)Remember that you just had a meal, because an experiment on some patients who have problem with their memory would take 2nd or 3rd helping within 10-30 mins after a meal.<br>10) eat less sugar, and oily food, because these things promote the pleasantness of food too...<br><br>hahha~ that's for extreme dieting, and it's really crazy to be doing all that lahz.. hehe~<br><br>Just a couple of things you need to do...<br>1) for 2-3 nights a week, stop having any snacks after dinner at 7pm till you sleep.<br>2) weigh yourself everyday at an appointed time, (eg. when you wake up). Tell yourself that you will lower your weight by half kg every week, and allowing +/- 0.5 of a kg of allowance. For instance, you're 75kg this week, the maximum you can allow yourself is 75.5, and you lower the limit by 0.5 each week, till you're happy with your weight. If you're too high you will need to reduce some fatty food intake and do some exercises. This will lower the homeostatic level slowly, so that it would have time to adapt to the new weight level.</div>
