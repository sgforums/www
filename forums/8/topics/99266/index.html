            <div class='col-md body'>Throwers given 48-hr deadline<br>Change of heart as SAAA offers the Chinese pair a one-year contract again<br>By Peh Shing Huei<br><br>THE two China-born throwers dumped by the Singapore Amateur Athletic Association last month have been given 48 hours to accept a one-year contract.<br><br>The offer was faxed to the lawyer of Luan Wei, 22, and E Xiaoxu, 20, at 4.55pm yesterday. They must revert by 5pm tomorrow.<br><br>The SAAA said it is doing so 'purely out of magnanimity and goodwill', though president Tang Weng Fei said he believes the pair have potential 'provided they work very hard'.<br><br>The throwers were dropped from the association's foreign talent scheme after failing to meet targets set by the SAAA in March.<br><br>Luan had to reach 17.50 metres in the shot put, and E 52m in the hammer throw within six months. Luan's best effort is the 17.17m set last year, while E's is 48.64m, achieved in July.<br><br>They refused to go and, after their parents flew here for talks, the SAAA relented by giving them a one-year extension to meet the same targets.<br><br>The pair did not take up the offer when the deadline lapsed last Friday, arguing that there were no written contracts.<br><br>The SAAA had said that the offers 'will not be revived' but, evidently, there has been a change of heart.<br><br>The terms are the same as those offered a fortnight ago, with conditions such as meeting the targets in a year, training under the SAAA's coaches and no increase in allowances.<br><br>'I wish they can accept it,' said Tang in a press conference at the SAAA office yesterday.<br><br>The oil trader added that he had offered E a job at his Nanjing office for 2,000 yuan (S$400), but she did not take it up.<br><br>He also rebutted the throwers' accusations that they have not been treated well, and that the SAAA reneged on the promises made when they arrived in 1999.<br><br><span style="color: red;">'We pay the rent for their HDB apartments</span>,' he said, 'and <span style="color: red;">we hired a chef to cook for them because they said they are from northern China, and have different palates from us</span>.<br><br><span style="color: red;">'After the chef left, we arranged for them to have free dinners at a seafood restaurant every day. We even paid for their taxi fares to the restaurant.</span><br>'But, after a while, they got tired of the food too.'<br><br>Restaurant owner Teh Chor Joo verified Tang's claims at the press conference. <span style="color: red;">The association pays Luan $800 a month and E $600</span>.<br><br>Said SAAA senior adviser Loh Lin Kok: 'They don't have to pay a cent for anything else. Maybe they just need the money to buy some sweets.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Claim and counter-claim<br><br>THE THROWERS<br>1 <span style="color: red;">Singapore citizenship after a year.</span><br>2 Represent Singapore in athletics meets.<br>3 Amateur terms until athletes do well.<br>4 To be employed by SAAA as coaches or other jobs after retirement.<br>5 Study and train, and <span style="color: red;">enrol in university</span>.<br>6 Good performances at SEA Games sufficient.<br>7 <span style="color: red;">Free airfare for parents to visit once a year.</span><br>8 Better housing and food than in China.<br><br>THE SAAA<br>1 How can we promise something we can't deliver?<br>2 Delivered.<br>3 But athletes not doing well.<br>4 We want to train them in strength and conditioning so they can coach next time.<br>5 No one can guarantee university enrolment.<br>6 Foreign talent scheme only for above SEA Games level.<br>7 No such promise.<br>8 HDB flats with air-con, cable TV and computers. Specialised cook and free meals at seafood restaurant.</div>
