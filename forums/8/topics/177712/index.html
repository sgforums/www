            <div class='col-md body'>heya,<br><br>I'm new here... I have a question about the employment act. Does the clauses apply to both full time and part time workers?<br><br>For example, "All salary, other than payment for overtime work, must be paid within 7 days after the end of the salary period.  Salary for overtime must be paid within 14 days after the end of the salary period."<br><br>and, " An employee shall not be required to work more than 6 consecutive hours without a break. However, if the nature of work is such that it must be carried on continuously, an employee may be required to work 8 hours continuously but he must be given a break or breaks so that he can have his meal. The duration of the break(s) shall not be less than 45 minutes."<br><br>I work part time for Cafe Cartel whilst schooling and I feel that the workers there are being explioted in the sense that we are required to work for 8 hours at times without breaks, they take at least 2 to 3 weeks to give us our salaries, when we work overtime, they don't pay us, etc. I've tried speaking to the management about it but they just said this is how the system works, regardless of what is said in the MOM Employment Act.<br><br>So I was wondering if the Act actually apply to part-timers as well and I could perhaps seek help from the Ministry regarding these issues?<br><br>Does anyone know?</div>

I worked in Cartel because it is hard to find a flexible job and I really needed the money for school.<br><br>For the time being, I just feel that even if I'm gonna quit, I still shouldn't really let the matter rest because I'm not the only one bullied by them. The whole company of temp workers suffer the same fates and no one dares to voice out if they want to keep their jobs. For some of them, this is their first job and they don't even know their rights as workers - they think whatever the company does to them is inevitable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are some clauses in Employment Act that can be overridden by contract that you may have signed with your employer.<br><br>you would have to check.<br><br>but if you are working on wages (ie part time), the usual case is pay must be every 2 weeks, and if you work more than X hours in any 7 days then it is 1.5x pay after XX hours, it is 2x. pay.  X &amp; XX (i dunno what is the current standard)<br><br>Some employers go around this rule by scheduling you offs so you can't complain much.<br><br>Those clauses regarding frequency of pay and the amount of pay, whether it's legal to over ride them by contract. i am not too sure.<br><br>But as far as i experience locally, especially in the F&amp; B industry, they treat part timers are dispensible and asssume that you won't take any action beyond simple complains.</div>

If I'm not wrong, if you work for 8 hrs, you shd be entitled to 45mins - 1hr meal break. Good to check with MOM. You can also inform the company HR or your supervisor's superiors.</div>
