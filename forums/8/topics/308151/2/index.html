              <p>Hey, are you talking about ankle socks or socks that go below the ankle? There's a difference, you know.</p>
              <p>My school didn't allow the latter, but they allowed ankle socks and didn't give a damn if you wore them in rainbow colors. I don't think ankle socks look weird - it's just a matter of getting used to. Besides, it's cooler to wear ankle socks in our warm climate.</p>
              <p>What's the purpose of wearing socks? Cover half of your calf or keep your feet comfortable from excessive friction with the shoe, as well as prevent eeky things from growing in your shoe? Duh.</p>

              <p>I've got no idea what defines ankle socks for some people. Some wear their ankle socks real low, below their ankles. Some wear it just like what's it's for - around ankle area.</p>
              <p>Feeling that it looks odd is just me.</p>

              <p>Public opinion does not matter truly!</p>
              <p>What matters is the school's opinion! If you are in that particular school which says, "No ankle socks is allowed," then dont wear them loh. As the chinese saying goes what," every family has its own rules,every country has its own regulations" (pls translate it yourself) Too bad you are in the school that does not allow ankle socks even if you want to - you have to stick to the school's rules. If you want to wear ankle socks that badly, after school, go home, change out of your school uniform and wear the ankle socks until they stink also never mind.</p>

              <p>When i first heard of the rule that schools banned students from wearing ankle socks, i'm actually kinda surprise. I'm like 'HUH why?!?' :/</p>
              <p>Its just a pair of socks. Plain, white ankle socks. I have no idea why some schools want to make the extra effort to set a rule on it.</p>
              <p>I even remember teachers asking guys to pull up their long pants to do spot check on their socks. I mean, is that necessary? :/ If they already covered the socks with their long pants, why bother? I don't think students who wears ankle sock is trying to do anything rebellious, or making them look bad.</p>
              <p>This is one of the un-necessary rules in school imo.</p>

              <p>Well, I think ankle socks are a silly fashion fad which has nothing to do with functionality, health or comfort. I will never wear ankle socks myself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, I don't see any reason for banning ankle socks. Although I don't like them, I do not feel that they are unsightly or reflect anything bad about the students who wear them or their school. As long as the students are wearing socks it is ok to me.</p>

              <p>anyway the current type of sch sock with words or logos or XXSS on it are those above the ankles, where the words and so can be seen, thats only for short pants and girls. those are the "highest" kind of to be worn these days, excluding soccer types. the lowest will be no socks.</p>
              <p>unless u are working most guys will have their socks pulled to the max, but not for me they will "mess" my leg hair <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png">. </p>
