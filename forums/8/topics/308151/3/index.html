              <p>The issue nowadays is why wearing ankle socks is unsightly. I think what is unsightly to these people are the revealing of their ankles. What do you guys think?</p>

              <p><br>what so bad about revealing ankles?</p>
              <p>then if u wear slippers isnt is worst?</p>
              <p>is the fashion fault or the school's fault?</p>
              <p>cuz for those girls and/or guys wearing shoes for casual use with berms or whatever that does not go below their knees, and yet show off their ankles, it is the norm!? right?</p>
              <p>then again maybe the school just wants to make sure students wear socks to school, and the best way is to have socks above the ankles, so that teachers do not have poke their eyes into the shoes to see if theres any socks, regardless of ankle socks or not.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Deino is somehow right there. But there is a common saying among most youngsters nowadays. Rules are made to be broken, and thus the rebelliousness from people these days. But now, due to this new trend set by a few people, others have followed these "leaders". Anyway, I personally feel that ankle socks aren't such a bad thing. Some schools just can't accept the fact that students are wearing ankle socks as they don't want to change their school rules.</p></div>

              <p>My classmates used to wear those white ankle supports and slippers to school. Those caught wearing ankle socks to school had to be barefoot for the rest of the day and collectÂ  their shoes after school. Mind you I came from an all boys school if it makes any difference.</p>
              <p>I think those ple who wear ankle socks have trouble following instructions luh.</p>
