If not for PAP, will Singapore be who she is today? GST raise was because we are face an ageing population.. Since lesser adults can contribute to the country's income, some where must increase to make way for other places or development.<br>The government also subsidies for payment of your SCC and Flats, if i am right.. Correct me if i am not..<br><br>Why are you all always referring [b]PAP</strong> as <strong>Pay And Pay</strong>? It is alright to <strong>Pay And Provide</strong>, afterall, they have been <strong>Providing And Providing</strong>. I agree that Singaporeans are nothing but whiners.. GET ON! Look at PAP, they are practising their policies well, at least they are transparent, unlike the Wayang Party.. They are covering up all their filthy actions.. Besides, would you want your leader to be someone full of 'la's 'lor's and cannot speak ENGLISH in a proper tone?<br><br>Look at how the westerns will LAUGH their teeth out! Be practical, you owe all this to PAP if not for their forward looking principle and their pragmatic actions.. Singapore is amongst one of the richest country, and be glad!<br><br>*Just a note, PM Lee did announce that an amount of subsidies would be given to help those in lower income groups in their studies.. You can whine if they did nothing to intervene in the people's education.. But they did try to help.. Partially also blame it on the AH BENGS and AH LIANS who tried to bring these students astrays...[/b]</blockquote>i admit PAP was good long long time ago...they did develop Singapore...now only the PAP team members r very rich  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ... especially family members...do they really work for the ppl or helping themselves</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>come, read newspaper time.<br><br><strong>PM gets his strong mandate</strong><br><span class="small">S'poreans give him clear vote of confidence with 66.6% margin; opposition retains Hougang, Potong Pasir<br><br>By Zuraidah Ibrahim<br>POLITICAL EDITOR<br><br>SINGAPOREANS yesterday gave Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong a clear vote of confidence for his new team and programme, denying the opposition more seats despite the strongest challenge it had mounted in 18 years.<br><br>The People's Action Party's share of the popular vote fell 8.7 points from its exceptionally high 2001 level, to 66.6 per cent.<br><br>While the smaller margin was in line with expectations, the showing was creditably better than its 1997 victory of 65 per cent.<br><br>At a 2am press conference, Mr Lee thanked voters for a 'very strong mandate'.<br><br>'The support has come from all communities across all races. And we will do our best to serve you, work with you, so that we can achieve our vision for Singapore,' said a calm and composed-looking Mr Lee, 54, who led his first election as secretary-general.<br><br>The PAP was denied a clean sweep but the opposition's appeal for a breakthrough win in a Group Representation Constituency or GRC was also denied.<br><br>The verdict of 1.15 million Singaporeans: Two is enough.<br><br>Opposition veterans Chiam See Tong and Low Thia Khiang held onto their respective wards of Potong Pasir and Hougang, which rebuffed the PAP's inducement of multi-million-dollar upgrading packages and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong's personal appeals.<br><br>Mr Low, 49, not only succeeded in defending his seat for a fourth term but also improved his margin by seven points, garnering 62.7 per cent of the votes.<br><br>It is his best showing since he was first elected in 1991, further entrenching him in his ward and firmly securing his leadership of the Workers' Party well into the future.<br><br>In Potong Pasir, where people poured onto the streets to chant his name last night, 71-year-old Mr Chiam proved age was no barrier to getting elected for the sixth time. Despite a neck-and-neck race, the warhorse sped ahead at the finish and was garlanded with 55.8 per cent of the votes.<br><br>A gracious PM Lee said the verdict showed the two men were 'credible people' with 'standing on the ground'.<br><br>In the closely watched contest for Aljunied GRC, WP chairman Sylvia Lim and her 'Team A' secured 43.9 per cent of the votes from the incumbents led by Foreign Minister George Yeo. It is likely that as the top opposition performers, the WP team will be invited to select one among them to serve as a Non-Constituency MP.<br><br>The 82-2 scoreline, preserving the status quo in Parliament, may go down as an apt end to a nine-day campaign that never quite caught fire and which many described as relatively issueless.<br><br>PM Lee called for the elections only after he was convinced that Singaporeans had had time to get to know him and to digest his many new programmes, especially those designed to alleviate the pains of economic restructuring, such as the Workfare scheme.<br><br>The most controversial issues of the past two years, the National Kidney Foundation scandal and the great casino debate, had also received a thorough airing before polls were called.<br><br>Mr Lee's 20-month buffer between becoming Prime Minister and asking for a mandate contrasts with the mere nine-month gap that Mr Goh gave himself after getting the top job in 1990.<br><br>The PAP lost four seats and claimed just 61 per cent of the popular vote in the 1991 polls.<br><br>PM Lee's maiden GE performance even surpasses that of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who, when he went into election for the first time as Prime Minister, won 37 out of 51 seats.<br><br>As expected, the PAP did not score anywhere near its 75 per cent share in 2001, widely seen as a one-off outcome, due to anxiety about terrorism and recession.<br><br>This year's showing of 66.6 per cent appears to be a new equilibrium in the relationship that Singaporeans seem to have reached with the ruling party.<br><br>Since the party's complete monopoly was broken in 1984, when there was a 12.9 percentage point swing against it, the PAP had managed scores of only in the early 60s until it was bested by Mr Goh in 1997 at 65 per cent.<br><br>Given that those born after 1965 make up 40 per cent of voters, it shows the PAP continues to be the party of choice across all generations, assuaging fears that younger voters might choose to distance themselves from it.<br><br>What is clear too is that voters want a more credible opposition. Hence, the Workers' Party, with a more presentable slate, emerged as the top dog in the camp, collecting an average of 38.4 per cent of the votes where it contested. Mr Low promised of more to come, declaring: 'The renewal process of the Workers' Party is on track.'<br><br>What the WP, as well as the PAP, may have to reckon with though, are the changing expectations of younger voters.<br><br>PM Lee gave the best tip yet for both sides, when he said this morning: 'The key is to keep in touch with the changing demographics.'</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Workers' party makes a comeback</strong><br><span class="small">Party rewarded for its 'organised' image, rather than its personalities, say observers<br><br>By Bertha Henson<br><br>THE Workers' Party (WP) last night made a strong comeback in the Singapore political scene, polling consistently higher than its opposition rivals.<br><br>Party chief Low Thia Khiang retained his Hougang seat with his best showing in the polls since he entered Parliament in 1991, and declared that his party was now 'entering a new phase'.<br><br>Contrary to expectations that the Group Representation Constituency system would hobble the opposition, its A team in Aljunied GRC polled 43.9 per cent.<br><br>This is the highest proportion of votes among the seven contested GRCs the three opposition parties had hoped to wrest from the People's Action Party.<br><br>With just opposition incumbents Mr Low and Mr Chiam See Tong holding on to their wards, this means that the Government has to offer the WP a Non-Constituency MP seat to any of the five on its Aljunied GRC slate.<br><br>Voting patterns in GRCs also placed the WP teams in East Coast and Ang Mo Kio head and shoulders above the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) and the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP).<br><br>Even its youngest slate received 33.9 per cent of the votes - despite contesting the Prime Minister's ward in Ang Mo Kio.<br><br>Political observers believe it was the party's image that counted with Singapore voters, rather than individual personalities.<br><br>Save Ms Lim and her teammate Mr James Gomez, none of the other WP candidates stood out.<br><br>But it would appear that the Singapore voter also rewarded the WP for its better-quality slate of candidates, an improvement over the past and superior to those of the SDA and SDP.<br><br>Mr Low had cast GE 2006 as a referendum on the future of the opposition and asked voters to signal that they wanted opposition politics to stay.<br><br>On the eve of Polling Day, he added that voter support was vital to get more better-qualified people to renew his party's ranks.<br><br>He said last night: 'I'd like to tell Singaporeans tonight that the renewal process of WP is on track.'<br><br>The WP share of votes stands at 38.4 per cent, at least six percentage points higher than the SDA's.<br><br>Political observer Zulkifli Baharudin, a former Nominated MP, said the results showed an across-the-board support for the WP, rewarding it for being 'more organised and cohesive'.<br><br>The WP went into GE2001 with just Mr Low for Hougang and Dr Poh Lee Guan contesting Nee Soon East, after its Aljunied slate was disqualified on Nomination Day. This time round, with a slate of 20, it had to contend with questions raised over Mr Gomez' missing minority candidate form as well as the PAP's pledge to reward voters with early lift-upgrading and massive estate renewal plans.<br><br>Mr Low had described the attacks on Mr Gomez as making a mountain out of a molehill and called the lift upgrading promise to PAP wards 'divisive'.<br><br>The WP made accountability its main beef, declaring that it would ask tough questions of PAP ministers to ensure that they justified their high salaries.<br><br>The SDA, an umbrella grouping of four opposition parties, fought in the three GRCs of Jalan Besar, Tampines and Pasir Ris-Punggol, scoring about 30 per cent.<br><br>Mr Vincent Yeo, part of the Jalan Besar GRC team, said he was expecting 36 to 38 per cent.<br><br>'So I'm a little disappointed. But 30 per cent is a good start. We will not neglect this 30 per cent. We will reorganise ourselves and come back again.'<br><br>Among the four single seats the alliance was vying for, Singapore People's Party chief Mr Chiam, 71, further entrenched his position in Potong Pasir, despite a much younger PAP rival and the PAP's $80 million upgrading plan.<br><br>Said his daughter, Camilla, 30: 'We worked hard and managed to beat abalone porridge and that $80-million carrot,' she said, referring to the $2 abalone porridge which PAP's Mr Sitoh Yi Pin, 42, had organised for residents.<br><br>National Solidarity Party chief Steve Chia failed to win the Chua Chu Kang seat for a second time, and declared that he was getting out of politics for the time being.<br><br>The former Non-Constituency MP had a score of 39.6 per cent, lower than the WP's Aljunied GRC team.<br><br>Although the SDP fared the worst with a score of 23.2 per cent of the vote, it described the PAP's victory in Sembawang GRC and Bukit Panjang as 'hollow'.<br><br>Its Sembawang GRC team leader, Ms Chee Siok Chin, said the party performed 'creditably' given the 'extreme circumstances under which we had to labour'.<br><br>Asked what the SDP would do in light of the defamation suits it is facing from PM Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, she replied: 'I have said we will begin our work immediately, not just on the lawsuit, but certainly, there are needs to be reformed in Singapore. That's what the SDP is looking at.</span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Young, first-time voters stayed with us, says PM</strong><br><br><span class="small">Warren Fernandez YOUNG, first-time voters stayed with the People's Action Party (PAP) in the elections, contributing to its 66.6 per cent share of the vote, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his traditional post-election press conference at 2am this morning.<br><br>He said he was pleased that Singaporeans had strongly supported his team and their plans. 'We have a lot to do and we are starting now,' said the 54 year-old Mr Lee, who was flanked by Cabinet members at the Treasury building auditorium.<br><br>Pointing to the 66.1 per cent that his team won in his Ang Mo Kio GRC, which was contested for the first time since 1991, he said he was 'happy with my result', noting that the support for his team was uniformly spread between older and newer parts of the GRC.<br><br>'Anchorvale and Fernvale, many young voters recently moved into a new estate, first-time voters for many of them. And they gave my team even stronger support than some of the older areas in the GRC,' he said, noting that a similar pattern was seen in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, helmed by Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean.<br><br>'It shows that our programmes and our team have struck a chord with younger voters. They know what is at stake and have voted very sensibly,' he said, sounding upbeat.<br><br>Younger voters born after independence made up 40 per cent of the electorate in this polls, and all parties had sought to win them over, not least the Workers' Party (WP), which fielded a young team against the PM in his own ward.<br><br>Last night, Mr Lee graciously thanked the WP for doing so, as it had given voters there a chance to vote. More so than individual candidates, voters had backed parties which had a better image and profile, with the WP faring the best, Mr Lee noted.<br><br>Voters appreciated that the WP had fielded better candidates than in 2001 and better than the other opposition parties this time round, he said, noting that the votes showed that Singaporeans wanted 'higher quality and credible opposition candidates'.<br><br>While he was disappointed that the PAP had failed to win back Potong Pasir and Hougang, he respected the voters' decision, which showed that incumbent MPs Low Thia Khiang and Chiam See Tong were 'credible people, with standing on the ground'.<br><br>With the electoral contest over, he called on Singaporeans to 'come together again as one people'. He pledged to continue to encourage open and serious debate on national issues, tapping and engaging the talents of Singaporeans to take the country forward.<br><br>'Whichever party you voted for, let's close ranks, and in the words of the manifesto, stay together and move ahead,' he said.</span></div>
