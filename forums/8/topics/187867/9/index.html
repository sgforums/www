Ok lets look at this, HDBs are like avg 4 rooms at maybe $200k. WOW 200 K!!!! Giving prevailing interest rates it will close to $500 if u pay over 30 yrs. $1.5k a month gross gives u like $14,400.00 take home per annum. which means $144K in 10 years.

            <div class='col-md body'>About progress package not many of you guys know<br><br>1. PM Lee said, this money is FOR US, did u know that portions of it goes to CPF and Medisave for some group of people? Did u know that many Singaporeans CANNOT get ALL the CPF monies because u need to have a certain amount in it. Did you know that many Singaporeans kick the bucket with a VERY healthy CPF balance, and these in turn goes to their dependents under the DPS, which in tuen could not use all of it and thus the vicious cycle grows.<br><br>2. Did u know that many Singaporeans who are paying their Income tax via installments have a 1 time deductment FULL amount outstanding from their progress package. Which means if u owe IRAS $600, and progress package is $600, u get NOTHING!!! And this is happening in many cases. Just go google how many defaulters are there in the workign singapore population and you will know the % of people who did not get their FULL progress packge. Won't this means the Govt is just getting back what they were suppose  to "give"?<br><br>3. With regards to pt 1 &amp; 2, the progress package is FOR every singaporean who had worked before. This money is MEANT for us, not MEANT to pay the govt back what we owe them. $600 is ALOT to many people who have diff making ends meets due to unforseen circumstances, e.g. Stock collapse, business fail, jailed, medical illness, etc. And that does not mean if they owe $ to the govt that the Govt should deduct it from the progress package. This is really distasteful. Why can they pay up in installments? it hurts less anyway.<br><br>more to come<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Newman LOL good one<br><br>Well Pay And Pay ... anywayz I was referring to those 40% that do not take up tertiary education ... d00d even if they get $5k a month within the decade of working (which is very hard IMHO) they still wont be able to have a comfortable life, as both have to work = no children. Esp if u are from bigger family, ur parents no time to take care of the children. Look around man. They once stated that the AVERAGE flat/condo owning working singaporean owes nearly 100k odd in debts.<br><br>Oh yah no forgetting $5-6 K a month is gross not bring home .. as .. monthly bills / household stuff etc etc. end up with less than a few hundred in savings a month. Add a child or 2 = even less savings ... not to forget the die die 5% GST u must pay for almost every item. = Annual Gross - 20% CPF - 5% GST. And minus monthly expenditure ... get my dirft <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br><br>So d00d 10yrs husband and wife w/o more than tiertiary education pay up for a 200k plus HDB? no way. Thats like almost 1.5k plus in monthly payment (interest, and such, EVEN if use CPF deductions). Not forgetting Combine $5k is a very very ideal figure. A more educated guess and from my friends parents, more like $3k avg.<br><br>Smart people will get insured. Else 100% thats it for them if anything crops up<br><br>I once remembered someone saying a private property for every S'porean ... who ar??cannot rem ... but all I know is someone in the govt ... but then again I may be mistaken<br><br>So who wanna buy insurance <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> jking<br><br>Anywayz the point is ... Can the Govt make housing more affordable .. hey look I know cause i am earning ard 4k take home and stays in a HDB 4 room that cost me $230k resale. My wife does not work so as to take care of my 2 kids.<br><br>Even with my degree education I can only hope to earn that little. whats the more to say those with lesser education? I mean what chance have they got. Sure there are people who make it, then again how many do and dont?<br><br></div>

Tho minority gets it<br>9) Increase CPF withdrawal age limit and also minimum sum.<br>10) Giving out $$$$ which BELONGS TO US IN THE 1ST PLACE before every ELECTION<br><br>Some education policies leave me wondering if the MOE can interveane:<br><br>1) University entry for local students made easier, does not require Mandarin to enter. Making many students ditch mother tongue in schools.<br>2) Locals refused PhD entry to local Uni, BUT got entry to IVY LEAGUE Schools<br><br>Issues :<br><br>1) Why is it Minister MAH BOW TAN agrees to FUNDING the nominees from PAP if they win? Why not give this funds to the proposed developement project the opposition MPs have lobbied for?<br><br>2) Why is that the NKF issue is SO unfair. How come TT Durai is the one taking the fall? Is he a blacksheep? why is the Board of Directors or Exco not indicted ? And what is these claims that TT is the one who forced them all to give full control over to him. I mean, HEY!! HELLO!!! did u know that SM Goh's wife is the patron there, wont she be involved in the advisory panel as well? So are they trying to say that the Board or Exco are weak minded and low IQ / Lowly educated that the ENTIRE personnels involved gave full control to TT? HELLO!! Check out these people's credentials they are VERY WELL educated. Why now and not last year when the case was still hot? or the years before when this was first brought up?<br><br>3) SM Goh said its time for change (referring to Chiam), won't it be a slap in the face as well, cause PAP has been like donkey ages in the Governing Business. So yeah i guess if we all take it as he said, its time to change the PAPs iron hold ove parliament too<br><br>4) In 2004 the MOE wrote a later stating that 60% of the Sec Sch cohort went on to Poly and Uni, which means 40% did not. I mean WOW!!!!!! thats alot .... Ask you this, how much does an avg diploma student earn? $2k?? Yeah ard there and if u are 'O' or less u earn ard $1.5k avg right? Ok lets look at this, HDBs are like avg 4 rooms at maybe $200k. WOW 200 K!!!! Giving prevailing interest rates it will close to $500 if u pay over 30 yrs. $1.5k a month gross gives u like $14,400.00 take home per annum. which means $144K in 10 years. LOL even if ur salary increases to $3k a month over the years, based on inflation calculations and monthly expenditures, you CAN NEVER OWN UR OWN FLAT!!!!YOU WILL ALWAYS BE IN DEBT. 40% or lesser (but not much) will have to face this dilema in the years to come.<br><br>5) Increase in GST in the books again? Rumors abound that GST hikes are near. Same sordid story in 2001, after giving us incentives to vote for PAP, will they rise the GST? who knows? you answer this.<br><br>Many more to write but gotta go for meeting</div></blockquote>I also want to raise some fact<br>....<br><br>Two years ago, somebody (not to mention name lah)... some Dr XXX, fat guy, accused Singaporeans for the low birth rate.  He said that Singaporeans are selfish, that's why we don't want to have children.  He also said that Singaporeans are actually very rich, so can have children.  He based that one the fact that every family has a TV at home.  Have TV = rich = can raise children without financial difficulty.  Wahhhhh... what a good mathematics he has siah.<br><br>In some areas ... it is proven that foreign talents are given better treatment and exclusive privileges than locally born citizens.  Don't believe?  See <a href="http://www.irc.org.sg" rel="nofollow">www.irc.org.sg</a>  -- A club set up to take very very good care of the foreigners.  Not bad huh?</div>

Esp if u are from bigger family, ur parents no time to take care of the children. Look around man. They once stated that the AVERAGE flat/condo owning working singaporean owes nearly 100k odd in debts.<br><br>Oh yah no forgetting $5-6 K a month is gross not bring home .. as .. monthly bills / household stuff etc etc. end up with less than a few hundred in savings a month. Add a child or 2 = even less savings ... not to forget the die die 5% GST u must pay for almost every item. = Annual Gross - 20% CPF - 5% GST. And minus monthly expenditure ... get my dirft <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br><br>So d00d 10yrs husband and wife w/o more than tiertiary education pay up for a 200k plus HDB? no way.

A more educated guess and from my friends parents, more like $3k avg.<br><br>Smart people will get insured.

Can the Govt make housing more affordable .. hey look I know cause i am earning ard 4k take home and stays in a HDB 4 room that cost me $230k resale. My wife does not work so as to take care of my 2 kids.<br><br>Even with my degree education I can only hope to earn that little. whats the more to say those with lesser education? I mean what chance have they got. Sure there are people who make it, then again how many do and dont?<br><br></div></blockquote>okay the main aim of Tiertary education provided by the government is to educate and cultivate people up to the standards to perform the roles required of them in the relevent industries...depends on how you want to put it. if you are like the older geenration (or some ppl with such views) then a worker wearing a tie and suit and sitting in any offices is of a higher status and earning more than another blue collared worker is very incorrect. Of course with better education the chances of you securing a position/ job of your liking with the equal rewards is there. however there are also those who are non-uni grads as yourself are earning more and holding a higher position than u!<br><br>a couple will be able to afford MBT's HDB flats if they see far and ahead but is staying with factts and reality. do u buy a flat tthat you know you cannot afford to service or own? do you do your planning and financial calculations before you buy. Based on a 200k (an expensive 4-rm or a cheap 5-room) flat and an example you wanna say that "no, a couple with 5k gross income per month each cannot afford to own one as such?" If so get a cheaper and affordable 4-room flat of a real affordable 5-rm flat on the lower floors. I believe a decent affordable 4-room flat should be okay (about 160k - 180k). 1 room for the couple and 1 room each for son/s or daughter/s. Minus the downpayment direct deductions from the existing funds in your CPF ordinary, the couple cann take loans up to 30 years from HDB (if first time buyers) and service the instalments at a lower monthly rate. moreover, the special account can also be ustilized for flat instalment deductions if your ordinary accounts are depleted prior to age 55 yrs. The Ordinary account will also allow you to pay for the instalments up to the similar age. So its a ful-proff win-win situation that your special account can be a backup to flat instalments during the service period.<br><br>for grads i am sure u can do the maths so dun come here and whine about how life is tough for u guys. you are elites..so better start behaving like one.<br><br></div>

Correct me if i am not..<br><br>Why are you all always referring <strong>PAP</strong> as <strong>Pay And Pay</strong>? It is alright to <strong>Pay And Provide</strong>, afterall, they have been <strong>Providing And Providing</strong>. I agree that Singaporeans are nothing but whiners.. GET ON! Look at PAP, they are practising their policies well, at least they are transparent, unlike the Wayang Party.. They are covering up all their filthy actions.. Besides, would you want your leader to be someone full of 'la's 'lor's and cannot speak ENGLISH in a proper tone?<br><br>Look at how the westerns will LAUGH their teeth out! Be practical, you owe all this to PAP if not for their forward looking principle and their pragmatic actions.. Singapore is amongst one of the richest country, and be glad!<br><br>*Just a note, PM Lee did announce that an amount of subsidies would be given to help those in lower income groups in their studies.. You can whine if they did nothing to intervene in the people's education.. But they did try to help.. Partially also blame it on the AH BENGS and AH LIANS who tried to bring these students astrays...</div>
