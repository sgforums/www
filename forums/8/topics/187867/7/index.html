It is not as if election in Aljunied will stop. It'll continue."<br><br>He said the PAP is still questioning the Workers' Party on the Gomez issue because "many Singaporeans are still not fully aware of what has happened."<br><br>Mr Yeo said: "They read the newspaper quickly, they flip the pages, they watch television fleetingly, so they have not fully grasped the importance of what has happened. So it is really our duty to point it out to them.<br><br>"It's not something small, something trivial. It is not about James Gomez, it is not about particular personalities. It is about the integrity of a system which is at the heart of a democracy. Without that integrity, general elections are a waste of time."<br><br>Mr Yeo added that if this system is seen to favour one candidate over another, then the public will lose trust in the Elections Department.<br><br>In many countries, there are allegations made against the Elections Department which undermines democracy.<br><br>Mr Yeo said: "This is not a matter of personal attack, it is a matter of principle. Some of my grassroots say I should not talk about this because it will lose me votes, so be it. It is important enough.<br><br>"We are not splitting hairs, we are talking about a very major fundamental issue. I don't think they (Workers' Party) should be evasive or be afraid. So what if you lose one candidate in the slate? Move on."<br><br>PAP Chairman Lim Boon Heng said: "It is better if the WP...clears any doubt of transparency in the management of the WP. After all, this is a question they say of our government, that the government should be transparent.
