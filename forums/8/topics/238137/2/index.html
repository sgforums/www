I typed the sms during my spare time, e.g. tv commercials or waiting for bus. Also, i didnt send out all at one go at 12 midnight. I sent out whenever i typed finish over these 2 days.<br><br>By the way, this is also a good way to see if the girl you are interested in is interested in you or not (guy if you are a girl). If she bothers to thank you for specific helps or wishes you very specific wishes, then you got a good chance.</div>
