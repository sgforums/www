Fall sick no clinic must go hospital and the hospitals truly sucks! Doctors and nurses are dressed in dirty white uniform(looks more like psycho killer who dressed up as doctors), and you'll really doubt their abilities. There's no such thing as take number and Q up. The doctor will ask u what's wrong with u but come up with no conclusion. After which, they will ask u "U wanna take blood test?" then send u to take blood test and get a drip. After drip, u take ur blood test report which stated alot of digits and stuff u wun understand and doctor won't be there to explain(trying to trick ppl take blood test so as to earn extras).<br><br>The place is totally dirty!! They treat patients not in A&amp;E room(perhaps full), they treat them in the lobby. It's so horrible!!! And they're still using mercury thermometer!!!! My another friend who went to the hospital said that she witnessed them pushing an old lady out to the carpark after OP! OMG.. they actually exposed the poor lady under germs. Worst still, after taking 2 bottles of drips, I wasn't cured!! I had to take medicines my friend brought over from Singapore to get better after sick for almost a week!!<br><br>As for fake products, there was another once I developed a sore throat so I was thinking of going to their pharmacy to get Pi Pa Gao. I saw the Pi Pa Gao on shelf so i got the lady at the counter to take it for me. After which when I went home, I realised that the Pi Pa Gao I bought wasn't the Jin Du Nian Ci An Chuan Bei Pi Pa Gao that we see in Singapore, but some weird medicine named Xiang Gang(HK) Yu Nian Tang Mi Lian Gao!!! WAH LAU!!! Packaging totally same, if one nv see clearly(like me), you'd have bought the wrong product. Seriously I don't dare to take that Mi Lian Gao cuz I was thinking if the product is good, it doesnt have to copy Pi Pa Gao's packaging and mislead consumers.
