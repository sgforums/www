            <div class='col-md body'>Happiness? Hmm... Strange but I was discussing something like that last night with Maya.... Anyway, to me making another person happy, because you know that what you did is the cause of it, makes me happy. Chim? Nah... Ok, simply, if another person is happy because of me, I feel happy. Egoistic? Maybe... but I believe that if another person is happy because of something I did, I felt appreciated, he/she dun have to tell me directly that they are happy because of what I have done, but if I can just even sense it, I feel happy.<br><br>Of course that's not the only thing that makes me happy, a thing did right, personal achivements also makes me feel elated, to be able to know what is another person feeling right now especailly to someone I care about also makes me happy, even if it's sadness that they are feeling, I feel happy to know that I can share it with them, to bear part of their burden or to share their happiness itself is to me a small part I could do, and that makes me feel happy to know that I have done my part.<br><br>Hmmm.... what else? Cheese cake!   :p Well, I think it's a sin to eat it, especailly to my figure(You can see how vain I am, *LOL*). Especially when it melts in your mouth, emmmm..... I can feel it now, the melting, the taste, the cream.... I am getting orgasmic here...*LOL*<br><br>Simple pleasures like listening to my favourite song, reading poetry I like, seeing the person I love, enjoying the company of my love ones, an enjoyable family outing...e.t.c., also adds to my joys of life.<br><br>Happiness is a simple thing, but it brings so much with it, what more it is free, it is a matter of perspective.<br><blockquote><br>We always say, "When I have this, I will be happy." When we get it, happiness lasts but for a short while.<br><br>Soon we say, "When I have that, I will be happy." The slavery of happiness begins when Desires dominate.<br><br>So cut the chains of desires, and let's enjoy what we have NOW.</blockquote>------------------<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Just my $0.02 + $0.03(from Lex) worth</span></strong><br><br>[This message has been edited by Callan (edited 21 February 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that pple R normally not satisfied under normal situation. They will onli remember happiness for a while but remember unhappiness for a longer period of time. Because when they achieved what they wanted, they R contented but under normal situations, it will onli short lived. They will 1 more &amp; getting more difficult 2 satisfy them. Its hard for pple 2 be happy always until they really know what does being contented really mean. When this is comprehended, I think its easier 2 be happy &amp; have less worries. Too amny thing R taken for granted, so I don't really know. Perhaps it may be a mistake that god created us with such great intelligence. I believe the animals R living happier &amp; more carefree than we do. What do all of U think? ^_^ Any suggestions? Comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm! I'm new here. Hopefully i can be able to flow in the same stream of thoughts here. If you ask me what is happiness and wat cause me to be happy, I would think that it will be a very complicated matter because you must understand that our emotion are make up of many feelings and it can be affected by many factors too. But let's cut things short. Perhap juz allow me to share when will i be happy and wat will cause me to be happen. Basically, i think seeing another person happy will cause me to be happy. I think the greatest joy in this world is to be able to contribute to other people life and make a impact in it. Therefore, happiness is more that an ice-cream or possessing something you like. All this are juz temporary. I hope that my deepest most feeling will not offend you in any way.<br><br>Aidious!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I feel that 2 be happy is how U choose 2 perceive things.

But 2 a person who worries too much, a small thing will drive him/she 2 a desperate situation.<br><br>But of course in this inperfect world, pple R not so perfect as well, there R weaknesses that will break us down.
