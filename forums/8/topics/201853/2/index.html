            <div class='col-md body'>im taking pure history and i think its a big mistake. wish i chose pure geography instead. history is so much memorising and i dont see the use of it when we leave school. at least you get to read maps and learn why disasters happen in geog. totally regretting it now but the funny thing is history is my best subject now even though i dont like it<br>for humanities the combination in my school insistst that everyone must take at least one lit whether chinese lit or eng lit , whether elective or pure<br>so if you take pure geo or pure hist, you end up with elective lit no such thing as pure geog and elec hist or pure hist and elect geog<br>if you take pure eng lit, you can take elect hist or elec geog<br>if you take chinese lit which is only available in pure, you can choose elect hist elect eng lit or elec geog<br>so basically theres no way to escape lit in my school; you either take chi lit or eng lit which in some ways sux<br><br></div>
