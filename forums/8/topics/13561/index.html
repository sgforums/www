            <div class='col-md body'>In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.<br><br>1. The sure calamity!<br><br>2. What is the sure calamity! And what would make you<br>realize what the sure calamity is!<br><br>4. Samood and Ad called the striking calamity a lie.<br><br>S. Then as to Samood, they were destroyed by an excessively<br>severe punishment.<br><br>6. And as to Ad, they were destroyed by a roaring, violent<br>blast.<br><br>7. Which He made to prevail against them for seven nights<br>and eight days unremittingly, so that you might have seen<br>the people therein prostrate as if they were the trunks of<br>hollow palms.<br><br>8. Do you then see of them one remaining?<br><br>9. And Firon and those before him and the overthrown cities<br>continuously committed sins.<br><br>10. And they disobeyed the Apostle of their Lord, so He<br>punished them with a vehement punishment.<br><br>11. Surely We bore you up in the ship when the water rose<br>high,<br><br>12. So that We may make it a reminder to you, and that the<br>retaining ear might retain it.<br><br>13. And when the trumpet is blown with a single blast,<br><br>14. And the earth and the mountains are borne away and<br>crushed with a single crushing.<br><br>15. On that day shall the great event come to pass,<br><br>16. And the heaven shall cleave asunder, so that on that day<br>it shall be frail,<br><br>17. And the angels shall be on the sides thereof; and above<br>) I them eight shall bear on that day your Lord's power.<br><br>18. On that day you shall be exposed to view-- no secret of<br>yours shall remain hidden.<br><br>19. Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand,<br>he will say: Lo! read my book:<br><br>20. Surely I knew that I shall meet my account.<br><br>21. So he shall be in a life of pleasure,<br><br>22. In a lofty garden,<br><br>23. The fruits of which are near at hand:<br><br>24. Eat and drink pleasantly for what you did beforehand in<br>the days gone by.<br><br>25. And as for him who is given his book in his left hand he<br>shall say: O would that my book had never been given me:<br><br>26. And I had not known what my account was:<br><br>27. O would that it had made an end (of me):<br><br>28. My wealth has availed me nothing:<br><br>29. My authority is gone away from me.<br><br>30. Lay hold on him, then put a chain on him,<br><br>31. Then cast him into the burning fire,<br><br>32. Then thrust him into a chain the length of which is<br>seventy cubits.<br><br>33. Surely he did not believe in Allah, the Great,<br><br>34. Nor did he urge the feeding of the poor.<br><br>35. Therefore he has not here today a true friend,<br><br>36. Nor any food except refuse,<br><br>37. Which none but the wrongdoers eat.<br><br>38. But nay! I swear by that which you see,<br><br>39. And that which you do not see.<br><br>40. Most surely, it is the Word brought by an honored<br>Apostle,<br><br>41. And it is not the word of a poet; little is it that you<br>believe;<br><br>42. Nor the word of a soothsayer; little is it that you<br>mind.<br><br>43. It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds.<br><br>44. And if he had fabricated against Us some of the sayings,<br><br>45. We would certainly have seized him by the right hand,<br><br>46. Then We would certainly have cut off his aorta.<br><br>47. And not one of you could have withheld Us from him.<br><br>48. And most surely it is a reminder for those who guard<br>(against evil).<br><br>49. And most surely We know that some of you are rejecters.<br><br>50. And most surely it is a great grief to the unbelievers.<br><br>51. And most surely it is the true certainty<br><br>52. Therefore-glorify the name of your Lord, the Great.<br><br>ï¿½<br>Chapter 69, Koran</div>
