If he lunges with the knife, sidestep the attack, grab and control the knife hand (dun get into a struggle over the knife with him, but just keep it away from you) use his momentum to keep it away from you and cause the stab to overshoot, move in and follow up with a strike to the face or the neck, following that, you can do a close range knee stomp or groin kick (use the foot, not the knee to groin somebody, more effective).<br><br>If got multiple people attacking, always keep on the move and not be grabbed, do not allow yourself to be sorrounded and look for means of escape. Defensive front, side and rear kicks are very useful. Focus on kicks as your primary weapon and only use hands when it gets too close. Make them keep their distance. Do not expect to win or teach them a lesson, but to fend them off. These are good defensive methods. Remember to work on the speed of your kick so your leg cannot be grabbed without the grabber taking extensive damage to the foot, it should be like a cobra lashing out. Strike with either the ball of the foot or the entire sole, if your want a powerful pushing effect for making them keep their distance and use the ball for more accucrate kicks like getting the weapon out of their hands.<br><br>Best self-defence tip however, is to stay out of trouble. Keep your head on, your ego in check and screws tightened and you will not have to resort to all these. Saves everyone a lotta trouble.</div></blockquote>thanks for the tips..i oni know the 7 weak point in a person. and when i hit anyone of them, i hit them hard. thats my way of playing.</div>
