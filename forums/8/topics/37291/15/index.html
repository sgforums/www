I have virtually no life so i get the kicks from thinking up stories telling everyone how heroic i am in an arcade over KOF2001. &lt;--- The best thing i can call you is amusing.<br><br>Psst look over that counter strike story i made up for your sake. If you use that story at least a half wit (of your own level) might believe it .... or maybe not. But hey at least its better than your original one</div></blockquote>and i agree wif u all the way.. i really cant imagine how this guy is in real life.. since he's been through NS, well, he shld not haf been thinking this way.. either would he haf done those things that he did.. oh please.. the NS teaches one to be self-disciplined, not teaches someone to keep a swiss knife to protect themself when the need arises.. and oh please.. u'll oni use the knife when u're outnumbered? u wun even haf the time to go through ur pockets, take out the "keychain", pull out the knife and get ready for anione who dares to attack u.. to be truthful, no one's siding wif u.. all my frenz who's been looking through this particular posts thinks u're after all a big fool who doesnt really noe how to think in the right way and that we're all treating you as a clown, as a form of entertainment to keep us laughing at ur a55.. u're certainly a very great clown for all of us.. we're posting to keep u posting so that we can take a look here whenever we are bored to help us laugh.. get it? u wun get f*cked up wun u? u said u wun.. keep ur cool.. MY FRIENDS AND ME WRITE IN TO KEEP YOU POSTING SO THAT WE CAN HAF A GREAT LAUGH AT YOU!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys I dun even need to take sides to see that it is obvious this Delusion fellow has multiple self-image, ego and esteem problems, so why waste your time on him... as the saying goes... empty vessel makes the most noise... he seems to be like malaysia... always big on threats and rethoric...<br><br>But when it comes to crunch time, you suddenly see his tune change... from "I'M GONNA CRUSH ALL THESE AH BENGS" to "heheh... big boss... relax ah... relax..."<br><br>Nuff said... Some people are not worth all this attention, his maturity and conduct here is appaling... and I think he's just proving all your points when he contuines on his own rabid way to protest them. So sit back and enjoy his little meodrama like the way Singapore enjoys malaysian antics...<br><br>There we go...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey De|usi0n... i was refered to this forum by 1 of my friends. Didn't wanna read it initially, but ended up reading it due to the persuasion of this being a damm funny forum. I took around 2 hours to finish reading all the comments from the 1st to the last..
