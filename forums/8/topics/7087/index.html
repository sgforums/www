That's why i say if by talking to them does not work, start all the formal complains.<br><br>But i think you have to try and settle it at the personal level first. It is the "trying" that is important. Give them chance to explain themselves and realise their mistakes (in Axl's case they may not even know they are disturbing him). However, in your case, since by talking to them is impossible, a formal complain is the next step. But at least you've done your part in trying to solve it yourself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry, I am not posting to offer any suggestions to solve the neighbors' problem as I also face that kind of problems. bear me a while to see how's my neighbors.<br><br>My neighbors totally upset me too. Maybe in their dictionary without "noise pollution" these two words. The worst one is the one live next door, there is an unhappy family. The three kids (actually not kids lah, the younger one also older than 10 liao) often quarrelled and fight to each other, and their mum yelled at them as loud as possible, and they never close the door just like to let the whole world know that they are quarrelling even at midnight. "liang tian yi xiao nao, san tian yi da nao" so bothersome, I really dare not to go to ask them to close the door or keep their voice down. Haikkk, don't know when they really grow up.<br><br>Nowadays, it is not easy to keep a good relationship with the neighbors. I lived here more than two years, I only can recognize my neighbors' voices but not their faces. we live so close, but so strange to each other. It is so pity.  as an old chinese saying: " yuan qin bu ru jin lin", I think this old saying should be put into museum, it is not suitable to this modern society anymore. *sigh*<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ever had your laundry re-rinsed by the mop water from upstairs? It might be a scheme: when your laundry finally dries in this humid weather - it strangely coincides with the spot as well as the timing! So,... we have wet laundry. Also, we stay near the top floor, so our neighbour who stays higher, will generously distribute mop water as well as 9 to 5 washing. There's almost always water dripping from above when there's daylight. There's already a notice at the lift landing - &amp; my mum is afraid that it might be an Ah-mah (ok, we don't really know that many neighbours)... so it's  :p<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ixion (edited 26 April 2000).]</div>

Sounds like something metallic hammering right up where I stand, and of course a normal reaction to this is to.........retaliate!!
