              <p>Hi guys, I'm new here. Just looking to chit-chat and get some feedback on something. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>What
                                   I'm about to share is really something utterly crazy as a matter of 
                                  fact, and is pretty lengthy, so please brace yourselves and bear with 
                                  me if you decide to go ahead.</p>
              <p>First off, I'd like to preface this post with a disclaimer:</p>
              <p>I'm
                                   merely sharing my personal experience, and am not looking to prove 
                                  rigorously beyond a shadow of a doubt to anyone said experience. It's 
                                  entirely up to you whether to believe it or not - take it or leave it  - no one's putting a gun to your head to do so. 
                                  If you don't, please just simply refrain from participating and/or posting 
                                  inflammatory comments.</p>
              <p>Here goes: I recently gained the ability to create things out of nothing and teleport - no joke; not trolling; am dead serious.</p>
              <p>It
                                   all began when I watched some youtube videos of a French-Chinese 
                                  magician called Yif awhile back. In them, he performed some really 
                                  incredible "magic," among which are teleportation and creation from 
                                  nothing.</p>
              <p>I, to say the least, was pretty intrigued. I watched 
                                  every one of his videos, including live TV performances and famous 
                                  celebrities and businessmen in Taiwan and China who endorse and vouch 
                                  for him.</p>
              <p>Plus, I grew up as a Christian, so all the familiar Bible
                                   stories in the gospels started flooding my mind of Jesus stating that 
                                  "All things are possible to him who believes," Him making bread and 
                                  fished out of nothing to feed the multitudes, and many other miracles 
                                  attributed to him including teleporting, levitating and walking on 
                                  water, among many others. But the whole time they were mere stories to 
                                  me, and I wasn't sure if I believed them. But I then began to see a 
                                  faint, possible connection between the twain.</p>
              <p>Supernatural power 
                                  to perform miracles only comes from two sources - dark spirits, or 
                                  faith/belief, in my understanding. From all that I'd gathered about Yif,
                                   and other eminent magicians like Cyril and Dynamo, they didn't seem to 
                                  be enlisting the help of evil forces, so there was only one other option
                                   left - belief. But I concluded that the only way to be sure was to try 
                                  it for myself.</p>
              <p>In addition, I was also in the know about quantum 
                                  physics and the true nature of reality. To cut a long story short, it 
                                  basically showed that we are consciousnesses/spirits inhabiting a 
                                  simulation/virtual reality, not unlike "The Matrix," and that there's 
                                  really no physical world existing objectively, fundamentally, and 
                                  independently.</p>
              <p>To use an analogy: we are literally living in a 
                                  simulation in the same way the characters in, say, a video game live in 
                                  the virtual world of the video game. The only difference between the two
                                   scenarios is that in the case of video games, the virtual world is 
                                  displayed on the screen of a computer monitor, while in the case of our 
                                  "real" world, the virtual world is displayed on the "screen" of 
                                  consciousness/spirit.</p>
              <p>Consequently, I started to experiment 
                                  for myself. A few weeks back I began to attempt to make a gold kilobar 
                                  out of nothing. The method is pretty simple - just will what you want to
                                   happen and BELIEVE it will happen - which was what I did. Not 
                                  surprisingly, I was met with utter failure - nothing happened. I kept 
                                  trying on the first day to no avail, and a tide of frustration washed 
                                  over me needless to say. But I thought to myself, "it's just the old, 
                                  faulty beliefs about the nature of reality lodged in my subconscious 
                                  mind that's getting in the way, and I should press on until I manage to 
                                  overwrite those beliefs and finally get a manifestation."</p>
              <p>After a 
                                  week or so of continuous working on it in my spare time, lo and behold, a
                                   gold bar popped up on my desk right before my eyes. To say that I 
                                  couldn't believe my eyes is an understatement - I was outright 
                                  flabbergasted and mind-blown. Thereafter, once the first step was made, 
                                  the mental barrier was gone. The subsequent miracles came much more 
                                  readily. I made a few kilobars, and then went on to making the much 
                                  bigger gold delivery bar. You can imagine at this point how my mind went
                                   wild, thinking that I can make a living being a goldsmith selling 
                                  faith-made gold haha!</p>
              <p>It hit me that everything in this virtual 
                                  reality is made of the same stuff, elementary particles/energy, which 
                                  upon deeping probing turn out to be just information, like in "The 
                                  Matrix." "Physical" reality is generated from underlying information in 
                                  the same way the virtual world of a video game is generated from 
                                  information in the form of computer code.</p>
              <p>So, I decided to be more
                                   adventurous. I went on to other things like food and clothing and was 
                                  met with similar success. I can now literally create food out of nothing
                                   when I'm hungry by simply willing it with faith without needing to go 
                                  to a store to buy food! Same with clothes!</p>
              <p>Then a thought flashed 
                                  in my mind: human bodies are basically made of the same stuff as 
                                  anything else in this virtual reality - at bottom, information. However,
                                   a human being is not just a body, but also a consciousness/spirit. So I
                                   thought I'd try just making the shell of a person, the body (not the 
                                  spirit, which belongs solely in God's domain).</p>
              <p>I have a deceased 
                                  grandmother whom I was pretty close to when she was alive, and I 
                                  actually made a verbatim, exact replica of her body appear right before 
                                  me. It was just a shell without the spirit obviously, not the real 
                                  person, and so it was inanimate. I then made it vanish shortly after off
                                   course as it was a tad creepy.</p>
              <p>The next miracle I tried was 
                                  teleporting. After some time of trial and error, I also succeeded. I've 
                                  to date teleported from room to room in my place, but I haven't tried 
                                  doing it for more distant places though.</p>
              <p>I tell you, it's like the drama "Heroes" come to life for me lol! It's really all too much to take at this juncture.</p>
              <p>Right
                                   now, only my immediate family knows about this, and they are very 
                                  excited about it. Moreover, I'm sharing this anonymously here because if
                                   I were to share it publicly
                                   in the open you can just imagine the kind of ridicule and criticism I'd
                                   be met with!</p>
              <p>So what say you? Any thoughts/feedback/advice? By chance does anyone else have similar experiences?</p>
              <p>Some examples of Yif's videos I mentioned:</p>
              <p>Creation out of and destruction into nothing example: https://youtu.be/OCnATCO5L-U?t=3m38s</p>
              <p>Teleportation: https://youtu.be/h-R_UjP9vzw?t=50s</p>
              <p>I'm telling you, what these elite "magicians" do is for real, as well as Jesus' miracles and faith-healing to boot.</p>
              <p>Well, I'm not oblivious to the fact that this is something that's pretty far-out and absurd to 
                                  the typical person unaware of spiritual realities and the implications 
                                  of quantum physics as opposed to the outdated newtonian, materialistic 
                                  paradigm of the world. Once again, no one's forcing you to believe it. 
                                  I'm just putting it out there, in the hope of having a discussion with 
                                  kindred spirits.</p>
