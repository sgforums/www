It is easier said than done. As what Azrael brought up, we can all empathise with that.<br><br>bollywood beng: perhaps you should work as a cust service personnel yourself and see things from other people's angle. things aren't as rosy as being in bollywood with glamour, beautiful babes like Aishuarya Rai (pardon the spelling if it's wrong), red carpets, servants at your beck and call. you must have equated cust service people to be that of those servants who have awaited you all this time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well that's the idea. If you are in servitude, you have to serve nicely with the vision that the customer is always right no matter what. I know its hard, but doing so correctly and effectively makes us better people at the end of the day, tougher too. I worked at 7-11, cold storage and even a bouncer at dance arena <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> (closed down now though ). Most of the time I make customers happy by engaging in conversation while doing business, and its important to smile. I know its hard with shitty pay, but that's what the job demands, and if you can win customers over you win more business via contacts. And if you meet those ****ed up customers, you just suck it up and smile, and sometimes... you can be naughty if the customers can't speak good english, you can reply sarcastically.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Customer is always right cuz they are the ones who pay us salary every month. Without them, our company will close shop and retrench all of us. Of cuz there should be a limit to customer demands. If they go overboard, it is better to lose that customer than endure his antics. The tough part is finding that line when one define as overboard and not overboard.</div>
