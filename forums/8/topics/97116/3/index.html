            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I LOVE MY COUNTRY!! CHINKS MUTTS BANGLAHS ANGMOHS GALORE!<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Uniquely Singapore</strong></span></span><br><br>A- Annabelle Chong; What more can I say? Singapore's very own golden girl who placed us in the Guinness book of records. Who says that we Singaporeans are an unadventurous bunch. Look at our darling. She takes it in every other orifice possible, that's more than what most ang mohs could have done. Respect to ma girl. You take my pants off everyone.<br><br>B-Bengs; Act like punks, whine like bitches. Roystan Tan's Fifteen says it all for our local boys. Flashy, Hokkien rapping lyrical about brotherhood. Long fringe is a must. Couple that with a long baby fingernail for that occasional ear digging. Oh oh and the sure fire way to spot a Beng. Look out for the orange comb sticking out of the back pocket.<br><br>C- Changi airport; Our pride and joy. Usually the first and last impression left on tourists, Changi Airport has won international recognition in being the BEST AIRPORT IN THE WORLD!!!! i definitely know i'm home everytime i see the familiar outline against our sky. My favorite place in the world.<br><br>D- Durian; so loved by locals we bring in durians from malaysia and thailand and hawk them all year round at Geylang. we even made one of our national icon based on the thorny fruit. You either love it or hate it. There's no room for in betweens.<br><br>E- Eating places; Singapore boasts to be the food hub. We may not have the best food, but it is true when it comes to the number of eateries we have here in Singapore. We have one diner at every corner. If you happen to be hungry at night, chances are, there is a 24 hour eatery somewhere near you.<br><br>F- Flora and Fauna; garden city that's what we are. every overhead bridge is decorated with bougainvilla bushes. all our roads are sidelined with shady trees and shrubs. Amazingly, our trees never seem to shed their leaves for the cleaners make sure that it's all cleaned up. Bats fly by every night and sparrows chirp every morning. what a heavenly place to be in. relatively clean air and spotless environment. awwww. i love mother nature.<br><br>G - Government; while it is safe to say that each government is unique in its own way, no other government can rival ours in terms of honesty, corruption-free and payroll. So far our leaders have delivered what they have promised, their record of corruption is as white as their uniform. Strong will, Strong Money, and Strong Punishment are the main cause for a near perfect legislation<br><br>H- HDB; Nowhere else in the world can these compact housing be found. Made out of the same mould, HDB estates can serve as a maze playground for the orcs or minotaurs.<br><br>I- Import; As long as it's foreign stuff, it's good stuff. Singapore itself is small and has little resources, thus we built our nation on import and export trade, capitalizing on our only resource, humans. but even now that is being outsourced as foreign talents flood our countries, edging the rest of us out.<br><br>J-Jack Neo; Steven Spielberg cross Whoopi Goldberg with a trait of a Lao(read<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">ld) Beng(refer point B). Local comedian/host/director who's been boosting our movie industry with box-office shattering films about this island we call home.<br><br>K-  Kiasu; A trait that ensures growth and survival. Seriously, look at how our Singaporean kids whoop the others in all money making aspects of their life. At the age of 3, most local kids would have gotten black belt in Tae Kwan do, fluent in 3 languages not including dialects, improvise Beethoven concerto in jazz and wear glasses that NASA uses to see the landscape on Pluto. 30 years and Kiasuism is all it took for us to be what we are today. Don't anyone forget that. Long live Mr. Kiasu.<br><br>L- Lians; The Significant Other of a Beng (refer point B)  Lians dress to pass off as Taiwanese or Jap but more often than not, their unique individuality  shines out like a soaring thumb. Flashy outfit, tiny slit eyes, a mix of languages such as "Wo kao su ni, wo jin tian hen hairpy cos wo miit dao Carewin. Da hen hensome leh. Wo ming tian yao zhi miit da chi parti parti yi sia. Rang hou go sarper den maybe chi ML lor.?distinguishes a lian from the wannabes.<br>*translation: let me tell you, Im happy today because I met up with Kelvin. He is so handsome leh. We are going to meet up again tomorrow to party for a while. Later on we will do supper and then off to make love lor*<br><br>M- Money; No lack of it here in Singapore. Every year, we complain about GST hike, COE increment, ERP costs, but yet, year after year NKF's donation drive just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.............<br><br>N- National Service; unlike others, our national service really isn't about training for war. It's about training the boys to act like man. During national service, our men begin to develop a manly physique and above all, they learn about manhood. All in hope to impregnate our woman to relief our country of its dwindling population. National service provides rhem with an excuse to compare d*** size and to appreciate women better. If you, my female readers, feel lousy about yourself because you're fat and ugly. There is always hope. Hope comes on Saturday morning when NS boys book out. Swear you I, no women is too ugly to be oogled at.<br><br>O- Orang-Utan; Singapore's mascot Ah Meng, second only to the merlion. Tiffany, step aside. Everyone's having breakfast with Ah Meng.<br><br>P- Punishment; Singapore is a fine country. You litter, spit, chew gum, vandalize, pluck flowers, speed, urinate, you PAY.<br><br>Q- Queue; (refer to point K) The inate ability to want the biggest, the most and the best has evolved into this particular trait to blindly follow what the majority are doing. Get in line fast.<br><br>R- Religion; Let me be serious here for a minute. No other place in the world have I seen Chinese deities, Muslim kramat and Lord Garnisha situated on the same land, unpartitioned. Thanks to our Old Man Lee and boys, we understand the need for racial tolerance. Respect.<br><br>S- Singlish; the language of the country whether you like it or not. Perhaps a trait passed down from the time of the British colonization. Anyone who speaks with an English twang is immediately recognized as educated. Tsk tsk. English speaking groups consider themselves of higher stature, westernized and as such, powerful. The Chinese think they're Japanese. The Malays and Indians think they're niggers. The Caucasians tries to speak in singlish and pass off as local.The  real Chinese don't understand us, the authentic Malays don't understand us, hell, even the wholesome Americans we look up to don't understand us. That's our language. Singlish is the one twang that identifies us from the rest of the world. You can spot a fellow Singaporean immediately when overseas.<br><br>T- Tiger beer. Hey what good is it to be the food and clubbing hub if we can't even produce our own beer. That's right. Tiger Beer, our very own. Unlike the cocktail, Singapore Sling, Tiger Beer is actually consumable. The same cant be said for Touche tho. Oh and did you realise that the tail of the tiger logo is actually out of the circle that erm, circles it? That was actually changed after Tiger gone international.<br><br>U- who me?<br><br><strong>V- Vulgarity; We express our frustrations much better than our AngMoh counterparts, with a good mix of Hokkien, English, Chinese and Malay. Like for example, Kar nin na boo chao chi bye fark u understand?</strong><br><br>W- Water; who can forget our never ending feud w malaysia and our counter attack w newwater which has been running our taps w/o us even realising it.<br><br>X- XEROX; the photocopied country. How unique and original we are depends on how we inject local flavor on the xeroxed copy of our neighbours. Esplanade is our version of Sydney's Opera House. And our latest NDP "HOME" mtv, looks eerily familiar to Australia's "I still call Australia home" mtv. Rows of children lined up and sang chior style, cept that our version had our kids in black and white samfoo lookalike, depicting an almost funeralistic feel.<br><br>Y- Y-chromosome; Found only in males. Increasing number of gays are coming out of the closet as our society opens up to accept them. Or tolerate them. Just like we do other race and religions.<br><br>Z- Zouk; has placed us on the world music scene right beside Ibiza and London's music underground. Honestly, which other major clubs plays oldies on Wednesday?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a very thought provking thread. Self reflection folks, and we'll see our mistakes. Loose cannons on board a boat can sink it. Supremist, instead of whining off here like some 3 year old kid. You're 20ish and by god. Either you have a slow mental growth or you are outright a dumbfuck nut. Who gives a shit if you can screw JC females left and right? Life isn't about just screwing; wait, you DON'T have a life. Instead of a meeting, why don't you go down to chinatown and scream "CHINKIE" in the face of some chinese. You'll probably get the general idea of what you deserve.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really wonder if this guy is real or what.<br><br>Can't blame him for being bitter.<br><br>1) Their neighbours don't respect them. Yes, my Canadian friends think Americans are so out of it, only wanting to stick to American places and eating American food when they travel. They are so full of themselves that they forgot that they are part of planet earth too. They also think most American's are so out of touch with world news. Oh, I also heard that some American's fly with Canadian stickers on their luggage because they get treated better that way as some places are so anti-American.<br><br>2) The 'beanies', 'chinks' and the 'niggers' those white trash hate are banging up their girls, so maybe that's why he says white girls are harder to bed.<br><br>3) Asians are fighting with them for their jobs, and winning.<br><br>4) Most USA companies are moving out of US into Asia, creating a void in jobs. Yeah white rules! They leave the whites in their country jobless while they fuel the Asian economy. Don't you just love them?<br><br>5) I don't know if anyone noticed but you see more Chinese guys with White girls lately in SG, married with a kid. I wonder if there is anything wrong with the White guys...hmm...makes one wonder. Too bad they have to be stuck with girls here who still live in the colonial ages.<br><br>6) Do let us know the location of your all white church so that we can avoid it like a plague.<br><br>Anyways Supremist, I don't know why you are doing this but you are giving your country such a bad name, though your current President is already doing helluva good job.</div>
