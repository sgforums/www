If anything don't fit, complain to govt and govt spend a few million a year setting up committies to study the problem and tell you something you and I already know...  There are always more than one way... But to the inflexible Small Singaporean, there is only one way and its their way.<br><br>I had the misfortune to live above a woman who would pick up a piece of tissue that accidentally few down to her aircon. She would pick it up and remind me about my trash and warn me never to do it again. Aye, Auntie, accident ah, buay hiao tnia ah, go live in condo lah? She also call town council to complain about so many things town council setup special line for her. She even come into my house when my doors are open, without knocking or pressing my working door bell and kick up some fuss and her explanation is that my doors are open and I am only a tenant. I of couse must exert my power lah and bang table at her. I warn her if she ever come into my house without my permission, the next time, I will restrain her and call the police and charge her with unlawful entrying of another's residance and maybe claim she is threatening me. What a Bit.ch!<br><br>Another misfortune, to sit with stupid inflexible people in a open hawker. 6 seats. 4 persons. I joint in cause the place was busy. THere are 2 extra seats but these people must purposely book certain seat for their "people" hey 2 seats, no diff lah. Where I sit, the rest if theirs. But to them is very big deal, must be those and those only. Ok loh, those seats got gold lah. Then the Auntie come and sit down, complains non stop and all sorts of nasty comparison, shallow talk. Somemore like so smart, talk so loud. I though, wah liao eh, you so Ba Bai ah, then don't eat if you don't like lah. Unfortunately she turn her attention on the things on my plate and start to point at my choices and almost touch my food. I almost say Aye, Auntie, this is not you home ah. You no manners don't mean the whole world must accept you ah. And on and on and on she nag about the food (she is a local - no wonder men don't like local women.) Nag and nag. Not a moment of silence. When I got up and leave, I said loud enough for her to hear: Xia Deng Ren.<br><br></div>

Thing is, some Singaporean are stingy, why?<br><br>1. Due to their upbringing.<br>2. No money due to lower pay.<br>3. They are saving up to buy cars or to play golf.<br>4. They are not hawkers themselves.  Invite these groups of winnies to be hawkers and see how they do the biz.
