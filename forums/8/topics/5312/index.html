            <div class='col-md body'>Let me get this straight- she SEEING another guy, she's not attached to him right? If this is the case, why would this be stealing somebody else's lunch? *puzzled look*<br><br>Why don't you let the lady decide who she likes? (That is, tell her how you feel lah!)<br><br>Let you out on one trick- sometimes, when we girls wants to move a relationship with a guy along, we like to pretend there's another worthy competitor. If he doesn't respond, then we know it's a gone case. Anyway, there's still the other guy as a consolation prize (ha, ha, just joking!)<br><br>So tell her how you feel. It might just be what she's waiting for. If you can't say it, write her a letter (e-mail is not THAT romantic though). Or get her a gift (e.g. soft toy) with the words 'I like you' or something to the effect. Worst case, get roses. No need to say anything, it's understood immediately alredi. I'm sure you can come up with better ideas.... good luck dearie. Don't hesitate too long or you'll regret.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..which means she is attached to that guy, and U feel that the guy is not"good enough", which means I supposed you think u are better than that guy.First, may I ask in what sense? And how do u do if that guy is not good enough? DO u really understand the girl what she really want in a partner?<br><br>I realise that most guys are usually very fast in approaching relationship which I think time has to play an important role in knowing the person. The reason of most break-ups is actually lacked of real-time communication and understanding.Always remember, it does not really matter if you have got her, the thing is can u keep her. I think if the girl does not have a little feelings for the guy , she wouldn't have accepted him somehow. And if she had accepted the guy just to provoke u, I think that is being very selfish and childish.<br><br>Always think what u want before what u want to do.Sit down and do some brainstorming..think deep not just the surface...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

Then make sure you turn up.<br><br>You can choose to include your name or leave it out. If you include your name, you're making her decide. If you don't, you create a sense of mystery and adventure (but she might think it's from a wacko and not turn up).<br><br>Plus points of this- (1) it's romantic, so it shows you made an effort (2) provides a graceful exit for both of you if she rejects you. She doesn't have to tell you and you don't have to hear it from her, but both of you will know how she feels.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>

(damn, you're good, you're REALLY good)<br>well, it all comes down to basic analysis i suppose, i mean, i look at the guy, and i'm not trying to be boastful or spiteful, but i don't how he could've captivated her...his only advantage is that they're both schoolmates.  i understand that you think that i am a shallow person by not thinking beyond those outer vantage points, but i sincerely can't help myself.  i suppose my own hesitance in making the initial move only exarcebated the process of losing her.<br>i know that it is not within my rights to claim that i am a far better partner compared than him, but it is only human nature to do so.  and i know that beyond the superficial layers of that guy, i can't make a comment whether i am a better person INSIDE rather than just on the outside.  i remember a quote from Othello : 'if virtue doth beauty lack, then your son in law is far more fair than black'  appearance is only skin deep...<br>i know that i can't make the assumption that i'm a better person just by comparing.<br>perhaps she chose him for a reason beyond my comprehension, but i know that i had my chance.  i'm simply lost for words, and i don't know what to do...<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...</div>

What do u think if he knows that someone is having eyes on his gf and even of getting her as her own?<br><br>There is always a causation. Like i said, dun let your emotions get over u.Sometimes, rashness leads to real regret. If you really love before, U will understand that love is not to possess but to give.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiaz Pluckaduck,<br><br>all this see-sawing. Why don't you try to find out from the girl whether she's really attached or just seeing this guy? There's a big diff. If she's just seeing him, then she hasn't committed to him yet. She's in the process of deciding, so there's nothing wrong with going after her. You're just offering yourself as an alternative for her to consider. (But if you don't tell her, you've definitely eliminated yourself from the list of potential bfs). BTW, doesn't mean that if a girl decides to go on a few dates with a guy, she has decided that she definitely wants him as a boyfriend. In fact, I have progressed from being attracted to a guy to really disliking him in the span of a few dates (spoilt brat who doesn't want to grow up.... okay, dun want to complin. Back to you....) In short, you may still have a chance.<br><br>Just curious- how has she been acting towards you after she told you that she's going out with another guy? Is she still the same (got chance), or is she colder or avoiding you (no chance liao)?<br><br>Nonethless, don't be a love fool. Even if you feel pressured to move the relationship along, you should also take time to find out whether both of you can get along. I've had friends who broke up even though they were very much in love. Their personality differences made it very painful to be together. Or they're at different stages of their lives- she wants to settle down but he doesn't.<br><br>Then again, you wouldn't know if a relationship would work unless you've tried. Sieze the day man! Better get rejected than to regret for the rest of your life.<br><br>BTW, if you really want to give my trick a try, ask the florist to deliver it. I'm sure they'll help if you buy the 11+1 roses from them. If not, bribe the neighbourhood kids and swear them to secrecy.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 28-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fingers...<br>Oh...ok. I think first you have to find out what is her name.How? Teach you a trick, go to her one day and tap on her shoulder and ask,"Excuse me? Are u XYZ(come up with a nice name)?" Of cos she will say no.Next question:"Sorry, I thought U really look like my schoolmate...so embarassing, anyway my name is fingers(yr real name lah), what's yours?" If she dun give u, most likely she not interested in u. So see if u wanna give up or not. If she gives u her name, means still got chance, then say "oh nice to meet u, I am from XYZ JC." then try to start a conversation.Never try to get her number for the first time.You will freak her our. Try to know which bus-stop she goes home and try to talk to her but remain cool(most girls prefer cool guys). Only after the 5th time you meet her, get her number.If she say it is not convenient, e-mail add is good too...never give her your number.Wrong move! I think she will wash it together with her uniform.<br><br>try these moves then see how it goes and feedback to me.<br><br>If fate decrees, you will meet her again...------------------<br>Rinoa...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 28-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know that for some people, they are able to chat well on the net, but when come to face to face interaction, they might not be able to cope with it. Dangers do loom around if you are the type who hope to use the net to start off a new relationship. Sometimes, you can get quite intimate from chatting online and when you come face to face with each other, the sparks or chemistry isn't there, this might cause some awkwardness. It isn't too bad if both parties are not turn on, but if only 1 of them is not too keen, then it can be quite hurting. Anyway, love cannot be compelled, if you are meant for each other, nothing can seperate you.<br><br>As for not revealing yourself early enough.. well, I know it feel miserables.. but it is never too late. What you can do is to sound her out first, see how her response is like. Even if she might be seeing another guy, it's still alright. So long she is not engaged or married, you still got a chance. If you feel that you can provide for her and love her better than anyone else in the world, go for it. It might not be a nice thing to do if she is already attached, so this has to depend on your principles.<br><br></div>
