            <div class='col-md body'>ok pluckaduck:<br><br>this is gnna make me sound like a cad to many but i still have to say it...even if she's attched u have 2 options...<br><br>1)if the one she really likes is you, then thru inaction, u are harming 3 pple...you, her and the bf, cos its like deep down she knows she loves u better, u KNOW you love her, and the bf, if he hasnt heard of you from her, will be shortchanged of the fullness of a relationship cos the gal he's with will not have 100% of her heart with him...<br><br>2)you can just sit and remain frds while waiting for 'em to split, but you wont know when, if ever they will...<br><br>from personal experience i picked 2, but its al up to personal preference, i dont think principles play a part in this cos no one owes anyone anything in "true love"...evrything is freely given, and like i said earlier abt the bf also getting shortchanged anyway...depends on the situation u gtta see for yrself, but consider what i've said 1st cos i regretted taking choice 2 but now its kinda too late....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh Pluckaduck,<br><br>I feel so sorry for you. Sorry for not reading your postings carefully. I thot she's not attached yet so you still have a chance.<br><br>Seriously, in this case, you should really consider whether or not you should declare that you like her. Accusations of girlfriend snatcher is really not a nice label to be stuck with. And if she leaves him for you after such a short while, it wouldn't look very good on her too..... So, as Rinoa said, dun do it unless you are very sure you can provide her with more happiness.<br><br>Even then, declaring your love for her now is VERY risky. If she doesn't like you, her impression of you will be worsened (yup, 'girlfriend snatcher' label again). If she likes you, (1) she may be leave him for you (mixed blessing because both of you have to live with others' unfavourable opinions about the matter)(2) then again, she may stay out of or loyalty or fear of trouble and start avoiding you instead.<br><br>Whichever way, it's hard to see a happy ending  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I hope I'm not pouring a big bucket of cold water over you. I just hope to present what could possibly happen in case you get hurt.<br><br>Maybe the best way out is to just get to know her better and become pals with her so that if she ever breaks up, you'll stand a good chance. Then again, this can be awfully painful....<br><br>Haiz, Pluckaduck, how come u so unlucky? Feel so sorry for you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JC Boy,<br><br>glad you like my trick. One of my female friends was won over by a secret admirer this way. I just love listening to stories of courtship; all the silly things people do really make you laugh.<br><br>Sadly, my bf won my heart in a rather 'normal' way. I knew he liked me right from the start because he kept staring at me in class and always offer me all kinds of help, even when I say no need. Lucky for him, I found him very cute. So no special gimmicks from him. Just one white lily, lots of thoughful acts, and a stolen kiss.<br><br></div>

(i can already smell the criticism from Rinoa....ouch...)<br><br>why am i so unlucky?  well, maybe cuz i'm a gemini...and maybe cuz i'm also the duck...you see, the duck never gets anything...just lok at Donald and Daffy...but i don't care...after all, i'm plucka duck...<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...</div>

I dun really believe in star signs..But Geminis are known to be "fickle" and love ppl "quite easily" and thought they are in love...well...my best friend is a gemini but she is such a love lorn, in love with a guy for a year and still perservering on...<br><br>Well...well...sorry to put u thru such psychological torture, but really as far as I can see I give u the extreme of both cases good and bad...and U seems that U can't handle both...<br><br>Like I said, U are still young.

            <div class='col-md body'>pluckaduck - reading thru your posts made me feel that i had to write and maybe share in your pain. and i say share in ur pain cos u sound like me when i was ur age! going thru the same kinda thing....i dunno why, but somehow when ur abt to reach the end of ur teen yrs, it's in the larger scheme of things to get some big r'ship thingey thrown in ur face, almost as a reminder of the amt of agony and pain that is possible in this world.<br><br>i write this for many reasons. i write this, firstly to tell u ur not alone. many ppl have gone thru this exact thing. and have thot that the girl at stake (for want of a better phrase) was the only one for them. i had this fren who couldn't get over this girl for 7 years. i am no better. but never mind abt me.<br><br>i write this to see if what ur going thru is the same as what i've been thru. i think how u handle this in part depends on ur own personality. if ur anything like me (and i certainly hope no one in the whole wide world is anything close to being as screwed up as i am), then u would be going thru a period of intense emotional strain and pain. it may affect ur diet. ur sleeping pattern. you'd agonise over not just whether to bring it up with her, but increasingly, how to do so (which means you've already made up ur mind, or unconsciously had it made up for you by ur emotions). you'd have feelings of jealousy. of a chance gone abegging. of regret and remorse. and you'd think that this is a defining moment in ur life, one u have to fight for, for ur own sake. and then, if ur anything like me, u'd blurt everything out to her and screw things up big time. in other words, if ur anything like me, you'd tell her abt how you feel. and no amt of counselling would convince u to do otherwise. u noe what u should do but you'd do the exact opposite. and then feel like crap after the fact.<br><br>all this of course, is assuming ur like me. when i was 19. for ur sake, i hope ur not anything at all like me. i sincerely hope ur one of those more ruled by ur head (a clear head at that) rather than ur heart. i say this because, even tho u would never be able to see it now, there most prob is someone more rite for u than her. and u prob haven't met her yet. how do i know? just a hunch. cos if ur anything like me, you'd be doing this rite now more for yourself than for her. but you'd convince yourself it's for the best for both of you. silly me. i did all i did more for myself than for her. it might as well have been a barbie doll for all i cared. but somehow i told myself it was abt me and her, when really, it was abt me all along, all the time.<br><br>you'd also tell yourself this is a defining moment in ur life. and it is. but not in the way u think it is. at the risk of sounding dramatic (and again this has more overtones of my tragic life experience than yours), how u handle this will have repercussions on how you see yourself in the future. ur sense of self-worth. dat will only happen if u really lose her. if u do get her, u wouldn't even rem me writing this. if u lose her, i think, from all you've written, you're gonna scar badly. but then again, whether u scar or not depends on ur capacity to cope. i didn't cope too well.<br><br>from someone who has screwed up his life before (viz, yours truly), to someone on the brink of it, if u can gain a measure of mastery and self-control over ur passions, i think u would have learnt a great deal. and grown up far more than i ever did (or could)at ur age. why is dat so impt? cos it saves you from future pain. once ur over this (assuming the worst), you'd prob wonder why on earth u bothered so much. you'd tell urself that it was sth u had to go thru, sth u had to do, and it was a good learning experience, but there wasn't really as much riding on it as u think there is now.<br><br>so if i seem so convinced that ur gonna go ahead and tell her anyways, why am i even bothering writing?<br><br>firstly, to tell u that u have to do it right. know when to stop saying what u want to say. some things are better left unsaid. and know when u should clarify things. do it with some poise. and make sure u have ur dignity and self-respect at the end of it. don't grovel. it's unbecoming.<br><br>secondly, to tell u that if u do lose her, don't dwell on things. grieve for her. then move on. don't take 7 yrs. major psychological repercussions there. this is prob the most impt thing i want to tell you.<br><br>thirdly, don't lose faith in life and humanity and girls in general. even more imptly, don't lose faith in yourself. i have met many ppl weary with the world. weary at life. cynical. bitter. resentful.<br><br>fourthly, if u do meet another girl, don't carry ur emotional baggage over to her. it's not her fault u've had a tough life. love her for who she is. and don't compare her wif this other girl.<br><br>fifthly, there is more to life than women. no, i'm not asking u to try men out instead. but do try to develop other interests too. keep at that cricket thing. keeps you healthy and in the good company of friends.<br><br>you see, i've taken too long to learn some lessons the hard way. either personally or thru friends with bad experiences. and i've mellowed out a lot over the years. but i've met some ppl who've had things tough like me. and they are the highly emotional kind. these types usu hurt the worst. and some are still hurting. so if ur anything like some of my frens, then i've just given u a taste of ur future. those are prob some of the things you'd go thru. and then later learn you should have done differently.<br><br>i hope actually that none of this makes sense to you. cos that may mean ur actually more ruled by ur head. and that will only serve to pull u thru this in tact. i also hope that i've typed this in vain. cos then that may mean you told her, and she chose you instead. but the toughest part wouldn't have been over. u'd prob be over-joyed. and then after a while you'd see the problems emerge. the point tho is this. the passion and elation often die out. think right now, do you and her have what it takes to last the long haul? u don't know do you? how could you? if ur anything like i was when i was 19, then i don't think you noe her enuf. u don't noe her just yet. i was more focussed on my own loneliness to even consider what "we" would be like as a couple. i only knew "i" wouldn't have to be alone anymore. so know what you want. and try not to deceive yourself while you're at it. it's gonna be tough, no doubt abt it. i know because i've been thru it. several times. and i know ppl who've been thru hell too. but we're still alive. tho barely. all that is left is for me to wish you all the very best. and to let you know that whatever the case, life is a long and arduous journey, but one you should embrace instead of fear. oh....and one last thing....the die-hard romantic in me hopes you get the girl. hang tough in there okay?

            <div class='col-md body'>Pluckaduck: Can't agree more with what fading star said. Like reading my own story.<br><br>I just want to add that if you really decide to go ahead and tell her, be very aware of what you are in for. Understand that she might not be feeling what you feel, or she does not want to betray anyone, and you'll be hurt bad. Thats what happened to me, and I'll say that I haven't recovered yet.<br><br>You should know by now how difficult it is to choose between using your heart or brain. Sure we know what we should do, but its not easy to actually do that.<br><br>But,you and only you have to decide anyway. No matter what happens you are already in for some tough times, but you'll be right. Trust me on that.<br><br>Hope you are not getting sick of all the viewpoints from so many people.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Fadisng Star, Pacman, and everyone who has kindly replied,<br><br>thandk you so much for putting the efforts in...i never would even had the slightest idea of how many replies i would get from my post.  i am genuinely touched by all your kindness and your wilingness to share and to enlighten me.  i know that i might have sounded foolish, or a self-centered egoist who cares for none other than my own self...<br>i realize how unwise it would be for me to reveal the warm feelings i have for her, and yet, at the same time, coming clean seemed the only logical explanation out.  it's funny, this thing called emotion...it takes you beyond all your senses and tears you apart from your conscience and all boundaries.  i could get this over and done with with a simple phone call and uttering those 3 simple words.  and although it's not unlike a Russian Roulette, it would pull me out of the brink of uncertainty and it would shine a light on where i am standing.<br>i would blame myself entirely for becoming surly to compound the felony of being labelled ignorant.<br>but at the end of the day, i've decide that my head should rule over my heart, and let my own nature to take action...which means i wil take no action.  it may not sink in, at all tot hat matter, and perhaps i would be drowning in sadness and wallowing in my own misfortune and rue the fateful day...but at least i know that i should enjoy  and bask in the satisfaction which comes with making the right decision. &lt;--note the egoistical nature of me =)<br>i should have trusted others when they told me that being her friend and confidante would get me further...time will tell...eventhough it may not exist at all, if we believe Einstein...and as the big kahuna himself said, "there is nothing more beautiful to experience than the mysterious and the unknown...for there lies the tiniest amount of grief and suffering..."<br>so we'll see...<br><br>a big wrap to everyone who contributed, i can't name you all one by one, but all of you are greatly appreciated.  thanks for listening, and most of all, thanks for caring...<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...</div>
