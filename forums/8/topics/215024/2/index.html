            <div class='col-md body'>pregnant lady still ok. at least u can identify them.<br><br>The worst is elderly. Some is obviously old, like 60 above, so just give them the seat. But some look 50, then got white hair, yet looks strong and healthy. but then they always purposely stand beside you.<br><br>Once i give up my seat to a guy like above described, i was so shocked that he rudely rejected my offer and say i insulted him by giving him the seat. To think that i apologise for being kind.<br><br>Now unless is very very old or pregnant lady, i will just pretend to sleep if i canot decide the guy is old or not.</div>
