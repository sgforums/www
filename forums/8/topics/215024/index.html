            <div class='col-md body'>Well this would probably be a pretty common thing to most of your, but what I saw this morning on the train really enraged me.<br><br>I was taking the train from Bishan down to City Hall around noon today, and the train was quite packed. Most of the teenagers and young adults were standing, with majority of the seats taken up by middle-aged adults, and about 3 seats taken up by senior citizens.<br><br>Anyway, here's the thing which really got me mad. About two stops later when an 70 - 80 year old woman came in, I was pitying the poor woman and wondering if anyone was going to give their seats up. Fortunately a pregnant woman saw that she was quite weak in the legs, and was quite quick to give her seat up for her after realizing no one else would, even though she needed the seat quite badly.<br><br>But well, this part was equally bad as well. At the next stop, someone just in front of me got off her seat and alighted. I didn't take the seat because (naturally) I expected that everyone else in the train would've let the pregnant lady take it, and I think she thought so too. But just before she reached, a 30+ year old man took the seat. Okay so maybe he was a little bit plump, but undoubtly that woman needed the seat more than I did.<br><br>I was almost about to scold him, especially because he was right in front of me and kept looking at me, but he noticed that my bag was unzipped, and told me with a very pleasant smile on his face, which made me reconsider whether to scold him or not. I didn't in the end.<br><br>About another 2 stops later, the elderly woman got off, returned the seat to the pregnant lady and thanked her before alighting from the train.<br><br>Out of the 18 seats on both sides, 15 of the people sitting on them were healthy enough to stand without any problems. Yet it took a pregnant lady to give her seat up to someone else who needed the seat as much as she did? Worst yet, someone can even steal a seat from the pregnant lady AFTER she gracefully gave her seat up to the elderly woman. Worst still, he can notice that my bag is unzipped, but he can't see a pregnant lady just about 2 metres away from him. Honestly, I can't believe those people sitting on the seats had no shame at all. Selfish little assholes who only think about themselves and can't be bothered to see what's going on around them.</div>

Guess it was because at that time all I could think of was "scold that stupid jerk. scold that stupid jerk.", but after he was so nice to me, in my mind all I could think was "alright, that option of scolding him is out."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JennTS:</div><div class="quote_body">Well this would probably be a pretty common thing to most of your, but what I saw this morning on the train really enraged me.<br><br>I was taking the train from Bishan down to City Hall around noon today, and the train was quite packed. Most of the teenagers and young adults were standing, with majority of the seats taken up by middle-aged adults, and about 3 seats taken up by senior citizens.<br><br>Anyway, here's the thing which really got me mad. About two stops later when an 70 - 80 year old woman came in, I was pitying the poor woman and wondering if anyone was going to give their seats up. Fortunately a pregnant woman saw that she was quite weak in the legs, and was quite quick to give her seat up for her after realizing no one else would, even though she needed the seat quite badly.<br><br>But well, this part was equally bad as well. At the next stop, someone just in front of me got off her seat and alighted. I didn't take the seat because (naturally) I expected that everyone else in the train would've let the pregnant lady take it, and I think she thought so too. But just before she reached, a 30+ year old man took the seat. Okay so maybe he was a little bit plump, but undoubtly that woman needed the seat more than I did.<br><br>I was almost about to scold him, especially because he was right in front of me and kept looking at me, but he noticed that my bag was unzipped, and told me with a very pleasant smile on his face, which made me reconsider whether to scold him or not. I didn't in the end.<br><br>About another 2 stops later, the elderly woman got off, returned the seat to the pregnant lady and thanked her before alighting from the train.<br><br>Out of the 18 seats on both sides, 15 of the people sitting on them were healthy enough to stand without any problems. Yet it took a pregnant lady to give her seat up to someone else who needed the seat as much as she did? Worst yet, someone can even steal a seat from the pregnant lady AFTER she gracefully gave her seat up to the elderly woman. Worst still, he can notice that my bag is unzipped, but he can't see a pregnant lady just about 2 metres away from him. Honestly, I can't believe those people sitting on the seats had no shame at all. Selfish little assholes who only think about themselves and can't be bothered to see what's going on around them.</div></blockquote>Aiya.. your heart so soft for what?<br><br>Since the man told u that your bag is unzipped in a friendly way, you should have told him back in a sarcastic manner with a smile of course something like, "I think she needs the seat more than you do."<br><br>Haiz..<br><br>I'm puzzled why some people just dun like speaking up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes people do not take note of who's coming in and out of the trains you know.<br><br>the MRT is a form of transport.<br>not a duty to look out who's coming in and out.<br>so i think if u told him politely there's a pregnant lady somewhere i'm sure he would offer his seat.</div>
