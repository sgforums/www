            <div class='col-md body'>I guess why some of the people who don't have the common sense to give up their seats is that, if they stand in the bus, they will face difficulty. They cannot control their balance as when the bus brake or whatever, those who stand may lose their control and move here and there causing incovience to the rest, and when people want to get out of the bus, those who are standing must squeeze until like sardine to let those to pass through while those sitting, can shake their legs happily  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  So maybe that is the reason why people are not willing to give up the seats if the bus is crowded  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For me, I don't have the courage to say out to those who need the seats and give the seats to them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oct 14, 2006<br><strong>Must Singaporeans 'behave like pigs'? </strong><br><br>RECENTLY, my friend from Australia commented that Singaporeans behaved like pigs. I disagreed, saying that at most it's a small minority who behaved that way.<br><br>He challenged me to a test. I accepted his challenge, determined to prove him wrong. I was bitterly disappointed.<br><br>Here is an account of what happened.<br><br>My friend, my wife, our one-year-old son in a pram and I (wearing a neck brace and with my arm in a sling from injuries sustained in a car accident) went for an MRT ride. My wife and son couldn't get into the station for some time because other commuters kept using the gate meant for the disabled, ignoring her and the pram.<br><br>When the train arrived, people rushed in while alighting passengers rushed out. No one gave way to my wife and the pram. She had to compete with the horde to get onto the train. To make things worse, those standing at the doorway refused to move in, making it even more difficult for her.<br><br>Once on board, no one bothered to give up his seat to my wife, who was carrying our son. Those seated were young, able-bodied and educated (executive-type) adults. Finally, it was two Thai workers who gave up their seats to us.<br><br>Later, an old woman boarded the train. Again, no one gave up his seat until a man in a neck brace and an arm sling did so.<br><br>When we reached our destination, we tried to take the lift from the platform to the ticket concourse. The lift was packed with able-bodied people. My friend asked that my wife and the pram be allowed in but one man turned around and remarked rudely, 'Why can't you take the next lift?'. I was shocked beyond words.<br><br>We went to a packed food court for lunch. No tables were available. We waited and finally noticed a couple leaving. We inched our way towards their table but, with just 5m to go, a group of office girls ran ahead of us and took the table.<br><br>When we finally got a table, it was unbelievably messy. There were chicken bones, spilt sauces and prawn shells all over the table.<br><br>I turned red in the face when my friend, who was helping to clear the table, asked, 'So, do you still think that it's only a minority of Singaporeans that behave this way? If so, take a look around you. Look real hard at the tables when they leave... You guys eat like pigs.'<br><br>Martin Goh Lye Thiam<br></div>
