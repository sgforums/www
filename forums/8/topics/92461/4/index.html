            <div class='col-md body'>This article is a good read. But IMO, Chechnya deserves sovereignity NOW! The crimes of the Tsarists and Bolsheviks have been visited on innocent schoolchildren, and President Putin had better take note.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chechnya and the inflation of terror </span><br><br><strong>By Sunanda K. Datta-Ray </strong><br><br>THE portly Englishman I was chatting with at a private lunch party in a suburban Surrey garden was interested in my stint in Singapore. He had been there several times. Did he still go? No, he replied, he used to visit Joe, his son. Had Joe moved? He's dead, said the man. Then, perhaps feeling that a little more was called for, added, 'In the Bali bombing.' Conversation continued.<br><br>Perhaps the Beslan school's bereaved will also be as laconic about their suffering one day, though, like many Asians, Ossetians, Ingushetians and Chechens passionately nurse their pain from generation to generation. Moreover, the brutality has by all accounts further hardened attitudes in Moscow.<br><br>The murderous cycle will therefore intensify until Russian President Vladimir Putin can bring himself to acknowledge that Osama bin Laden did not mastermind the massacre of infants from some lair in the Caucasus, and that revolting though the school killings were, the challenge is essentially political.<br><br>Chechnya is an unresolved relic of czarist expansion into the Asian heartland. It would also be realistic to acknowledge, as I discovered in Bali, that the ill-fated Sari Club, where innocent young Joe perished, did not endear itself to local sentiment. More need not be said of that tragedy so long as we bear in mind that what looks like Muslim fundamentalism can stem from many social and political disaffections.<br><br>The newest fashionable theory to be spawned by the growth industry of terrorism, which bestows expert status on anyone who follows events in Afghanistan or Sri Lanka, is called 'inflation of terror'.<br><br>It implies that in a hideous parody of the Olympics' Faster, Higher, Stronger motto, terrorists are constantly trying to scourge the world with ever more gruesome outrages. It might look so if one compares Stavropol where Chechen rebels seized a hospital complex in 1995 to the Moscow theatre siege two years later and, now, Beslan.<br><br>But that's just the Chechens, and the security response played things up on all three occasions. To claim inflation of terror on a worldwide basis implies a unified global command, a single purpose, submissive legions and inexhaustible resources. It ignores the multiple causes of violence.<br><br>A recent survey confirmed that only 30 countries are without a religious or ethnic minority that comprises more than 10 per cent of the population. Even tiny Singapore boasts two major minorities with the majority Chinese divided into a number of dialect groups.<br><br>Demographic diversity should be a source of strength. But it can also provoke bitter strife as in Kosovo or Spain's Basque country. It is facile to attribute all these eruptions to an apocalyptic clash of civilisations that only the American-led war on terrorism can win. Both sides in Northern Ireland rally to the Cross. Secular Palestinians complain of Jewish theft of their land.<br><br>As for Chechnya, barely a word of history can be found in acres of tear-jerking Western reporting of the massacre. Moscow, which says 10 Arabs were among the terrorists, though none of the hostages saw them or heard Arabic spoken, must be pleased with this effusion. Yet, Chechens have been trying since the 16th century to defend their identity from Russian autocrats like Peter I, Catherine the Great and Stalin. Their resistance boasted heroes decades before Osama's appearance.<br><br>Shaikh Mansur raised the banner of revolt in 1785, organised the Chechen peasantry and died in prison after the czarists caught him in 1791. Beibulat Teimiev united all the North Caucasus tribes against Russia. The Russian conquest of 1859 and Stalin's ethnic cleansing in the next century only stiffened resistance.<br><br>When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, jubilant Chechens declared independence and invited fresh reprisals. The dreaded 'black widows' - wives, daughters and sisters of slaughtered men - belong to the ensuing repression which intensified with Mr Putin's accession to power in 1999. He was responding to a hardline electoral mandate, to public revulsion against Chechen crimes and Russian fears that one secession would lead to others, unravelling Russia's Asian empire.<br><br>These are understandable concerns. Nor is this the time to talk of sovereignty for Chechnya. But it is time to reconsider a constructive political alternative to military methods that have obviously failed. There will be no chance otherwise of Russians and Chechens ever achieving the philosophic tranquillity of Joe's grieving father.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The writer is a senior research fellow at the Institute of South-east Asian Studies.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by paperboi:</div><div class="quote_body">Its really sad. I pity the innocent children.</div></blockquote>I predict that more blood will be spilled unless President Putin takes a leaf from Tunku Abdul Rahman's memoirs and decides to expel Chechnya from the Russian Federation the way Tunku did to Singapore in 1965. With their own Islamic state, there is no reason for the Chechens to bother Moscow ever again. Since the Chechens want a nation to call home, let them have it in return for some peace and quiet. It is a win-win deal for both. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
