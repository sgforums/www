These include safe driving and exercising tact and courtesy with customers. They are also expected to comply with customers' instructions at all times.  Due to the onset of SARS, our  drivers are advised to wind down their windows and turn off the air-conditioner unless their  passengers request for them not to do so.<br><br>To help us in the investigation, the driver was called up for an interview. For his poor driving manners and discourteous behaviour towards you, the driver was warned.  Your complaint has been filed in his service record.  A  repeat offence will result in the termination of his taxi hiring contract with us.  He was also advised to exercise tact and courtesy towards his passengers.<br><br>I apologise once again for the unpleasant incident.<br><br>Should you require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me on tel: 6550 8588 or e-mail to:  prfeedback@ctpl.com.sg<br><br>Yours sincerely<br>Agnes Aw (Ms)<br>Customer Service Officer<br>Public Relations Division<br>Comfort Transportation Pte Ltd<br><br>Our Website: www.comfort-transportation.com.sg"<br><br>GUYS! note down the darn number... it's faster...<br><br>anywayz, here's my reply to their reply...<br><br>"Hi Agnes,<br><br>Thanks for ur help. Appreciate it.<br><br>I am glad that the cabbie was given a warning, i do hope that the msg went through to him, and made him understand the importance of customer service as i definitely did not want him to be suspended coz times are bad.<br><br>Thanks once again for taking time to look through my complain.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Audrey Lee"<br></div>
