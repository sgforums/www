            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>was TOTALLY PISSED by the cabbie yesterday... decided to write a letter of complain.. here goes...<br><br>"Hi there,<br><br>Was travelling from Takashimaya Taxi stand back home to Tampines St 45 just now, 10th April 2003 at ard 9.50pm, when i was totally pissed by the driver, Loke XXX of cab SH 6549C.<br><br>I was coincidentally and accidentally choked by my saliva, therefore started coughing uncontrollably. I do understand the tense situation due to SARS, however, whatever happened next was definitely not what i had expected frm a Confort cabby.<br><br>Firstly, he wound down his window, right down to the bottom without even bothering to inform my fren and myself of the reason. I had thought that perhaps there was a foul smell or something, thinking he would wind it back up. However, that did not happen in the next few minutes. This made the whole vehicle smell of exhaust smoke from the other cars, we were in the midst of the city, moving towards the expressway, which we were definitely not travelling alone!<br><br>After about approximately 5 minutes, i started coughing again. This time, he wound down both front windows, right to the bottom again, before he told us that he had to wind down, as preventive measures. I understood his difficulties, however, he should have respected us by informing us BEFORE he wound down the windows! I was speechless by his actions.<br><br>For another 10 minutes or so, i had to put up with all the exhuast smoke, the high pitch noise of all the motorcycles and cars are making, as well as my hair slapping on my face, until i asked him to wind up the windows halfway coz the wind was making my hair messy as he was driving very fast, as if to bring me to my destination asap. But the next few comments from him were definitely unacceptable. He raised his voice at us and told us that if he knew that i was having a cough, he would not have allowed us to board his vehicle. Does this mean that all those who are coughing are not entitled to ride in his taxi? Do we all have to walk home even from East to West if we were to hail his taxi again? Are WE then entitled to reject taking his cab?<br><br>I remember a cabby telling me that they are not allowed to reject customers. Then, isn't Mr Loke going against the rights that the taxi companies have given us, the commuters? Aren't cabbies supposed to be customer oriented? If so, pls send Mr Loke to some courses on Customer Relations, coz he IS definitely lacking in those skills.<br><br>This has definitely affected the good impression i've got for Comfort taxis. Being a frequent cab passenger, i've encountered all sorts of cabbies. BUT, he has spoiled the good image of the frontlines of ur company! This incident did happen to me, and no doubt, it will happen to OTHER coughing passengers of Mr Loke.<br><br>I hope that the Company will do something to improve on the cabbies' attitude towards the COUGHING passengers. It doesn't matter sending them to CR courses or getting all of them masks, as a compensation to what i've gone through this evening.<br><br>As this is a serious situation coz of all the hoo hahs on SARS, i WISH to be acknowledged upon receiving this email, giving me some updates on what will be done to improve on the service you promised. I do not wish to bring this matter up to the higher level or even to the LTA.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>P/s: He was coughing too.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>XXX"<br></div>
