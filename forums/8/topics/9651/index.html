U can see the interior frm the entrance already. She'll definately like it. Huge oil paintings frm the floor all the way up to the ceiling. I couldn't take my eyes off frm the paintings when I first saw them. The price is slighty cheaper than compass rose. $200 should be enough. Go check it out!!  :p :p :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ermmm...tango, Just a few questions first, 1) What is your idea of romantic?<br><br>2) Isn't $150-$300 for 2 person abit too much? I meant it is just dinner right? Does that $150-$300 includes the flowers, tips, and violin player?<br><br>3) Dun you think that your women would feel that you are buying her or something?<br><br>Ok personally, I dun mind paying that much, but spending like that makes me feel like I am entertaining my clients or something, nothing special. If I were you, I would be the chef for the night and whip up my own feast. Have it in your house, give some dough to you family members and ask them to go for a movie or something, and tell them not to come back before midnight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Use dim lights, some aromatheraphy,(but make sure she is not allergic to it) Some nice table cloth, a nice bouquet of flowers, some nice music, Jazz would be nice, and no I dun mean acid Jazz. Also have a bit of nice decor around the dining room.<br><br>Know her taste, western, italian, exotic, fusion, chinese...e.t.c. (yes, it does not have to be old bland routine western all the time.) Whatever, just take a bit of trouble to find out before you go to the supermart to buy stuff. And if you are cooking the dish (or even cooking for the first time), try out the dish first, at least she would not be your geniue pig.<br><br>If you have a balcony, or garden, clear it up too, so that after dinner, you 2 can have some red wine while enjoying the night breeze. Or you can have some Chardonnay if you prefer white, but please no beer please, hell no! No hard liquor too, you want to be romantic not business like. If you have a jigsaw puzzle or something, take it out, and do it together, something that you 2 can do together, not you talk about yourself, and then she talk about herself. That is boring. But she better enjoy what you have in plan with her. (oh yes, the jazz continues to play in the background.)<br><br>After all that when she is ready to leave(or maybe stay for the night.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">, that would be another story all together.), sent her back saftly, and end it all with a nice sweet kiss.

Isn't that palce a bit noisy? *shrugs* I dun know it is a personal preference thing.<br><br>Ruthie:<br><br>BBoss at istana park is getting crowded nowadays, and the ambience it lacking now that they have change the mangement. The only ambience they have comes from the damn fountain, not from the resturant itself. I used to go there alot, but now I think it is becoming so cliche to bring gals there, I prefer to bring them where they have never go before. I tihnk you are into the openair feeling of the place right? Well, go to Cuppage centre, there are quite a few outdoor italian, french cusine placethere, and yes, my favourite is Istanbul, the turkish resturant, but it does not have such nice ambience although the food is fantastic.<br><br>Delphis:<br><br>I dun know about the prime rib place yet. Maybe I will check it out or something. Hmmm...why not I make our first date there? Then you can guide me. Hey I am not trying to buaya you or anything ok?
