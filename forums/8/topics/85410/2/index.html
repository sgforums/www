            <div class='col-md body'>Think going to be a long post so hope you do not mind.<br><br>I got to know this girl from a friend a few months ago. I started smsing her and everything seemed to go on well. We were flirting with eachother when we sms eachother. Soon, I was talking to her quite regularly on the phone. However before I could call her house, I would have to sms her first. I was happy that everything was going on well. I felt that she had feelings for me.<br><br>Things started to crop up during the holidays when I asked her whether she wanted to be with me, she rejected me but wanted me to keep in contact with her. I was disappointed but promised her that I would still keep in contact with her. She began asking me for help in her studies and we soon forgot about the thing that she had rejected me. I had hope that I might win her heart. Things went back to normal.<br><br>When school reopened, whenever I saw her in school, I would go up to her to talk to her. I did not knew she did not like me to talk to her in school. Her friends will make fun of her and ask her questions about me and she did not like that. She ignored me for a few days. These happened a few days ago.<br><br>Yesterday, I really wanted to explain things to her. I called her house and her sister told me she was sleeping, knowing she was not, I got her sister to get her to the phone and talk it out with her. We compromised with eachother that I would not go up to her and talk to her in school, I would jus say hi or nod to acknowledge her presence. And within this period of time until the exams which is a few months away, she said that she only wanted to talk about school work. We promised eachother that if we had difficulties in our studies we would ask eachother for help. I also said that I would call her on her birthday.<br><br>After our exams, she said that I could sms her or call her and talk on the phone whenever I want as long as she is not working. Do not know if she meant what she said but I trust her. I asked whether I could ask her out after the exams, she told me she would think about it but no promises. Thats all. I feel like giving her up, u know!! Wonder if my sincerity will win her heart??</div>

I remember I was in sec 2 (during holidays) and I really liked a girl then.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, you should not worry too much about it. You have expressed how you feel to her, so it's up to her. Maybe you could talk lesser with her, cause some girls might find you irritating if you call her too often.<br><br>Anyway, girls are even harder to understand than rocket science and their thoughts evolve at the rate of 12987389 per second, so you will never know what they think. In short, don't bother trying to figure out.<br><br>Just live like you have never met her before and enjoy life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>You don't have lots of teenage years to live.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously speaking, you are quite naggy for a guy. This's just my guess, so forgive me if I'm wrong. I mean since you keep posting whether you stand a chance, when apparently no one really wants to answer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, some girls don't happen to like sincerity, the more you push them aside, the more they might like you. Again, it's very subjective, but as they said 'nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu ai'. I have seen this to be very true for teenage girls and becoming gradually false as women grow older and become smarter to go for guys with the $$$.<br><br>You should not wonder about your chances of being with her at this moment, since she has just sort of rejected you. Maybe, you should take this time and hang out more with your friends and cease contact with the girl for a week or 2. If she doesn't even call you once, you will know she doesn't have a liking for you. Of course, even then, you can still try, but you will be regarded as an irritating pest.<br><br>Ultimately, she might decide to be with you, but is the trade-off worth it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Super2004:</div><div class="quote_body">Think going to be a long post so hope you do not mind.<br><br>I got to know this girl from a friend a few months ago. I started smsing her and everything seemed to go on well. We were flirting with eachother when we sms eachother. Soon, I was talking to her quite regularly on the phone. However before I could call her house, I would have to sms her first. I was happy that everything was going on well. I felt that she had feelings for me.<br><br>Things started to crop up during the holidays when I asked her whether she wanted to be with me, she rejected me but wanted me to keep in contact with her. I was disappointed but promised her that I would still keep in contact with her. She began asking me for help in her studies and we soon forgot about the thing that she had rejected me. I had hope that I might win her heart. Things went back to normal.<br><br>When school reopened, whenever I saw her in school, I would go up to her to talk to her. I did not knew she did not like me to talk to her in school. Her friends will make fun of her and ask her questions about me and she did not like that. She ignored me for a few days. These happened a few days ago.<br><br>Yesterday, I really wanted to explain things to her. I called her house and her sister told me she was sleeping, knowing she was not, I got her sister to get her to the phone and talk it out with her. We compromised with eachother that I would not go up to her and talk to her in school, I would jus say hi or nod to acknowledge her presence. And within this period of time until the exams which is a few months away, she said that she only wanted to talk about school work. We promised eachother that if we had difficulties in our studies we would ask eachother for help. I also said that I would call her on her birthday.<br><br>After our exams, she said that I could sms her or call her and talk on the phone whenever I want as long as she is not working. Do not know if she meant what she said but I trust her. I asked whether I could ask her out after the exams, she told me she would think about it but no promises. Thats all. I feel like giving her up, u know!! Wonder if my sincerity will win her heart??</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> remember u said she shy right? to kickstart a relationship u really need to be veri patience. go on with the school work coachin u are doin 4 her, talk to her over the phone and if u hav a chance go on a private (just the 2 of u) outin or date with her. wen at school see her wif her frens, try not to be to brazen. talk to her only wen she is alone in school, giv her some space and air to breathe wen she is wif her frens.<br><br>u 2 must still be veri young...no need to commit so early right........be her close fren and maybe 1 day this shy gal may pick up the courage and let u in coz you have given her the trust she needed all this time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on your long long story, what I can see or should i say most of us can see is she is treating you as a very very nice friend.. Have you heard of the saying where sometimes its better to be friends than to get attached?? Sometimes you think that you can click with a gal, does not mean that both of you are meant to be forever..<br><br>To bang the hard facts into you, what I can forsee is that both of you may not be together, not now but also in the future. Why? If she is really really interested in you or even have the slightest feeling for you as in a bgf thingy, she will not ask you to "keep the distance" when she see you in sch etc..<br><br>Like the others had said.. Both of you are still young and there are many opportunities.. Open up your circle and maybe you can find someone you really love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
