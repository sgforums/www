            <div class='col-md body'>I've personally bought 3 systems from Fortrex Industry at Sim Lim Square without any problems. I don't think they're the absolute cheapest but if I remember correctly, their prices were comparable to other places and at least the service was adequate (not super super shiok, but hey this is Sim Lim Sq!!)<br><br>But then the last time I did business with them was in 1998 April. (Incidentally damm heart-ache now man. My $3000-4000 system then costs like $1500 or something now!!!) Oh yeah if it's anyway to judge quality, I typically dont switch off my PC, just leave it on stand-by and it's been running fine since I bought it.<br><br>Also, check out this site: <a href="http://www.hardwarezone.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hardwarezone.com</a><br><br>It's a very good site for news on what's happening on the local PC scene. Reviews etc. Sim lim Square price list too. There's a msg forum too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It would help Anna if you could specify your requirements. After all, you have to determine what you need before you do the sourcing.<br><br>If the PC is just for word-processing, projects and surfing the Net, Pentuim 2s are fine, with 32M RAM, a decent 3D video card, sound card, 4 GB or so of hard disk space and a 56k bps modem.<br><br>If it's for some serious gaming, use a Pentium 2 or 3 ( 3 is still a bit high ), with 128M RAM, Voodoo 3 ( or any high-end video card), the latest Sound Blaster ( don't know the name), and 6 to 8 GB of hard disk space.<br><br>If you want to add more 'cool' but not really necessary stuff, get an ergonomic keyboard, infra-red mouse, Altec-Lansing speakers, joysticks like the Sidewinder...whatever.<br><br>DIYs are ok, but they don't come with software. Off-the-shelf brands are simply more convenient, plus they provide technical support.<br><br>Mine's a DIY with the following:<br><br>Pentium Pro<br>64M RAM<br>2 x 2.1 GB Quantam Fireball Hard Drives<br>Voodoo 1<br>Sound Blaster 64<br>22.8k pbs modem<br><br>Nothing outstanding. Just that it was the fastest 3 years ago! Oh, and if you can get hold of an old stereo or hi-fi set, use it as speakers. My speakers is a Sony Stereo which is 10 years old, with only one cassette deck functioning!</div>

The PIII 500E is overclockable to abt 666Mhz(5x133). If you want to spend more get the 550E, o/c to 732(5.5x133) .<br>2. The Diamond TNT2 Ultra is overclockable to 160/200Mhz, that will put it's power to just below a GeForce256 SDR, and has AGP4x<br>3. 64Mb RAM, it's PC-133 because of the CPU. RAM still too expensive for my tastes.<br>4. MAG Monitor, love it after seeing it at my friend's place, his was 17' though.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>5. Xitel Storm sound card, it had digital output even before Creative decided to include it with their SBLive family. Uses A3D and doesn't have Creative's irritating menu bar. I prefer it in my opinion, feel free to change to a SBLive if you want.<br>6. The motherboard is expensive cause it's new, can't be helped.<br>7. For 3pt speaker set, I feel Altec is the best, unless you want to plug it to your hi-fi.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>8. The Quantum Fireball KA has the fastest seek time at 8.5ms. 9.1Gb is acutally quite sufficient, however if you need more storage for mp3s or games, I suggest getting an additional harddisk rather than a larger one.<br>9. Other parts include fan, casing, mouse, keyboard, 1.44Mb floppy drive, CD-Rom.<br><br>If you can't find someone with experience to get the parts and assemble for you. I think Dell is a good alternative. If I'm not wrong they allow you to customize your PC and the total cost is only slightly higher than at Sim Lim, abt $100-$150 more. Furthermore, DELL has customer support etc.<br><br>The key to a DIY PC is to get parts that will suit your needs and be able to upgrade to increase it's lifespan, not the best in the market. That's because technology gets better VERY quickly.<br><br>Someone out there with a better setup please feel free to correct me.<br><br>Just my two cents worth.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Auspex (edited 14 January 2000).]</div>
