            <div class='col-md body'>Have not come to this forum for a while..busy gathering my frens in SG ever since I come back..sorry..din not have time for even forumite outing but I realise that even as we are in our very own 'home' and country. I do see some ppl spending lotsa time in the forum and IRC....and it makes me tick..do all of us have real frens...who are there for us when we are down and to be there when we need a fren?<br><br>Is it only thru this medium that we find the so called attention and frens? Are they real to feed our ego and satisfy our seek for attention?<br><br>In Canada, trying to live in isolation really sucked cos I dun really have a fren whom I can rely on. So life in Singapore is really good. Saw some forumites and was glad to talk to some of them.<br><br>I do hope that all the forumites here are having a good time knowing each other but at the same time, do remmember the real life frens u all had or u have none?<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.</div>

Coz even if the person treats you as a friend and you do not, will you go to the person when you are down? Of coz you will go the person whom you treat as a friend.<br><br>People choose friends, so there's no actual way of whether you can find the right one to care for you in the way you want to.<br><br>Attention can be seeked not only through friends but family and else. By coming online, you may not necessary seek attention. Net friends can become real friends or not will depends on whether you want to or not.<br><br>Some people are already friends before they start communicating online. The net in my opinion can only be seen as a communication tool.<br><br>We are having a good time knowing each other and I guess the enjoyment is seeing the POVs flying around here to enrich their minds, broaden their horizons, get advice and having just that bit of fun.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Countdown...<br><br>[This message has been edited by lexelle (edited 01 June 2000).]</div>

I got three of them when i'm in 'A' level, got one when i'm in Uni...I always find that good friends can only be found in school time cos friends known through working society are hard to stay long if u're no benefit to them..so i really treasure the friendship i have with four of them...</div>

How's everything going so far?<br>With regards to the topic, I believe I am blessed with lots of good friends, and good ol buddies who never fail to brighten up my days when I am down and give me that small boost when I'm in need of help. And I am indeed glad that as I move along in this journey of life, more meaningful friendships are being forged.

            <div class='col-md body'>Real Friends? Sorry but I don't really believe in this thing.<br><br>How do you define as real friend? Someone who will help you chio girls when you like someone but don't dare to express. Or someone who is willing to spend his last 20 cents in his bank to let you take a bus back home?<br><br>To me a real friend can only be considered as a REALLY true friend when he/she will not think of themselves to help you when you are in need. Think..do you think you have such a friend now?<br><br>A real friend can only emerge in the times of crisis and not during normal days. If you think now you have a few real friends, good for you. But always remember to have reservations over them till they really show you that they are the rare breed in this cold world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmmm.....What is the meaning of a real friend?!<br><br>To me, the definition of a real friend is someone that is there for you, through thick and thin, when you are up and down.  Someone there to listen to your problems, Someone there to give you an unbiased advice.  It doesn't matter how you meet that friend or how to communicate with them.  The important thing is that they understand you and is true to you.<br><br>Why should it matter how you meet the person?! Whether you guys are chatting on the phone, in person, or on the net?! The bottom line is you need emotional support.  You need someone to understand you and be there for you.<br><br>Maybe our definition of "real friends" are different.  Mine are in the sense of emotionally, whereas your's in in the sense of physically.  For me, even if that person are there with me face-to-face, I can't consider them as a real friend unless I get to know the person, they just can't become a real friend to me cuz they are there physically.<br><br>Yes, being too involve on the net might cause some people to shut out their friends in real life, but that does not apply to everyone.  I do admit that I spend a lot of time on the net in the forum on IRC, etc.  But I never did shut out of friends in real life.  I go clubing and have dinner w/ them at times.  I still chat on the phone with them, they still look for me when they have problems.  I am sure lots of ppl out here are just like me  =D  It doesn't just happen in the net.  Lots of people tend to shut out their close friend because they are attached.  So, I guess Net is not the only reason how a person can get isolated from their real life friends.<br><br>I understand that you feel a bit frustrated at times cuz you can't find true friends in Canada.  Part of friendship is just to give the person the benifit of the doubt.  Why wonder if you can trust them or rely on them?!  Just do it and if they disappoint you then change your views on them.  You have to give them a chance before you can get to know the real person inside....<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh man....!Frens? I have a lot..but it is just that sometimes I thought to myself..what is a real fren to me? A fren in need is a fren indeed...I mean I do have have good online frens but how many are there when I need a shoulder to cry on and be there for me physically...and it all takes a min to send a message...<br><br>Giving the priority, real life frens and online frens whom I have never met...who would u choose?<br>What is true and what is not...?Can we see thru what is behind the screeen? Sadly I can't...it is different when u meet the person in real life and in the net. I do know that there are lotsa net politics even in the IRC and forum. Lotsa gossips and rumours around which seemed so worldly even though we have not met.<br>Sorry to those whom wants to meet me but really I am so occupied for the moment, but there will be one outing before I leave end of the month... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Snafu<br>My frens in Canada are what I call acquaintances...To me a cool frenship have to stand thru time and also be there when the person needs me and vice versa. Facade are what we see and not the real person we have seen...is that real? oh well..maybe it is just me.</div>
