              Besides in the 60s racial riots in Singapore, during the British rule...this incidence took place.
                  
              Feb 15, 1915:
              Mutiny breaks out among Indian soldiers in Singapore
                  
              In Singapore on this day in 1915, Indian soldiers launch the first large-scale mutiny of World War I.
                  
              Some 800 soldiers in the Indian army's 5th Light Infantry Brigade broke out of their barracks on the afternoon of February 15 and killed several British officers before moving on to other areas of the city. By the time the revolt was quashed, several days later, by British, French and Russian troops, the mutineers had killed 39 Europeansâ€”both soldiers and civilians. British soldiers executed 37 of the mutiny's ringleaders by gunfire.
                  
              The Singapore Mutiny was intended by its organizers to be part of a general uprising being engineered by Sikh militants in neighboring India against British colonial rule. The Sikhsâ€”whose religion combined elements of Hinduism and Islamâ€”had earned favorable treatment from the British after their refusal to take part in an earlier mutiny in India in 1857, but some still chafed against the constraints of the empire. The Indian rebellion in 1915 enjoyed encouragement from the Germans, whose ship, the Bayern, had recently been intercepted by the Italians with a cargo of 500,000 revolvers, 100,000 rifles and 200,000 cases of ammunition intended to aid the militants. The rebels in India were betrayed in March 1915 by a police spy, and the leaders were arrested before they could signal the start of the revolt. Eighteen were hanged.
                  
              Despite such insurrections, many Indians from across the country continued to volunteer to serve the British empire in World War I. The first Indian Victoria Cross for bravery had been awarded on the Western Front in January 1915. Mahatma Gandhi, champion of passive resistance and leader of the struggle for Indian home rule, played an active role in the recruitment of Indian soldiers during World War I, writing later that If we would improve our status through the help and cooperation of the British, it was our duty to win their help by standing by them in their hour of need.

              1915 Singapore Mutiny
                  
              The 1915 Singapore Mutiny, also known as the 1915 Sepoy Mutiny, or Mutiny of the 5th Native Light Infantry was a mutiny involving up to half of 850 sepoys (Indian soldiers) against the British in Singapore during the First World War, linked with the 1915 Ghadar Conspiracy. The mutiny, on 15 February 1915, lasted nearly seven days and resulted in the deaths of 47 British soldiers and local civilians, before it was finally quelled by British forces and Allied naval detachments.

              Thats what my Indian national workers told me. If they can't afford to buy expensive alcohol then they will buy the todi. Todi is the common brand for Indian cheap alcoholic drink too among local Singaporean and Malaysian Indian alcoholic drinkers. If they can't afford to buy other brand alcohol they just buy that todi for alternative. Anyway, most low wage foreign workers like the Thais and Chinese too will share the cost of their alcohol drinks and drink together too under the void decks or in the parks.

              Many years ago, my late mother had a food stall at rowell road and I went to her shop often too to help her with the business there too. I've seen foreign and local indians drinking todis in that coffee shop. For them todi is cheaper and faster to get drunk rather than beers.

These auxiliary police officers are seen often patrolling the little india areas for peace keeping. They are not trained to handle riots or gang fights. Hmm...the Indian gangster group Sara Jambo is the main gangster group in that little india.</div>
