              I read the debate between you and sgdiehard. For non-Malaysians/Malaysians manual labour workers in Singapore, they have no issues with their salaries. They are happy working in Singapore because they are here to make money. They will only be frustrated and angry when they are cheated or mistreated by their employers in Singapore. I've worked with Indian, Bangladeshi, Myanmar and Chinese nationals before...they are happy with their salaries....unless they are cheated by the employers. As for Malaysian workers in Singapore, they are fortunate or at the advantage position over other migrant workers in Singapore because they can simply take public transports or private vehicles to return to JB/Malaysia on a daily basis whereby the cost of living there is cheaper. Unlike other non-Malaysian manual workers, they have to live in Singapore after working hours and of course their expenditures in Singapore is higher than the Malaysia workers. Hope this helps you to see better.

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>By AMELIA TAN</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DORMITORY operators are planning a slew of activities from movie screenings to flea markets and even short trips across the Causeway to keep foreign workers occupied on upcoming weekends and public holidays.</p>
              <p>   With limits on weekend alcohol sales in Little India, and the 50 per cent cut in the private bus services that usually ferry some 22,000 workers there every Sunday, dorm operators believe fewer workers will head to Serangoon Road on their days off.</p>
              <p>   The measures, announced by the Government on Wednesday, will last for up to six months, until a Committee of Inquiry looking into the Dec 8 riot at Little India makes its recommendations.</p>
              <p>   Dorm operators The Straits Times spoke to said they are drawing up a calendar of social events for workers, which will include day trips to Malaysia during the Chinese New Year holidays and monthly Sunday outings to attractions such as Gardens by the Bay.</p>
              <p>   However, their most pressing goal is to ensure that the workers can relax and run errands at their dorms instead of having to go to Serangoon Road.</p>
              <p>   Westlife chief operating officer Kevin Teo, who runs three dorms housing 18,000 men in all, said his staff are planning a karaoke event for workers this weekend.</p>
              <p>   Westlife will also allow them to use the astroturf courts at two of its dorms for cricket. Nets will be placed around the courts by early next year so that cricket balls do not fly out of the compound.</p>
              <p>   "When they play cricket, other workers will come and watch too. I think we will be able to attract a large crowd," said Mr Teo.</p>
              <p>   Singapore Contractors Association Limited will screen Hollywood and Bollywood blockbusters this weekend at its six dorms, which house some 20,000 workers. It will also hold badminton, football and other matches.</p>
              <p>   Mini Environment Service (MES), which runs three dorms for 25,000 workers, already runs a weekend flea market where items such as cellphone accessories and men's clothing are sold. But it plans to bring in more vendors with a wider range of goods such as toys and clothes for women, which workers can send as gifts to their families back home.</p>
              <p>   "We want to make things more convenient for the workers. They are tired after work and need to rest," explained business development manager Yusof Lateef.</p>
              <p>   MES also runs beer gardens at its dorms so that workers need not go outside to drink.</p>
              <p>   Indian national V.Deva, a shipyard employee who lives in a dorm at Tuas, said workers would gain from having more amenities where they stay. "I'm tired after work but I still have to go to Little India or Boon Lay to send money home," said the 37-year-old, who has worked here for four years. "It is better if I can do this from the dorm."</p>
              <p>   Shipping foreman Weslin Raj, who came here from India 10 years ago, said dorms can persuade workers to stay in by providing free WiFi in the rooms. "We can surf the Internet and chat with our family members back home," said the 35-year-old, who also lives in a Tuas dorm.</p>
              <p>   Yestersday, officers from the Rochor Neighbourhood Police Centre started distributing leaflets to inform shopkeepers of the alcohol restrictions, which apply on weekends, public holidays and their eve. The rules include limiting liquor sales by retailers to between 6am and 8pm. There is a complete ban on drinking in public.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong>Police action against the Dec 8 Little India rioters were not limited to those who threw rocks and attacked police officers and medical personnel.</strong></p>
              <p>Around 200 others, whose involvement that night was described by police as "passive and incidental", will be given police advisories to remind them to behave themselves.</p>
              <p>   Commissioner of Police Ng Joo Hee explained that this group was physically present at the location of the riot.</p>
              <p>   He said: "I want to make clear that this third group will neither be further detained nor repatriated. They will be allowed to stay on in Singapore and to continue with their employment, but they must not come to adverse notice again."</p>
              <p>   On Sunday, this group will be issued with formal police advisories at the Police Cantonment Complex.</p>
              <p>   They will have to be accompanied by their employers from more than 150 companies in the marine trade and construction industry.</p>
              <p>   Why an advisory and not a warning?</p>
              <p>   Mr Ng said: "Police advisories are given out to persons who have not committed an offence as a reminder to tell them to comply with the law in Singapore."</p>
              <p>   He said besides those charged in court, 57 others who were involved in the rioting were repatriated. (See report on right.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0070c0; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">WHAT ARE POLICE WARNING AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ARE ISSUED?</span></span></p>
              <p>A warning is of a higher degree of severity than an advisory, and is given in lieu of prosection.</p>
              <p>   Anyone, even Singaporean, can be given a police warning. But in the case of foreign workers, getting a police warning means they will have to be repatriated to their home countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0070c0; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">WHY ARE THOSE REPATRIATED NOT GIVEN A TRIAL OR CHARGED?</span></span></p>
              <p>If the evidence was good enough to charge them in court, the police would have done so. The question of whether there should be a trial to moot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0070c0; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">WHY WOULD A PERSON INVESTIGATED FOR A CRIMINAL OFFENCE NOT BE CHARGED IN COURT?</span></span></p>
              <p>They are not prosecuted because of a variety of reasons. It could be due to an age factor, or the mental state of each individual for example. Sometimes, the prosecution might decide not to proceed because the evidence is not clear cut.</p>
