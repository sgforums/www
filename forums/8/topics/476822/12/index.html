              <p>always easy to write on the hindsight. When your car got into an
              accident involving injury, you don't move the bus. What the crowd
              could have done was to lift the bus up and pull the injured away,
              there are 400 of them, sure can lift the bus.</p>

              I reckon they would have done just that if the fella was still alive. Someone outside the bus probably had knocked very hard on the left side of that bus to signal the bus driver to stop moving.

              Something to learn about the past riots in Singapore..
              
              Maria Hertogh riots
              
              The Maria Hertogh riots, began on 11 December 1950 in Singapore after a court decided that a child who had been raised by Muslims should be returned to her biological Catholic parents. A protest by outraged Muslims escalated into a riot when images were published showing 13-year-old Maria Hertogh (or Bertha Hertogh) kneeling before a statue of the Virgin Mary. Riots in Singapore lasted till noon on 13 December 1950. In total 18 people were killed and 173 injured. Many properties were also damaged.
              
              Hertogh (also known as Nadrah) had been in the care of Aminah binte Mohamed before being returned to her biological Dutch Catholic parents.

              Remember N.A.I.R...No Alcohol I Resign. To ban totally that is impossible. Even Islamic Countries have sales for Alcohol. Total ban means no business, no tourists, no night life, no entertainment, no relief for stress etcs. Its not something like drugs you know where is illegal unless in the Holland...drug addicts can go to drug stores to consume drugs for their drug addictive habits under control environment.

              accident.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>According to reports, the riot started after the paramedics were
              there doing their duty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If it was due to the accident, it would have started earlier.

              I think it has to do with the accident and the driver, then the police protocol approach...nothing to do with alcohol abuse which I see is very little to do with this riot unless they were provoked by the police...the Government need to look into this also.

              <p>For the non malaysian workers, the $S3 is an increase of 13 - 15% from unskilled non experience (S$20 - 23) to skilled and experienced earning $23 - 25.</p>
              <p>For these workers if they don't spend their money on alcohol or gambling, they can send money back home every month just earning S$23 a day. a Malaysian workers making S$28 x 24 x 2.5 = RM 1,680 a month, they ride motor every morning as early as 5 am to cross the causeway, how do a thai earning 400 Babt a day raise a family? for you S$3 can't even buy you a meal, so these are just from the low spectrum of the society, no need to argue.</p>
              <p>you need to know them accurately if you want to understand them and help them,  in anyway, there is no fun winning a debate with you just correcting your error.</p>

              <p>We have riots in 60's , I am echoeing the voices of pioneers.</p>
              <p>Banning alcohol - Some said alcohol should be banned in all areas and business drop due to consumption of alcohol, high rental need to be paid .Some public said that to sell softdrink to solve the rental issue</p>
              <p>Some public fear about foreign worker espcially China driver , Our pioneers done a great curbing the riots in 60's .</p>
              <p>xenophobia - People (Public) fear that accident will come again and it is the same thing happen over and over again .</p>
