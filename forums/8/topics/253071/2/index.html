            <div class='col-md body'>1 thing i notice abt tis 2 schools regarding the wearing of ties...the tie discipline seems to have slackened in recent yrs for sajc but for cedar, it seems to have improved...during my era, there were more sajcians who wore their ties properly compared to cedar...nowadays, more cedarians r wearinf their ties properly compared to sajcians...maybe the kor-kors n jie-jies from sajc have to learn from their younger sisters from cedar how to wear their ties properly...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though I'm not from a school that requires students to wear their tie daily, I'm a Student Councillor and can say that after wearing the tie for 3 years, I somehow feel I'm not looking that smart without the tie anymore.
