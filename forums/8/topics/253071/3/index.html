A former saint myself, it is hot when one chooses to study at the balcony on an average day. To wear a tire properly, you would have to button the top button too, do you do that? The photo taken is just a snapshot of the girls in a computer lab. It does not mean they wear their tie in such manner the whole day. Maybe it is just a presentation in which they have to dress properly? Isn't this also practised in SA when pw presentation is done?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Isn't this also practised in SA when pw presentation is done?  </blockquote>let me answer the words in bold 1st...yes i was an sajcian n yes i do button up the top button n pull my tie up...<br><br>infact, if u trace the earlier posts, i did mention tat during my time sajc was much stricter wif uniform...tis was so after a member of the public coomplained abt students looking sloppy outside sch...hence during my time, the students were generally very smart-looking in our uniforms wif almost all of us wearing the tie properly...in fact, most of us kept our ties worn properly for the entire day until we reached hm from sch...sigh, gone r those days of gd uniform discipline...the uniform discipline seemed to drop after tat once the principal left...<br><br>when i say the problem lies wif them, i mean tat its due to the choice of the students whether they wanna wear the tie properly or not...wad i mean is we all face the same weather everyday...however, despite the weather being the same to all...y do we see some wearing the tie properly n some nt??? i am toking abt after school...if the weather was realli unbearably hot, y is it tat some students stil keep the top button fastened n tie pulled up??? its cos they choose to obey sch rules n nt to look sloppy in their uniforms...u tink they dun feel hot??? i for one did back then but i stil keep my tie worn properly cos i CHOSE to obey the rules...so since its the students' choice, doesnt it mean the problem/deciding factor is they themselves???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yesterday at ard 8plus at nite, i ran into a group of sajc councillors...all of them had their ties pulled up wif the top button fastened...of cuz one may argue, well they r councillors mah, they have to wear their ties properly to set a gd example..nw tis is true...but wad i wan to say is y r the councillors the onli one who r doing it? muz every student in sch be made councillors b4 the uniform discipline can improve? the sch is nt made up of juz the councillors...in fact, majority of the students r nt councillors...note tat it was 8plus at nite...so they have been wearing their ties properly for more than 12 hrs! some of the non-councillors cun even last until ard lunch time...<br><br>moreover, councillors also go thru the same weather as the rest of the students...yet they r disciplined enuff to keep their ties worn properly...do they feel hot? i believe they do yet they r stil able to do it...wad does tis show? actually, every student can wear their tie properly...the heat is nt unbearable..yet many dun do it...tis onli shows poor uniform discipline...students r either nt proud to be sajcians or they r plain bo chap...the problem lies in the students themselves n nt any oher external factors like the weather...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>an acquaintance of mine who was an sajcian once said sth like tis: a person who wears his uniform sloppily onli shows how sloppy his character is from within...he nt onli shows disrespect to the uniform he is wearing but also disrespect to himself...<br><br>how true is tis statement...in fact most ppl i noe who adhere to smart uniform wearing would agree closely to wad my acquaintance said above...juz abt 2 mths ago, i was going hm one nite...i was waiting for the bus at a bus stop outside serangoon mrt when i saw tis female sajcian(non-councillor) who was also waiting for the bus...she was sitting down when i walked towards her direction...i noticed tat nt onli was she stil wearing her tie, it was pulled up all the way such tat it the knot covered the top button, which was neatly buttoned up...i looked at my watch n realised it was abt 930pm...i was like man, how many of such ppl can we find nowadays??? students who choose to obey sch rules, r proud of their uniforms n wil nt choose to break sch rules for the sake of their own comfort???<br><br>at tat time, memories began to flood back into my mind...memories of the time when i was in sajc...when almost all of the students adhered to gd n proper uniform discipline...looking at tis gal juz reminded me of those times when my sch frends n i went out in groups after sch...we would go shopping, go for meals tgr...yet hardly any of us took our uniform for granted...u would have seen groups of sajcians roaming the streets wif their shirts/blouses tucked in n ties worn properly...in fact, many of us liked wearing our uniform cos we felt very smart in it...in fact during those days, the onli way u could tell if someone was a councillor was by the councillor's tag on the shirt/blouse cos almost all of us, both councillors n non-councillors wore our ties properly...tis is so unlike nowadays when councillors r so easily recognisable...cos nowadays, u onli have to look at how the person wears his/her tie n u can guess if he/she is a councillor...sigh...it seems like those gd old days of gd uniform discipline r over...realli dunno if those days wil ever return... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this post is specially to commend 3 students who have set gd examples for their schools...<br><br>during tis past wk, i had the honour to witness 3 female students from cedar n sajc doing wad their schools shld feel proud of...juz last wk at ard 9plus at nite on one of the days, i spotted a female councillor from sajc at j8 wif her frends...she was in uniform while her frends were in casual attire...wad was heartening was tat even though it had been a long day for her, she stil kept her uniform looking prim n proper, nt to mention her tie...it was worn neatly n she looked sharp n smart...although one may argue tat tis is nt surprising cos she is a councillor, i stil commend her cos nt all councillors keep their uniforms so prim n proper thru out the day...tis is evident from my earlier post abt a councillor i saw who had her tie worn sloppily after sch while wearing her councillor's tag...<br><br>then juz today, i was on my way hm from serangoon..i walked thru the mrt station control n spotted 2 cedarians who were in uniform...it was ard 930pm...wad was commendable was tat they kept their uniforms prin n properly worn n they had their ties worn neatly...even more commendable is tat they r both nt prefects...i was like man, they sure put to shame those councillors or prefects who have been guilty of nt wearing their ties properly after sch...i noe of students who has the mindset tat theres no need to keep the uniform prin n proper once they r outside sch...there r even prefects/councillors who tink like tat...yet i always applaud the few who r like the ones above...they r different n do not practise double standards which is to look prim n proper in sch then look sloppy once outside sch...<br><br>so THUMBS UP to the above 3 gals n those who r like them...u have indeed made a difference in our society... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
