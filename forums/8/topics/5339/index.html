I am interrogating, I am cross-examining, I am prying and probing for the meaning of a student's paper. The student is a college senior whith a straight-A average, an extremely bright student who has just been awarded a coveted fellowship for postgraduate study. He and I have been at this for an hour.<br><br>"The choice of exogenous variables in relation to multicolinearity," I hear myself reading from his paper, "is contingent upon the derivations of certain multiple correlation coefficients." I pause to catch my breath. "Now that statement," I address the student - whom I shall call, allegorically, Mr. Bright- "that statement, Mr. Bright - what on earth does it mean?"<br><br>Mr. Bright, brow furrowed, tries mightily. Finally, combining our mental resources, we decode it. We discover what he is trying to say, what he really wants to say, which is: "Supply determines demand."<br><br>By James P.
