            <div class='col-md body'><strong>...Unless MediaCock Restores Terror Footage</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">by Pak Cham Kai with Jane Hencock and Lau Cheow</span><br><br>Terrorists today threatened to behead a Singaporean citizen unless MediaCock rescinds its decision not to show footage of grisly terrorist acts.<br><br><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/behead.gif"><br><br>Earlier this morning, a little-known terrorist group calling itself Al Amak sent a VCD to the various news organizations showing a group of three persons wearing NTUC Fairprice plastic bags as masks, while wielding a pair of scissors over a hostage.<br><br>They are demanding that Gahmen-linked broadcaster MediaCock resume airing grisly terrorist footage over Channel News Asia and all its other news programmes.<br><br>Â“Wah lau,Â” said the lead terrorist. Â“Those images were the only exciting thing on CNA! Now kena watch nonsense about schoolchewren getting tablet PCs lah, MPs opening buildings lah, what next? Cooking show? Game show?Â”<br><br>Â“Anyway,Â” said another terrorist. Â“The terrorist clips arenÂ’t half as stomach churning as the average MediaCock sitcom!Â”<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s why!Â” growled the third terrorist. Â“MediaCock says they doÂ’wan to show the footage because it encourages such acts of terrorism. So by doing this, we will make them damn LPPL!Â”<br><br>Al Amak are demanding that MediaCock resume broadcasting by 12 midnight, 9th August 2004, failing which the citizen, Mr. Poh Tong Tau of Bukit Gorblok Avenue 5, will be beheaded.<br><br>The heartrending video shows Mr. Poh whimpering, Â“Wah lau, tolong-tolong, spare my head, leh! I just spent $200 on a haircut at Toni and GuyÂ’s! Dun waste, lah!Â”<br><br>Mr. Poh goes on to plead with his captors to Â“chopÂ” his genitalia instead, saying, Â“Singaporeans dun use them anyway, mah!Â”<br><br>When contacted, MediaCockÂ’s immediate response to the terroristsÂ’ demand was, Â“Your head, lah!Â”<br><br>Mr. PohÂ’s family has pleaded with the Gahmen to intervene in the crisis, but a spokesman from the Prime MinisterÂ’s Orifice says the Gahmen is sticking to its guns over not negotiating with terrorists.<br><br>Â“ItÂ’s very tough, of course,Â” said PMO spokesman Mr. Gerry Mandhir. Â“You canÂ’t help but be moved by Mr. PohÂ’s predicament. But we are resolute. The terrorists should be under no illusion that we will cave in to their demands. Look how we have stood steadfast for so many years over the issue of Ministerial pay. By comparison, terrorist threats are chicken feed.Â”<br><br>(Mr. Mandhir refused to comment when our reporter pointed out that next to Ministerial pay, everything is chicken feed.)<br><br>Little is known about Al Amak, the group holding Mr. Poh, but according to Internal Security Department spokesman Mr. Khong Kong Chit, Â“We do not believe they are tied to any subversive Muslim organizations. But the game of cat and mouse they are playing strongly suggests an affiliation with Aksi Mat Yoyo, who are known for making their participants dress up in feline costumes.Â”<br><br>Despite the Gahmen and MediaCockÂ’s stand, the public is taking a strong interest in the plight of Mr. Poh, who was apparently abducted after buying 4D at his local outlet.<br><br>Said fellow Bukit Gorblok resident Mr. Chin Kay Poh, in a plea to Mr. PohÂ’s captors, Â“Show some heart, leh! At least tell us what number he bought, because now he kena sai, it sure come out, one!Â”<br><br>At this time, only satirical website TalkingCock.com is publishing the story.<br><br>MediaCock and its affiliate, Toolate newspaper, have refused to air the story in line with their stand on not publicizing acts of terror, as well as their commitment to focusing on the Remaking BG Lee Campaign.<br><br>Meanwhile, the nationÂ’s top newspaper, The StateÂ’s Times, has to check first with the Gahmen whether they can publish the story or not.</div>
