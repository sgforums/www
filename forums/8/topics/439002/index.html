Are there any financial advisors out there who can give me advice as to whether i should start now or after i graduate with a diploma and possibly a degree? Are there any companies that accept new guys to do part time while studying for the licensing exams?</p></div>

              I don't really think it's a good choice, no doubt it maybe able to earn you a good income. however it takes a lot of hard work and luck. 
              
              in short i personally won't wanna be one, as there is too many insurance agents among my friends. probably they have already approached my common friends and i'll be left with a minority.

              Do you believe in the product in the first place ?
              
              There are 2 groups of sales people out there. One who believes in the product and the other whose driven by targets, commission, etc. Some people do have a flair for sales. They're extroverted, out-going, tenacious, etc. If you fall into this category, by all means, go ahead - insurance, property, medical sales - sky's your limit.
              
              If you don't, then ask yourself if you believe in insurance in the first place. If you believe in the product and think its necessary, then that will be your drive - helping people.

              <p>hi dream big,</p>
              <p>are you very sure this is what you want? when i said 'are u sure' i meant are you 100% chop chop kalipok sure. If yes then forget about studying and go right into the line.</p>
              <p>why i say that, because 3 years in a poly is a super long time and the amount of field experience you will lose is just too much. getting into poly won't help you in this line at all (sales) unless youre taking finance diplomas and maybe for the cause of networking. so if youre 100% sure this is what you want go for it. google some career seminars with some of the big boys out there (AIA, Great Eastern, Prudential) then see if you like it.</p>
              <p>I m in this line as well so if you want i can lend you my notes, they are pretty updated.</p>
              <p>and no, MAS is very strict when it comes to agent's compliance. no license no selling. but you can do some active prospecting while you studying for the exams. what i suggest is get signed up with one of the big boys, get your license, do part time insurance n see if u like it.</p>
              <p>this is a reply to angel7073, you re quite wrong. insurance companies have seen one of the highest increase in new premiums acquired in the 1st quarter of 2011 so no prospect is pretty wrong. and cpf only insured you with medishield which only covers so damn little(check up their site). i heard cases whereby your bill can 4 to 5k and you can't claim any amount. so health insurance is definitely the first thing.</p>
              <p>just my 2 cents</p>

              <p>Unless you are confident of converting your circle of friends and family and acquaintances into your insurance clients........and that you can make a living out of it.....otherwise dont.</p>
              <p>Also it is not so easy because if you work in sales in long term, to be successful you need sales skills, such as approaching, closing, etc.....and these are not easily picked up skills but need time........so you will be struggling at first.</p>
              <p>You just have to ask yourself, are you good in communicating and persuading people, or are you the shy type.........if you dont have the skill-set, it is better to find another line of work......</p>
