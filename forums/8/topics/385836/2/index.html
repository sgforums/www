              <p>if we ask most women...they would still want a stronger man in
              terms of everything (that would be ideal) and yet be gentleman and
              softer on the other.</p>
              <p>It is as if women are drafting the rules of how to be a man
              women wants (ironically, the media is so supportive..keep telling
              what men should do here and there)... tell you what....you would
              end up a new product called gay...a balance of hard and soft...some
              women want it more soft, some wants it hard according to women's
              whims...it is worse enough for women to be a confused lot....don't
              confuse us with your expectations...And after all it has been done
              for these bitches....they can tell you:"You are not yourself...come
              on..Be yourself!"</p>
              <p>These are times MEN WITHOUT WOMEN (to borrow Hemingway's great
              title) - BE YOURSELF...FCUKPAP...FCUKWOMENANDSAYGOODBYE...</p>
              <p>Men's Charter needs no great tome as an initial kickstart...it
              is very simple...just add behind to every clause in women charter
              "To be reviewed and considered in line with the male gender 's
              agreement" and "To pass if and only if mutual agreement is reached
              for the aforesaid clause" - if women want equality...let's have a
              taste of it by not agreeing or to agree only after due
              consideration has been made and deliberated along with men as well.
              Isn't that strict and fair?</p>
              <p>This would drive home a message....EQUALITY IS NOT SPOON FED BUT
              TO BE FOUGHT EQUALLY AND ALONG WITH MEN'S AGREEMENT.</p>
              <p>FCUKPAP: Whenever there is a white horse (minister's son)
              entering a new batch of army, new utensils will be changed and food
              is better (with siew mai and no more rubber band bee hoons)...if he
              complains about a tree keep shedding leaves and he has got to do
              area cleaning...the next day the tree will be obeyed to die...go

The women he played deserve it becos of the greed. Its a u willing I willing thing (ni qing wo yuan). People argue he should stay loyal to his wife, oh pls...i bet 100% the wife married him becos he is tiger woods and he is a money tree. who do U think u r to expect a man with so much money and power to be tied by u?</p>

              <p>Let's face it - it's a feminist country that has ruined men's image here. The system's policies are deliberately intended to suppress men's normal development into one that has given way to the rise of women here. </p>
              <p>This would seriously affect the socio-psychological development of men, which is vital to our country's economy. It is overprotecting women and has given too much leeway just to get the headcount necessary to sustain its policy of supporting women's movement. </p>
              <p>If women believes that this country is blessing them...yes it is ...and they can keep pretending to think that the majority of us are happy (of course you can't please ALL - but there are the majority which is being neglected - only women are given the most attention and legal help.</p>
              <p>The rise of singles (which gives rise to aged population and men's fear of commitment as we are much more disadvantaged upon divorce), homosexual issue, old folks, etc. - why was the coverage and help is so negligible for other areas? The "failed-or-pretended-not-to-see-the-point-for-fear-of-women's charter-social programs" is such a waste of time as compared to the strongly supported women's movement here? The system is overheading into the wrong direction which has helped to breed (knowingly or unknowingly) barbaric behaviours of so-called new generation of women in AWARE?</p>
              <p>How much more does the system or women here wants men to give way further? </p>

              <p>Instead of harping on men and setting up harsh laws demanding us to keep giving way to powder gals (who turned out barbaric feminists) and to serve for the well known mandatory army-servile regime, isn't it about time to make mandatory demands on women to return to society what they have benefited from us? </p>
              <p>Yes - MANDATORY, not up to moods, spare cash or free time or after watching a touching movie....MAKE WOMEN SERVE THE SOCIETY FOR A GOOD 2 YEARS JUST LIKE HOW MEN WERE MADE TO SERVE AND DIE FOR OUR COUNTRY!

              <p>Though parents play a significant part in upbringing the children, but it is the system that plays a major part in steering us in the right and balanced social direction. A system that is off balance or extreme in certain biases in certain policies (i.e. social development) would leave the people in distressed state. On the whole it's stable, but i simply cannot agree on the policies on divorce against men - this is one policy that had increased the no. of singles and breeds greater fear of commitment in men. There is nothing in store for us men but to pay and suffer the lost of children upon divorce most of the time.</p>
              <p>Why are most judges for divorces women? So much has men here given way out of sympathy for women. Now, why not have a civil education for today's young gals in school on the role of ASIAN women to support men's rightful position as the family head rather than building on western concept of freedom? Why keep harping only on men to change? Where are we men heading to? Isn't it about time we establish our very own Asian social system than feeding on French Fries? </p>
              <p>Look at China. The difference between communist regime and open economy has changed billions of Chinese lives - they could never have imagined thousands of millionaires sprouting every now and then if they were still trapped under communism - queuing up for a ticket to get a meal. System does play a significant role and impact on our lives and destinies. </p>
              <p>Likewise, the system here is and must be partly responsible for our social development - taking great care not to side women too much just because there is women's charter. Don't just push it all to parents upbringing (though they are also responsible). Be the first country to establish our charter as well - this is one area the Singapore system wouldn't dare to tread, despite boasting in all areas.</p>
              <p>FCUKPAP - It's about time to CHANGE. The system must be involved - don't say it's only our fault and not yours. </p>

              <p>We have seen historians over applauding Empress Wu's contributions to the pride of rising women. With that they are condoning the concept that one could do anything so long as you achieve the necessary objectives at the expense of lives - to be exact, at the expense of her only baby daughter's life (being strangled to death by the then concubine Wu herself to oust the existing Empress). Historians argued that the times are different from now, and she is doing that necessary for the so-called objective of the "big situation".</p>
              <p>That means Osama or the Japanese or any tyrannies of Hitler, Mussolini etc. are also right when mass murder or terrorism is showered on innocent lives so long as they are doing so to what they think it's right for their "big situation". Shouldn't they be applauded? If we condone such a concept as what historians credited to the vicious Wu, then i would encourage men to be doubly vicious i.e. to sell the wife or gain prominence through using women to achieve so called the "big situation".</p>
              <p>Who knows out of this, we have a new leader arise so long as he could uplift the nation. who cares what cunning or vicious methods he use? I am sure the govt would care less so long as everyone gets a pie as promised. </p>
              <p>Money isn't everything? So when men leave their partner because of money - he should not be blamed - because women use that same excuse to find better life or the often quipped "security". Men, do the same and even doubly more to justify yourself.   </p>
              <p>FCUKPAP - look at what you have done or condone through your stupid one-sided policies in favour of women. Sure you wouldn't care less so long your ministerial sons are protected, our sons will carry the loads or threats due to your stupid policies. Men, pay back double or ten times more on women so long as it deems fit to your "big situation".</p>

              <p>It was women who claimed about love is more important than money and it is also women who claimed that money is more important. Both are important. Which is right? Don't even bother - it's EVERYTHING!</p>
              <p>If any guy is perplexed over such issue - NEVER! The only option is still career. It is the simplest way out and most rewarding at least. We have come to the social stage where materialism matters (thanks to consumerism) - money indeed affords the ambience, buys time and people on your side when u r in need. Chasing women? Whatever for? Chasing sex is ok but not the person (i mean the "hidden monetarist mentality of women" - for all you know, you are being judged according to your name card, memberships and of course the type of 4 wheels. </p>
              <p>Fake illusions of life? Yes it is. women are the catalyst in the process of our modern materialism that forces us to disrespect them in return. The ironic twist is that they are helped by the legal process. </p>
              <p>FCUKPAP - Your stupid male discriminative policies really ruined the image of Sg Men. Thanks to you and the hordes of softies in parliament...Lion City? come on..... </p>

              <p>what is molestation? how do you define it? do you know that being rubbed by a woman in a jammed packed area i.e. MRT or even in full house disco or pubs could also be suspected or charged as molestation just because there are some "eyewitness" (could be the close friend or someone who has seen only partially) and if the lie detector fails? how proven is the detector? </p>
              <p>all we know is that the "benefit of doubt" is given to women when you are brought before interrogation? there could be some quarrels with the woman or "unpleasant" feeling against the man which could assist the woman to charge a man for molestation? There was no clarification as to how the police or judicial system works on this issue?  one thing for sure is that the man (if innocent) would have to undergo inhumane treatment and lots of inconveniences and mental pressure - there was no equal treatment as compared to women. </p>
              <p>a distant friend of mine was recently discharged as innocent when he was being suspected of raping a bitch in his own house - finally it was found out that the bitch was in cohort with another guy to get his property. But the mental torture for 2 years was irrevocable. </p>
              <p>we will have to take the lop sided law into our hands. in equal measure, we do not need to show any respect for women - go on and make life difficult for them. we have no protection at all. </p>
              <p>FCUKPAP - the rise of singles (including divorcees + gays + lesbians) is all time high. u r worried about aged population? why? u know the problem but u have no guts to solve it. any one can run a country with a high salary by simply suppressing men to uphold equality - in a company, we often see people looking for scapegoats. if it is that simple, just push it to men to hold the responsibility. we will punish your daughters - FCUKPAP!   </p>

              <p>there are mainly  2 main types of modern women - licensed and "unlicensed" prostitutes. Sure there are still good women around but they r really the rare minority.</p>
              <p>Unlicensed pros are those who traded themselves to gain security - in most cases, financial security and freedom. They either drive you nuts or strip you financially bare - their desires are apparently better met that way.One thing they do feel proud is that they are better known as some kind of "tai tais" - being promoted to higher level of living and sophistry - and all the more class with a "western potato" hubby. They seem to wear even shorter to bare essentials like asparagus stick with mashed up potatoes, than they are with us. Modern love is now defined by them and is restrictively conditional, similar to commercial clauses. Strange enough, they seem to command some kind of insurances from us upon divorce.</p>
              <p>Western potatoes are not that idiot after all - for all these unlicensed pros know - the smarter ones do not own property (even if they could) and their love, just like nice cosmopolitan living in condos (and skinless condoms whatever), is based on rental or rented love. Ironically enough, these unlicensed pros seem to be all the more happy buying fake illusions of sophistry.</p>
              <p>FCUKPAP - look at your daughters on rented love and broken nails which cost $200 with crystals. Microwave is their saviour - they have erased all other utensils from the dictionary of gastronomy.        </p>

              now the govt is perplexed by the issue of lack of new born babies ...trying almost everything but couldn't improve the falling birth rates and urged more babies...
              
              the crux of the problem is what we have known all along..this country is over emphasizing on women's charter and the ever greater pressure on men to commit in marriage without any legal protection..and we are expecting more liabilities on us...
              
              the govt still fails and ignore the ground discontents that men feel it but couldn't help it as the law is over protecting the women....men's fear of commitment has increased ...this comes as no surprise...
              
              the govt tried subsidies of all kinds, promoting on dating, icebreakers, .....all these measures have failed and repeatedly fail with decreasing birth rates....they just dun dare to touch on whats need to be done to improve and lift men's fears of unreasonable and unlimited liabilities of men to serve the country and worse, to get huge fines upon divorce....
              
              Men's liabilities are just too high...the due is overly and fearfully high...its better to be single...it is so clear and yet so stubbornly ignored
              
              FCUKPAP - You dun even want to discuss on the matter...becos u know its difficult and ultra sensitive....easier to suppress men through legal means than finding a better and balanced solution...

              <p>high costs of living is well understood ...but the most basic issue is how to create a conducive environment for marriage ...as of now...we men are being suppressed through legal means...this makes men more cautious... dun blame us ...we have to protect ourselves by our own means when the system wont help....</p>
              <p>women all know the trump card of divorce is in their hands..loss of virginity is no big deal now for a long time...the govt simply ignores the problem...save your time to icebreak...think more fundamentally on how to uplift men's belief in you</p>
