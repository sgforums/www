            <div class='col-md body'>I met up wif an ex-colleague fer lunch yesterday. We saw a cute cute boy sitting by himself next to our table. I kept looking at him all the time. Then when we finshed our meal, i told my colleague dat i wanted to go up to him. She began to suan me say simi 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. U want u go loh.'. I made a face at her and approached him.<br><br>Wah! I saw 2 gameboys on his table. I took one and he quikly took the other and began to play. I tried to make small talk but was ignored by him. I refused to give up &amp; tok sumore. This time, he put down his gameboy and began to munch on his biscuits. Those big &amp; round colourful ones. All those times, me duno y he was looking down. He muz be beri shy. I told him i want some too. Me had specififed dat i wanted the pink colour one. But without looking up, he broke a piece of his yellow biscuit and held it up in his hand. I luffed at him. He quikly withdrew his hand. I asked fer another piece again. He broke another fer me. Me took it, tink i dun like it, gave it back to him. Still wif his head down, he took it back and gobbled it down.<br><br>I began to luff wif my colleague. He so cute &amp; strange. But then since there wasn't any positive reaction from him, we went off after me said byby to him.<br><br>We went to a fruit stall nearby to get some fruits fer someone &amp; my favourite "Uncle, yi li qing ping guo, qie. Xie Xie." and then went on to add 3 spoons of sour plum powder. Hahaha!!! He must have suffered quite a loss from such a regular customer like me.<br><br>After dat, i went back to him. Heng ah! He was abt to go off liao! Me gave him a piece of watermelon, skinned for his convenience. C, me so considerate. He accepted it after some hesitation. AND HE ACTUALLY SMILED TO ME LEH!!! HE SMILED TO ME U KNOW!!! Wah lao!!! Me was so dazzled by his charming smile!!!<br><br>I said byby to him again before turning back. He responsed also leh!!! Waved to me and gave me a wide smile too!!! Wah lao!!! Nearly fainted!!! My first time so excited bidding farewell to someone leh!!!<br><br>We both parted. Tink he was rushing fer time. He was soon in front of me, diagonally, tens of metres away. I didn't know he kept looking back after my colleague told me. I looked to his direction. FARK!!! He was indeed looking at me! And there i was trying to light up a cigarette! I quikly took it out from my mouth. By then he had turned into a corner, out of sight. Shit.<br><br>Me told my colleague i had a tinking dat the watermelon wun end up in his stomach. She asked me y. I told her he wun bear to eat it. She luffed. Toopid idiot.<br><br>Alamak!!! I realised dat i forgot to ask fer his name!!! She tot i did!!! No, i didn't!!! Shit, shit, shit!<br><br>But then at least, me know he's 5 years old. And he wun be there again next Monday.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>------------------<br><strong>if you live to be a hundred,<br>i want to live to be a hundred minus one day,<br>so i'll NEVER have to LIVE WITHOUT YOU.</strong></div>
