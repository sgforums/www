              <p>Solving the low birth rate is quite easy and well within the government's means.</p>
              <p>( Btw, increasing the birth rate means increasing the Singaporean CHINESE birth rate, as the Malays are reproducing quite happily, thank you very much. No studying for them- too busy baby making to study ;)  )</p>
              <p>Basically you give a lot more money.</p>
              <p>The current baby bonus is quite low- $4000 to 6000. Even Australia gives roughly twice as much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is what I propose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the next 3 years, every second baby onwards results in $500,000 being given to the parents, under the following conditions:</p>
              <p>1. Parents are married at least 2 years.</p>
              <p>2. Parents have degrees. (this can be modified to include poly tech diploma holders, but it's the Chinese who need to be encouraged remember?)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now last year, about 3,000 people were eligible under the baby bonus scheme. Usually about 36,000 to 40,000 babies are born each year.</p>
              <p>By offering to make instant  half millionaires of couples, this should triple or quadruple over the 3 years to around 120,000 babies per year.</p>
              <p>Can the Govt afford it?</p>
              <p>Hell yes.</p>
              <p>Say 80,000 of the 120,000 are 2nd or 3rd children (not 1st born)</p>
              <p>80,000 x $500,000 is $40 billion per year.</p>
              <p>Over 3 years is $120 billion.</p>
              <p>Currently Temasek has around $200 to 300 billion.</p>
              <p>Thus for a 3 year investment, they vastly increase the wealth of the Singaporean Chinese, they get huge increases in population in just 3 years- no need to give PR or citizenship to foreigners, and they will even increase the boys available for NS in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Problem solved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does anyone else have any other solutions? :)</p>

              <p>all programmes of subsidies have failed ......we need a balanced gender policy than an ovremphasized women charter to reduce fears of commitment on the part of men as well...financials only solve half the problems</p>
              <p>nothing has been mentioned except most significant developments have only been done to spruce up for women....</p>

              <p>Materialism has affected the Singaporean couple's perception of a "good" life; is it no longer the traditional mindset of starting a family and raising kids. The idea of enjoying life with your spouse or even yourself seems pretty good, particularly if Singaporeans have the ability to take care of themselves in the future; highly plausible if we consider that Singapore has pretty high standards of living.</p>

              <p>Our mps should study how each country help the couples with babies, what incentive they give them.</p>
              <p>For instances, free medical jab, heavily subsidised medical care, free transport for mother and baby. Free school books and uniforms if not heavily subsidised. Take care of babies till they reach U.</p>

              <p>No one has a comment on my idea?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't see why offering $500,000 per 2nd baby onwards is a bad idea. They can do it every 1-2 decades, and they would never have a birth rate problem (although the demographers would have a field day working out how it affects their age graphs)</p>
