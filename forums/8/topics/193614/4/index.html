He is charged with culpable homicide under Sect 304 of the Penal Code. The maximum sentence is 10 years. Remember this law was meant for mentally ill persons who murder someone but have escaped the gallows on the grounds of diminished responsibility. It is reasonable for a mentally ill person to be sentenced to a max of 10 years in that situation. The law did not anticipate the interference of foreign governments.<br><br>His girlfriend was charged for her participation in a murder whereas this fella could only be charged with culpable homicide.
