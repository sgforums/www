In essence, even their foreign talent scheme is nothing but a flop, which, to be fair, is what most people in Singapore(from what I have observed anyway) - though not speaking for myself, truth be told - are peeved with(I mean, who in their right mind would accept playing second-fiddle to inept, incompetent "foreign talents", who are unable to prove they are indeed better than the locals?).

Many other countries force companies to be in charge of your allowance and medicals and housings after you retire. Singapore only got what CPF, some more they are actually your own money.
