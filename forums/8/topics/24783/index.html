Done alot of stupid things after we broke up. been in a few relationships after her. But will break up after a short while because I am unable to forget her. I am still unable to forget her after all these years. no amount of beer or cigarettes will ease the pain and agony.<br><br>I would try out ways and means to find out news about her. But its hard to do so because I had broken off all connections with our friends. I still have her house number, though I am not sure if its changed. I never got to call her because of all the foolish things I had done.<br><br>What will you do?</div>
