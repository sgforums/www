            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ristar:</div><div class="quote_body">SumOne</div></blockquote>Firstly, you have a lot of angst to work with. Chill man, really.<br><br>Secondly, you strike me as stereotypical or prone to sweeping statements at least.<br><br>It's good that you like to think for yourself and you have your strong opinion, but seriously, you are getting it way off here.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>all you are saying is that i misinterpreted. then, u go on to say that u r only human.</strong>[/quote]<br><br>Yes, I'm only human. True ain't it? I'm saying you misintepreted is just simply something even a non-Christian might have been able to tell you.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>u know, many people have said the same thing to me without giving me a satisfactory answer.</blockquote></div></blockquote>So what type of answer are you looking for? It wasn't my idea to have a lng discussion, but you seem to be eager to press me for a specific answer that you want.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>and just because im quite free, even if i misinterpreted, many things could still have been prevented, if not for a Being that created a flawed creation, which He knows before he even created. yet, nothing was done to prevent it. then again, u [b]DONT</strong> have an answer, do u?[/b]</div></blockquote>Ok, if you really want an answer about the misintepretation thing, here's my take. It's a chicken and egg thing, you feel there's a problem with the bible, I feel there's problem with person reading the bible. Coz ultimately, it's about the mindset of the person reading.  If the person has intentions to read it out of context, he will read it out of context. It's like a knife, it can be used as a tool, it can be used to harm others. Just a simple analogy, don't think too much into it.<br><br>Somehow I feel this is still not the answer you want, because you have already decided the answer yourself.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>just because u r unwilling to question, or see things in another POV, doesnt mean im not.</blockquote></div>Again I think you misunderstand or are making wrong assumptions about me again.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>anyway, religion/faith is all fun and games, but when somebody puts it on the forum and tells everyone else to repent, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> it just sux. </strong></div></blockquote>Erm.... since when was I trying to convert you or anyone else for that matter? I was just telling you that's how that part of the scripture wasn't meant to be read like that. Whether you are Christian or not, if you have the mindset to misintepret, then  you just will.<br><br>But to clarify, not once was I trying to convert you or anything. Please don't misunderstand, just pointing out that one simple thing to you.<br><br>I think you're mixing me up with other people you meet.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>last but not least, im a christian. but im one of those who questions everything, unlike the likes of you.</blockquote></div>Again, you make a wrong assumption of me. But whether Christian or not, I think there's no need to go all hostile just because of something like that. And start making personal comments on others. This isn't about religion anymore.....<br><br><strong>[quote]seriously, beat it. </strong>Seriously dude, you have some anger issues.<br><br></div>
