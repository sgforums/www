Sounds like you're getting hostile. Anyway, your assumptions about me are wrong. Also, I think it's quite possible to put your point across without having to resort to insults and personal attacks, don't you think? If that is the manner in which you approach this, I don't think I'd have much to say to you beyond this post.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>when God told Adam to "go forth and multiply", Eve was supposed to be the [b]only</strong> woman. of course, Adam couldnt f--- around even if he wanted to.<br><br>however, the situation now is different. just because the Bible mentioned about marriage doesnt mean that it mentioned "go forth and multiply <span style="font-style: italic;">with your wife</span>".

Something that has previously been done in EH that I don't wish to go on here. I would agree that it's within man's instinct/primal urges to want to sleep around, so to speak. However, it is through cultivation of mind that we resist things like that. But even priests and monks fall prey to such temptations. Of course perhaps to you maybe there is nothing wrong with multiple partners, I'm not here to preach a moral story to you. You choose your own life in that aspect.<br><br>I think also based on the above statement, it suggests that your idea of man before eating the forbidden fruit is the same as after eating the forbidden fruit. To me, there is a difference. But I'm not here to discuss that.<br><br>Ultimately, going back to the phrase about 'go forth and multiply', I just want to clearly state that it's not a 'flaw' but I'm quite sure the scripture was not intended the way you meant it, I would term what you're saying as misintepretation of scripture. Something David Koresh has done before. In fact, he did it pretty often to get what he wanted.<br><br><strong><blockquote>why do many people go clubbing? to listen to music... dance... get to pick up gers... all for wat? eventual sex (BGR), or ONS.</blockquote></strong></div></blockquote><strong>I don't know about you, but I go for music. I'm aware that others go for other things so thanks for informing me but I already know.
