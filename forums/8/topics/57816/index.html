            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hello Talkcockers! This is your favourite journalist Cherry N. George. I am currently doing my Masters Degree in Journalism in the US and have graciously leased my services to Talkingcock.com. Today we are going to talk about the hot topic of why Singaporean women love to go for Ang Mor men. With me I have Ms. Ping Ker Tern and her Caucasian boyfriend, Mr. Al Byno.</strong><br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>.: Ms Ping and Mr. Byno, a warm welcome to this interview with Talkingcock.com. First I'd like to ask Ms Ping, how did the two of you meet?<br><br><strong>Ping Ker Tern</strong>: Well, I actually pre-planned this. I just wore the shortest mini-skirt and a spaghetti strap blouse and went into a pub frequented by Ang Mors. Every Ang Mor that entered the pub I gave a wide seductive smile until one approached me, which was Al Byno!<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>.: Wow that was slick! But as we spoke before the interview, you were already in another relationship. Weren't you being unfaithful to your then Singaporean boyfriend?<br><br><strong>Ms Ping</strong>: You see, as Singaporeans we always want to upgrade ourselves. People aspire for the 5 C's. And I decided to upgrade and told myself that I want 6 C's instead. The 6th 'C' being Caucasian. What's so wrong with wanting something better?<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>.: Weren't you happy with the relationship with your then Singaporean boyfriend?<br><br><strong>Ms Ping</strong>: Oh I was very happy! He was great! But he wasn't white! I mean we are raised from a very young age to glorify the white man through the movies. So we grow up thinking that white is always the best. Look at shows like Baywatch, do you see an Ah Beng lifeguard? No! The Ah Beng life guards that are in the local swimming pools all have pot bellies and wear thick spectacles! Also I would want my kids to have double eyelids, sharp nose and curly hair, and that can only happen if the sperm comes from an Ang Mor.<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>.: I see. So your Singaporean boyfriend treated you well, but you just wanted some Ang Mor meat! But I want to ask a very personal question. Could you tell us, were there double standards in your relationships before and now?<br><br><strong>Ms Ping</strong>: Of course! With my Singaporean boyfriend, I would always dress up conservatively and portray myself as a "decent girl". I only had sex with him after dating for a year. But with Al, I hit the sack with him on the first date. And I always dress up like a slut, exposing as much flesh as I can without getting arrested.<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: What about oral sex?<br><br><strong>Ms. Ping</strong>: Oh, Al and I are very open and talk about sex in a mature manner. Having a frank talk about sex is nothing taboo to us!<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: That's not what I meant. I was referring to the act of fellatio. Was it the same in both cases?<br><br><strong>Ms Ping</strong>: Oh you are referring to that! Well I refused to perform oral sex on my Singaporean boyfriend, I found the act demeaning and disrespectful to women. But with Al, I have no hesitation of getting down on my knees and doing it with devotion. After all, Ang Mors are next to gods! But I am no Monica Lewinsky though, I don't like my dresses stained so I inhale. Even when Al slaps and pinches my butt in public, I just give a submissive giggle - I would NEVER allow my Singaporean boyfriend to touch me anywhere near there in public!!!!!. Once you hook your Ang Mor, you can throw all this Women's Lib nonsense in the garbage bin.<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: Wow! That's amazing! Now I want to ask you, Mr. Al Byno, was it easy to woo Ms. Ping Ker Tern?<br><br><strong>Al Byno</strong>: I was surprised at how fast it happened, in fact I dare say that I made little or no effort at all! And I have a lot of acne and a mole twice the size of Phua Chu Kang's!!! Women in my own country don't bother to give me a second look. But in Singapore, you can be the ugliest Ang Mor, but there will always be an Asian slut waiting on you hand and foot. And the best part is, after a date you can send them home on the MRT!!! If they were dating a Singaporean guy, they will always expect to be sent home in a Taxi, and if you don't, you can forget about asking her out again. But if you are an Ang Mor, you can disrespect her and treat her like dirt, and she will always come back asking for more.<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: And why, Mr. Byno, do you think that Singaporean women like to go for Caucasian men?<br><br><strong>Al Byno</strong>: Well, as what Ms. Ping said, we have Hollywood to thank. I own a debt of gratitude to people like Brad Pitt and Richard Gere. Because whenever Singaporean women look at Ang Mors, they fantasize about these celebrities. So you can be the ugliest Ang Mor on the planet, but in their minds, they think they have Brad Pitt or Richard Gere as their boyfriend!! What suckers!!<br><br><strong>Cherry N</strong>: Wow, what a revelation!!! Well, we have just about run out of time and we have to end this interview. I'd like to thank Ms. Ping Ker Tern and Mr. Al Byno for graciously agreeing to do the interview. I'm Cherry N. George, signing off for Talkingcock.com. And always remember: Never be economical with the truth!<br><br>- contributed by Chin Du Lan</div>
