              <p>We're still on food for this edition, but I'll talk about how to shop for and manage your snacks so that you reap their fullest potentials. Just some preliminary information that is good to know before we start:</p>
              <p><strong>1. Cheapest places to shop<br></strong>Contrary to popular belief, Fairprice really isn't the cheapest place to shop for your snacks. Try Sheng Shiong, heartland supermarkets and dollar stores instead.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Cheapest tactics to shop</strong><br>This is a common-sensical approach, but always look out for promotions at the end of each row at the supermarket. Another common tactic that many people know of but do not practise regularly is to look out for items that are not at eye level. Obviously, items found within a comfortable reach are there because a premium has been paid for to get them placed there.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Cheapest types of snacks</strong><br>In most places, snacks are priced as follows per unit (ascending order):</p>
              <p>1) Fruits (cheap)<br>2) Sweets ($1-$3)<br>3) Crackers, potato chips, nuts ($1-$5)<br>4) Cookies and biscuits ($1 onwards)<br>5) Chocolates ($2 onwards)<br>6) Yoghurt, ice cream, cereal, muesli bars (expensive)</p>
              <p>As you can see, the cheapest snacks to get are 1, 2, 3 and 4. I have always avoided 5 and 6 as much as possible, because the eating pleasure obtained per dollar spent is generally poor. It helps to save money if you don't have a sweet tooth (like me) and love the saltier snacks. However, I still generally go for a good mix of 1, 2, 3 and 4. I would suggest that, even if you have a sweet tooth, you try getting the biscuits/cookies instead of chocolates and dairy products to save a few bucks. An important step in keeping your budget tight is to choose the correct <span style="text-decoration: underline;">categories</span> of snacks that are inexpensive yet still satisfy your snacking needs.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Cheapskate mentality<br></strong>In deciding what to buy, always remember that the cheaper an item is, the better it is. This is an absolute rule. Even if the taste isn't that good, the pleasure from saving tens of cents should more than compensate for the lack of enjoyment in your snacks.</p>
              <p>Now that you some prerequisite knowledge, let us now begin the guide proper. The first thing that you should do when you arrive at a supermarket is to decide on a shopping budget and an expected period of time for the snacks to last. I usually go with $10 for 2 weeks. Whatever it is, make sure that you set a benchmark that you can commit to (something that is not too easy but not too unrealistic).</p>
              <p>After having your objectives in mind, you should be looking for your shopping cart. Please use a basket, not a trolley, if you want to keep your spending minimal. I can isolate three reasons right off my mind:</p>
              <p>(a) You have to carry baskets, thus they will feel heavy at some point. Heaviness gives you the impression that you have picked up too many items.</p>
              <p>(b) Heaviness makes you tired -- more reasons for you to end the shopping trip early.</p>
              <p>(c) Baskets are smaller. You can't overload if there isn't enough space in the first place. They keep you disciplined.</p>
              <p>As you can probably infer, I don't like to shop for very long. A typical shopping trip should last no more than 10 minutes. Longer shopping trips make you spend unnecessarily. Another thing you should refrain from doing is exploring the rows excessively. By the time you set foot in the supermarket, you should already have a clear idea of what you want to buy. You are there merely to execute your plan; all decision-making should have been completed beforehand.</p>
              <p>Once you've arrived at the relevant section (e.g. cookies/biscuits section), start looking at price tags. Look out for the $1-$2 items. My favourites are Chipsmore and Khong Guan raisin biscuits for cookies/biscuits, Mamee Monster for crackers, Fruit Plus for sweets and a bunch of bananas. Note that each of their unit prices is below $2, and I still have a good mix of all four categories that I've identified earlier. They add up nicely to about $10:</p>
              <p>Bananas - $1.20<br>Chipsmore - $1.60<br>Raisin biscuits - $2.00<br>Mamee Monster (2) - $1.50 x 2<br>Fruit Plus (2) - $1.00 x 2</p>
              <p>Total - $9.80</p>
              <p>Except for the Chipsmore, notice that it takes some trouble to eat the snacks. The raisin biscuits are contained within smaller packets, just like the Mamee Monster and Fruit Plus. You have to peel the bananas individually too. The rationale here is to make your snacks more troublesome to eat so that they last longer. You would most likely finish a packet of Ruffles in one session, but you wouldn't finish a ten-pack Mamee Monster in one session. In the latter case, you would have to take out the individual packets, crush the noodle, pour in the seasoning, shake the packet and gingerly pour the noodle bits into your mouth. I'm sure it's enough to discourage you from snacking on it too often.</p>
              <p>One last tip that I found useful is to snack only at strategic times. Snacking right before or after meals is not optimum because you inevitably juxtapose the taste of your snacks with your food. You would therefore derive less pleasure out of your snacks or your food, as opposed to when you juxtapose either with hunger.</p>
              <p>I have applied these tips since a couple of years ago and they've served me well. Try it out and see if they help you to save up to tens of dollars a month!</p>

                                2) Sweets ($1-$3)<br>
                                3) Crackers, potato chips, nuts ($1-$5)<br>
                                4) Cookies and biscuits ($1 onwards)<br>
                                5) Chocolates ($2 onwards)<br>
                                6) Yoghurt, ice cream, cereal, muesli bars (expensive)</p>

                                exploring the rows excessively. By the time you set foot in the
                                supermarket, you should already have a clear idea of what you want
                                to buy. You are there merely to execute your plan; all
                                decision-making should have been completed beforehand.</p>
                                <p>Once you've arrived at the relevant section (e.g.
                                cookies/biscuits section), start looking at price tags. Look out
                                for the $1-$2 items. My favourites are Chipsmore and Khong Guan
                                raisin biscuits for cookies/biscuits, Mamee Monster
                                for crackers, Fruit Plus for sweets and a bunch of bananas.
                                Note that each of their unit prices is below $2, and I still have a
                                good mix of all four categories that I've identified earlier. They
                                add up nicely to about $10:</p>
                                <p>Bananas - $1.20<br>
                                Chipsmore - $1.60<br>
                                Raisin biscuits - $2.00<br>
                                Mamee Monster (2) - $1.50 x 2<br>
                                Fruit Plus (2) - $1.00 x 2</p>
                                <p>Total - $9.80</p>
                                <p>Except for the Chipsmore, notice that it takes some trouble to
                                eat the snacks. The raisin biscuits are contained within
                                smaller packets, just like the Mamee Monster and Fruit
                                Plus. You have to peel the bananas individually too. The rationale
                                here is to make your snacks more troublesome to eat so
                                that they last longer. You would most likely finish a packet of
                                Ruffles in one session, but you wouldn't finish a ten-pack Mamee
                                Monster in one session. In the latter case, you would have to take
                                out the individual packets, crush the noodle, pour in the
                                seasoning, shake the packet and gingerly pour the noodle bits
                                into your mouth. I'm sure it's enough to discourage you from
                                snacking on it too often.</p>
                                <p>One last tip that I found useful is to snack only at strategic
                                times. Snacking right before or after meals is not optimum because
                                you inevitably juxtapose the taste of your snacks with your food.
                                You would therefore derive less pleasure out of your snacks or your
                                food, as opposed to when you juxtapose either with hunger.</p>
                                <p>I have applied these tips since a couple of years ago and
                                they've served me well. Try it out and see if they help you to save
                                up to tens of dollars a month!</p>
