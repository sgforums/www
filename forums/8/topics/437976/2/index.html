              was made 'because of the negative feedback received from
              corporations, friends of the zoo, the public and the media about
              the event, especially over the relevance in relation to
              conservation'.</p>

              <p>Will have to agree with everyone here.</p>
              <p>It may be true that Halloween has nothing to do with conservation. But with no disrespect to Hindus, I'm not sure how they're going to put Deepavali within that framework.</p>
              <p>After all, going to the Night Safari during Halloween in my opinion does count as (I quote the WRS director) 'family bonding and wholesome activities'. Dollars to donuts say that half of those tickets were sold to<em> families who actually want to go for an outing there</em>.</p>
              <p>I don't know what got into the heads of the people who made this sudden decision, really. </p>
              <p>As much as I may write off this whole 'Halloween Horrors' thing as a marketing gimmick, I am the first to admit that it <em>was</em> a really good gimmick, and they're just shooting themselves in the foot with this decision.</p>

              <h1>Wildlife Reserves Singapore apologises to the President</h1>
              <p>Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) CEO Isabella Loh has apologised to 
              President Tony Tan for linking his comments made during a Mid-Autumn 
              Festival celebration to the decision to cancel its popular Halloween 
              event. In the statement, Ms Loh said: 'I would like to re- emphasise 
              that President had nothing to do with Wildlife Reserves Singapore 
              decision to cancel Halloween Horrors. I would like to apologise for 
              bringing in his comments from the Mid Autumn Festival 'Moon Night' 
              celebrations into this issue.'</p>
              <p>'The decision to review and reset the calendar of events was 
              discussed and decided even before Moon Night. The decision to cancel 
              Halloween Horrors is not due to any religious beliefs but in response to
               negative feedback Friends of the Zoo and Corporate Partners,' she 
              added.</p>
              <p>The plug on the award-winning Halloween Horrors event was abruptly 
              pulled last Tuesday, even though 1,000 tickets had been sold. In earlier
               media statements, Ms Loh said that 'WRS agrees with 'the earlier 
              comments made by the President that going forward, WRS parks should have
               more family-bonding and wholesome activities.'</p>
              <p>She was referring to a comment made by Dr 
              Tan during a Mid-Autumn Festival event at the Singapore Zoo last Sunday.
               'Such family bonding, I believe, is very important for Singapore 
              because we need to create informal occasions where families, children 
              can bond with their parents and grandparents. It is the best way of 
              building a sense of unity and comfort within the family,' he said.</p>

              <p>Halloween is a festival with no significance in our society. It is pure western influence. Hence it holds no relevance being in a zoo whatsoever. As much as people wish it wasn't canned, it should be made known that it should not even have existed to begin with.</p>
              <p>I reckon kids here don't have a clue what halloween is all about and why it is celebrated, and to have something like that at a zoo further reinforces that. Zoo, safari, whatever.</p>

              <p>I can understand why this was cancelled.</p>
              <p>firstly, the new chief was from some environmental and conservation thingy. </p>
              <p>secondly, the organisation was drifting away from its mission on educating the public on wildlife conservation.  this is understandable as the previous chief had wanted to the organisation to achieve financial sustainability, instead of getting subsidised by govt funding, and position it to be another SIA. </p>
              <p>I went for a few of their halloween thingy in the first few years and stopped going a couple of years back, cuz I found the activities so-so.  In fact, I have never intended to go this year.  Hence, I didn't bother to know they have already started selling tickets. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the cancellation got nothing to do with TT la.  his comments got so power meh?  hahaha</p>
              <p>I just hope the new management can bring back the soul of the zoo.  I miss the zoo that was under Bernard Harrison, before the fast food people took over.  While the papers claimed that the halloween thingy was the brainchild of the last chief, the open zoo concept and night safari were the brainchild of Harrison. </p>

              <h1>Staff split over decision to cancel event</h1>
              <p>THE sudden cancellation of the Night Safari's Halloween event has not only caused an uproar among members of the public, but has also brought to the fore an apparent divide among the company's employees.</p>
              <p>Sources familiar with Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS), the parent company of the Night Safari, told The Straits Times that some staff were already uncomfortable with the style of new chief executive Isabella Loh, who came on board in July.</p>
              <p>When she decided to can Halloween Horrors last week, just two weeks before its Sept 30 launch, the divide became more obvious as they disagreed not only with the cancellation, but also with how she handled it and comments she made over the past week.</p>
              <p>They said that initially, Ms Loh had wanted to cancel the event only next year. It is unclear why the plug was eventually pulled on this year's event.</p>
              <p>Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said some of the staff tried to get Ms Loh to change her mind.</p>
              <p>They told her it would not make sense to cancel the event as close to $1 million had been spent to organise it. This included the cost of themed food supplies, retail items and decorations.</p>
              <p>They argued that the event - launched in 2006 by then chief executive Fanny Lai, who was replaced by Ms Loh - was a signature event for the park.</p>
              <p>The 2009 instalment also won an award for Most Innovative Marketing Initiative at the Singapore Experience Awards last year.</p>
              <p>Organised by the Singapore Tourism Board, the awards recognise organisations and individuals which have designed memorable experiences for their customers.</p>
              <p>On the involvement of 17 Singapore Polytechnic students who had helped organise the event as part of their final-year project, Ms Loh said on Saturday that she was 'not informed about the contract for grading the... students' work'.</p>
              <p>However, The Straits Times understands that a media release which mentioned the collaboration had been sent out.</p>
              <p>Last Tuesday, WRS said it was cancelling Halloween Horrors, which was to have run on five weekends until Oct 30, although 1,000 tickets had been sold. Tickets had cost between $40 and $56 for adults.</p>
              <p>Ms Loh, 51, said this was 'because of negative feedback from corporations, friends of the zoo, the public and the media, especially over the event's relevance in relation to conservation'.</p>
              <p>She added that, going forward, WRS' three parks - it also runs the Singapore Zoo and Jurong Bird Park - will have more family-centric activities.</p>
              <p>She also said at first that she agreed with comments made by President Tony Tan Keng Yam, when he visited the zoo on Sept 11, that it was important for Singapore to have family bonding activities.</p>
              <p>On Saturday, she apologised to the President for linking his comments to the cancellation of the Halloween event, and stressed that he had nothing to do with the decision.</p>
              <p>She also clarified that the cancellation was not due to religious reasons, although she admitted that she made references to 'devil worship' when members of her team asked her why the event did not fit the family theme.</p>
              <p>She said she had visited the event's Haunted House on Monday and 'got upset' after that as she was 'uncomfortable with the idea because it was too scary'.</p>
              <p>'I explained in an e-mail that that is a lot of money spent on an infrastructure (Haunted House) of devil worship,' she said.</p>
              <p>According to sources, Ms Loh said she had heard that 'zebra heads were chopped off as a scare tactic' as part of Halloween Horrors.</p>
              <p>Employees told her this was definitely not the case.</p>
              <p>WRS is a private company set up in 2000.</p>
              <p>It is chaired by Ms Claire Chiang, a former Nominated Member of Parliament who is also senior vice-president of hospitality chain Banyan Tree Holdings. Efforts to get Ms Chiang's comments on the matter since last Friday have been unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>Besides Ms Chiang and Ms Loh, WRS has five other board directors: Mr Chia Ngiang Hong, Ms Aw Kah Peng, Mr Raymundo Yu, Mr Philip Tan Yuen Fah and Mr Nihal Kaviratne.</p>
              <p>Three of them were contacted, but they declined to comment.</p>
              <p><strong>Internet postings slam decision</strong></p>
              <p>The WRS Facebook account yesterday continued to see postings slamming the decision as well as some calling for a boycott of its parks.</p>
              <p>Some wanted to know how many people had complained about the event.</p>
              <p>Others asked what WRS would be doing to 'repay' the polytechnic students' months of work on the project.</p>
              <p>Yet others felt that if WRS was against the event, it should just allow this year's event to go on, but not have it from next year.</p>
              <p>There were also criticisms of Ms Loh, and a notice from WRS was put up on the site urging users to 'please be civil and refrain from making baseless accusations or personal attacks on anyone'.</p>
              <p>A user, known as Worldtrotter Angel, said he would 'boycott' WRS.</p>
              <p>Another post, by a Katherine Kang, applauded the decision to can the event as she felt Halloween 'has no correlation to the Night Safari theme'. But she acknowledged that there were people who were looking forward to it.</p>
              <p>Said another post, by Glenn Goh: 'I feel that the best decision would be to let the event go ahead as planned, but inform everyone that it would be the final year. Not only would WRS be able to shift their focus, but they could also reinstate their reputation, increase ticket sales, and not let the costs and efforts go to waste.'</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, it is understood that props related to the event have been taken down</p>
