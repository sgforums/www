              <p>I would serious call for the resignation of Ms Loh from the WRS !!!</p>
              <p>1) Poor business sense <br>event as close to $1 million had been spent to organise it  - hello if you want to cancel it should have done it long ago, not with all the effect and dollar spend !!! Deepavali too close to even organise anything or promote it .</p>
              <p>2) bring politics to animals world<br>President Tony Tan - say family bonding  - over eager to lick boots</p>
              <p>3) halloween no  relevance in relation to conservation ? hello then pls someone tell me what does deepavali have any relevance to conservation ! - maybe cook a pot of curry using different animals ???</p>
              <p>4) 'devil worship' 'got upset' "it was too scary'.  - frankly all those based on her own feeling - just because she uncomfortable - she axe the whole thing - she could have try to ask things to be tone down a little. She behave more like the devid &amp;  more scrary  axing things !!!</p>
              <p>5) chopping 'zebra heads were chopped off as a scare tactic' - wow a person at her position , listen to hearsay and action on it ?  I hearsay that she be fired by end of this month - so will please someon axe her based on heresay.</p>
              <p>I am boycotting the WRS !</p>
              <p>Halloween may be a american tradition , face the fact - chirstmas also same , even deepavali !!! even thing is imported . <br><br>Halloween theme actually is a good event - that bring teenagers and other party folks who normally would not even go to a zoo. </p>

              <p>i am using this language because parents like you refuse to take responsibility over your own children, and expect everyone else to be responsible for their upbringing which they have no say over...</p>
              <p>you fail dismally as a parent if you think like that..</p>
              <p>so... if i sell alcohol in my establishment and you bring your idiot child to the place, sees people having a good time over a few drinks, and becomes a raging underaged alcoholic, i am at fault?</p>
              <p>or is the parent at fault...</p>
              <p>which comes back to this: you don't want your child to be "scared" you don't bring your child to the place.. and if you do, knowing full well what is going on, you should not be allowed to breed..</p>

              </span></p><p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">The sudden cancellation of the Night Safari's Halloween event has not only caused an uproar among members of the public, but has also brought to the fore an apparent divide among the company's employees.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">Sources familiar with Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS), the parent company of the Night Safari, told The Straits Times that some staff were already uncomfortable with the style of new chief executive Isabella Loh, who came on board in July.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">When she decided to can Halloween Horrors last week, just two weeks before its Sept 30 launch, the divide became more obvious as they disagreed not only with the cancellation, but also with how she handled it and comments she made over the past week.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">They said that initially, Ms Loh had wanted to cancel the event only next year. It is unclear why the plug was eventually pulled on this year's event.</p>

              <span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 12px;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">I READ with disappointment about the Night Safari's abrupt cancellation of the Halloween Horrors event slated to be held from Sept 30 ('Halloween Horrors event axed'; last Friday).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">The last-minute cancellation reflects an unfathomable lack of strategic planning and business logic. If the Halloween event was not in line with the park's core purpose, the Wildlife Reserves Singapore's (WRS) board of directors should have had the strategic clarity to review the annual event at the start of the financial year itself and decide on whether to continue with it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">To call it off after 90 per cent completion, when the costs for holding this large-scale event had already been incurred, seems illogical as it would yield zero returns on investments and negative publicity for WRS. It is shocking that WRS has made such a costly decision without consulting all the stakeholders.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">One group of stakeholders clearly neglected in the process was the 17 Singapore Polytechnic students who had conceptualised the theme, developed characters and designed costumes as part of their project. As an educator myself, I can only imagine the disappointment of these students who spent months on it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">As an organisation that claims to be big on corporate social responsibility, what kind of message is WRS sending to the youth? Is it telling them that a powerful organisation can make any decision based on its whim and fancy, with little regard for other people who may be affected?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">To date, the reasons given by WRS for wanting to focus on family-bonding activities and negative feedback from shareholders do not justify its action.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">With WRS helming three parks - the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park - there is no lack of family-friendly events and wholesome activities over a period of 12 months. The Halloween Horrors at the Night Safari was just one of the attempts (a commendable one, indeed) to diversify the nature of events and audience base. In fact, it had proven to be highly engaging for young people and families with older children.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;">The more acceptable action would have been to allow this year's Halloween Horrors to proceed and then re-evaluate its plans for next year, so as to minimise the impact on all stakeholders.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong>Bay Wee Wen (Ms)</strong></p>

              <p>East and west means rubbish. Neither east nor west.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;"><em>But the dyke has been breached. And fear receded. The internet gave access to news and views and questions and doubts, not printed in the press. Ex-detainees began to speak out and write about their experiences, and the tortures they underwent. There is an increasing demand for historical facts, for freedom of speech and assembly, and Singaporeans are no longer “dull.” They have begun to question the official version of the history of Singapore’s formative years, and to seek truth from the propagated myths, and question what has been dished out to them through the years.<br><br>Suffice for me to point out one example. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lee Kuan Yew in his memoirs stated that as he was working for the Japanese broadcasting at Cathay Building during the Japanese occupation. Hence, he was able to receive news before other Singaporeans of the impending Allied return to Singapore. He claimed he had discreetly disseminated the information. As such, he was afraid the Japanese authority would punish him for doing so if he were identified. It was a heroic act. He fled to Cameron Highlands to hide till the return of the Allied forces.</span></span></strong><br><br>But after the publication of his memoirs, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mei Ling Chung Harding in her book, Escape from Paradise  stated that Lee Kuan Yew was working for the Japanese Intelligence. We may note that Intelligence is a very different sector from Broadcasting.</span></span></strong><br><br>She was never sued for libel. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you believe her story, then logically Lee Kuan Yew’s flight to Cameron Highlands could not be to evade the Japanese, as claimed. I am sure this puzzle must be in the minds of most of you, and especially those who will be attending the Memorial service at Nilai tomorrow, in honour of those who died fighting against the Japanese aggressors.</span></span></strong></em></span></p>
