            <div class='col-md body'>hmm okie let analyse...<br>Xbox 360 Vs PS3 specs<br><br>1) Do you really think that Sony would have even mentioned the 51-billion-dot-product-operations per second number during the PS3 press conference if Microsoft hadn't boasted that the Xbox 360 could do 9-billion-dot-product-operations per second<br><br>2)  What if we told you that Sony combined the CPU and GPU performance numbers to come up with the 51-billion number while Microsoft only reported its CPU performance number? The Xbox 360 actually has 33.6-billion-dot-product-operations per second if you also include GPU performance.<br><br>3) Processor: Sony has announced that the PlayStation 3 will have a 3.2GHz Cell processor that consists of a PowerPC-based core with seven synergistic processing units. The PS3 spec-sheet says that there's an eighth SPE reserved for redundancy--whatever that means. The Xbox 360, in comparison, has a multicore PowerPC processor that has three dual-threaded cores that can handle six total threads at a time. You might be able to call the Cell's SPEs overgrown math units, but we think Sony's Cell processor wins from a brute power perspective.<br><br>Quoted from:<br>http://hardware.gamespot.com/Story-ST-x-1985-x-x-x?tag=boxcar_all_features_image<br><br>True that Xbox is better than Ps2 in terms of graphics as it is released later. Technology imporvies day by day so it is expected some pple will worship Xbox. But dun forget graphics is not everything..  True Xbox has popular games such as the DOA series. Halo 1,2 and etc but  Ps2 on the other hand PS2 has much more Fantastic games, FF series, Kingdom heart, Gran turismo, NFS series, Armored Core series, ACE Combat series .. etc.. countless.<br><br>Xbox 360 isn't everything coz of Xbox live and stuff.. dun forget PS too have "PS live" but onli in jap if i am not wrong.. if u wanna compare graphics look at the remake of FF7 for PS3.. graphics of the game is reported to be exactly the same as those rendered CGIs for Advent children.. i am a gundam fan and the new gundam game for PS3 is .. heavenly.. maybe i am a little pro towards PS3 but c'mon.. PS3 has to be released so dun hail Xbox 360 as the ultimate console .. for now. And for those Xbox hardcore gamers.. take a look at PS3 games and i will tell u.. u might/ will change ur mind towards Xbox 360 games.. =D BTW i own PS2 and Xbox. xbox graphic rox but too little games..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by targa2:</div><div class="quote_body">Also, if you compare the in-game screenshots from PS3, they are much inferior to X360 in-game screenshots. It's hard for me to explain, but you have to see it for yourself. Those out there who brag about Killzone and gundam having killer graphics, please read up more because so far PS3 has yet publicly released any in-game  screenshots. So far all you have seen are Pre-Rendered videos, which does not represent the console's power at all. Some companies such as Sony Online Entertainment also uses term like "Rendered with In-game assets" to mislead gamers into thinking it is ingame screenshots when it really means that it is pre-rendered.</div></blockquote>True it is shown that it is pre-rendered but take alook at this<br><br>The PlayStation Meeting Gundam demo is the first example of a fully playable PS3 demo (that is, a demo where you actually control a character), even though we ourselves didn't get to play it. Expectedly, the game is a bit early in its development cycle. After entering the game from the title screen, the player, who played using a Dual Shock 2 controller, was able to move his Mobile Suit around and shoot. Towards the end of the demo, an enemy came out and destroyed the player's partner Mobile Suit. The player was then able to blast the enemy, bringing an end to the demo.<br><br>There isn't much life in the game world at this point, and with good reason. The demo doesn't use any physical calculations. Such calculations, which will add effects such as wind and smoke, will make use of the Cell's seven SPU processing units. The game in its current form uses just the main Cell processor (minus the SPUs) and the system's graphics chip.<br><br>Bandai pointed out that developer Beck created the demo from scratch, without the use of middleware. It's unclear if Beck hopes to continue along this fully independent development path, or if some of the powerful PS3 middleware tools will be incorporated in the final rev of the game.<br><br>You can take a look at the early demo for yourself through the two videos that we've uploaded. Once Bandai and Beck have added more life to the world, the PS3 may end up with an impressive take on the Gundam franchise.<br><br>quoted from IGN<br>http://ps3.ign.com/articles/635/635525p1.html<br><br>take a look at the video of the demo and u will see.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
