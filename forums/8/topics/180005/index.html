            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : Singapore has laid to rest one of its founding fathers - the former Deputy Prime Minister and senior statesman, Mr S. Rajaratnam.<br><br>More than 1,000 people from all walks of life attended the state funeral, culminating in a solemn service at the Esplanade.<br><br>They included President S.R. Nathan, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament and foreign dignitaries.<br><br>Mr Rajaratnam died on Wednesday of heart failure. He would have turned 91 on Saturday.<br><br>In his eulogy, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong hailed Mr Rajaratnam as a Singapore hero and a champion for multi-racialism.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew also spoke at the funeral, and gave an emotional tribute to the man who was one of his oldest friends and colleagues.<br><br>Flanked by police outriders, Mr Rajaratnam's funeral procession left Parliament House at about 1.40pm.<br><br>The cortege made its short journey, past the historic City Hall to the Esplanade where the funeral service was held.<br><br>Giving his eulogy at the service, Prime Minister Lee called Mr Rajaratnam an extraordinary leader with the ideals, courage and passion.<br><br>He said Singapore would not be here today if not for men like the late politician who fought and changed history.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee said: "Throughout his years in public life, Raja would continue to think deeply and speak ardently about Singapore - our values, our future and our relevance to the world.<br><br>"He was an idealist and a visionary. He believed profoundly in a multi-racial, multi-religious society. The National Pledge which he drafted has helped to shape the nation's psyche and entrench a core value for SingaÂ­pore.<br><br>"In this age of extremist terrorism and tensions between Islam and the West, multi-racialism and harmony is more vital than ever to our very survival, both as a nation and a civilised society."<br><br>Prime Minister Lee remembered the late statesman fondly - as "Uncle Raja" and said that he had benefited much from his political guidance.<br><br>One of his most vivid memories were of Mr Rajaratnam's impassioned speeches both at home and defending Singapore's interests abroad.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee said: "His speeches not only convinced the mind but stirred the soul. Watching on CNA this last week the snippets of Raja speaking in Parliament and on the stump brought back to me - and I am sure many others - memories of Raja at his prime: the cadences, the gestures, the warmth, the eloquence.<br><br>"He was genuine and considerate; he spoke with conviction and passion, and even when he stuck a stiletto into an opponent - for he knew how to defend himself - it was done so nicely that the victim would smile with him."<br><br>In his eulogy, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew recalled his first meeting with Mr Rajaratnam in April 1952 just as the postman's union was striking.<br><br>He spoke of how they had worked together to form the PAP, and remembered Mr Rajaratnam as a tireless fighter who enjoyed stringing words together to influence the people.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee said: "His strength was as a thinker and a writer, a man of honour, with great moral courage. He had a way with people, enormous charm, integrity and character. He was self-possessed, had a good strong voice, and won the confidence of those who dealt with him.<br><br>"I cannot count the thousands of hours we spent together over the years, discussing our doubts, our fears and our hopes. Whatever the outcome of an issue we had to resolve, whether it ended in an advance or a setback, we got to know better each other's biases and strengths. We learned to complement each other. Most of all we trusted each other. He was the older man, but he had an optimistic streak that was infectious."<br><br>Mr Lee said his most lasting memory was of Mr Rajaratnam's courage and how those around him saw him as a tower of strength<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee said: "His most enduring legacy is our National Pledge. After two communal riots in 1964 and the tensions and suspicions of Separation, we were not at our most optimistic. I felt Raja would have the conviction and optimism to express our aspirations. I got Raja to draft it. He crafted the words, I tightened them. The cabinet adopted them as the National Pledge. It was an act of faith.<br><br>"The experiences we shared in the struggle, confronting problems and crises forged an enduring bond between us.<br><br>"With his passing, Singaporeans have lost a patriot, a man of deep conviction and principle. His contribution was not in bricks and mortar, or concrete and glass, but in ideas, sentiments and spirit. Everyday when the pledge is recited in our schools, our children are reminded to live up to our aspirations as Raja expressed them." - CNA/de<br><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/195019/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/195019/1/.html</a><br><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/obituary/rajaratnam/" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/obituary/rajaratnam/</a></div>
